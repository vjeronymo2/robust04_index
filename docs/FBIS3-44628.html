Chen  Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, and Mayor Li  Qiyan gave important speeches. [passage omitted]    In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: It is not easy to  make the whole municipality's tree coverage rate rech 40  percent. Leaders at all levels and various departments must hold  responsibility to the people, formulate good plans and guarantee  their implementation. Leaders at all levels must enhance their  sense of making the municipality green. In addition to clearing  up the occupied wooded areas and forbidding the people from  occupying greenbelt areas, they should also tap the  tree-planting potential. At present, many units can plant trees  and flowers in their neighborhoods but they fail to do so,  therefore, they have great potential for planting trees.  Starting from each and every street, we should investigate the  tree planting potential of all units along the street and urge  them to plant more trees, to speed up their efforts in tree  planting and to do good things for the people. It is necessary  to resolutely stop the act of damaging trees because this is the  most uncivilized. Strenuous efforts should be made to plant  trees in major areas and along road bridges.    In his speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Enabling the tree  coverage rate to reach 40 percent is one of the important tasks  of realizing the goal of becoming well-off. We should share the  tasks with the lower levels, conduct inspection every year, and  must not settle accounts during the last minute. The key to  realizing the tree- planting target lies in the city proper. It  is difficult to plant trees in the city proper. If we fail to  do a good job in planting trees in the city proper, greenbelt  areas will be encroached upon rather than expanded upon. If the  city proper can guarantee the fulfillment of the greening task,  the suburban and outlying areas will also be able to fulfill  their tasks. All relevant departments should support this.    The meeting also heard briefings given by the municipal  planning commission on the municipality's key construction items  next year.    Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee; Zhang Baokang, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi and Qiang  Wei, members of the standing committee of the municipal party  committee; Li Yongan, secretary of the municipal discipline  inspection commission; Ren Tieying, vice chairman of the  municipal people's congress standing committee; and Feng  Mingwei, vice chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, also attended the  meeting.</p>

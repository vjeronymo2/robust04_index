			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "The Country's Goods </F> Producers Propose Their Own Path for Pulling Out of the Crisis:  At the Same Time, They Are Not Counting on the Government"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Event </H5>   "A national catastrophe is approaching"--this forecast,  despite the bravura reports of the government on the "victorious  procession of the market throughout the country," was made by  the second congress of the Federation of Goods Producers of  Russia (FTR) held last week in Krasnoyarsk. Representatives of  collectives of enterprises, directors (managers), and owners  assembled--all those who are engaged in the sphere of goods  production, regardless of form of ownership and type of economic  activity. Established in 1992 by the Association of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union  of the country, the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises,  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the  Russian Union of Workers Collectives, the FTR today,  undoubtedly, not without the energetic efforts of Yuriy Skokov,  its leader, represents the interests of the federal, republic,  regional, kray, and oblast branches of unions of goods  producers, which united, as the congress showed, by no means for  the sake of selfish opposition as such. Their unification was  prompted by the policy of the present government, expressed in a  reprisal against national industry, which, in the opinion of  congress participants and the leadership, does not at all appear  to be a mandatory and necessary victim for a country that has  taken the path of political and economic reformation. Not  denying the need for economic transformations, the congress of  goods producers evaluated the path of economic reforms in Russia  in its own way. As was obvious from the report of FTR Chairman  Yu. Skokov, there were in fact none. The political reforms  absorbed everything, for which there was a consistent need for  the president, people's deputies, and parliament... Meanwhile,  an analysis of the state of the economy of Russia based on the  results of the year presented to the congress by FTR experts  shows that the drop in domestic production, without which the  preservation and strengthening of Russian statehood is  inconceivable, exceeded the planned level by more than a factor  of two. The FTR chairman cited figures: the national food  basket, consisting of 19 (!) descriptions of goods (for  comparison, it is made up of 300 paragraphs in the United  States), is applicable to only 30 percent of the population of  Russia. The growth in unemployment is indicated by the 2,400  plants in this country that died out this year. Against the  background of general instability of economic life and  administration, there is a continuing flow of a significant part  of our national wealth abroad, and the export of capital from  the country in legal and illegal form amounted to $12-15 billion  this year. An economic and legal environment that is hostile to  native goods production, whose direct result was the disruption  of economic relations and a reduction in the volume of products,  created such conditions that it simply became unprofitable to  work. Thus, in branches that determine the competitiveness of  the Russian economy (electronics, electronic equipment, and  instrumentation) in the last three years the output of products  has dropped by more than 40 percent, which indicates that a  process of the deindustrialization of the country is beginning.    In the meantime, the congress of goods producers of Russia  (not anticipating tangible progress for the better, not only in  the first quarter but also in the first half of 1994, when, in  the opinion of FTR experts, there will continue to be a further  listless decline in production, inflation in costs in connection  with continuous price increases for energy sources and  agricultural raw materials, an increase in transport rates and  wages, mutual indebtedness of enterprises, and the depreciation  of money), is coming out in support of signing agreements with  the government of the Russian Federation and organs of authority  of the components of the Federation concerning a qualitatively  new system of mutual relations that regulates the procedure of  implementing the stages for conducting economic transformations.  In the FTR's opinion, the state should guarantee the native  goods producer the unconditional right to direct participation  in determining the strategy of development of the national  economy and in legislative initiatives on questions of goods  production and expert analysis of all normative acts at the  federal and regional level in this sphere. Arkadiy Volskiy,  chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of  Russia and leader of the Civic Union, remarked in his speech to  the congress that goods producers can credit themselves with the  fact that the government, which until recently demonstratively  had withdrawn from tasks of support of domestic production,  today agrees with the need to regulate the economy of the  country. However, the present state of Russian industry, the FTR  leadership thinks, will not permit restriction to  "consultations" with the government. Correctly relying on the  intellectual and production potential of the regions, and also  emphasizing the cementing role of the "class" of goods producers  in the regional policy of the state, the FTR chairman sees the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), the Agrarian Party,  and the Women of Russia Movement as possible and real allies in  the federal organs of power who could be interested in  supporting domestic goods producers. It is obvious that the  representation of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  of Russia in federal organs of authority by one plant director  can hardly be adequate for an expression of the interests of a  multimillion-strong social group. But the question of the  political formation of a movement of goods producers, as the FTR  leader let it be known, is not yet urgent. Today, Yuriy Skokov  believes, it is far more important to conduct a staged  restructuring of the economy of Russia that is as painless as  possible for the population, and which, in spite of everything,  the FTR leader sees in the future as being among the first in  the world.</p>

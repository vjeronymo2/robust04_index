			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT ALL BEGAN WITH A 'FRIENDLY' LAWSUIT . . . ;  </P> <P> WHODUNIT REVEALS INNER TURMOIL OF A WEALTHY FAMILY  </P> <P> Libby Keck was distraught as she stood in the conservatory of her $42-million,  treasure-filled Bel-Air mansion.  </P> <P> "Look at that!" she shrieked.  </P> <P> "Yes, ma'am," her bodyguard and chauffeur, Roger Paine, replied hesitantly.  </P> <P> Sensing his uncertainty, Keck led him by the hand to a painting and ran his  fingers across its surface.  </P> <P> It was as smooth as glass. Paine knew right away that it was no Impressionistic  oil painting but a high-quality color photograph.  </P> <P> "Well, hell! Somebody has stolen this painting," he concluded.  </P> <P> "I know it! I know it!" said Keck, her hands still shaking. "It's gone!"  </P> <P> On that afternoon in August, 1987, which was later relived by the two in Los  Angeles Superior Court, it hardly seemed likely that Keck had touched off a  scandal that would titillate the world of fine arts from Los Angeles to the  Louvre. The painting's disappearance led to the prosecution of the Keck family  butler on a grand theft charge last year.  </P> <P> But a jury refused to believe the butler did it, and what ensued is a whodunit  that also has raised questions about the veracity of Elizabeth Avery Keck,  matriarch of one of America's leading philanthropic families.  </P> <P> The painting's disappearance also flung open the curtains on the war among the  Kecks, heirs to an immense oil fortune, as they hurled charges and  countercharges of betrayal, theft, family jealousies, illegitimacy and, behind  it all, pure greed.  </P> <P> Court battles in the internecine combat have already cost members of the Keck  family well over $12 million in legal fees.  </P> <P> It all began when Howard and Libby Keck's oldest child, Howard B. Keck Jr., or  "Little Howard," filed a "friendly" lawsuit in 1983 to clarify inheritance  issues.  </P> <P> At stake were hundreds of millions of dollars as well as the world-renowned  collection of priceless French objets d'art that fill La Lanterne, the  11,000-square-foot Stone Canyon mansion that Libby Keck, a lifelong  Francophile, designed and named after a pavilion in the park at Versailles.  </P> <P> But the trust litigation quickly degenerated into no-holds-barred warfare among  the Keck family members that left lawsuits strewn from Los Angeles to Houston.  </P> <P> The acrimony also led to a messy divorce between the Kecks in which "Big  Howard" questioned the paternity of "Little Howard."  </P> <P> Libby Keck said her husband at one point even threatened to "go out and have  more children" and maybe adopt the entire Marlborough School for girls to  dilute the inheritance of the next generation of Kecks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Torn Family to Shreds'  </P> <P> "This thing has really torn our family absolutely to shreds," Libby Keck said  with a sigh of resignation.  </P> <P> "The whole thing's absolutely, absolutely off the wall -- the whole thing.  We're all kind of in a limbo," she added. "The family's all blown apart.  Everybody's just sort of stunned."  </P> <P> Other Keck family members refused to be interviewed. Especially adamant in  refusing to comment was Howard Keck Sr., even though his lawyer was advised  that many of his kin, including his ex-wife, had ugly things to say about him.  Even Libby Keck, who sat for two interviews in her lawyer's office, abruptly  withdrew, terminating all contact.  </P> <P> "Everybody's afraid to talk. Even the little children are afraid," she rued.  </P> <P> Through it all, Libby Keck has remained an active if stoic player in the local  art and museum scene, serving on the boards of the County Museum of Art, the  Museum of Contemporary Art, the Huntington Museum and the Music Center.  </P> <P> Board members say her personal problems have not come up. "We've never  discussed Mrs. Keck's situation. She has been a very satisfactory trustee,"  said Los Angeles attorney Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of the Museum of  Contemporary Art board.  </P> <P> Aside from the art world, sports fans, too, might recognize the Keck name. She  owns Ferdinand, the thoroughbred that won the Kentucky Derby in 1986.  </P> <P> Libby Keck is best known as a world-class collector who has assembled a  museum-quality treasure of French tapestries, paintings and exquisite  furnishings once owned by the likes of Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and  Napoleon.  </P> <P> In happier days, La Lanterne, a walled estate on Bellagio Road, was a regular  stop for curators from Europe's finest museums, many of whom had competed with  Libby Keck for those precious objects.  </P> <P> Howard Keck Sr., 73, sponsored cars that won the Indy 500 in 1953 and 1954. He  retired as chairman of Superior Oil Co. in 1984 after it was purchased by Mobil  for $5.7 billion, a sale triggered by a dispute with his late sister,  Willametta.  </P> <P> The Keck family fortune can be traced to William M. Keck Sr., a one-time candy  and sandwich salesman on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil Firm Is Born  </P> <P> Early this century, he went into the oil business as a roustabout in  Pennsylvania. Eventually, he made his way to California and, as a speculator,  drilled wells on contract for big oil companies, often taking leases as payment  instead of cash.  </P> <P> By 1921, Keck had accumulated enough leases to start his own firm, Superior Oil  Co. Within a decade, it had wells in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Louisiana and  Venezuela.  </P> <P> Keck died in 1964, leaving most of his estate to his three surviving children  through the $640-million William M. Keck Foundation, one of California's  largest private grant-making foundations. He also left five beneficiary trusts  set up at USC, Stanford, Pomona College, Occidental College and the Church of  Our Savior in San Gabriel.  </P> <P> As the family became increasingly mired in litigation, some feared the  hostilities would adversely affect the foundation's charitable giving, which  over the years has totaled tens of millions of dollars to museums, schools,  churches and community programs throughout the country. But those concerns have  been allayed.  </P> <P> In 1985, the foundation put up $70 million to build a state-of-the-art  telescope in Hawaii. And last year, the foundation's grants totaled more than  $34 million. In January, the foundation awarded $5.3 million to KCET Channel 28  to produce a six-part series on astronomy.  </P> <P> The family trusts came into being in 1978 after a 14-year probate over Keck's  estate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sibling Rivalry  </P> <P> His children never got along well, according to some of the Kecks. Initially,  William M. Keck Jr. was installed as Superior's chief executive officer. But  Howard B. Keck Sr., or "Big Howard," eventually wrested control of the company  away from his brother.  </P> <P> "The reasons they didn't get along go back to childhood," explained Libby Keck.  Their father baited the brothers and encouraged the rivalry, she said.  </P> <P> Such intense competition, Libby Keck said, later also poisoned Big Howard's  relationship with his own son, Little Howard. It was as if her husband had  transferred that sibling rivalry from his brother to his son, she said.  </P> <P> "As it happened, our son was born on Bill's birthday," Libby Keck said. Little  Howard even had the same, straight brown hair as Big Howard's brother. "And so  he (Big Howard) was jealous of his son from Day 1."  </P> <P> Willametta Keck, Howard's sister, was also not immune to sibling rivalry. When  they were children, Howard killed her pet ostrich by stuffing an orange down  its throat, according to one well-told family story. Later, Howard sent  Willametta's children to work at a refinery in Alaska -- out of spite, said  Libby Keck.  </P> <P> Willametta was seriously ill in Santa Barbara when Howard dispatched emissaries  who urged her to grant him sole control of the trusts set up by their father.  She refused, calling her brother a "dumb son of a bitch" in the Wall Street  Journal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proxy Fight  </P> <P> Their dispute prompted Willametta, who died shortly afterward, to start a  successful proxy fight against her brother, which triggered the 1984 sale of  Superior to Mobil Corp. for $5.7 billion.  </P> <P> It was after that sale that Little Howard filed his lawsuit to clarify the  complex inheritance issues involving the family trusts.  </P> <P> According to court documents, income from the trusts was to be distributed to  the grandchildren of the patriarch, William Sr. And the trusts themselves were  to terminate with the death of his last surviving child with all assets to be  divided among the living descendants. Big Howard now is the sole surviving  child of William Sr.  </P> <P> But Little Howard's "friendly" lawsuit proved anything but amicable.  </P> <P> In and out of court, Big Howard and Little Howard became increasingly hostile  toward one another. At one point, Libby Keck said, Big Howard vowed to bring  his son "to his knees."  </P> <P> Such enmity hardly surprised her.  </P> <P> Libby Keck said her son always "idolized his father. He killed himself to be  everything his father wanted him to be." But it was never enough. His father  wanted him to become a geologist; instead, he studied economics and finance at  USC and Pepperdine. Later, Big Howard sent his son to northern Canada and then  to Africa -- assignments that scared her son "to death," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just a Prelude'  </P> <P> "He (Big Howard) sent him as far away as he could. He didn't want the threat of  a son or an heir-apparent around," she said. "So we always fought over that.  But I never dreamed for an instant that it would blow up in the end the way it  did. All that was just a prelude."  </P> <P> Big Howard was a fabulous provider, according to Libby Keck, and his children  had "every advantage known to man" -- private airplanes, limousines, ski  vacations, tennis camps, surprise black-tie parties, hunting lodges.  </P> <P> Yet they were all afraid of their father, she said. Big Howard's relationship  with his other children -- two daughters and a stepdaughter -- also were less  than smooth, Libby Keck said.  </P> <P> As the father-son lawsuit progressed, the Keck daughters began taking sides.  One of them, Kerry C. Vaughn, joined Little Howard's lawsuit. But the other  daughter, Erin Anner Lower, and stepdaughter Francesca Elizabeth Drown joined  Big Howard, alleging that Little Howard is not the biological child of Big  Howard -- "based on recently discovered evidence." But according to Sorrell  Trope, Libby Keck's divorce lawyer, that issue has been laid to rest through  genetic analysis.  </P> <P> Married for more than 38 years, the estranged Kecks continue to live --  separately, rarely  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gag Order  </P> <P> Until 1988, little was known about the deepening Keck family misery because  much of the litigation was inaccessible to the public. Throughout the trust  litigation, a Texas judicial gag order prevailed. And even though the  litigation has been settled out of court, most of the documents remain sealed  and its participants have signed a confidentiality agreement.  </P> <P> Similarly, the Kecks' divorce proceedings in Los Angeles Superior Court have  been sealed at their mutual request.  </P> <P> But all that secrecy began to crack in August, 1987, after Libby Keck  instructed Paine, her bodyguard-chauffeur, to summon Los Angeles Police  Department detectives to investigate the disappearance of a painting in La  Lanterne's conservatory.  </P> <P> It turned out that the century-old painting, "I Fria Luften," (In Free Air) a  nude of a mother and child by Swedish master Anders Zorn, had fetched nearly  $500,000 at a Swedish auction that spring.  </P> <P> It is not disputed that the Kecks' then-butler, Roy Donell, had received the  proceeds.  </P> <P> Charged with grand larceny, Donell proclaimed his innocence before a Los  Angeles Superior Court jury, saying he had acted at Libby Keck's behest because  she needed money to pay her lawyers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Black Lies'  </P> <P> Donell said he turned over the proceeds to her, minus his 20% commission, in  installments in white envelopes on her breakfast trays under a napkin. A  second, minor painting was also allegedly stolen by Donell.  </P> <P> Libby Keck took the witness stand and called Donell's assertions "black lies."  </P> <P> But after a monthlong trial last summer, the jury exonerated Donell. In the  meantime, the Kecks were paid off by their insurance company, minus a $50,000  deductible.  </P> <P> It was this criminal trial -- attended by numerous lawyers representing the  conflicting interests of the many Kecks -- that served to part the curtains on  the Kecks' private affairs.  </P> <P> Denouncing Donell's claims, the elegantly dressed Libby Keck told the jury:  "The suggestion that I would conspire with my butler to sell these paintings  for a sum of money which is but a small fraction of one month's income of  myself and my husband is ludicrous."  </P> <P> She said she never had any financial worries, noting that she had sole control  of an $11-million account. "I could have written a check for the whole amount,"  she testified.  </P> <P> A document from the divorce proceedings, produced at Donell's trial, showed  that she also had a monthly allowance of $5,000 for groceries, $3,300 for  dinners, $1,200 for lunches, $10,000 for dinner parties and $25,000 for  clothing and other accessories.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Husband Takes Stand  </P> <P> During final arguments in Donell's criminal trial, Donald Randolph, the  butler's defense attorney, told the jury that it would come down to Libby  Keck's word against his client's. "She says X, and he says Y."  </P> <P> It did not help Libby Keck when her husband took the witness stand and told the  jury that she was not one to be trusted. "I don't think she is a truthful  person," he testified.  </P> <P> After acquitting Donell, jury foreman Joel Nenzell said the jurors did not  necessarily believe Donell was innocent -- only that his story seemed more  believable than Libby Keck's.  </P> <P> Despite his acquittal, Donell is not out of the woods.  </P> <P> Libby Keck has sued him in civil court for theft, slander, invasion of privacy  and infliction of emotional distress, demanding $31 million. The former butler,  who earned $25,000 a year, has been representing himself during the pretrial  machinations.  </P> <P> Libby Keck said she filed the suit to clear her name.  </P> <P> "I want the truth out. I don't want to live with the lies that have been cast  upon me by the bludgeonings of fate," she said. "Until about three years ago, I  lived a charmed existence. But now, oh, what a nightmare."  </P></p>

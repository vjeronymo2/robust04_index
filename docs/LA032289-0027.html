			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLETCHER, WHO HEADED NASA IN DARKEST HOURS, TO QUIT  </P> <P> James C. Fletcher, who returned to the helm of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration during its darkest hours, announced his resignation  Tuesday, effective April 8.  </P> <P> Fletcher, 69, who had served as NASA administrator from April of 1971 to May of  1977, reluctantly accepted the post in 1986 for a second time in the aftermath  of the Challenger explosion, the nation's worst space disaster.  </P> <P> The resignation came as no surprise in that Fletcher had made it clear that he  wanted to retire as soon as President Bush named a replacement.  </P> <P> Sources at NASA said they thought Fletcher went ahead and announced his  decision before the replacement was picked in hopes of accelerating the  process. Many in NASA are extremely anxious over who will head the agency  because the appointment could serve as an indication of how strongly the Bush  Administration will push space exploration.  </P> <P> Selection of a strong leader who would be willing to do battle with Congress in  these days of budgetary limitations would indicate that the Administration  plans to aggressively pursue the many items on the agency's agenda, including  the construction of a permanently manned space station by the end of the next  decade.  </P> <P> In a sense, Fletcher is seen as having been a strong administrator but an  uninspiring leader in the three years of his current term as head of the  embattled agency. He is credited with completing a major overhaul of NASA's top  management structure, getting the authorization and money to build a  replacement for the Challenger and keeping the space station alive.  </P> <P> NASA's deputy administrator, Dale Myers, will serve as acting administrator  until Fletcher's successor is picked.  </P></p>

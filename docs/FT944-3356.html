			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Strong growth challenges NZ governor's inflation contract: Terry Hall on the struggle to keep price rises below 2 per cent Mr Don Brash, governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, is grappling with the challenge of holding inflation below 2 per cent without stifling growth in an economy that is showing one of the strongest recoveries in the developed world. He operates under a statutory contract that puts him in charge of monetary policy under strict inflation parameters. These stipulate that he must not let inflation rise above 2 per cent. Mr Brash's immediate challenge is what to do about the strength of the recovery, with growth in gross domestic product running at 6.1 per cent, arousing fears that the economy could overheat. This would tip it, in his words, 'away from sustained growth to the boom-bust cycle New Zealand has endured in the past'. Outlining his concerns yesterday in the central bank's economic statement, he said that the rise in interest rates by around a percentage point over the past fortnight had been warranted. Mr Brash said this had allowed the bank to lower its estimates of underlying inflation. It now expected underlying inflation to peak at 1.7 per cent early next year, and drop to 1.4 per cent by early 1996. However, he warned that the bank would act at the first sign that underlying inflation might exceed 2 per cent. Mr Brash made clear he was happy that the financial markets had taken the hint in late November that the Reserve Bank would tolerate higher interest rates by pushing market rates higher. Mr Brash's handling of monetary policy is under intense scrutiny. He agrees that his powers have not been tested through a full economic cycle since the passing of the Reserve Bank Act in 1989 which stipulates the terms of his inflation-beating contract. A drawn-out recession in the first few years of the decade helped the bank bring inflation below 2 per cent. However, critics say the Reserve Bank Act's inflationary parameters are too restrictive. As soon as the economy starts to show worthwhile growth, they say, the Reserve Bank is forced to tighten the monetary screws, putting growth at risk. Mr Brash's particular concern is inflationary expectations. The consumer price index is forecast to rise to more than 4 per cent next year. Mr Brash's statement yesterday that he wanted monetary conditions to stay 'firm' gave the green light to mortgage rate rises by around 1.5 points to 11 per cent with similar rises in business borrowing costs. These would be in line with increases in short-term rates. Mr Brash is receiving ample advice on how to do his job. Critics such as Mr Gareth Morgan, a private forecaster, say he should have applied the brakes earlier this year when it was apparent that the economy was performing strongly. However, others say that if he had acted earlier it might have cut off the recovery before it took hold. Mr Brash said yesterday that he would not know if he had been right until next year as lags in the economy made it difficult to judge the impact of any decision. There are ample signs of resurgent inflation. The Reserve Bank's survey last month showed house owners expected inflation of 4.4 per cent next August. There has also been a sharp lift in retail sales, new house approvals, car sales, and private sector credit. Prices of homes, especially in Auckland, have risen strongly, helped by rising numbers of wealthy Asian migrants. The Reserve Bank is concerned at growing skills shortages in the labour force, which could lead to higher wage demands. Other signs of growth include a drop in unemployment to 7.5 per cent from 9.5 per cent in 1993 and 10.3 per cent the two previous years. Adding to the problems faced by the Reserve Bank has been a sharp rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar, up 1.5 cents against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. This has also helped reduce inflationary pressures in an economy heavily dependent on imports.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG ABOUT KIDS  </P> <P> I felt compelled to give you some feedback to your article about the New Kids  on the Block.  </P> <P> I'm the parent of a teen-ager who dearly loves the New Kids.  </P> <P> As a parent, I'm glad to have a group that sings, dances and entertains in a  manner that I don't have to worry about the words of their songs. It is nice to  have such a refreshing young group come to the forefront of the music world.  </P> <P> LEONARD MOEDER  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

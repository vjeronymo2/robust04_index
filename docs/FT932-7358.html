			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Exchange paid Rawlins Pounds 348,500 MR PETER RAWLINS, who resigned in March as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange was paid Pounds 348,500 last year, 28 per cent more than his 1991-2 remuneration of Pounds 272,500, according to a draft of the exchange's 1993 annual report. It says Mr Rawlins's pay included a Pounds 75,000 performance-related bonus 'against the achievement of specific objectives achieved during the year'. In the previous year, Mr Rawlins received a Pounds 60,000 performance-related bonus. Mr Rawlins resigned after the exchange was widely criticised in the City for its abortive attempts to set up a computerised settlement system called Taurus. The project was abandoned on March 11, forcing the exchange to write off Pounds 75m. Mr Rawlins said: 'I had one of the biggest jobs in the City and I received bonuses based on meeting objectives which were set a year ago.' The draft report and accounts, which cover the year to March 31, 1993, has been sent to board members but has not yet been approved by the board. The accounts, due to be published in June, also say Mr Rawlins received payments following his loss of office. The amount is omitted from the draft, though it will be included in the final version. The accounts also say Mr Rawlins was given a Pounds 9,500 car. A member of the board's remuneration committee, which is chaired by Sir Anthony Tennant, the retiring chairman of brewing group Guinness, said: 'Mr Rawlins did a good job at cutting expenses and costs at the exchange . . . We went out of our way not to give him anything more than was necessary.' The exchange refused to make any official comment. Other members of the remuneration committee include Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of brokers Smith New Court and Donald Brydon, chairman of BZW Investment Management, Barclays' fund management business. The accounts will also show that the highest-paid director after Mr Rawlins, who is not specified, received remuneration of between Pounds 215,000 and Pounds 220,000. In the previous year, the highest-paid director after Mr Rawlins received between Pounds 115,000 and Pounds 120,000. Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, received a small fall in remuneration from Pounds 180,600 to Pounds 171,900 last year.</p>

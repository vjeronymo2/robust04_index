			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Lonrho's last day as a constituent of the FT-SE index was not one it will care to remember. The company was abandoned by its joint lead broker, Phillips &amp; Drew, which then aggressively marked down the shares. But perhaps more humiliatingly, its market capitalisation fell to a mere Pounds 430m, or Pounds 100m less than the value put by Libya on Lonrho's Metropole Hotels group when it bought a one-third stake last week. The share price fall aside, Lonrho's banks must be thoroughly unnerved at the speed with which its finances appear to have gone awry. They have advanced it more than Pounds 800m of unsecured loans, of which Pounds 250m is repayable this year or next, and a further Pounds 430m within five years. Granted, Lonrho has favourable covenants which deprive the banks of an excuse for withdrawing existing facilities in the short term. But the group is already seen as a forced seller of assets, which will scarcely help efforts to reduce or roll over its debts. Shareholders are doubtless asking themselves how much their shares would be worth in the event that such efforts prove unsuccessful.</p>

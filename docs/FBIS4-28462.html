			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["IAEA Must Not Pursue Sinister Purpose" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Hans Blix,  director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA], in a report submitted to the United Nations Security  Council on June 2 brought forward again "the necessity" of "a  special inspection" of two military sites of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, alleging that the possibility of the  measurement of fuel rods discharged from the 5 megawatt  experimental atomic power plant in the DPRK was lost.    He also attempted to prove "the reasonableness" of his  demand  for "a special inspection" at the June meeting of the Board of  Governors of the IAEA.    In this regard, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    We, in keeping with our special status, honestly accepted  the  inspection for the continuity of safeguards and even allowed "an  additional inspection" and replaced fuel rods in the presence of  the agency's inspectors. The agency, however, is now urging us  to allow "a special inspection" of two military sites. Lurking  behind this are a mean intention and a grave political plot to  have access to our military sites under the veil of inspection.    The analyst further says:    The feasibility of our method of preserving the technical  possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods has already  been proved on the theoretical and experimental basis. Then,  why are some officials of the IAEA Secretariat arbitrarily  making a political charge against us, persistently ignoring our  method?    Do the "impartiality" and "democracy" loudly advertised by  some officials of the IAEA Secretariat mean that the member  nations should bow to the demand of the agency, with their  sovereignty ruthlessly trampled down? While trying to  politicize our "nuclear issue" and lead it to an inspection of  military sites, they are openly joining the hostile forces in  their moves to stifle our socialist system.    The IAEA Secretariat must no longer play into the hands of  the privileged forces and seek a sinister political purpose but  resume its original mission befitting an unbiased international  organization.</p>

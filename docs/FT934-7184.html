			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Warning to fraudsters FRAUDULENT insurance claims will soon run a greater risk of being detected, as UK insurance companies use computer registers to share information on insurance claims and applicants. Insurers say that fraudulent claims have more than doubled in the past four years. Fraud now costs insurance companies and their honest policyholders Pounds 400m a year. Up to 10 per cent of claims are thought to be bogus. The new system, called Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, or CLUE UK, is based on an American prototype. The first register will cover household buildings and contents insurance and will soon be followed by motor and travel insurance. The registers will have access to three years' information, allowing insurers to check on a new applicant's previous claims history and to cross-check when claims are made to prevent multiple claims for the same loss under different policies. CLUE should make it easier to detect cases such as the Gloucestershire businessman who was burgled three times, and each time claimed under two different policies, making a profit. He was prosecuted, and sentenced to community service as well as paying compensation and costs.</p>

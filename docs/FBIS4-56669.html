			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel </F> Tello and Navy Secretary Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo by reporters  Elena Gallegos and Emilio Lomas; at El Zocalo on 5 May]    [Excerpts] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello and  Navy Secretary Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo have seen "nothing odd"  in the Mexican Government's purchase of riot gear. Tello,  however, admitted that the purchase could be viewed as untimely  "because society is very sensitive about it; it has exaggerated  the issue."    The two officials spoke with reporters briefly at El Zocalo,  following the ceremony to mark the 132d anniversary of the  Battle of Puebla. [passage omitted]    [Gallegos] What do you think about the purchase of riot  gear?    [Ruano] I see nothing wrong with this. It is not unusual.    [Lomas] How much equipment does the Navy purchase annually?    [Ruano] I have no idea. Do you know who can tell you? A  high-ranking officer, like Admiral Perez Elias.    [Gallegos] What do you think of the presence of U.S.  military  personnel at the border?    [Ruano] Which border? Ours or theirs? If it is their  border, it is their territory; should they be in Chihuahua or  Coahuila, it would be wrong.    [Gallegos] Is this a provocation?    [Ruano] No, it is not. Am I provoking you when I am  hammering a nail inside my home? I think not, but anyway...    [Gallegos, interrupting] Are they harassing us?    [Ruano] They have no need to harass us. You know that.  There are many ways to harass.... Well, there is something we  must take into account: By allowing illegal aliens to cross the  border, we are causing trouble for them. Of course I agree with  my fellow countrymen, but they (the Americans) have their own  problems. Therefore, I believe the presence along the border is  not affecting us.    Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said in other countries, like  France -- where he served as ambassador -- it is common to  purchase riot gear. He insisted that society is very touchy  today, and, in turn, people have exaggerated this issue.</p>

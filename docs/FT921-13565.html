			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Rand's Barnbrook mine likely to be closed SATISFACTORY performances during the December quarter by the four operating gold mines in the Rand Mines group were spoilt by the announcement that the fledgling Barbrook mine will almost certainly have to be closed. Barbrook's directors said in a statement yesterday that there was no point in continuing the care-and-maintenance programme which had been in effect since the mine ceased operating at the end of 1990. The mine only came into operation in 1987 and had been expected to have a life of about 50 years. The directors said that, given a lower grade of ore than expected and a higher cost structure, the mine would not be re-opened. Care-and-maintenance was futile in the absence of an offer for the mine or its assets from a third party. Rand Mines, Barbrook's controlling shareholder, has said that, failing any such offer before the end of January, it would have to consider applying for the winding-up of the company. For the Rand Mines gold producers as a whole, net profits fell by nearly 7 per cent to R25m (Dollars 8.9m) after a 44 per cent rise in the tax bill. Operating profits were marginally ahead following a reduction of costs and an improvement in productivity. With an average underground cost of production of R31,596 per kg, compared with the prevailing gold price of about R32,000 per kg, the group's gold operations remain highly marginal. Profits remain dependent on forward selling, which helped secure an average gold price during the quarter of R33,591 per kg. The bulk of profits came from Harmony, the group's largest mine, which produced an after-tax profit of R18.3m, down from R19.9 in the previous quarter. Although Durban Deep managed to lift gold production and reduce costs, a lower gold price and tax payments saw profits drop to R3.5m from R5.1m. Profit at Blyvooruitzicht dropped to R5.1m from R7.6m, while ERPM made a R1.9m loss, a considerable improve-ment over the previous quarter's R5.7m loss. The mine remains heavily burdened by large borrowings, with a R9.3m operating profit wiped out by a R13.4m interest payment.</p>

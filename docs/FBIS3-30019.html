The purpose was to evaluate a drive  to renovate banking inspection, control, and regulations over  the past three years -- 1991-93 -- and to set forth tasks for  1994-95.    Over the past three years, banking inspection, control, and  regulations have been gradually brought into in line with  renovation of the banking sector, ranging from special  inspection and control drives to long-range supervision and  on-the-spot large-scale inspection of credit organizations.  This has contributed positively to restoring order and  discipline in banking operations.    Addressing the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van  Khai commended the sector for its efforts last year to contain  and dispel inflation and gradually increase the value of  Vietnamese currency. The sector's credit operations have  gradually provided good service to various economic components.  Financial settlement work has shown progress, resulting in an  end to the shortage of cash. Many banks have had a surplus.    The deputy prime minister also pointed out major tasks to be  carried out by the sector in 1994, which consist of formulating  measures to stabilize the value of the Vietnamese currency;  stepping up the mobilization of capital among the people and of  foreign capital for economic components; managing foreign  currency more satisfactorily; and reducing negativism and  inconveniences if the banking sector is to meet various capital  demands of the national economy.</p>

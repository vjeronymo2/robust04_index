			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel has begun holding contacts with U.S.  congressmen prior to submitting a request for special U.S.  military aid as compensation for an Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan Heights within the framework of a peace arrangement with  Syria. Israeli Ambassador in Washington Itamar Rabinovich met  with a prominent senator several days ago and presented Israel's  security needs in the context of an agreement with Syria.    Rabinovich explained that Israel would ask for aid in order  to offset any damage to the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces]  deterrence and preclude any surprise Syrian attack. Rabinovich  stressed that since no progress had been made yet in the  negotiations with Syria, these were only initial preparations  and no official request has been formulated so far. [passage  omitted]    Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has briefed the Americans on  Israel's security needs in the event of an arrangement with  Syria and has asked for approximately $5 billion in special aid.  Baraq also specified the new weapons systems Israel will need,  especially in the deterrence field.    During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's last visit, a  U.S.-Israeli working group was established to discuss the  security components of the arrangement with Syria. On the  Israeli side, the group includes the chief of staff; Amb.  Rabinovich; and Major General Dani Yatom, the prime minister's  military secretary, while the U.S. side is made up of the  members of the U.S. peace team, including General Mike Ryan, the  head of the planning department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at  the Pentagon. The working group held another meeting during  Christopher's visit this week.    The presentation of the aid request to the Americans sparked  sharp disagreements in the defense establishment because no  staff work had been conducted and no detailed discussion held on  the components of the procurement list before it was presented  to the U.S. team. The chief of staff claimed that it is  preferable to conclude the details of the defense aid with the  United States at an early stage of the negotiations, in order to  secure a U.S. commitment to assist Israel.    Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri claimed that  an  early agreement on U.S. compensation to Israel, even before an  arrangement with Syria has been achieved, would enable the  Americans to pressure Israel to accede to Syria's demands. He  proposed putting off presenting the list of demands to the  United States until progress is made in the negotiations with  Damascus.    Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, tried to  resolve the differences and announced that the list handed to  the Americans merely reflects initial ideas and thoughts and  that more orderly staff work would be prepared on this matter in  the future. The Defense Ministry director general said during  internal consultations that he will demand that the procurement  list presented to the Americans be amended and include a request  to strengthen the U.S. commitment to Israel's defense against  surface-to-surface missiles.    'Ivri explained that defense against surface-to-surface  missiles will continue to be an important issue even after a  peace arrangement is reached because of the threat posed by  distant countries and the growing use of missiles around the  world. This week, Scud missiles were fired in the war in Yemen.  [passage omitted]</p>

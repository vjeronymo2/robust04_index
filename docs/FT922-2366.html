			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / The Big Lie, Inside Maxwell's Empire: Devil take the hindmost - Maxwell was able to borrow billions because his bankers and advisers overlooked or failed to recognise the signs of risk. Then, as the crisis deepened, all the possible lines of defence failed - regulators, auditors and stockbrokers - and Maxwell began raiding the pension funds TO THE END Robert Maxwell kept up the pretence that he was honest, that his empire was flourishing, and that his critics were malicious or wrong. September 11 1991, seven weeks before his death, was his last ever performance at Maxwell Communication Corporation's annual meeting. Maxwell wore his favourite 'sorcerer's' tie: bright blue, with yellow and red stars, lightning bolts ricocheting across it. In its centre was a large greenish food stain; the three secretaries at his side either had not noticed, or did not dare tell him. 'I hope to stay chairman permanently, but at the age of 68 I can give no assurances,' Maxwell said with a touch of humour. The acknowledgement of his mortality was almost the only true thing he uttered in the following presentation. Behind Maxwell's imperturbable expression, his empire was in crisis and he was already deep into one of the biggest business frauds of the century. Even so, two weeks later, on September 22, he wrote a blistering tirade in the Sunday Mirror saying that he treated pensioners from Mirror Group Newspapers better than other employers would have treated them. In fact, Maxwell siphoned away Pounds 933m - most of it in 1991 - from his two public companies Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) and Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) and from their pension funds. In many ways, Maxwell's fraud was breathtakingly simple. On July 4 1991, for example, four months and one day before his death, the late publisher sat at his desk in his 60-foot long office at Maxwell House and signed over Pounds 75m of his pensioners' money to himself. The contract, drawn up under Maxwell's instructions, was for the sale of shares in Scitex, a high-flying Israeli printing company and one of the most successful investments he made. On one side of the contract was Bishopsgate Investment Management, the private Maxwell company which managed most of the Pounds 700m in the pension funds of the public Maxwell companies on behalf of 30,000 past and present pensioners. BIM owned the Scitex shares. On the other side was Robert Maxwell Group, the company at the heart of Maxwell's secretive business labyrinth, whose ultimate owners lay in the tax-havens of Gibraltar and Liechtenstein. Maxwell signed the contract as chairman of BIM. He then signed it again as chairman of Robert Maxwell Group: the pension funds would hand over their shares in Scitex to Robert Maxwell Group to sell in the stock market on the pension funds' behalf. Robert Maxwell Group would repay the pension funds. That is what was supposed to happen. Robert Maxwell Group duly sold the shares on October 9 at an enormous profit. But, instead of giving the money back to the pension funds as agreed under the contract, Robert Maxwell Group gave the money to its banks to pay off debts. Maxwell's action was not illegal at the time. However, when, on his death, his bankrupt companies could not repay the pension funds, the Scitex loss proved to be the single biggest hole blasted in the pension funds. The Scitex scandal is typical of the Maxwell fraud. It was very fast, and very easy. It is typical in one other respect as well: the pensioners' money eventually found its way to Maxwell's banks, to pay down years of accumulated debt in his labyrinth of private companies. It is clear now that signs of trouble in Maxwell's empire were visible from 1989 onwards. But they were either overlooked by Maxwell's lenders and advisers or their seriousness was not recognised. All the lines of defence failed: Imro, the pension management watchdog; the auditors; merchant bank advisers; stockbrokers. There are two main questions about the fraud: how was Maxwell able to steal more than Pounds 900m in just over nine months and could it have been stopped or detected earlier? Some of the answers are complex - Maxwell set up his empire's tortuous finances to confuse observers and enable him to subvert the rules. But they are also simple. Neil Cooper - of Robson Rhodes, the firm of accountants appointed provisional liquidator to the pension funds - says of the Scitex loss: 'It is difficult to put a more charitable interpretation on it - Maxwell just took the money.' Only a tiny core of Maxwell's executives had responsibilities that straddled both sides of the empire. Robert Maxwell and his sons Kevin and Ian were directors of all four parts of the group - although Kevin gave up his MGN position after its flotation in spring 1991. Beyond that inner circle Michael Stoney and Ron Woods had both public and private Maxwell directorships. Maxwell was able to seize money so quickly because the sweeping powers he had secured as chairman of his companies allowed him to move money between them with little reference to anyone else. His policy of divide and rule concealed what he was doing from many. The fraud sucked Pounds 933m from three parts of the Maxwell empire - the two public companies and the pension funds - to feed the fourth, the 'private side,' as Maxwell called it, which was tottering under years of accumulated losses and debt. This private side was a tangled web of 400 secretive investment companies. It included some of Maxwell's most disastrous gambles: The European newspaper; the New York Daily News, the troubled US newspaper he had rescued in March 1991; Berliner Verlag, his attempt to start a Berlin newspaper; and AGB, the loss-making market research company. Maxwell's death on November 5 exposed the fact that the private side had drained Pounds 448m from the pension funds' total assets of Pounds 676m. It had left behind only those assets that were hard to sell quickly - like a burglar taking the silver but leaving the dining room table. From MCC - Maxwell's largest public company, valued at around Pounds 1bn on the stock market when he died - the private side had taken Pounds 388m cash and assets. From MGN - the second public company, valued at around Pounds 400m - the private companies had taken Pounds 97m cash. Maxwell had amassed enormous powers. He had the right to sign cash out of MCC's bank accounts or sign away its assets on his signature alone, although two signatures were needed for MGN deals. In 1989, crucially, he was allowed to create the mechanism that let him raid the pension funds. First, he pooled the Pounds 700m invested by the separate pension funds of all his companies. Then he created a company, with himself as chairman, to manage most of that pot: Bishopsgate Investment Management. All but one of its directors were also directors of his own private companies, including himself, Kevin and Ian - a situation as far removed from the 'arm's length' model envisaged by regulators for company pension schemes as can be imagined. BIM took control of pension investment policy from the trustees of the individual pension funds who could no longer see what was happening. BIM also took physical control of many of the actual share certificates. With hindsight, the licensing of BIM by Imro in 1989, under the Financial Services Act 1986, was a vital step in allowing Maxwell access to pension money. Although it had never come across a model resembling BIM, Imro still licensed it under its rules for Occupational Pension Schemes, which do not have to submit audited financial accounts for inspection. Imro then visited BIM only once, and did not examine it closely. Two groups had extensive access to the empire as a whole: the larger banks - particularly the UK clearing banks whose loans stretched throughout the empire - and Maxwell's auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. The banks lent the empire more than Pounds 3bn at its peak, in retrospect too great a burden. As their worries mounted they pressed for repayment or greater security and received more than Pounds 1bn in 1991. Most of it was siphoned from pension funds and the public companies. In some cases, the ownership of those assets is now disputed. That claim is likely to be argued out in the courts. What does appear to be the case is that some of the banks did not probe the source of the cash too closely. In their defence the banks can claim they received poor information. Some say they were given out-of-date figures on AGB and The European which hid the size of their losses. It is also clear, however, that some banks dropped their usually rigorous standards in lending to the Maxwell empire. Maxwell raised the private side's loans of some Pounds 1.5bn from 80 different banks. As the loans were often just for a few months, and were usually backed by assets - property and shares - many of the smaller lenders did not bother to assess the state of the whole empire. They were also complacent. One clearing bank director says in retrospect: 'We did not normally have these (low) standards - even for a very well-managed company among the top 200 on the stock market we would normally ask for more information.' The same director explains: 'For 30 years he had done business in this way - it was unsatisfactory but he had always come up with the goods.' At the time of Maxwell's death NatWest was the largest lender to his private companies. It had taken more care than many to notice what was going on, however, and judged - rightly - that the situation was becoming unacceptably risky. Over the preceding two years the bank had halved its total loans to his empire to Pounds 182m - almost all of that to the private side. One executive from NatWest says: 'We said: 'He's a touch overweight and ageing,' Then there was the bewildering speed and variety of the deals and we said maybe the top was spinning a bit too quickly.' Other banks had part of their loans paid off after the flotation of MGN on the stock market. One bank whose loans were partly repaid during 1991 comments in retrospect that the banks' demands for repayment could have had a de-stabilising effect on the group: 'The pressure we were putting on the companies - if you deprive anyone of that amount of cash it's equivalent to decapitalising a business.' Several banks became aware that the creditworthiness of the private side was deteriorating in May after the MGN flotation. Their response was to press for more assets - property and shares - to back their loans. MGN, until it was separated by flotation, had been the private side's cash dispenser. But when it became a public company, obliged to pay dividends to shareholders, it was no longer able to donate its profits to Maxwell's private companies. 'The picture began to change so fast that we would need new projections of where the cash was coming from nearly every fortnight,' says a director of one UK clearing bank. The director and his assistant went to ask Kevin Maxwell, just days after the flotation, where the private side would now get cash to pay its bills. Kevin's answer - hardly reassuring - was 'arguably, it would have been better not to have floated MGN'. The banker says: 'I just gulped, but was reassured that asset sales would bring down debt.' In many cases banks did not inquire closely enough where the comforting packages of cash or assets came from. Increasingly during 1991 the answer was the pension funds. Of the Pounds 448m eventually missing from the pension funds, Pounds 248m of shares had been liquidated and the cash given to banks. The destination of the Scitex proceeds is just one example of this. The other Pounds 200m lost from the pension funds occured when share certificates were simply handed over to banks as backing for loans. Robson Rhodes argues that banks should have known they were being given pension shares, because in most cases BIM's name was still written at the top of the share certificates. Neil Cooper says that as BIM had no role except managing pension funds, the banks need to answer where they thought the shares were coming from. As the crisis gathered speed over the summer of 1991 Maxwell squeezed some fresh short term loans out of a few banks - from Midland Bank, Bankers Trust, and the Bank of Nova Scotia - but the money was drying up fast. 'By September we were desperate,' one clearing bank director says. 'We could see there was just no cashflow at all on the private side.' During this accelerating panic, the banks did not confer with each other. John Melbourn, NatWest's chief executive in charge of group credit risk, explains: 'Not only is it against the rules of client confidentiality to talk to other banks, we wouldn't talk to them in circumstances where we think we have to make sure to protect our own security.' Maxwell thus evaded the scrutiny of the banks. An important potential line of defence failed. The next possible tripwire - the auditing of the books - also failed to rescue the situation. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte - as auditors to all the Maxwell companies, apart from the Gibraltar and Liechtenstein trusts - had access to all parts of the empire for audit purposes. Coopers were not in a position to check the books of the company on a day-to-day basis. Coopers now says: 'Maxwell had done nothing wrong since the 1970s; from our point of view he'd played it by the book.' Coopers says it did not detect the pension fund fraud because the last audit date was April 1990, and the pilfering of assets happened after that. That April the audit had shown some small irregularities in stocklending procedures. A subsequent audit would almost certainly have shown that the same practices had grown in the intervening period. But the audit report was not finalised until April 1991. Coopers says the 12-month lag is within the Occupational Pensions Board recommended timetable and 'pension fund accounts tend not to get priority in things; they normally take longer than public company accounts to be finalised'. However, the audit for the year to April 1991 never took place. One of the ways Maxwell avoided detection was by the simple device of extending the audit period. He simply declared that the next one would be December 1991, a gap of 21 months. Why did Coopers agree - and why did it not insist on interim accounts? Coopers says that it is for the directors and trustees, not the auditors, to determine the audit date. But it adds that it did press for interim accounts in July 1991 and said - in a letter to Trevor Cook, the pension manager, dated August 9 - that 21 months was too long a gap. Coopers adds: 'Kevin was also a director of BIM and took some responsibility for pension affairs.' In Coopers' view Kevin 'had accepted the need for interim accounts', although no steps had been taken to prepare them by November when Robert Maxwell died. A separate team of auditors from Coopers was responsible for the books of Robert Maxwell Group, which acted as group banker for much of the Maxwell empire, funnelling money in and out of all the companies, including many of the pension funds. The last audit of Robert Maxwell Group by Coopers was in December 1990, eight months after the pension audit. The pension liquidators now believe that, by late 1990, the pensions funds were already lending some of their assets to Robert Maxwell Group in an irregular manner. Coopers say that, at the date on which Robert Maxwell Group was audited, they 'detected no irregularities'. A third audit team at Coopers was aware of worries at MCC in the days before Maxwell's death. During October Neil Taberner, the Coopers partner in charge of MCC, learned that the private companies owed around Pounds 100m to MCC. Taberner did not communicate the information to Coopers teams looking at the rest of the empire, nor would he have had access to their views. Coopers operated a policy of strict separation between the four audit teams assigned to each arm of the Maxwell empire on the grounds of client confidentiality. Coopers now says: 'We are confident in the work we did. There is nothing we have particular concerns about. One greatly regrets the position of the pensioners.' As the crisis inside the Maxwell companies grew in 1991, there were a number of moments when outsiders caught glimpses of the problems that were to bring the empire down. As well as using BIM to manage the pension money, Maxwell used several respected City investment houses - such as Invesco MIM, Capel Cure Myers, and Lloyds Bank Investment Management. According to writs filed against MIM and Capel Cure Myers by the Mirror Group Pension Fund - the largest of the Maxwell pension funds - the fund managers were aware by April 1991 of worrying patterns in lending out shares from the Maxwell funds. 'Stocklending' is a legal and common practice among funds to boost their income, but the writs allege that the Maxwell stocklending was irregular in many ways. Invesco MIM was worried enough, the writs say, to hold an internal meeting to discuss the matter in April. Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which had advised on the MGN flotation, was alerted to problems a month before Maxwell died. On Thursday October 3 Ernie Burrington, MGN managing director, told Andrew Galloway, a Samuel Montagu director, that the Maxwells had taken Pounds 47m from the MGN bank accounts and would not give it back. Burrington said: 'I have no evidence of anything illegal, but the lack of information is worrying me. Would you - Samuel Montagu - ask him?' Burrington's call to the bank followed a row he had in Maxwell's bedroom at the Labour party conference in Brighton the day before. Maxwell had accused the MGN directors of meeting in secret 'cabals'. On Friday, the MGN directors had a strategy meeting at Knutfield Priory in Surrey. Burrington accompanied Maxwell out to the helicopter waiting to take him to London when the telephone rang to confirm Maxwell's meeting with Samuel Montagu. Later that day Ian McIntosh, a board director of Samuel Montagu, met Maxwell at Maxwell House in London. Maxwell told him that some money had already been paid back and some was going to stay in gilts - government bonds - as an investment. McIntosh says that Montagu then 'kept a dialogue' with the MGN directors as they tried to track down documentation. No money was recovered, however, and on Maxwell's death it emerged that a further Pounds 50m had gone missing. Montagu says: 'There's nothing more we could have done to protect the Mirror. It was a sound business. A manager's got to be allowed to manage. If we thought Maxwell should have been locked up we would have had no business listing the Mirror.' Another missed opportunity came between April and July 1991, starting around the time of the MGN flotation. Over that period orders were placed for around Pounds 300m of MCC and MGN shares. It is now clear that this was a huge, hidden scheme to prop up the shares of Maxwell's two public companies. The scheme was essential to Maxwell's protracted survival. He needed to support the share price because he had pledged his own shares in MCC and MGN  -his controlling interest - to the banks to raise loans for the private companies. If the value of the shares fell too far, the banks would call in the loans and the private side would crash. Many of the share deals were carried out through Goldman Sachs, the blue-chip US stockbroker. Goldman Sachs was told by Maxwell that the Liechtenstein and Swiss trusts buying the shares were entirely independent of him. Goldman Sachs says it acted properly. When the empire finally collapsed Maxwell's private companies had taken so much money from the rest of the empire that the pension funds were unable to keep up payments to the pensioners and MCC was pushed into administration under insolvency laws, to be dissected and sold in pieces. MGN is the only part that remains alive, although weakened. At the Sunday night meeting of the banks and accountants on December 3 when the scale of the fraud was exposed for the first time an 'audible gasp' went round the table. Several bank directors left early telling the others that they had lost their jobs. Imro's own internal investigation has concluded that it should have singled out problematic members of Imro for special attention. But not much else has changed. Coopers is still the auditor for MGN. The Serious Fraud Office is still investigating the support scheme, but will not be bringing charges against Goldman Sachs. If there is any criminal trial, Goldmans staff may well be called as witnesses for the prosecution to give evidence against those charged. Even as his empire was slipping from his grasp, Maxwell - who never lacked bravado - could still take a joke against himself. In the spring of 1991 a banker was talking on the telephone to Maxwell. 'I'm going to give up being chairman, and just meet presidents, and live on my boat in New York,' Maxwell told him. 'Oh look, there's a pig going past my window,' the executive replied. 'Is it a pink one?' Maxwell boomed. The FT's team of journalists has interviewed more than 150 people in 13 countries. The team led by Bronwen Maddox included: In London: Jimmy Burns, Raymond Snoddy, Robert Peston, Andrew Jack, Norma Cohen, Richard Gourlay, Daniel Green.

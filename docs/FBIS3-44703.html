As asserted by some authoritative observers, China will  continue to be in a process of rapid growth. There is massive  potential in its domestic market, which has provided a vast  field for industrial development. By and large, various  countries in the world look favorably on the economic trend in  China, so that the country will continue to be the world's  largest market attracting foreign capital, both at present and  for a considerable time to come.  <H5>  Three Major Signs of Economic Direction </H5>   Referring to opportunities, Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed  out: The new year will be a momentous one in which China's  economy will continue to maintain good development momentum. It  also will be a crucial year in which the reform to establish a  socialist market economy structure will be pushed forward. The  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has  concretized and systematized the objectives and principles of  this huge reform project, and has sketched out the basic  framework of a Chinese-style market economy, which has become an  overall tentative plan with a strong guiding and manipulative  character, with a view to comprehensively pushing forward the  omnidirectional reform for transforming government functions,  optimizing macroeconomic regulation and control, revitalizing a  microscopic economy, and expediting the building of a legal  system.    The senior CPC leaders hold that reform and opening up  over the past two years have been focused on Deng Xiaoping's  remarks during his south China tour, the establishment of the  socialist market economy structure defined at the 14th CPC  National Congress, and the decision on the "50 measures" adopted  at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee, all of  which have organically formed the "three major signposts of  China's economic direction" in this century, thus effecting a  historic transition from a planned economy structure to a market  economy structure.  <H5>  Readjustment of Interests To Stabilize General Situation </H5>   Deng Xiaoping said: Reform is also a revolution; it  certainly will change the unreasonable patterns of interest  inherent in the old structure or formed in the course of  structural transformation, and inevitably will encounter certain  difficulties or obstructions, including the readjustment of  interests between the central and local governments, the  preferential policies and investment restrictions among  different industries, the income readjustment and changes among  different social strata, and so on.    As reform will make a giant stride in the new year in which  the number of reform measures to be introduced will be the  greatest for the last 15 years, and will involve various areas  -- including the state, enterprises, and individuals, as well as  various trades and professions -- it will make up an organic  body incorporating various major links of reform. Hence, it is  necessary to push forward the reform in a positive, planned,  comprehensive, and coordinated way in order to bring about an  early formation of the new structure. Jiang Zemin,  general secretary of the CPC, described this as "being of vital  importance so that efforts should be made to strive for a sure  victory." He also pointed out the necessity of handling  the relationship among reform, development, and stability with  particular caution. While persisting in taking the economic  construction as a central task, it is necessary to persist in  achieving economic development and social stability in a  mutually complementary and unified way. He stressed that  economic development is the last word [jing ji fa zhan shi ying  dao li 4842 3444 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Only by  seizing the favorable opportunities can we deepen reform, open  wider to the outside world, expedite development, and solidify  the political situation of stability and unity. In turn,  political stability in society will vigorously ensure the smooth  advance of economic construction, reform, and opening up. He  held that the maintenance of political stability is an  appropriate compenent of the subject of concentrating our energy  on economic construction, and these two aspects must supplement  each other. He reminded members of the leading bodies to keep a  sober mind and to be adept at discovering and at resolving in a  timely fashion those new problems cropping up in the course of  advance, and hose tendentious problems in particular. He  stressed the necessity of carefully guiding and displaying the  initiative of cadres and masses, paying attention to  coordinating relations among various parties, and mobilizing all  positive factors to create favorable conditions for the healthy  development of the national economy.  <H5>  Explorations Should Be Made To Avoid Great Ups and Downs </H5>   Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China's  economy has experienced several ups and downs, which have  aroused attention in various quarters. Is this instability a  transitional phenomenon of the structural transformation or is  it a cyclical phenomenon of the market economy? The  Development Research Center of the State Council, a major think  tank in China, has listed it as one of the five major subjects  for economic research in the 1990's. Sun Shangqing,  director of the center, said: It was not sufficiently  scientific to think in the past that there was no economic  cyclicity under public ownership. The center has begun research  on what special features the development cycles will have, and  how we should base ourselves on these special features so as to  reduce the extent of the fluctuations brought on by these cycles  in the course of moving from a planned economy to a market  economy, and even after the establishment of the market economy.  It is hoped that the exploration into this law will help China  avoid great ups and downs in its economy.    Along with the increasing impact of market prices on  industrial and agricultural production, peasants have called for  reducing various inappropriate burdens imposed by local  governments, as they are the people most liable to be affected  by the shifts in market supply and demand. When their income  sags, they leave their villages and give up farming in order to  engage in trade, a process that has led to the ever-increasing  number of transients in the cities. Now and then, there are  cases of "lodging petitions" by groups of peasants who have  found it difficult to sell their products; who have been  deceived by people selling forged pesticides, fertilizers, or  seeds; or who have complaints about the high cost of farm  implements. In this regard, the CPC has adopted a series of  measures to increase agricultural investment, eliminate the  phenomenon of "IOU notes" in the purchase of agricultural and  sideline products, and so on. Xiao Yang, who took up the post  of Sichuan provincial governor in 1993, claimed that the  handling of peasants coming to town to "seek justice" was one of  his principal jobs.  <H5>  Workers' Position Remains Unchanged </H5>   In the course of transforming enterprise operational  mechanisms, owing to such public opinions as "now is an era of  scientists and entrepreneurs," which emerged at one time, and to  the fact that the rights and interests of staff and workers in  foreign-invested enterprises very often were unprotected,  workers felt that their position as "masters of the country" had  declined. According to a survey of more than 300  foreign-invested enterprises in Guangdong, most of the staff and  workers put in 10 to 12 hours per day, with some working for 14  hours or even as long as 28 hours in succession. In a  considerable number of enterprises, labor protection was poor,  with the air seriously polluted with poisonous gas and dust in  excess of standards. Among the 400 staff and workers at a  foreign- invested enterprise in Xiamen, Fujian, nearly one-tenth  had a part or all of their fingers cut off owing to industrial  accidents. In some localities, disputes between employers and  employees arising from such phenomena as withholding employees'  wages, beating or scolding them, sacking them at will, molesting  women workers, and so on, were very serious in both domestically  funded and foreign- invested enterprises.    A CPC leader pointed out: In the course of reform,  opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy  structure, all aspects -- including the socialist system, the  nature of the state, the status of the working class as a  leading class, and the position of workers as masters of the  country -- remain unchanged. The masters-of-the-country status  of staff and workers in state-owned enterprises, as well as in  foreign-invested, privately owned, and town and township  enterprises, also remains unchanged. Jiang Zemin particularly  pointed out: Trade union organizations should be set up in all  foreign-invested enterprises so as to safeguard the legitimate  rights and interests of the workers.  <H5>  The Four Factors Determining the Success or Failure of Reform </H5>   Recently, quite a few institutions of information on  scientific research, as well as specialists, and academics, made  assessments and analyses of China's situation of reform and  openness, as well as its economic trends. Their relatively  unanimous views are that China will continue to maintain a  double-digit economic growth rate in the future on the grounds  that -- given the somewhat intensified macroeconomic regulation  and control -- development in the energy, communications, and  essential raw and semifinished materials industries has been  accelerated, the growth of real estate and tertiary industry has  picked up again. They believe that the scope of investment will  remain comparatively large, which will contribute to the  development of economic production in various fields. In the  industrial structural readjustment, certainly, the excessively  high rate will decline to a certain extent.    One important point is: Whether or not the good momentum in  changing tracks will be maintained in the new year under  circumstances of the extensive introduction and implementation  of various reform plans will depend on the following four  factors:    1. Efforts are made to avoid great ups and downs in  economic construction. These include stabilizing  agriculture, reducing the impact of price reform on the economic  sphere, guarding against fresh inflation brought about by  relaxed investment, and so on. Jiang Zemin pointed out:  There should be new ideas for economic development. It is  necessary to really shift to the path of taking the enhancement  of economic results as a central task, and to refrain from  continuously following the beaten track of extensive operation  characterized by blind pursuit of output value and expansion of  investment scope. Serious attention should be paid to  structural readjustment, technological transformation, the  development of products, scientific and technological work, and  management in these areas. In short, stress should be placed on  the quantity, as well as the quality, of economic growth.    2. Stability is maintained in social and political  life, and efforts are made to improve the condition of social  security. Owing to uneven regional economic development,  the income gaps between various social strata will be further  widened in the reform years. In some minority regions, in  particular, and in areas where public order has worsened or the  economy has lagged behind, conflicts between cadres and the  masses, among nationalities, and among religious factions, as  well as the improper handling of certain problems by the  government, may bring about some sudden events or incidents that  will lead to serious consequences. As far as the general  situation is concerned, thanks to the popular support given to  the reform line for the market economy, the CPC has solidified  its ruling position and confidence, so that the senior policy  makers all think it impossible for a large, overall disturbance  to break out. Some of the serious problems at present are poor  public order -- with the number of serious cases remaining high  -- and the ugly phenomena still existing in society. The CPC  has taken firm control of improving the case-handling system on  one hand, and is intensifying the police forces and adopting  measures for the comprehensive management of social security on  the other, so as to severely crack down on various kinds of  criminal activities. Ideologically, it has further intensified  its leadership over ideological, cultural, and propaganda work  in a bid to prevent the outbreak of new turbulence and the  emergence of destabilizing factors.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Will Be Strengthened </H5>   3. The authority of the central government is in  place, and a coordinated relationship between the central and  local authorities is being maintained, while macroeconomic  regulation and control are being intensified and improved.  When the CPC hierarchy put into effect various reform measures  at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  in November, and at the national economic work meeting in  December, it emphatically pointed out, time and again, that as  the economy developed at a faster pace, there always would  emerge some unbalanced phenomena in various areas. Hence, it was  necessary to intensify macroeconomic regulation and control and  to make readjustments in good time. Both Jiang Zemin and Li  Peng repeatedly affirmed the achievements scored by the  regulation and control measures adopted in the second half of  1993. In their opinion, the correct practice of macroeconomic  regulation and control has been an indispensable condition for  the rapid growth, so economic, legal, and necessary  administrative means should be applied still more properly to  ensure healthy economic development in the future. As the CPC  has intended to establish a market economic mechanism for fair  competition, it is certain that the previous preferential  policies will fade out deliberately. By using the means of  macroeconomic regulation and control, the CPC will be able to  check various acts taken by various departments and localities  to "jump the gun" [tou bu 0262 2975] in disregard of the overall  interests. A more important point is that the intensification  of macroeconomic regulation and control is conducive not only to  making an overall arrangement, and to maintaining the unity of  the state and the authority of the central administrative  orders, but also to pushing forward the reform plan as a whole.  <H5>  Measures Will Be Taken To Guard Against "Leftist" Deviation </H5>   4. The resurgence of "leftist" deviation should be  prevented, and the set policies of reform and opening up should  be guaranteed so that they will not be changed after Deng  Xiaoping's death. Since the 14th party congress, the CPC  has put into practice measures to guarantee for 100 years the  steadfast adherence to Deng's line, precisely through the  party's political line, organizational line, and policymaking  structure. In the activities to mark the centenary of Mao  Zedong's birth, the CPC also took pains to lead the masses onto  the track of studying Deng Xiaoping's theory and of pushing  forward reform and opening up.    At present, owing to the great intensity and extensive range  of the reform, the CPC has not lowered its vigilance against the  possible risks that may occur. Recently, the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated new  regulations on collecting consumption taxes, which triggered a  new round of price rises in some areas. Spurred on by various  rumors spreading among the masses, ordinary people demonstrated  a "panic buying" mentality. The CPC authorities immediately  called on all localities to take measures to stabilize the  public will. On the one hand, the Beijing authorities  repeatedly announced through the media that no plan to raise  prices would be introduced in the near future. On the other  hand, they called on relevant departments to adopt measures to  limit the prices of retail goods so as to maintain order in the  markets.  <H5>  The Development of Shanghai Is a Microcosm </H5>   There is an element essential to the success or failure of  reform as a whole: Whether or not the openness and development  in Shanghai will make major headway.    Deng Xiaoping maintained: "It is a momentous measure  to take hold of Shanghai. Shanghai is our trump card, and it is  a short cut to boost the economy in Shanghai.... In the past,  Shanghai was a financial center, a place where money was freely  convertible. In the future, we should make it like this again.  If China wishes to gain an international position in the  financial arena, we must rely on Shanghai in the first  place."    It can be stated that after two or three years of  large-scale  development and construction, Shanghai has become a dragon head  of reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang valley, and even in  the entire country. The most important measures for the forward  position of reform have been experimented here, and the  development of Pudong has made headway, with a substantial  influx of various types of foreign funds. Shanghai's reforms in  foreign exchange, the securities market, the futures market, and  banking have begun to take shape. Deng Xiaoping  particularly stressed: "The banking industry is very important,  as it is the core of the modern economy. If financial work --  like a pawn in a chess game -- is well played and invigorated,  the whole game will be invigorated." Today, there are  scores of foreign-invested and joint-venture banks and finance  companies in Shanghai, and there are Chinese-funded banks too.  Shanghai has taken a crucial step to revive the old dream of an  oriental financial center.    Since the beginning of the 1990's, a total of 12 bonded  zones  have been set up in China's coastal areas. These are Dalian,  Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhangjiagang, Waigaoqiao, Ningbo, Fuzhou,  Xiamen, Guangzhou, Futian and Shatoujiao in Shenzhen, and  Haikou. Among them, the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in Pudong,  Shanghai, set up earliest of all and entirely closed, was the  largest, covering an area of 10 square km. One after another, a  great many world-class companies have opened offices here. Of  the 500 enterprises that have commenced business here, 446 are  foreign-invested enterprises. A number of experts hold that the  bonded zones in Shanghai's Waigaoqiao and Xiamen's Xiangyu boast  many conditions favorable to the construction of free ports,  which will serve as excellent channels for converging with the  international market once China reenters GATT.    Moreover, economist Ju Chongwei proposed that in a bid to  build Shanghai into an international financial and trade center,  it is necessary to follow the model of Hong Kong in exporting  capital, technology, management, and service, and to construct  the Chang Jiang valley and southern area of China into a fifth  "little dragon." He viewed with disfavor the practices of  absorbing purely foreign capital so as to make only Pudong  prosperous, and of developing purely local industries, as such  practices cannot turn Shanghai into a modern cosmopolis.    It is certain that the economic development and the  establishment of a new structure in Shanghai will become a  microcosm of the development trend of reform and opening up in  China.</p>

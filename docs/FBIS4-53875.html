			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 18 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's advisory "Defense Issues Council" (chaired by Asahi  Breweries Chairman Kotaro Higuchi) held a meeting at the prime  minister's office. At the meeting, the members agreed to  propose a review of the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline"  on three subjects: 1) international situation; 2) comprehensive  security policies; and 3) tangible measures for defense buildup.    On the "international situation," the panel is going to  discuss military and social trends of the present world,  focusing on "Japan's increasing responsibilities." Regarding  the "comprehensive security policies," the panel will advocate  "comprehensive measures to appropriately cope with `various  threats'" in consideration of both military and economic trends.</p>

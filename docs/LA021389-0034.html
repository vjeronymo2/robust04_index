			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) asked the Pentagon to keep the Norton Air Force  Base stores and clinic open after the rest of the base closes as part of a  proposed nationwide cutback in military installations. Brown said in a letter  to Acting Air Force Secretary James McGovern that nearly 10,000 retirees living  nearby rely on the facilities. A special commission has recommended to Congress  that Norton and 85 other installations be shut down because they are unneeded.  </P></p>

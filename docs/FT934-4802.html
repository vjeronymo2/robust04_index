			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Industry gloomy on investment prospects Low levels of manufacturing investment are likely to continue in spite of Budget measures to help small businesses, Midlands business leaders warned yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes. Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers' Federation in the west Midlands, said: 'The major disappointment is the lack of any direct incentive to further investment prospects. The temporary 40 per cent capital allowance rate has not been re-affirmed.' Mr Geoff Nicholls, east Midlands chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The allowance should have continued because of the depressed nature of the investment scene.' Companies held back from new investment not only because of the business climate but also because of the pressure on margins. 'Everybody is very clear that the pressure on margins is going to continue,' Mr Nicholls said. However, Mr Nicholls said the chancellor 'has avoided damaging the rather nervous growth prospects'.</p>

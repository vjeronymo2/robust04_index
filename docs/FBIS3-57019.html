Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius, who have been living there  illegally. Today RESPUBLIKA and NARODNAYA GAZETA published a  commentary from the Belarusian Internal Affairs Ministry on this  matter. The commentary says the following:    "In accordance with the treaty between Belarus and Lithuania  `On legal aid and legal relations in civil, family, and criminal  cases' signed in October 1992 and ratified by the Belarusian  Supreme Soviet in February 1993, the Belarusian side provided  assistance to a group of Lithuanian law enforcement officers  headed by a deputy procurator general in detaining citizens N.  Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius. Legal grounds for detaining  and handing over other persons who are not citizens of Lithuania  are not established, and this was stated to the Lithuanian  procuracy. The actions by the Belarusian law enforcement  officers correspond to the afore-mentioned treaty and to  international legal norms."</p>

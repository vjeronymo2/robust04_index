			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin, Aluf Ben, and Shlomo Dror] </F>   [Excerpt] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza  Strip have in the last few days resumed full operation, mainly  in the refugee camps and the big cities. The undercover units  have also stepped up their operations in the wake of new  instructions issued by senior Southern Command officers.    The Southern Command expects an increase in the attempts to  perpetrate terror attacks due to the population's frustration as  a result of the general closure of the territories and its close  enforcement in the Gaza Strip. Consequently, it decided to step  up the IDF's operations in the refugee camps and in the big  cities.    Last Friday, IDF troops operated in the Dayr al-Balah  refugee  camp, arresting a Fatah wanted man suspected of murdering a  70-year-old resident of Kefar Sava in February. [passage  omitted]    [A report by Arye Kiesel and Shim'on Schiffer in Tel Aviv  YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 10 April on pages 1 and 20 adds:  "A considerable part of the IDF's regular combat forces is  currently deployed in the territories to assure a maximum  enforcement of the closure.    ["The training program of many units has been halted to  enable their transfer to the territories. The troops  meticulously monitor every road, passage, and footpath leading  from the territories into Israel."]</p>

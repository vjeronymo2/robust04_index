			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Heroin Trap Snapped Shut"] </F>   [Text] For some time Bratislava has been considered a  center for drug gangs active in Western Europe. Competition is  great, which sometimes helps the police.    Thus, investigators of the Vienna Security Bureau learned  that a "large Mercedes from Slovakia" would arrive on 27 January  to deliver heroin for a deal in a restaurant in Vienna's 15th  district. The officials waited and pulled three "innocents" and  1 kg of heroin out of circulation.    Croat Cani N., 43, who drives a Mercedes 500-SEL, had a cafe  in Vienna some years ago, and is now operating an import-export  company in Bratislava, claims that he only took "a package from  A to B" to earn 6,000 German marks. Slovak Klaudia B., 25, on  whom 35,000 marks were found, only wanted to "visit a friend in  Vienna. The suspected main perpetrator, Vietnamese Minh Bang  T., 30, who lives in Munich, refuses to say anything at all."</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery reflects cost cutting at Pilkington - The glass maker has finally found favour with the City The City has found little good to say about Pilkington's management since it fought off BTR's Pounds 1.2bn bid way back in 1987. However, the tune has finally changed. Yesterday analysts were full of praise, particularly for Mr Roger Leverton who was brought in as chief executive in July 1992. 'They deserve a lot of applause for what they have done. For Pilkington, the recession has been a good experience,' said Mr Robert Donald, of NatWest Securities. The recovery in half-year profits owed much to an improvement in Pilkington's main markets. But management action also deserves credit. Criticised for being slow to cut costs at the onset of the recession, the company has since set about the task with a will. Almost Pounds 300m has been taken out of costs over the past four years with Pounds 42m, or 4 per cent, going in the six months to September. About 600 jobs went in the first half and another 1,000 are set to go before the end of the year. The brisker than expected cuts and a strong performance in Brazil pushed Pilkington's profits comfortably above analysts' estimates. As a result, NatWest increased its full-year forecast from Pounds 119m to Pounds 140m, before disposal gains, and from Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m in 1995-96. For the following year it predicts profits not far short of the 1989 peak of Pounds 330m. That will require a continuation in the price recovery being shown in most of Pilkington's main markets. The main weak spot is Germany where prices for double glazing units are still sliding despite strong demand. Although the German float glass price is still 40 per cent below its 1989 level, two price rises have pushed it up by about 10 per cent this year. But this has not arrested the decline in downstream prices. 'We have just put in another 5 per cent increase in float to try to force manufacturers to increase their prices. There is a limit to how much cost increases they can absorb,' said Mr Leverton. He points out that the capacity situation can change quickly. 'In the US there was a lot of surplus capacity 18 months ago. Now we are running at 100 per cent, with shortages in certain areas.' This has followed rapid growth in demand for value-added products, such as Galaxsee, Pilkington's 'privacy' glass for cars. Currently all the rage among fashion-conscious US car buyers, Galaxsee takes up more capacity and commands a premium price. Despite recent disposals Pilkington's balance sheet remains stretched. Gearing, which reached 86 per cent following the purchase of Heywood Williams, was cut to 66 per cent at the end of the first half. But the company will fail to hit the year-end target of 50 per cent, partly because of the postponement of the partial flotation in Australia. Pilkington has also restated its balance sheet to take account of revised accounting standards relating to US retirement benefits. This has reduced shareholders' funds by Pounds 100m, adding 7 percentage points to gearing. However, interest cover widened to more than two times in the the first half and Pilkington remains determined to work out its debts without resort to a rights issue. Its capital expenditure is running well below depreciation following the huge investment in new capacity in the late 1980s. Pilkington's main current projects are in South America, where it is building a float glass plant in Chile and a third line in Brazil. But there are some slightly ominous moves by its rivals elsewhere. At least two new float plants are planned in the US, where car production is about to peak, and two large European distributors are planning to move upstream with a float plant in Alsace. There is a long way to go yet, but when Pilkington's business peaks again, that will be the real test of its management.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff correspondent Han Baochang] </F>   [Text] The trading hall of the Shenzhen Metals Exchange  (SME), on the first floor of an ordinary commercial building on  Huafu Road, was bustling with activity. A number of young  people wearing red vests concentrated their attention on the  continuous flow of market quotations and transactions which  flashed across the 5x2.5 meter electronic screen. While the  exchange had only been open for 15 minutes, the transaction  volume totalled 1,200 tons of electrolytic copper, with each  transaction falling between 100 to 200 tons.    According to SME President Zheng Yuanheng, SME's total  transaction volume in 1993 exceeded the planned figure of 20  billion yuan by a substantial margin, reaching 38 billion yuan,  a 6.5-fold increase over the previous year.    "The exchange was jointly established by 38 enterprises on  June 1, 1991, and began formal operations on January 18, 1992,"  Zheng said. "The business volume for 1992 reached 6.3 billion  yuan, far exceeding the planned figure of 1 billion yuan."  <H5>  Standardization </H5>   China initiated research and investigation of futures  markets  in the mid-80s. Peng Haike, director of the General Manager's  Office of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Shenzhen  Associated Corp., said his company began investigating  international futures trading in 1985, and succeeded in carrying  out hedging transactions on the London Metals Exchange in 1987.  People were later sent to the London Metals Exchange to pursue  indepth research and investigations. They gained an in-depth  understanding of the requirements for establishing a futures  market to boost the rapid development of China's market economy.    At that particular time, China was shifting from a planned  economy to a market economy, and futures trading was something  completely new for both enterprise leaders and officials. Situ  Huai, president of the China Nonferrous Industry Shenzhen  Associated Corp., who concurrently serves as a professor at the  South-Central China Engineering University, wrote a book  entitled An Introduction to Futures Business. His intent was to  provide information and promote futures trading. According to  Situ, "The first step is to help people in the economic sector  understand futures trading and to train professionals. As a  result, from the very beginning China's futures trading will  operate under a standardized system."    The Shenzhen Metals Exchange opened for business on January  18, 1992, following a long preparatory period. Prior to the  opening, the Shenzhen municipal government issued its  Provisional Regulations on Administration of the Shenzhen Metals  Exchange and Regulations on Transactions in the Shenzhen Metals  Exchange. Executives from major futures exchanges in countries  and regions such as the United States, Britain, Japan, Canada,  Singapore and Hong Kong attended the opening ceremony. Filled  with zest, they visited the transaction hall which had been  operating on a trial basis, and expressed their appreciation for  the standardized operations, while at the same time offering  high praise for the establishment of the exchange.    Futures trading, which represents the top end of the market,  features major risk and heavy speculation. Therefore,  activities must be governed by laws and regulations. The  Shenzhen Metals Exchange, the first of its kind in China, must  be operate with high standards and proceed on a steady course.  It must be strictly managed in accordance with international  practices. According to Zheng Yuanheng, this has been the  guiding ideology from the very beginning.    The SME practices a membership system. Members must be  enterprises with relatively strong economic strength and which  employ professionals. The enterprises, which seek membership on  a voluntary basis, are examined by the board of directors and  approved by competent authorities of the local government. Only  members are qualified to appoint personnel as brokers, and all  brokers are required to pass an examination prior to receiving  working credentials. The number of members has risen from the  initial 38 to the present 110. Most large-scale nonferrous  metals enterprises in China are members, in addition to various  commercial and marketing enterprises, processing enterprises,  and financial and investment institutions.    The exchange operates five days a week, and on any given  day,  brokers in red vests busily complete vouchers containing the  selling and purchasing prices of commodities, which are then  displayed on the screen. At present, eight metals--copper,  aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, magnesium and antimony have  been approved for listing for either one-month spot or one-year  futures trading. The exchange's accounting center is  responsible for all settlements.    The Anhui Tongling Nonferrous Metals Corp. appointed Ma Ji,  26, a graduate of the Economics Department of Anhui University,  as one of the first brokers on the Shenzhen Metals Exchange. Ma  said that in the beginning business was far from brisk, but has  increased steadily as people have gained a better understanding  of the new business form. He noted that large production  enterprises mainly engage in hedging transactions in order to  lock-in costs to protect them from volatile market prices, and  show little interest in profit-making. For example, the price  for electrolytic copper on the international market was recently  lower than the domestic price, with a substantial price  difference of 1,000 yuan per ton. As a result, his corporation  imported copper from foreign countries while selling reserves on  the domestic market. Shortly thereafter, the domestic price  fell, as did the price on the international market. Ma's company  was nonetheless able to earn a profit. Today, the corporation  allows Ma to personally make decisions to conduct transactions  involving less than 1,000 tons. In addition to his work for the  corporation, Ma also serves as a broker for various other  enterprises. At present, each broker working on the exchange  handles accounts at least five enterprises [as published].    Liang Xiaohua, a female broker working for an aluminum alloy  processing plant in Sanshui City, Guangdong Province, said that  futures transactions may be hedging, but nonetheless ensure a  steady supply of goods. Strict rules and regulations instituted  by the exchange ensure that payments will be made in a timely  manner, and Liang said her company dare not undertake major  futures trade due to limited operating funds and loans. Liang,  who also works as broker for more than 10 other companies, finds  her job quite interesting since she is able to learn a great  deal from the exchange, while at the same time enhancing her  judgment and developing a sense of competition.    In the very beginning, Liang said, she was much too  nervous to work well, and other brokers nearby often helped her  correct mistakes. However, only two short years practice has  transformed her into a skilled broker. At present, females  account for only 10 percent of the total number of brokers.    According to Zheng Yuanheng, the key to futures trading is  designing standardized contracts for commodities, since  contracts ensure that products must be traded in accordance with  circulation standards and help to prevent switch selling. In  addition, contracts not only help to increase business volume  but also guarantee day of delivery. In 1992, the SME joined wit  production, use and quality inspection departments to adopt a  special-class standardized aluminum contract in line with  current international standards. The contract, China's first  ever for a commodity, was revised and used in trial operations  prior to its formal adoption on April 26, 1993. Shortly  thereafter, similar contracts were adopted for copper, zinc, tin  and nickel.    Zheng said aluminum and copper contracts have distinctly  strengthened the circulation of commodities and attracted a  large number of firms engaged in hedging and profit-making. As  a result there has been a significant increase in business  volume, up five fold per month over the previous period. At  present, all transactions consummated on the exchange have been  subject to standardized contracts and the rate of evening up has  increased by a large margin to near 90 percent. The strict  administrative system has ensured that the contract fulfillment  rate has remained at 100 percent since the founding of the SME.    The SME has invested several million yuan to install  state-of-the-art telecommunications and computer systems. In  addition, the exchange has installed 225 program-control  telephones, and a new long-distance business transmission system  links it with some 10 other exchanges. The number will soon be  expanded to include another 20-odd exchanges both at home and  abroad. The exchange is now linked with the Reuters Information  Network which transmits market information worldwide. In  addition, the network provides the exchange with rapid access to  international market quotations published by Reuters. At the  same time, negotiations are underway with United Press  International and the Satellite Communications Corp. Market  quotations from the SME are regularly published in more than 10  domestic newspapers and periodicals. And some local newspapers  and magazines publish a weekly market outlook, and broadcasting  and television stations carry daily quotations.  <H5>  Development With Chinese Conditions </H5>   SME's effort to develop a futures market has included paying  close attention to the unique characteristics in China. For  instance, in consideration of the country's true conditions and  resources, SME introduced antimony and magnesium to the futures  market thereby setting a worldwide precedent. The exchange's  settlement system requires the payment of earnest money  representing only 3 percent of the total transaction volume.  The intentionally low figure, which is in fact far below the  international practice of some 10 percent, is designed to  encourage enterprises lacking abundant excess funds to actively  participate in the market and conduct large-scale business with  small-scale funds.    Following the lead of the SME, the Shanghai Metals Exchange  went into operation in May that same year, and within a very  short period its transaction far surpassed that of the SME. By  exerting price guidance on production, consumption and  circulation and using forward pricing, the exchanges have played  an important role in regulating market supply and demand, and  stabilizing market prices. The consumption surge resulting from  the dramatic expansion of basic construction between 1988 and  1989 pushed the prices of aluminum, copper and nickel up by from  2.5 to 3-fold in a very short period of time. During 1992 and  1993, domestic basic construction was once again expanded and  the prices for rolled steel and various other raw materials not  yet listed on futures market increased by a wide margin, while  prices for aluminum and copper maintained relative stability due  to the regulatory function of the futures market.    Zheng said that when materials are in short supply on the  domestic market and prices rise, the majority of members of the  exchange purchase on the international market and sell on the  exchange, thereby bringing about a balance in supply and demand  and stable prices.    In accordance with open and just principles, all business  transactions are carried out publicly, rapidly and in simple  procedures. This particular form of business has gained great  has popularity amongst the majority of enterprises, especially  large enterprises. Ma Ji said most of his company's business  are transacted on the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges, adding  that the company has opened two futures trading companies in  Shenzhen and Shanghai in order to act as large-scale trade  agents.    The success of the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges has  ignited a fervor for the establishment of additional futures  markets. By the end of 1993, the number of various types of  futures exchanges rose to more than 40, 11 of which were  nonferrous metals exchanges. In the interim period some have  been forced close because of low standards.    Speaking of future development, Zheng said the SME is still  in the midst of a period of growth and self-perfection. Last  December, based on the SME, the Futures Integrated Exchange was  established to expand the scale of the industry to include  banking futures and option trading.</p>

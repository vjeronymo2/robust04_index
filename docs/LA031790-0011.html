			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS SCHOOL FUNDS BILL IS BACKED;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A PLAN TO PAY FOR NEW SCHOOLS BY RAISING THE SALES TAX FINDS  EDUCATORS, BUILDERS AND ANTONOVICH IN ACCORD AT A SANTA CLARITA 'SUMMIT.'  </P> <P> In a rare show of unanimity, Santa Clarita Valley school officials, developers  and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Friday threw their support  behind a bill by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that would increase the  state sales tax to raise funds for building schools.  </P> <P> The bill calls for an amendment to the state Constitution to increase the sales  tax a quarter-cent per dollar for 10 years. It also would make it easier for  local school districts to increase property taxes to build schools in rapidly  growing regions.  </P> <P> Representatives from the Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts and the  Building Industry Assn. of Southern California met with Davis and Antonovich at  an education "summit" organized by Antonovich to develop a strategy to address  school crowding statewide.  </P> <P> Several bills aimed at raising money for school construction are pending in the  Legislature, and Antonovich said he wants schools and builders to agree on  which measures the county should endorse.  </P> <P> Friday's meeting ended in harmony, quite unlike a similar meeting last week  that broke up after 15 minutes when Antonovich learned that school officials  and builders had not yet agreed on a joint recommendation to combat school  crowding. The builders and school officials said they did not realize that  their recommendations were due that day.  </P> <P> An angry Antonovich said the builders and school officials had failed to show  leadership on the issue. School officials promptly accused Antonovich of  lacking leadership, saying he was ignoring county school crowding problems  while trying to address the issue at the state level.  </P> <P> But Friday's meeting was civil and businesslike. School officials and  developers handed Antonovich their recommendations, and Davis outlined the  provisions of his education bill.  </P> <P> "The genius of this bill is that it goes for 10 years," Davis said.  </P> <P> The quarter-cent sales tax would provide a steady and reliable source of funds  for new schools, Davis said. California's school construction program now  relies on statewide bond measures, which must be approved by the voters. A bond  measure that would raise $800 million is on the June state ballot.  </P> <P> The sales tax would be more cost-effective than bonds because the state must  pay interest on bonds, he said. It takes $2.1 billion, Davis said, to pay off  $800 million in bonds.  </P> <P> "This is a stupid thing for anyone to do," Davis said. "It's an idiot's way."  </P> <P> Under the Davis bill, school districts could raise property taxes up to 5 cents  for each $100 of assessed valuation if the increase were approved by more than  half the votes cast in a district election. School districts now need a  two-thirds yes vote to raise property taxes.  </P> <P> Davis told Antonovich that an endorsement from the Board of Supervisors would  help his cause in Sacramento, particularly among conservative lawmakers usually  averse to tax increases. "The biggest problem we're going to face is Assembly  Republicans," Davis said.  </P> <P> In addition to supporting Davis' bill, the builders and school officials asked  Antonovich to support measures that would streamline construction guidelines  and procedures that local school districts must follow to build schools.  </P> <P> Antonovich endorsed the basic elements of the Davis bill but said he has some  reservations about extending the tax for 10 years.  </P> <P> Antonovich said he will present the recommendations to the Board of Supervisors  Tuesday. The board could vote on whether to support the package a week later.  </P> <P> Friday's meeting concerned statewide solutions to school crowding but did not  specifically address conditions in the Santa Clarita Valley, where the five  districts predict they will need $400 million to build 33 new schools by 2010.  </P> <P> Developers and Santa Clarita school officials have been at odds for more than a  year over how much money the building industry should contribute to new  schools. The districts are suing the Board of Supervisors to block construction  of two housing developments in Castaic, arguing that supervisors have the power  to deny building permits to projects that overburden schools and that they  should use that power.  </P></p>

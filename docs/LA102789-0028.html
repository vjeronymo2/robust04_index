			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARRESTED HART PLAYERS TO PLAY  </P> <P> Five Hart High varsity football players arrested Tuesday for allegedly  kidnaping a 17-year-old girl will not face disciplinary action from the school,  Hart Athletic Director Bill Beauer said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We don't have any jurisdiction," Beauer said. "It has nothing to do with the  school. . . . What they do after hours on their own time is not our business."  </P> <P> Beauer said that all five players will be allowed to play in Hart's game  tonight against Burbank. The players were released into their parents' custody  after the arrests.  </P> <P> The alleged kidnaping occurred early Saturday and appeared to be a prank, a  police spokesman said. The boys forced the girl, a schoolmate, into a van and  left her on Pico Canyon Road. Walking out of the canyon, the girl once more was  forced into the van, then was taken to a friend's home in Newhall. BRENDAN  HEALEY  </P></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Inflation fuels fear of fresh rate rise: Retail prices and jobless figures unsettle markets - FT-SE loses 41 and bonds fall A slight rise in UK retail price inflation and a bigger-than-expected drop in unemployment last month provoked fears of further base rate rises and unsettled financial markets yesterday. The Central Statistical Office reported that the retail prices index jumped 0.5 per cent between July and August and was 2.4 per cent higher than in August last year. Underlying inflation, defined by the government as the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, rose 2.3 per cent in the 12 months to August. Both annual rates of inflation were 0.1 percentage points higher than in July and above the average expectations of City analysts, who had forecast a slight drop. The news prompted a sharp decline in share and bond prices. The FT-SE 100 index lost 41.6 points to close at 3,079.8 and the 10-year benchmark government gilt-edged stock fell 1 5/32 points. Sterling wobbled, losing a pfennig against the D-Mark on the news, but later closed broadly unchanged with losses against the D-Mark offset by gains against the dollar. Yesterday's financial market jitters were compounded by news of a sharp 34,200 fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment last month to just under 2.6m, apparently providing further evidence of fast growth in the economy. Lord Lawson, chancellor from 1983 to 1989, added to base rate anxiety by writing in yesterday's London Evening Standard that 'this week's half-point hike is most unlikely to be the last'. Markets were unsettled further by a CSO official's disclosure that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had been given a preliminary estimate of the RPI data last Wednesday before he decided on Friday to raise bank base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent. That appeared to take some of the lustre away from Monday's base rate increase. Some City commentators suggested that the rate rise might have been a reflex action to current needs and not, as the chancellor said, a pre-emptive action to nip incipient inflationary pressures in the bud. However, speaking on BBC radio's Today programme yesterday, the chancellor insisted that the latest inflation and jobless figures were 'not relevant to last week's decision'. Instead, he was looking to possible events 18 months to two years ahead. The CSO said the rise in inflation reflected sharp increases in prices for clothing and household goods after heavy discounting in July's summer sales. Looking at the trend, 'prices have been broadly stable since May', officials added. However, the jump in inflation last month fuelled fears of further price rises in September. 'We are at a turning point in inflation,' said Mr Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at Natwest Markets. Yesterday's retail prices report overshadowed the positive labour market news. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in all UK regions and reached its lowest rate since January 1992. The unadjusted 'headline' jobless total, which normally rises in August, fell last month by nearly 5,000 to 2,638,267. Wage inflation stayed subdued, with average earnings growing an annual, underlying 3 3/4 per cent in July, unchanged from June.

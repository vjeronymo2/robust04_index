"I accept the proposal to serve as a mediator," said the  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, in  reference to a communique issued by the armed group published by  the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA on Saturday.    Official reports indicate that nearly 100 people have been  killed and an undetermined number injured since the armed group  occupied several towns of the region known as Los Altos de  Chiapas last Saturday.    Bishop Ruiz Garcia talked about "the urgent need to take  specific steps toward a true consolidation of peace" and said  that in these times of "sorrow and hope" we must act "with  responsibility."    In the communique the armed group proposed a "public and  written" dialogue with the government with the mediation of  Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize winner,  Mexican journalist Julio Scherer, director of PROCESO magazine,  and Ruiz Garcia.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Training of unemployed most hit Sir, The remarks by the leader of the group of 10 Training and Enterprise Council chairs (G10) which you reported ('Tec warning on links with government', April 3) underline the difficulties facing all those involved with publicly financed training at present. As the largest private training provider in the UK, Astra deals with more than half of the Tecs and Local Enterprise Companies. We therefore gain a broad picture of the provision of training for the unemployed. It is quite clear from our experience that funding of this training is being cut for the third consecutive year. We also drew attention, in our recent evidence to the House of Commons Employment Select Committee, to the inflexibility of funding and contracting arrangements which restrict the freedom of action of Tecs. Like the Confederation of British Industry, Astra has long supported the Tec concept. Also like the CBI, we endorse the outgoing government's strategy for encouraging employers to take increasing responsibility for meeting the skill needs of the country. Yet Sir John Banham has only this week described what is happening to Tecs as 'death by a thousand cuts'. By contrast it is from those employers which, acting in tune with CBI policy, do indeed invest in the skills of their workforces (and therefore in the future of their companies) that Astra earns half of its income and most of its profits. While this employer investment is slipping a little, it is falling much less than in any previous recession. It is public investment in training the unemployed that is being seriously neglected at present. As far as we can tell, spending on employment training is down about 5 per cent nationally (almost 10 per cent in real money terms). At a time of rapidly rising unemployment that cannot be right. When the long-awaited recovery gets under way, British industry is going to need a skilled labour force. Let us hope that employers' willingness to invest in achieving that is matched by a similar willingness on the part of the incoming government, whatever its colour (or colours).

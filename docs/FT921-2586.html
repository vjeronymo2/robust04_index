			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (10): Willis Corroon - Consultant's critique to take historical statistics from a corporate database and then present them in a tablular form. The implementation was extremely pedestrian. Using Lotus 1-2-3 as a relational database is inappropriate. It is a spreadsheet, not a database. While excellent for analysing data and performing 'what if' analyses, Lotus is hopeless as a database. It is both slow and inefficient in this context. Waiting 25 minutes to produce a report may seem quick compared with a three-day wait, but it is still dreadful. The system was not slowed up by the complexity of any analysis but by the poor design and incorrect use of available tools. Some of the ideas in the IT group were commendable. I applaud their approach of disseminating best practices to non-computer-literate users. However, their stranglehold on buying will probably stifle the staff in the longer term or may simply be subverted. I was astonished to hear that they made no changes to a proposed system after using Lotus as a fill-in replacement. It seems inconceivable that the design was perfect and needed no modification. Sadly, it imples that the group does not appreciate the value of learning from prototypes. There was no apparent soliciting of ideas from subsidiaries, nor transfer of technologies across the organisation. One broker appeared happy with the system and felt that it gave Willis Corroon a competitive advantage. In that sense, it should be considered a success. However, I suspect that it reflects more on the paucity of the offerings of the competition rather than any credit to the system as it stands. Unless Willis Corroon can address the issues and use appropriate tools, this slim advantage will soon vanish.</p>

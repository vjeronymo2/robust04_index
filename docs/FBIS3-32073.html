			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 1 Feb (NOTIMEX) --  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace in Chiapas, today  described as "an important step" toward peace a recent  communique issued by the armed group [Zapatist National  Liberation Army, EZLN] operating in Chiapas. The EZLN  communique states that a direct dialogue is "imminent."    The message is "an important step toward meeting and  advancing the process for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas  State," Camacho Solis said in a communique released to the media  in San Cristobal, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. [passage  omitted]    Camacho Solis, in his second communique issued on 1  February,  termed as an additional advancement the fact that the group is  willing to broaden media coverage of the possible direct  dialogue.    The armed group also agreed today to Camacho Solis' proposal  for national and foreign journalists to cover the eventual  negotiations, but the group excluded the private Mexican  television networks Televisa and Television Azteca.    Camacho Solis responded: "My stance is not to exclude anyone  and to make accreditation and access to the talks subject only  to the appropriate security measures."    The commissioner deemed "appropriate the EZLN's suggestion  for the registration of the media and the procedures for  coverage to be carried out through the group's mediator, Bishop  Samuel Ruiz Garcia."    Camacho Solis, in his first communique today read this  morning in San Cristobal de Las Casas, proposed to the armed  group the creation of two "buffer zones" without an armed  presence to ease the situation and help the civilian population.    Camacho Solis also announced that the Mexican Army has  withdrawn from the towns in the conflict area.</p>

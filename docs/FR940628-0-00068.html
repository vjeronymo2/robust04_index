			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The THLPSSC voted to approve this proposal, but four members believed the NPRM did not give terminal owners adequate notice that the proposed amendment could affect their piping. These members wanted RSPA to publish a separate NPRM on the subject. For the reasons stated supra in response to a similar argument by these THLPSSC members concerning in-plant piping, RSPA does not agree that another NPRM is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(7). Of these commenters, two operators and one association agreed with the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters expressed the same concerns about the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(7) as they did about the proposed in-plant piping definition. These concerns were that the NPRM did not adequately notify plant (terminal) owners of the proposed rule, and that some operator-owned components located on plant (terminal) grounds would fall outside part 195. Our response to these concerns is the same as stated supra regarding in-plant piping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to transfer lines located outside terminal grounds at ports, an operator and a pipeline-related association pointed out that the U.S. Coast Guard regulates transfers between terminal storage and dock facilities. These commenters suggested that RSPA and Coast Guard develop a memorandum of understanding to limit Coast Guard's regulations to dock facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that Coast Guard and RSPA jurisdictions overlap in port areas, but the two agencies have different responsibilities. Also, the overlap does not automatically result in regulatory conflicts, and the commenters did not mention any. Nonetheless, though we have not changed the final rule as a result of this comment, in enforcing part 195 at port areas, RSPA will act appropriately to resolve any unnecessary regulatory burdens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carbon dioxide injection system. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 195.1(b)(8) provides that part 195 does not apply to ``[t]ransportation of carbon dioxide downstream from a point in the vicinity of the well site at which carbon dioxide is delivered to a production facility.'' RSPA proposed to amend this section to clarify that the exception covers pipelines used in the injection of carbon dioxide for oil recovery operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The THLPSSC approved the proposed amendment (10 voted in favor and 5 did not vote), and we received no adverse comments from the public. The proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(8) is, therefore, adopted as final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.2&blank;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed revision of the definition of ``Secretary'' is not adopted in this rulemaking. Instead, it is being handled in an omnibus rulemaking covering all regulations involving pipeline safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``In-plant piping system'' is discussed above in &sect;195.1 Applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters objected to the proposed definition for petroleum products because of its use of the terms ``flammable'', ``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' which are not defined under part 195. The commenters stated that absent specific definitions for these terms, their applicability could be unclear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees with the comments about the lack of clarity in the proposed definition for petroleum products. So, the final rule for this section includes new definitions for ``flammable'', ``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' that come from the definitions contained in 49 CFR part 173 for Transportation and Packaging of Hazardous Materials for the terms ``flammable liquid'', ``poisonous material'', and ``corrosive material'', respectively. RSPA has adopted the definition of ``poisonous material'' for ``toxic'' because it considers the terms synonymous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 195.2, 195.106, 195.112, 195.212 and 195.413&blank;(Nominal Outside Diameter of the Pipe in Inches)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA proposed to standardize the dimensioning of pipe size throughout part 195 (Changes are made to &sect;&sect;195.2, 195.106(b), 195.106(c), 195.112(c), 195.212(b)(3)(ii) and 195.413(a)). All 10 THLPSSC members who voted were in favor of the proposal and no commenter objected thereto. Accordingly, the proposed amendment is adopted as final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.3&blank;Matter incorporated by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.3 sets out the general requirements for the incorporation in the regulations of industry standards for the design, construction and operation of hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. Paragraph 195.3(a) states that incorporation of a document by reference has the same force as if the document were copied in the regulations. Some operators have misinterpreted this section to mean that they must comply with all of the terms contained in a referenced document. Accordingly, RSPA hereby revises &sect;195.3(a) to clarify that an entire document is not incorporated when the document is incorporated by reference; rather, only those portions specifically referenced in the regulations are incorporated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule is being revised to conform to a recent update of references in another rulemaking (Update of Standards Incorporated by Reference (58 FR 14519; March 18, 1993)). Also, references to ASME/ANSI Codes B31.8 and B31.G are being added. The 10 THLPSSC members who voted and 7 commenters favored the revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

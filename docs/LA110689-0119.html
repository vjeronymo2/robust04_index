			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN SIGNS TAX HIKE, EARTHQUAKE RELIEF PACKAGE  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian today signed a 12-bill earthquake relief package,  including a temporary sales tax hike to raise $800 million.  </P> <P> "We're going to do whatever is necessary to restore the lives and the homes of  the people who were victims of this quake," Deukmejian said as he began signing  the bills.  </P> <P> As Mayor Art Agnos and a dozen legislators looked on, Deukmejian signed the  relief package at 11:45 a.m. after riding a ferry boat across the San Francisco  Bay from Oakland.  </P> <P> "I congratulate the Legislature on its quick action on the earthquake relief  package to assist the earthquake victims in rebuilding their lives, businesses  and communities," Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> State and federal aid, the Republican governor said, "should provide the  necessary resources in order to restore some semblance of normalcy in the Bay  area."  </P> <P> Some legislators of both parties criticized the plan, which raises the sales  tax to as much as 7 cents on the dollar, depending on local rates. Deukmejian  also plans to tap the state reserve for $200 million.  </P></p>

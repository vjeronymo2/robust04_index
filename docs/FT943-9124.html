			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Islamic marchers demand author's trial Three hundred Islamic activists marched through Dhaka yesterday, demanding that Taslima Nasrin, the feminist author who has fled to Sweden in fear for her life, be brought back to Bangladesh and tried for blasphemy, AP reports from Dhaka. The protest march was organised by a coalition of 13 Islamic groups that want Ms Nasrin executed for a comment she allegedly made against the Koran. For two months, Ms Nasrin hid in Bangladesh to avoid death threats by fundamentalists. She surrendered to a court in Dhaka on August 3 and was granted bail and permitted to travel outside Bangladesh. Ms Nasrin flew to Stockholm on Tuesday and is living at an undisclosed location. 'The government has connived with the infidel in allowing her to leave the country,' Mohiuddin Khan, a protest leader, said. Before Ms Nasrin, 32, emerged from hiding, extremist groups organised large demonstrations against her. But since then, the turnout at anti-Nasrin rallies has been smaller.</p>

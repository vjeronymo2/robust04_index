			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / China launches into space market: New entrant breathes a sigh of relief CHINA SENT an Australian telecommunications satellite into orbit yesterday confirming the country's arrival in the commercial space market. The satellite, Optus B1, will provide television and telephone links for Australia and New Zealand. The launch success, which followed a failed attempt in March, was good news for the members of the Optus consortium: BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the UK and the Mayne Nickless group of Australia. They paid Dollars A200m (Pounds 77m) to buy, launch and insure the satellite to provide pay TV for Australia and New Zealand. Jubilation at mission control, Xichang satellite launch centre in a remote corner of China's south west Sichuan province, was tempered with relief. The first attempt to launch Optus B1, made by Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft, failed when a short circuit cut off the flow of fuel to the rocket engines. Viewers around the world watching the live television coverage saw rocket ignite then fail to move as flames and smoke billowed from its base. Neither the rocket launcher, Long March 2E, nor the satellite was damaged. But the televised failure was a loss of face for the Chinese and a setback to China's commercial space prospects. The approach to yesterday's relaunch was considerably toned down, said Mr Gordon Pike of Optus at the launch site. Everybody was nervous, especially the Chinese. A launch this time was crucial to the future of China's commercial space programme, he said. Optus has said it saved about Dollars 100m by launching the satellite in China. China charges about USDollars 30m, compared with at least Dollars 50m on US or European launchers, but the price of a Chinese launch is now likely to rise because of a deal struck between Beijing and Washington. China has been trying for several years to break into the commercial satellite launch business. One barrier was that many satellites are made in the US, and an agreement had to be negotiated with the US government on safeguarding its technology and domestic launch market. The US agreed that China can launch nine US-built satellites over a six-year period as long as it promises not to undercut too much the price of a US launch. The first launch, yesterday, was exempted from this pricing rule as promotional. Washington is trying to protect an industry in trouble. The US is finding it difficult to win business in competition with the European consortium Arianespace. This is partly because the main US rockets available for commercial launches are made by defence companies McDonnell-Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta. They ran down their commercial programmes in the 1980s as the Nasa Space Shuttle programme grew. As a result, they were badly placed to pick up business when, after the Challenger space shuttle exploded in 1987, Nasa said it would no longer offer commercial launches. The departure of Nasa also encouraged other countries to examine the possibility of offering commercial space products. Among them were Russia, which will probably also be subject to a pricing and frequency deal with Washington, and Japan, where snags with test firings mean that the first launch has been postponed to 1994. Beijing has worked hard to build its head start over Russia and Japan. It first received international attention with the April 1990 launch of the Hughes-built Asiasat owned by Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite Telecommunications. Yesterday's launch was part of a Dollars 358m contract between Optus and Hughes to make, launch and insure two satellites. The second launch is due in October.</p>

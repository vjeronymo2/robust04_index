			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installment No 130 of the serialized memoirs of Xu Jiatun: </F> "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs]    [Text] 1. Continuous Incidents (Part Four of Four) --  The Yang Yang Affair    [Text] The Yang Yang affair also occurred during the same  period. Yang Yang was a Beijing swimmer who had overstayed a  tour of Hong Kong and not returned, and who publicly claimed  that he feared persecution if he returned to China, so was  asking for political aslyum. While I at first throught that he  was the Jiangsu badminton player of the same name, I later heard  that he was a Beijing athlete, so sent someone to find out and  make inquiries in Beijing, finding that Yang Yang would  certainly not be persecuted, but simply did not want to go home.  Our investigation showed that while the British Hong Kong  government had not yet made contact with Yang Yang at the time,  a Taiwanese party had, and the Taiwanese authorities had  expressed a willingness to take him in. As we were quite  concerned that he might go to Taiwan, we sent someone to work  with him, in hopes that he would return to China. Ji Shaoxiang  [4764 4801 4382], our NCNA branch's Foreign Affairs Department  director, reported directly to us that the British Hong Kong  government had said that as long as we issued a statement to  guarantee that Yang Yang would not be persecuted after he  returned to mainland China, they would send Yang Yang, who they  had in custody, back to China according to the practice for  dealing with those who overstay visits.    I replied that this was possible and, after obtaining  Beijing's consent, issued the statement, the gist of which was  that mainland residents left behind in Hong Kong around the time  of the 4 June incident, regardless of whether they had taken  part in any political activities, would without exception not be  investigated after they returned to the mainland.    But after the statement was issued, the U.S. consulate  general still gave Yang Yang a visa allowing him to go to the  U.S. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs learned of this, it  immediately took it up with the British Hong Kong government,  which claimed that the person had already left, so was  "powerless" in the matter. How could we continue in the future  to work with such an untrustworthy British Hong Kong approach?  And when Ji Shaoxiang took it up with a [British Hong Kong]  political advisor, he was offered only regrets.    So Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, and NCNA consulted on how to curb the British  Hong Kong government's untrustworthy approach, demanding a test  of strength with Britain. As every day brought mainlanders  fleeing illegally to Hong Kong, and both China and Britain had  agreed that those seized by the Hong Kong government's border  guards would be repatriated immediately on the same day they  were caught, we decided that unless we obtained a better promise  from Britain on this matter, we would refuse to accept the  repatriatees. When British Hong Kong missed the point of our  negotiations, we began to refuse to accept repatriatees on our  border, which brought a very strong response in Hong Kong  society. As I considered at the time that allowing this to  drag on for long would be adverse to winning over public  support, I asked Pao Yu-kang [0545 3768 0474] to go and see the  Hong Kong governor, to tell him that the hard line being taken  by Beijing was Deng Xiaoping's idea, not a decision taken by  subordinates. I also asked Pao Yu-kang to tell the Hong Kong  governor that to resolve the Yang Yang incident, we were only  asking the Hong Kong government to promise again that such  incidents would not occur again in the future. Meanwhile, Ji  Shaoxiang also made the same request to political advisors.    But after Pao Yu-kang had disclosed this news to the Hong  Kong government, there was no response. So I specially sought  out Chia Tao-li [0857 6670 3810], asking him to use his  influence to once again convey this information to the British  Hong Kong government. A day later, Chia Tao-li told me that "as  to the matter that you asked me to take care of, I have done it,  and now we have to wait for the response." Sure enough, a Hong  Kong government political advisor gave Ji Shaoxiang a verbal  promise, after which we felt that the affair was over. When  someone in the media asked about it, we announced the British  Hong Kong promise. But then the political advisor denied it,  forcing a clarification. Finally, the Hong Kong government  published on the front page of the 26 October 1989 edition of  NAN-HUA TSAO-PAO [SOUTHERN CHINA MORNING NEWS] their promise,  stating that the Hong Kong government would not allow Hong Kong  to be used as a base for activities designed to overthrow the  PRC, ...... [LIEN HO PAO ellipsis], and that the Hong Kong  government would continue to carefully consider matters and  interests of concern to Hong Kong's special conditions and the  Chinese Government.    On 23 October 1989, after the Hong Kong government's private  verbal promise, we stopped refusing to accept repatriatees.  Throughout the whole affair, Guangdong Province was very  supportive, with Guangdong's border guards acting in very fine  coordination.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Attention" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "Shelling of </F> Hebron's Occupation"]    [Text] After 27 years of military occupation of the City of  Hebron, the occupation authorities could not find a way to  control the city other than by artillery shelling, anti-tank  rockets, and heavy machine guns. By this invasion, Hebron says  it is a city that cannot submit to the will of the Zionists, and  that it is a Palestinian Arab city with a free will that could  not be subdued by years of captivity, suppression, murder,  deportation, confiscation of lands, and encroachment on  sanctities.    In Hebron, a real war continued for 18 hours after the city  was isolated and besieged by the occupation army, thereby  revealing its old colonial face. The army intervened after the  settlers had failed to subdue the will of the Ibrahimi Mosque  guards, who are all Hebronites, brothers of Gazans, sons of all  Palestine who deepened their affiliation with their Arabism with  heavy sacrifices, while all others around them were heading  toward their final downfall in the final, historical screening  of the entire Arab popular and official rank.    At the peak of talks on the details of how to deprive  international protection of its effectiveness, the army of Rabin  and Peres invaded Hebron to re-occupy it and guarantee effective  protection of the settlers, whose crime Rabin and Peres had  disowned for temporary political reasons.    But by that 18-hour armed confrontation, Palestinian  militants, who believe in their freedom, sovereignty, and full  rights, showed they were in full control of their will and that  they had completely given up the idea of attaining their rights  outside the confrontation field. Because everything in Hebron  and all other towns and camps of occupied Palestine is now  clear, and everything in the labyrinths of open and secret talks  is suspect and vague. Chief negotiator Shahal is a false man of  peace at the negotiation table; in the battlefield, however, he  is a general armed to the teeth with U.S. weapons and racist  Zionist hatred. Once he is through with his murderous,  suppressive tasks, he changes his uniform and goes back to  continue his mission at the negotiations table. It is precisely  here that we clearly see the unison of enemy words and deeds.  It is also here, unfortunately, that we clearly notice the  absence and growing separation of the [Palestinian] negotiator  from the resistance stand in Hebron which, like other parts of  the land, is creating its own glory and delivering another  child, who will hold a stone to the face of the occupation  soldier, with his helmet and gun, and force him to flee in  defeat.    Is Washington, which recognizes Jerusalem as the eternal  capital of "Israel," suitable as an arbiter of justice after all  bloody massacres and moral scandals?!    Denunciation is our firm answer at this stage when the  Intifada is moving toward a wider armed confrontation, opening  the way for a general armed popular rebellion, which will  definitely come.</p>

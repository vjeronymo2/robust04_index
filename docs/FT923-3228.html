			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Justinian: An escape from justice A shorter, simpler and cheaper system for trying complex fraud cases would reduce the risk of trials having to be abandoned or breaking down for reasons of defective procedures in the criminal justice system. This is the recipe recently prescribed by the new director of the Serious Fraud Office, Mr George Staple. His approach reflects the anxious consideration now being given in the wake of a crop of misfired fraud trials - Guinness, Barlow Clowes and Blue Arrow  -which have unsettled the administrators of criminal justice. It was Mr Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the US Supreme Court who once remarked that there was more danger that criminals would escape justice than that they would be subjected to tyranny. Mr Staple, not unnaturally, focuses primarily on what prosecuting authorities might undertake to achieve the objective of a more effective method of subjecting fraudsters to a judicial process. He has three main proposals to make for reforming the existing system or seeking an alternative route to a solution which is just for both offenders and the public. First, he wants to produce greater selectivity in both the range of criminal charges facing accused persons, and the numbers of defendants put on trial. The former is always available to prosecutors, aided and abetted by a vigilant judiciary. The latter is also exclusively within the discretion of the prosecutor. Any of those at the very heart of the fraudulent enterprise present an appropriate target for prosecution. And there has always been a sound stratagem among prosecutors to include the minor miscreants in a fraud trial. A jury finds special comfort in acquiting the peripheral offender, while convicting the main villains. If only the central figures are in the dock, the opportunity for selection is severely reduced and may lead to the unforeseen consequence of acquittal for one or more of the palpably guilty ringleaders. Mr Staple's special suggestion is to formulate an explicit system of plea bargaining. Informal agreements to accept pleas of guilty in return for monetary or other non-custodial penalties do pertain at present. They could be encouraged. But there is an instant dislike within the legal profession for any formal bargaining which needs to be carried out before the criminal justice system is majestically wheeled into place. A leaf might be taken out of the Inland Revenue's book. It uses its power to administer monetary penalties, up to three times the amount of the tax evaded by the defendant. If that were to be an acceptable policy in non-fiscal frauds, it would need to be legislatively sanctioned. The third proposal is allied to the second. It is to confer powers on the financial regulatory bodies to discipline fraudsters by way of penalties such as disqualification from offices and posts, in addition to administering fines. Again, legislation would be required. As long as criminal justice is to be applied effectively and efficiently to serious fraud cases, the focus of reform must be on the defence. Mr Staple does not want to tamper with the right to trial by jury. Instead he wants tough measures to ensure that the defence puts its cards face upwards on the forensic table at the earliest stage, and that judges should strictly enforce their orders for disclosing the nature of the defence. Mr Staple thinks that much can be achieved to produce a cultural change in criminal justice, abandoning the tradition whereby defendants keep their defences up their sleeves until the last moment, even declining to indicate whether they will go into the witness box until the last prosecution witness has given evidence. Early disclosure of a defence would no doubt help define the issues to be tried. The introduction in 1967 of a provision that took away the absolute right of a defendant to call evidence in support of an alibi, and required prior notice to be given of an alibi defence, provides a useful precedent for demanding prior disclosure of a defence. Certainly prosecuting counsel can do much - but only so much - by presenting the Crown's case in a readily intelligible form for ordinary jurors. But will such reforms of the procedure within the jury system suffice to remedy the mischief of complex, prolix and costly trials? Six years ago, the Roskill Committee on Fraud Trial (to whom Mr Staple gave written evidence) thought not, and recommended trial by a 'fraud trials tribunal', consisting of a judge and two lay members selected from a panel of persons with expert qualifications. The government rejected the recommendation, and still inclines towards preserving trial by jury. Will it resist the pressures for at least modifying the unqualified rule of jury trial for all serious crime? The ultimate problem of trial by jury is less about refining the process of prosecution or imposing disclosure by the defence of its case than about the conduct of the case as it is being unfolded in the courtroom. It is an inevitable feature of jury trial that defence counsel, at the insistence of the client, will wish to put up a smoke screen in front of the jury, and confuse the issue so that doubt is created in the jurors' minds. Without the risk of impairing the fairness of the trial process, it is impossible for the judge to stop the spoiling tactics of defence counsel. This is an aspect of jury trial that was not fully considered by the Roskill Committee. It should now form part of a comprehensive review, and not one confined to a narrow band of cases of an indefinable class. Perhaps this is a topic for the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Exhibition opens in London on improving Communication for people with disabilities PROFESSOR Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University cosmologist, yesterday joined schoolboy Neil Wallace at the opening of a Science Museum exhibition in London on improving communication for people with disabilities, Clive Cookson writes. Prof Hawking, who has motor neurone disease, communicates via a computerised speech synthesiser with a special keyboard operated by two fingers of his left hand, and can manage about 15 words a minute. Neil, 10, has cerebral palsy. He is using the US-made Liberator, which in its basic form costs Pounds 5,795. Prof Hawking said such devices made such a difference to the lives of people who could not speak that they should be available on the National Health Service.</p>

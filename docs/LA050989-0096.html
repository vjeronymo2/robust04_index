			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITADEL CHAIRMAN FACES TEST ON VALLEY FEDERAL DEAL  </P> <P> Less than two months into his new job as chairman of Citadel Holding Corp.,  Edward L. Kane faces a nagging problem.  </P> <P> At issue is whether Citadel, the Glendale holding company for Fidelity Federal  Savings &amp; Loan, should go ahead with its tentative plans to pursue a  takeover of sickly Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Citadel is struggling with lower profits, which the company blames on the  recent increase in interest rates. But some analysts say that Kane has  inherited one of the strongest and most efficient S&amp;Ls in the nation, and  that it could sharply improve the profitability of Valley Federal by applying  Citadel's low-overhead techniques there.  </P> <P> Citadel's "financial characteristics are superb," said Jonathan Gray, an  analyst with the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. He said  Citadel's name "is as much a description as an appellation."  </P> <P> Yet Citadel, with $4.8 billion in assets and 33 branch offices, still has its  critics. Other analysts say that even though higher interest rates are  troubling most thrifts, Citadel's management is without a decisive strategy to  make the company a standout in years ahead.  </P> <P> "It's a 'me-too' savings and loan," said Gerald S. Haims of Seidler Amdec  Securities in Los Angeles. "They're just treading water." He also said Kane, a  51-year-old lawyer who used to work on Wall Street, was elected chairman  because "there's nobody really strong within" Citadel with S&amp;L management  credentials.  </P> <P> Kane and Samuel C. McCarver, Citadel's chief operating and financial officer,  vigorously disputed such claims. They noted that Kane had been vice chairman of  Citadel since January, 1987, has been a Citadel director since 1985 and briefly  filled in as president in early 1987.  </P> <P> Kane "certainly was the most qualified and certainly a very logical candidate  for the position," McCarver said.  </P> <P> James F. Wilson, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, agreed that  the company needs "a larger management crew" because "Kane is not an operator,  and has no background in the S&amp;L business." He said Citadel is "looking for  either a new chief executive or a new No. 2 man, someone to work with  McCarver."  </P> <P> But now that Kane is chairman, he wants to make a decision on Valley Federal.  "I will personally try to see if we can't either consummate something or  terminate" the merger plans, he said. "It's silly to keep going along this  way."  </P> <P> Citadel has talked about the merger for more than two years. Kane likes the  match, believing that it would make Citadel "the predominant lender" in the San  Fernando Valley residential real estate market.  </P> <P> No deal has yet been struck because, among other things, Valley Federal, with  $3.4 billion in assets and 45 branches, had been resisting Citadel's overtures.  Valley Federal did say two weeks ago that it would consider a firm offer,  however. But Valley Federal's worsening condition -- it lost $3 million last  year -- has forced Citadel to take a longer, harder look. New thrift  legislation working its way through Congress has also given Citadel pause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inherited Problems  </P> <P> Kane also inherits some problems at Citadel. The thrift's profit fell 3% in  1987 and 15% last year, and it "will be substantially lower" in 1989 because of  the recent rise in interest rates, Kane said.  </P> <P> Kane said the interest-rate increases are occurring much faster than Citadel  can successfully boost the interest rate that it charges on home mortgages.  Most of Citadel's mortgages have adjustable rates that change with market  conditions, but those ARMs are tied to an interest-rate index whose changes lag  those of money-market rates, he said. As a result, the difference between  Citadel's interest income and its interest costs is rapidly narrowing, and so  is its profit.  </P> <P> In 1988, Citadel's earnings fell to $24.1 million from $28.2 million in 1987.  Last week, Citadel said its first-quarter 1989 profit tumbled 51% from a year  earlier, to $3 million from $6.1 million.  </P> <P> Citadel's return on average assets -- a key gauge of profitability because it  measures a thrift's performance relative to the assets at its disposal -- was  0.58% last year, well below the 1% ratio that is considered an excellent  showing. Citadel has plenty of company, though; the average ROA in California  last year was a mere 0.20%, according to Sheshunoff Information Services, a  financial research firm in Texas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stock Low  </P> <P> Citadel's stock, now at $36.50 a share on the American Stock Exchange, remains  35% below its level of three years ago. The stock also is 37% below Citadel's  book value per share, or its net worth, which is the amount of Citadel's assets  minus its liabilities.  </P> <P> Stocks trading well below book value in many industries are considered to be  bargains. However, these days many S&amp;Ls trade at discounts to book value  because investors are worried about the serious problems throughout the thrift  industry.  </P> <P> But analyst Gray said Citadel remains a bargain, particularly if interest rates  fall in the next three or four years, which would send Citadel's profit soaring  because of the S&amp;L's low-cost structure. Citadel's stock "looks like a  two-seater Mercedes convertible priced like a Ford Taurus with 40,000 miles on  it," Gray said.  </P> <P> Sutro's Wilson agreed that when interest rates finally turn down, Citadel "will  be benefiting more than others" because its overhead costs amounted to a mere  1.16% of its assets at year-end 1988 -- the second lowest among the 20 West  Coast S&amp;Ls that he follows. Only Golden West Financial, a perennial  low-cost operator, had a lower ratio at 1.14%, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loan Portfolio  </P> <P> Citadel's loan portfolio is also relatively strong. Its repossessed real estate  -- indicating Citadel loans that went sour -- totaled 0.4% of its total assets  at year-end 1988, compared with an average 0.7% for California thrifts and 1.8%  nationwide.  </P> <P> Citadel's "non-performing assets," which include the repossessions and existing  loans 90 days past due, fell to 0.74% of assets at year-end from 1.03% two  years earlier. That drop came even as Citadel's assets jumped 42% in the past  two years. "Our savings and loan business, in my judgment, is second to none  among our peers," Kane said.  </P> <P> There is a perception by some analysts that Kane is sharing power with James J.  Cotter, a Los Angeles investor with a hand in many companies, including  Citadel. Cotter is a former Citadel director and chairman of Craig Corp., whose  holdings include an 8.5% stake in Citadel and control of the Stater Bros.  grocery chain. Cotter also is a partner of Hecco Ventures, an investment  partnership that owns 9% of Citadel and about 10% of Valley Federal. Kane  serves as Craig's president.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proxy Fight  </P> <P> Cotter left Citadel's board last year after winning a bitter proxy fight to  gain a seat on Valley Federal's board of directors and has urged Valley  Federal's sale to Citadel or another party.  </P> <P> Wilson said Kane's election as Citadel's chairman means "Cotter is in charge"  at Citadel.  </P> <P> Cotter did not return telephone calls requesting comment.  </P> <P> Citadel remains a closely held company. About 60% of Citadel's stock is owned  by half a dozen big investors, including Tucson Electric Power, which owns 20%;  Hecco and Craig, and the group has "a hand in directing our philosophy," Kane  said. That philosophy calls for Citadel to keep growing with the help of  acquisitions -- even if the Valley Federal deal falls through.  </P> <P> Recently Citadel has gone shopping but its purchases have been small. Citadel  has agreed to buy tiny Rancho Bernardo Savings ($130 million in assets) as a  first step into the San Diego market, and has bought several branch offices  from other S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Citadel is also considering providing customers with expanded investment and  insurance services, and may sell more of its mortgage loans to investors to  generate more earnings.  </P> <P> But the Valley Federal matter likely will be Kane's first big test. "The  economics are there, the synergies are there" for a successful merger, he said.  The deal will depend on whether Citadel gets there with the right offer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPARING S&amp;L STOCK PRICES AND BOOK VALUES  </P> <P> Below are the per-share stock prices of various California S&amp;Ls as a  percentage of their book values per share. Book value is the amount of a  thrift's assets less its liabilities, or its net worth. Investors often use the  stock-book value ratio to gauge whether the stock is a bargain or overpriced.  It's often thought that a stock trading below its book value falls into the  bargain category. But as the chart shows, these days many S&amp;Ls trade at  discounts to book value, in large part because investors are worried about the  nationwide S&amp;L crisis.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.42IN:2.22IN:2.33IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock Price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Book Value  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock Price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> as % of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> S&amp;L  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> as of 3/31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> as of 5/5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> BookValue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Citadel Holding  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $57.70  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $36.50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 63%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (parent of Fidelity Federal)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Valley Federal  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $18.20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $9.25  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 51%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Glenfed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $37.80  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $19.25  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 51%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (parent of Glendale Federal)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Calfed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $55.35  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $22.125  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (parent of California Federal)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> H.F.

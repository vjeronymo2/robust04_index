			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Recovery is in place, but taking its time: Productivity-led growth likely for US TWICE in the past two years US economic recoveries have lost momentum in spite of promising signs of faster growth. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that president-elect Bill Clinton is treating the latest evidence of an upturn with caution. Few forecasters doubt that the US has emerged from recession: gross domestic product has grown every quarter since the spring of last year. The debate centres on whether the economy is at last emerging from a prolonged bout of stagnation that encompassed almost the entire Bush presidency. Real GDP growth has averaged less than 1 per cent a year since 1989. Even if the faltering upturn that began in May 1991 is taken as the starting point, growth has averaged less than 2 per cent, or about a third the pace normal in the early stages of US recoveries. Revised figures indicating growth at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the third quarter and a flurry of encouraging short-term indicators - such as recent jumps in consumer confidence, factory orders, and the Purchasing Managers' Index - have prompted speculation that the economy is now moving up a gear. Some of the structural drags on growth do seem to be easing. Lower interest rates and repayment of old debts have reduced the fraction of personal and corporate income absorbed by debt service, allowing both sectors to spend a little more freely. Real corporate profits were up by nearly a quarter in the third quarter relative to the same period last year, reflecting, in part, faster growth of productivity than wages. Mr David Hale, chief economist at the Kemper group in Chicago, points out that bank profitability and capital ratios have also strengthened sharply, allowing an easing of the 'credit crunch'. There is anecdotal evidence, he claims, of an upturn in bank loans to small and medium-sized companies - the sector responsible for the bulk of job creation in the 1980s. But the improvement is recent and modest; and growth is likely to be restrained by other structural weaknesses. 'There are too many drags on the economy for a normal recovery to occur,' say Roger Brinner and David Wyss, economists at DRI/McGraw Hill, the forecasting group. They fear that defence cuts will hold back recovery in many regions: defence spending as a share of federal expenditure is projected to fall from 27 per cent last year to 17 per cent in 1995. They predict continuing softness of commercial real estate owing to chronic overbuilding in the 1980s. And, like most other forecasters, they are pessimistic about US exports, one of the main engines of recent growth. Demand is slowing in many important markets, including Europe, the Far East and Mexico. But with domestic consumption accounting for two-thirds of economic activity, the spending proclivities of the US consumer will dominate the economic outlook. In the third quarter, consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent, and retailers are predicting a merrier Christmas than in 1990 or 1991. Yet doubts persist about the sustainability of personal spending. The savings rate fell sharply in the third quarter to 4.5 per cent, against 5.3 per cent in the second quarter. A further decline seems improbable. Consumption will thus be determined by growth of incomes. And the perceived stumbling here is the continued sluggish pace of job creation. Last Friday the Labour Department reported the fifth consecutive monthly decline in the unemployment rate, to 7.2 per cent. Weekly figures for state unemployment insurance claims have also moved down in recent months. But most of the fall in unemployment since the summer reflects a contraction of the labour force rather than new job creation. Private-sector employment has been roughly flat since the spring of last year, in stark contrast to previous recoveries. 'The economy is probably still tracking the 1.5-2.5 per cent growth pace of the past year,' concludes Mr Paul Mastroddi, a senior economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank. In keeping with most forecasters, however, he predicts a gradual acceleration of growth to 3 per cent or more in the second half of next year. The possibility of a faster recovery should not be ruled out: once consumer and business confidence returns, the US economy has a habit of snapping back faster than expected. But the likeliest prospect is the kind of steady, productivity-driven recovery experienced by European economies in the 1980s. In such recoveries, unemployment tends to stay relatively high. Such a recovery would suit Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who hopes to make further progress towards stable prices in his second term. With inflation only just beginning to dip below 3 per cent, the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates again and could raise them in the second half of next year. For Mr Clinton's economic team, however, the figures pose a dilemma. The recovery is strong enough to make anything more than a token fiscal stimulus next year look risky. Yet it may be too sluggish to convince most Americans that he has turned the economy around. How Mr Clinton resolves this dilemma will be the first big economic test of his presidency.</p>

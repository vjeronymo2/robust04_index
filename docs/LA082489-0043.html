			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CUCCIA TAKES HELM AT POLY  </P> <P> Fred Cuccia officially was installed Wednesday as the new football coach at  Poly High. He replaces Kevin Kennedy, who resigned last week after three years  as coach to become an assistant at L. A. Southwest College.  </P> <P> Cuccia, who formerly coached at La Puente, Hoover and South Pasadena highs, met  with the Poly players for the first time Wednesday and introduced John Alaimo  as an assistant coach. Alaimo, 22, played quarterback for Cuccia at Hoover and  will serve as a walk-on coach this season.  </P> <P> Cuccia was recommended for the job by Athletic Director George Tideback last  week and gained the approval of Principal Virginia Holt on Tuesday. He was  officially hired Wednesday by the L. A. Unified School District and will teach  either English or physical education.  </P> <P> B.J. Usher of Calabasas shot a two-over-par 38 Wednesday to win the  11-and-under division of the La Purisima Junior Invitational in Lompoc by 13  strokes.  </P> <P> Usher, 11, the 1989 L.A. City Champion in his division, has won 24 of 36  tournaments he has competed in this year. He placed second in seven others and  third twice. Last year, he was selected Southern California Golfer of the Year  in his division by the Southern California Junior Golf Assn.  </P> <P> Kris Kirksey, the Camarillo High tailback who rushed for 670 yards in six games  last season as a sophomore, said that there is an "85% chance" he would be in  the Scorpions' backfield when the season opens Sept. 8.  </P> <P> Kirksey tore a ligament in his right knee and subsequently missed Camarillo's  final five games. He spent the summer in rehabilitation but has yet to practice  with the team. A brace designed to stabilize his knee is expected to arrive  today.  </P> <P> "I feel stronger in both legs than I ever have before," Kirksey said. "I'm in  great health right now."  </P> <P> Whether the knee will stand up to the rigors of Camarillo's running game  remains a question, but Kirksey's desire to play does not.  </P> <P> "Mentally," he said, "I'm looking forward to playing this season more than I  ever have before."  </P> <P> Kirksey, heeding doctors' advice, opted against surgery.  </P> <P> Former Poly High standout Craig Ellis caught two touchdown passes Wednesday  night, leading the Edmonton Eskimos to a 37-14 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats  in a match-up of Canadian Football League division leaders in Edmonton.  </P> <P> Keith Wright, an All-Western Football Conference selection with Cal State  Northridge in 1987, led Edmonton (6-1) with four catches for 28 yards.  </P> <P> Ellis has 34 receptions this season, tying him for third in the CFL with  Toronto's Darrell K. Smith.  </P></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Exxon and Shell in Dollars 3bn gas venture ROYAL Dutch Shell and Exxon have agreed a joint venture with Japan's Mitsubishi and Venezuela's national oil company for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) gas project in eastern Venezuela. The Christopher Columbus project, which has been under discussion for three years, involves gas production from offshore fields near Venezuela's Paria peninsula. The joint venture partners also plan to build a gas processing plant onshore with the aim of exporting around 700m cu ft per day of liquefied natural gas, mainly to the US, by the end of the decade. The project is one of the largest ever undertaken by Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA, and is the first time foreign companies will be allowed to invest in Venezuela's natural gas sector since the industry was nationalised in the 1970s. The agreement signed in Caracas yesterday committed the joint venture partners to invest about Dollars 200m over the next two years on preliminary development work. It also settled differences between the partners over access to Shell's technology to be used in the liquefaction process, which had held up the three-year-long negotiations. Lagoven, one of the operating units of PDVSA, initially estimated that the total cost of the project would run to Dollars 3bn, although the partners have not revealed any official forecasts. Some observers expect it to cost much more. A Dollars 30m feasibility study and initial geological surveys indicated that the area contained around 15bn cu ft of gas in four fields. There are still some questions which must be resolved. The partners want taxes applied to the project, to be set at the maximum corporate rate, not at the rate used for most activities in the petroleum and natural gas industries, which reaches over 65 per cent. In addition, the Venezuelan Congress must approve the terms of partnership and the commercial association to develop the gas fields.</p>

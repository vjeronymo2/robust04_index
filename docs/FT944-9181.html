			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (8): In place of redundancy - Leave-from-work schemes are saving jobs It sounds like a trade unionist's dream: to prevent dozens of redundancies by putting workers on a rota of state-subsidised extra holiday. But for Copenhagen bus drivers the dream became reality this year, thanks to the government's leave-from-work schemes designed to cut unemployment and promote job-sharing. When the local bus drivers' union faced a cut of several hundred drivers from the 2,500-strong municipal force, because of privatisation, it adopted a system already worked out by a fellow union in the rubbish-collection sector. Exploiting a programme allowing workers to take up to a year in sabbatical leave - backed by generous state benefits while absent - the bus drivers' union worked out a scheme by which its members could take off one week in every nine on a rotation basis, thus cutting down the numbers of workers who had to be dismissed. As a result, some 75 jobs were saved. And each driver participating in the scheme has won six weeks of extra holiday a year, on top of their normal paid holiday allowances. While on the extra time-off, each driver gets 80 per cent of the maximum Danish unemployment benefit allowance - which works out at about DKr2,000 a week before tax. 'I think this is a very good model for helping to break the unemployment curve by slowly reducing working time,' says Mr Bjarne Hansen, of the Copenhagen bus drivers' union. He adds: 'Bus drivers are going to Poland, to Paris and to London on their week off. It is very nice, people really like it.' There are, however, mounting voices among employers and right-of-centre opposition parties, arguing that the leave-from-work schemes are an expensive and ineffective way of combatting unemployment. They warn that the programmes, which have proved more popular than anticipated since they were introduced two years ago, threaten to cause disruptive shortages of skilled workers in certain areas of the economy. The sabbatical leave programme exploited by the bus drivers is, in fact, the least popular of the three leave schemes. Most periods of leave are being taken under the parental leave and training leave programmes. Parents of children up to the age of eight years may each take up to a year off work for each child, separately or together, while receiving 80 per cent of the maximum unemployment benefit. Under the training scheme, an employee can take up to one year to undergo work-related education at 100 per cent of the maximum unemployment benefit. Under an easing of the rules recently, employers were relieved of the obligation to take on replacement workers. The government estimated that 20,000 people would take advantage of the three schemes this year. But demand has soared to the point where 76,000 are now on leave, and almost as many again are expected to have applications approved in the course of the year. Of those currently on leave, 45,000 are on parental leave and 25,000 are on training leave. The vast majority (90 per cent in the case of parental leave) are women. Most are in the public sector. Oddly, almost half the leave-takers are unemployed. They are entitled to take advantage of the schemes, an attractive option because, in effect, taking leave extends the period during which a jobless person is eligible for full unemployment benefits. Most controversial has been the rush by nurses to take advantage of parental leave. Up to 3,000 of the country's 45,000 nurses are on leave, forcing the health service to look abroad - mainly to Sweden and the Netherlands - to make up the shortages. Mr Poul Erik Petersen, head of the Danish Employers Association, says the case of the nurses illustrates the danger of the leave-from-work scheme. He says it can lead to serious bottlenecks in the labour market, which could begin to feed inflation into the economy rather than tackle unemployment which, though statistically, reduced by the schemes is in real terms little changed. He says skill shortages are also showing up in the furniture and construction industries. 'The nurses' union is now seeking a 15 per cent wage increase - they realise how the market economy works,' he says. 'There is a danger that this can spread to the whole economy.' The government rejects these fears as being overstated. It is reviewing the schemes with a view at least to reducing the level of benefits available to the users of parental and sabbatical leave. But its commitment to leave for training is solid, as this is a fundamental to its strategy of tackling unemployment by increasing skill levels in the economy.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Uncertainty about how much Customs knew THE COLLAPSE of the Matrix Churchill case raises questions about the co-operation between Customs and Excise and other government departments over the prosecution. In particular, it remains unclear to what extent Customs was aware of the 'dirty washing' that would emerge from Whitehall before mounting the prosecution. Customs has had an independence since its early days of catching smugglers on Cornish beaches. It is accountable only to the Treasury and able to bring cases to court without reference to the director of public prosecutions. The Matrix Churchill prosecution, some argue, is a demonstration of that independence, as Customs pressed on with its case regardless of the embarrassment caused to other government departments. But defendants and others have questioned whether Customs was fully in the picture. The official Customs explanation for the trial collapsing remains that inconsistencies in evidence given by Mr Alan Clark before the trial and then in the witness box meant the prosecution no longer had a case against the three men from Matrix Churchill. Its officials argue that the courtroom revelations - that ministers knew from late 1987 onwards that the exports were for military use but approved them to protect intelligence sources - were irrelevant to their case. The prosecution failed on the one point only - the inconsistencies of Mr Clark's evidence. Others consider this view disingenuous. They argue that the case fell apart as soon as evidence was produced showing ministers knew the exports were for military use in 1987. In June 1990, when Customs began its investigation after being tipped off by its West German counterpart, the reaction from other parts of Whitehall - particularly in the Department of Trade and Industry - was nervous. The 'dirty washing' memo was only one indication of the sensitivity of the subject. Customs yesterday insisted it had received full co-operation from other departments and that all relevant documents had been produced. But it could not confirm that the 500 documents which formed the basis of the defence case had been shown to officials before September this year.</p>

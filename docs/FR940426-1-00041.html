			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments and additions to the regulations on the subject of exclusion follow a framework which ATF believes is consistent with the statutory interpretation of exclusion adopted by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  court as well as similar concerns previously raised in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foremost Sales Promotions, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  860 F.2d 229 (7th Cir. 1988) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foremost <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The courts in both  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foremost <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  found that ``exclusion'' as used in the FAA Act cannot occur without a relationship or arrangement between the industry member and the retailer which directly or indirectly threatens the retailer's independence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF proposes to amend regulatory parts of title 27 CFR relating to exclusive outlet (part 8), tied-house (part 6), and commercial bribery (part 10), by adding new subparts on exclusion. Even though the exclusive outlet provision was not involved in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foremost <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decisions, the provision is impacted by the decisions since the provision requires the showing of exclusion in order for a violation to arise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF proposes to describe exclusion, in whole or in part, of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages sold or offered for sale by others as occurring (1) when a practice places retailer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry control over the retailer, and (2) such a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, results in the retailer purchasing less that it otherwise would have of a competitor's product. The proposed regulations will contain a set of criteria by which ATF will determine the existence of the first element. These criteria include the duration of the practice or promotion, the degree to which a practice involves an industry member in the day-to-day operations of a retailer, and, in some cases, the non-discrimination feature of the practice where it is available to all retailers. Exclusion will exist when ATF can establish the presence of both of these elements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, ATF proposes to identify certain practices which it believes, by their very existence, place retailer independence at risk. When such practices are undertaken, ATF would determine through the course of an investigation whether the other exclusionary element set forth above is present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, ATF proposes to revise and consolidate several of the provisions contained in Subpart D of Part 6 of the current regulations which find that certain practices will not result in exclusion under the FAA Act (that is, safe harbors). The classification of these practices is intended to provide guidance to the regulated industry so that legitimate product marketing programs can be developed without the uncertainty of a potential Federal enforcement action. Legitimate product marketing encourages competition, by large and small businesses alike, on the basis of price, product quality and service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF emphasizes that the revision of the trade practices regulations is an ongoing process. Any interested person may petition for a rule change, under 27 CFR 71.41(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusive Outlet <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 105(a) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or otherwise, any retailer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such product from such person to the exclusion in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided one of the three interstate or foreign commerce jurisdictional clauses is met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Retailer independence is threatened in an exclusive outlet arrangement when the ability of the retailer to decide which brands of alcoholic beverages to purchase is restricted or impeded. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  context, the question is whether any restriction negates the retailer's free economic choice or has been imposed by the industry member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In that regard, the proposed regulations identify two practices that clearly result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act. The first practice involves purchases of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages by a retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member. The second practice involves contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another industry member. In both situations, exclusion of a competitor's products results directly from the arrangement or the contract without any action by the retailer. Further, ATF views an exclusive outlet arrangement as including a situation where the retailer offers exclusivity privileges and the industry member accepts that offer. In other words, it does not matter whether the requirement originates with the industry member or the retailer; rather, the requirement is within the exclusive outlet prohibition so long as it is part of the bargain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Tied-House <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 105(b) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to induce through any of the following means, any retailer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such products from such person to the exclusion in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided one of the three jurisdictional clauses is met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) By acquiring or holding any interest in any license with respect to the premises of the retailer; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

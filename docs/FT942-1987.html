			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Rail union to press ahead with two more strikes The RMT rail union plans to follow today's strike of signalling staff with two more 24-hour stoppages in the next two weeks. 'My union has no alternative but to continue the action,' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday after the failure of late night talks to resolve the conflict. He said signalling staff would strike again on June 29 and on July 6. British Rail said last night it hoped to run twice as many trains today as it did during last Wednesday's 24-hour strike but most of the network will still be severely disrupted. 'I hope the public will recognise that the responsibility lies firmly with the government and Railtrack, the employers,' Mr Knapp said. Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the company which owns the track, signals and stations of Britain's rail network, warned that new strikes would damage modernisation plans. He urged the RMT to reconsider its rejection of Railtrack's productivity based pay offer. 'This strike will harm the industry and our customers and will inconvenience passengers and damage British business,' he said. 'Every day the network is closed by strike action we are losing income that could contribute to future investment. We have offered a restructuring package which recognises the importance of the signalmen to the rail industry and which is about restructuring this industry to meet the needs of the modern railway.' But Mr Knapp said Railtrack had refused 'to address the grievances of signalling staff'. He added: 'There is a danger in this dispute of losing sight of the issue. This is RMT's claim for a payment to recognise past productivity.' In the House of Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, sought to exploit Labour's refusal to condemn the strike by labelling Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting opposition leader, 'the strikers' friend'. Mrs Beckett said it was 'crystal clear' that the strike had been caused by government interference in negotiations between Railtrack and the rail union. Mr Major repeatedly denied that his office had played any part in the pay negotiations, which were a matter for Railtrack and the RMT. But he confirmed that Ms Jill Rutter of the Downing Street policy unit had attended a meeting on Friday between Railtrack and Transport Department officials. A senior Downing Street official said it was 'normal practice' for policy unit officials to attend such meetings 'to keep the prime minister informed'.

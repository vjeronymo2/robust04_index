			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Openness on open markets Monopolies thrive on secrecy. One of the best ways of combating them is to expose them to the full glare of public scrutiny. In the US, they call this 'sunshine regulation'. But most competition authorities do not practise sunshine regulation. They prefer to conduct their investigations behind closed doors. Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission is perhaps not the main culprit. Its independence from government and its habit of publishing detailed reports setting out the conclusions of its inquiries certainly compare favourably with the European Commission. The drawbacks of the European Union's approach were amply demonstrated earlier this week when the full Commission failed to back a proposal by Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, to block a three-way steel tube merger on grounds that it was anti-competitive. Not for the first time, political considerations overruled consumers' interests. The case for an independent European cartel office now seems unanswerable. But independence alone does not guarantee openness. For example, it has not prevented the Commission from being a black box. Until an investigation is completed and recommendations published, the Commission operates a system of strict purdah. This allows a monopolist to put a spin on the facts while other interested parties, which might be able to rebut its position, are kept in the dark. Mr Graeme Odgers, the MMC chairman, yesterday acknowledged the importance of regulatory openness. That is also one of the conclusions of an unpublished review of the Commission by Department of Trade and Industry consultants. But, beyond releasing a new video, which explains the MMC's workings by taking viewers through a mock investigation, Mr Odgers had little to offer by way of remedy. In particular, he rejected the idea of holding open hearings or publishing the Commission's preliminary findings. This is a pity. A video of a mock investigation is no substitute for public hearings. Nor is the publication of a detailed final report any substitute for public access to the Commission's preliminary findings. Once the final report is published, it is too late for the views of interested parties to have any effect. Mr Odgers defended the Commission's behind-closed-doors approach on the grounds that much of the information revealed in its investigations is commercially confidential. Confidentiality is certainly an issue. But it is not clear why it cannot be protected by holding selected hearings in private instead of having a blanket in camera approach. Nor is Mr Odgers' argument that public hearings would encourage participants to play to the gallery compelling. It assumes that the public cannot form a view of what is in its interest. The Commission's motto should be less black box and more sunshine.</p>

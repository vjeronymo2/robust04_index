			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Have the Authorities Played </F> Down the Problem?"]    [Text] Following the arrest of Mithat Emini, former  secretary of the Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP] and one  of the party's founders and most influential figures, on charges  of associating with the intent to pursue hostile activities  against the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia,  accused of being the supreme commander and ideologist of the  Albanian paramilitary army in Macedonia, the whole affair on the  creation of paramilitary formations discovered at the beginning  of November is now being reassessed in terms of what was  (official) cognition. A new analysis is under way.    The affair was discovered by the press and it was just two  days later that the authorities -- the Interior Ministry and  Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski -- issued public  statements. They announced that on 5, 6, 7, and 8 November  eight Macedonian citizens had been arrested and charged with  criminal activity. From the end of 1991 to the present they had  created armed formations and arranged the purchase and illegal  entry of arms, explosives, ammunition, and other military  equipment in cooperation with institutions and services of  foreign countries.  <H5>  November's Dilemmas </H5>   Minister Frckovski reported that the Interior Ministry's  action was the result of a two-year operation following the  independence of Macedonia. During this period some smaller and  some larger groups had been detected smuggling arms with the aim  of overthrowing the constitutional order of Macedonia. In the  end, eight people were arrested, while three foreign nationals  escaped. It had been planned to recruit 20,000 recruits. The  arrested group did not have direct links with any of the  political parties, and, according to information from the  Interior Ministry, Frckovski said there were no grounds for  linking the group with a political party. One of those  arrested, Deputy Defense Minister Hisen Haskaj, "appeared to be  a citizen having individual activities in this matter or with an  activity in liaison with the arrested group." The minister  stated that there was no evidence of involvement of any other  person from government structures, thus denying reports about a  direct link between the group and the PDP when asked about the  involvement of the deputy health minister Imer Imeri.    Different interpretations of events began to circulate in  public. The VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization- Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]  said it was not merely an ordinary case of arms smuggling,  emphasizing that the paramilitary formation was under the direct  leadership of the PDP, and was controlled and headed by the  Albanian Government and its Defense Ministry. The other  opposition parties reacted by saying that "a part of the  coalition is working against the state"; asking for the  "dissolution of the coalition"; arguing that the "national key  resulted in unskilled professionals"; and calling the whole  affair a "fiasco of the authorities." They also called for the  PDP and NDP [National Democratic Party] to be banned. The  temperature in the public was rising, albanophobia was  increasing. There were also some parties, however, that  appealed to reason, saying that "not all the Albanians should be  identified with the fascist nationalists and separatists" (the  nonparliamentarian associated political parties).    The PDP, that is, its delegate group, as its coordinator  Muhamed Halili stated, also looked at the situation from all  possible angles. The PDP delegates did not dissociate  themselves from the events, while the PDP center issued a  statement only a few days later. The PDP recalled the period of  the breaking-up of the Socialist Federated Republic of  Yugoslavia, the beginning of the wars, and the departure of the  Yugoslav National Army from Macedonia. "A vacuum was created in  the maintenance of the security of the citizens...vigilantes  appeared in inhabited areas, a model that became a thing of the  past after the formation of the Macedonian Army." The statement  reiterated the pleas of the PDP (for the Republic of Macedonia)  and revealed dissatisfaction with the fact that some of the  arrested were not given a chance to defend themselves. In fact,  the PDP did not react the way it was expected to.    Information obtained from "reliable sources" then began to  appear in the media. Mithat Emini and PDP President Nevzat  Halili were mentioned, the former as the commissioner of the  political organization of the All-Albanian Army Headquarters,  the latter as the one who approved the letters and documents  that fled to Albania. It was claimed that the whole undertaking  had logistical support from the top of the Albanian state --  President Sali Berisha, Prime Minister Alexander Meksi, and  Defense Minister Safet Zhulali. Bekir Zuta, then vice chairman  of the Macedonian Government, was mentioned as one of the  fundamental strategists of the paramilitary army. Many details  of the activities undertaken by the top figures of the  paramilitary army appeared.  <H5>  Serious Accusations </H5>   When Mithat Emini was arrested a week ago, when a couple of  days later a ten-person group was charged, the leading figure in  which was Emini, as "supreme commander," and when the text of  the indictment was "revealed" and published in the press, things  became clearer. However, this also called for a different  assessment from the one that was made three months ago.    Emini resigned from his position as party secretary three  weeks before the affair was discovered "for health reasons." He  gave no other explanation. What he left behind were statements  on peace and coexistence; he was publicly opposed to arming and  was an advocate for solving all problems and issues through  dialogue. He was considered a moderate and wise politician.  His party colleagues were of the same opinion, as were other  government authorities and foreign politicians, because he was  the key figure in government discussions with the mediation of  the international community. Can we associate his resignation  with the Interior Ministry action?    The fact that Emini was invited for a discussion by the  investigating judge and was then imprisoned raises the question  about the relationship between the Interior Ministry and the  District Court, because members of the Interior Ministry were  not involved in the arrest of the first defendant. Some sources  even tried to associate the resignation of the deputy secretary  of the Interior Ministry Pavle Trajanov with the Emini case.    Nevertheless, one of the defense lawyers believes that the  authorities were very prudent in carrying out their  investigation, trying to avoid any political pressures and  heating of the atmosphere among the Albanians, and postponing  Emini's arrest until the last minute.    The indictment raises serious charges against the defendant.  The text says there was a hostile association known as  "Headquarters for National Defense," designated to be the  commanding body. With the support and initiatives of the first  defendant, Mithat Emini, and on his orders, action was taken to  obtain technical equipment, computers were provided, and a  computer center was established where plans were prepared for  the personnel and recruitment of, as was mentioned, a  paramilitary force consisting of 20,000 recruits. Plans for the  formation of battalions and detachments were prepared (three  battalions for Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, and Gostivar  respectively, and one for Debar and Struga). Funds were  provided for the purchase of automatic rifles, and they had  bought 200 rifles from Albania. The documents of the  paramilitary army regarded the Macedonian Army and the  Macedonian Interior Ministry as enemies, and also the "orthodox  Slavs," and the intention was to solve the problem by force of  arms. With the cooperation of the former deputy defense  minister Hisen Haskaj a plan for the liquidation of the 14th  infantry brigade and of other commands and units of the  Macedonian Army was prepared. In the documents, there was also  a formulation about national defense in the framework of  territorial autonomy by the name of "Ilirida."    Ultimately we can question the way the political authorities  acted, because it seems that, either because of the procedures  of the investigation, or for the sake of maintaining peace, it  did its best to play down the dimensions and nature of the  activities undertaken by a group of Albanians, which included a  number of prominent PDP members. The question related to the  PDP is why it never broke the liaison with the case and why it  did not dissociate itself from the paramilitary organization, in  principle. Ultimately, as a participant in the government, the  PDP must tidy up its ranks. What is often heard nowadays is  definitely not true -- that none of the PDP members, or none of  the Albanians, regard Macedonia as their own state, and that  they all think of forming the so-called "Ilirida" and of joining  Albania (so-called Greater Albania).    Therefore, there is yet another test for the state to pass,  as well as its leadership, its authorities, and also the  citizens of Macedonia themselves. And of course, the court must  complete its work regardless of and without any political  pressure. There is no doubt we must await its last word before  we start making judgments and disqualifications.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  Emini Does Not Confess </H5>   Our editorial staff has obtained the text of the statement  made by the first defendant Mithat Emini. It is taken from the  indictment against Emini, and reads as follows:    "The defendant Mithat Emini did not confess the offences he  was accused of by the investigating judge. He defended himself  and justified his actions, placing them in the context of the  period when the wars started on the territory of former  Yugoslavia, when there was a threat to Macedonia's sovereignty,  and therefore also to the Albanians living in Macedonia. His  defense was based on the justification that whatever he had  undertaken and done was done to prevent bloodshed and secure  peaceful coexistence for all citizens in Macedonia. Defendant  Mithat Emini denied all statements made by the defendants who  mentioned him in their testimonies, and he did not accept the  written documentation prepared regarding the event, because  everything was done without his knowledge."</p>

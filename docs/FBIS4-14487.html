			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ivan Mashkivskiy, head of Russian </F> Main Inspectorate for Civil Aviation Flight Safety and deputy  director of the Air Transport Department, by Ruslan Ignatyev;  date, place not given: "Stop Press: Was Terrorism Cause of  A-310 Crash?..."]    [Text] Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent has  learned that the Air Transport Department has received a copy of  a tape recording of the crew's conversation during the tragic  flight. The specialists who decoded the so-called "black boxes"  at a Paris laboratory allegedly returned to the idea that the  A-310 crash near the city of Mezhdurechensk was caused by an act  of terrorism. They have rejected the hypothesis that the  aircraft depressurized during the flight....    Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent spoke over the  telephone with Ivan Mashkivskiy, head of the Russian Federation  Main Inspectorate for Civil Aviation Flight Safety and deputy  director of the Air Transport Department, who is in charge of  the technical commission studying the cause of the tragedy, and  asked him to comment on the information that he has received.    [Ignatyev] Ivan Yefremovich, you have evidently already done  some work to find out the causes and circumstances behind the  crash and can probably shed some light on the situation.    [Mashkivskiy] Our commission has indeed conducted a  preliminary investigation at the crash site. But we first took  the engines, some aircraft components, all the computer  equipment, computers, fragments, and parts of the fuselage to  Novokuznetsk Airport and laid them out in a definite order on  the airfield. Specialists carefully inspected everything and  drew some conclusions.    [Ignatyev] Can you confirm that the disaster was caused by  an act of terrorism?    [Mashkivskiy] Let me be blunt and say that we have not found  confirmation of that. The only thing that I can say now is that  the aircraft hit the ground in a flying position [v poletnom  polozhenii]. That is, all the flaps were retracted, the landing  gear was in the appropriate position, the engines were running  until the last moment [rabotali do kontsa], and the plane was  banking at an angle of 30 degrees. We also have other  information. But it is too early to talk about that. We will  receive the decoding of the special instruments -- the "black  boxes" -- in a few days and we will check the information that  we receive from Paris against our own information and only then  produce our final findings. In a word, there is still a great  deal of work to be done to find out the real cause of the  accident.    [Ignatyev] Is any work under way at the scene of the crash?    [Mashkivskiy] No. We had to stop all the searches 30 March  because flooding cut off our route to the crash site. Rescue  personnel and other services managed to remove the fuselage and  parts of the aircraft in good time. Relatives of the dead have  been allowed to visit the scene of the tragedy. They were taken  there by helicopter. The whole area is strewn with flowers....  [Mashkivskiy ends]    A civil memorial service for the crew of the A-310 who  perished in the disaster was held yesterday in Moscow at  Sheremetyevo Airport. The crew's remains were brought from  Novokuznetsk. Relatives of the foreign passengers who died in  the tragedy have flown to Moscow. They have to identify the  bodies.</p>

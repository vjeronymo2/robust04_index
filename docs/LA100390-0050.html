			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ALPINE  </P> <P> A 30-year-old man was in serious condition Tuesday at Sharp Memorial Hospital  after being shot by a sheriff's deputy Monday night on the Viejas Indian  Reservation, deputies said.  </P> <P> Keith Grijalva was shot once in his abdomen by Deputy Michael Tverberg during a  family disturbance call on Viejas Grade Road, a Sheriff's Department spokesman  said.  </P> <P> The incident occurred at Grijalva's residence on the reservation, about three  miles east of Alpine.  </P> <P> Tverberg and two other deputies responding to the call at 6:30 p.m. Monday were  told that an intoxicated man with weapons was threatening to shoot a woman in  the home, the spokesman said. Tverberg established voice contact with Grijalva,  who was verbally abusive and told Tverberg he had already killed Beverly Jane  Cantwell, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Tverberg forcibly entered the home and Grijalva reacted in a way that made the  officer fear for his safety and he fired one shot, the spokesman said. Grijalva  was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Cantwell apparently had fled to a nearby residence prior to the deputies  arrival, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Other details of the shooting were not available and an investigation is  continuing, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

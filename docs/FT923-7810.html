			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Pressure builds on opera chief - Off the Wall IS THERE a conspiracy to oust Jeremy Isaacs as director-general of the Royal Opera House ? The evidence is impressive. In the past few weeks there have been three leaks to the media, all of them light on fact but all calculated to undermine his position as the Covent Garden board prepares to consider his re-appointment. The first emphasised the personal antagonism between the rumbustuous Isaacs and his equally robust paymaster, David Mellor, the heritage minister. The report was denied vigorously, especially by Mellor. Then there was the floater that the government wanted to close down Covent Garden and the English National Opera and build a new opera house on the South Bank. Since the suggested site was impossible, the cost laughable and the outcry fast and furious, the only result of the story was to hinder badly the rebuilding plans of both opera houses. Then this week, the committee led by Lady Warnock - which is investigating, for the Arts Council, the running of Covent Garden - was said to have produced a report stating that the opera house was run 'with incredible amateurism' and that 'the only thing to do is to shut it down and start again.' Since the Warnock report has yet to be written, and will not go into personalities, its widely-publicised phoney details merely gave the 'Isaacs must go' bandwagon another push. So where did the canard come from ? The Warnock committee is drawn from the Great and the Good and members do not look at all like leakers. The Arts Council is the obvious alternative. It sometimes thinks out loud about what it could do with the money - Pounds 18.9m this year - it gives its largest and most troublesome client. The council, however, is still a conscientious English quango which tends to be reactive rather than active. Its chairman, Lord Palumbo, has never shown that degree of interest in Covent Garden. As for Mr Mellor, although he loves putting rockets under established institutions and would not lift too many fingers to save Isaacs, he hardly has the time, energy or small-mindedness to organise a coup. Perhaps the biggest argument against a vendetta is that Sir Angus Stirling, chairman of the Covent Garden board, does not believe one exists. 'We are a goldfish bowl,' he says. 'The media love speculating about us.' But there can be a crisis without a conspiracy, a ground swell of hostility which encourages rumour. There are many in the arts establishment who are fed up with Covent Garden. The other Big Three - the RSC, the National Theatre and the ENO - seem to have sorted themselves out, but Covent Garden lurches from one cash shortfall to another. Isaacs, pugnacious and verbally unrestrained, naturally attracts criticism. He is the bear to be baited and his position is becoming intolerable. He is ordered by the Arts Council to clear his Pounds 3m deficit; he can do this only by putting up seat prices. This then draws the wrath of Mellor, who wants Covent Garden to be more accessible. His new productions are torn apart and his programming compared unfavourably with the ENO; but when, this year, he notches up a string of critical successes, he is upbraided for not being popular enough in his repertoire. The high attendance figures for Covent Garden, even though below target this season because of the recession, invariably are ignored. Everyone agrees the basic problem: Covent Garden is under-funded. If it received as much subsidy as equivalent European opera houses, its travails would disappear from the headlines. But there are other, less important, problems which it could remedy. It could be more charming to sponsors and potential sponsors; it is not surprising that it has attracted no corporate backers for its 1992-93 new productions. It should have grasped the nettle of the unions years ago: it failed to implement the labour savings suggested in the Priestley report, and the Warnock report will not allow it to forget that. Isaacs' management style often seems off-the-wall, which can provoke unnecessary conflict. If there is a strike this year over the Garden's projected pay freeze, it could be interpreted as a sign of past weakness rather than present resoluteness. And, of course, there is the question of timing. The real threat to the future of Covent Garden is the condition of its building. Its redevelopment plan just missed the last property boom and looks a dead duck. But the opera house needs renovation: indeed, so bad are conditions backstage that there is a danger it will be closed down as a safety risk. The Warnock report is likely to be critical but factual. It will arrive in September, at the same time as Covent Garden's own analysis commissioned from accountant Price Waterhouse. On the basis of both, the board will decide Isaacs' future. It could bluff it out and re-appoint him; the Arts Council would accept the situation. But the board must know that, if it did replace him, it might get more money on the lines of a new team and a new strategy. There could even be a government promise to underpin the redevelopment plan. Mellor undoubtedly wants Isaacs to go. But the possibility exists that, if there is a total re-think, the days of a high-profile impresario as director-general would be over. After all, the three companies - opera, ballet and Birmingham royal ballet - which share the Covent Garden subsidy all are run by their own artistic directors. Could the opera house perhaps get by with just a general manager, a super accountant who looks after the money while the creative trio deliver on stage? Of course, this is moonshine and, in practice, a figurehead would emerge. Since opera attracts most of the attention, it would almost certainly be Nicholas Payne, the much-lauded new director from Opera North who arrives (providentially) at Covent Garden next summer - just before Isaacs' contract expires. FOR ONE day last week you could hardly move at Sovereign, the exhibition at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum which provides a peep show of the Queen's home life. The screening the previous evening of the television programme Elizabeth II left more than 1,500 royalists panting for more. For a moment, the museum hoped that attendances were finally picking up at what has proved one of the more disappointing shows of recent years. The three sponsors - Pearson, Reed International and the Daily Telegraph - must have been hoping even harder that the cash tills would ring and their guarantee against loss, which eventually totalled Pounds 1.85m, would be scaled down. But when the money is counted, they seem reconciled to paying just under Pounds 1m for the privilege of backing Sovereign. The target was 2,000 admissions a day, but attendances are likely to average just over 1,000 when the exhibition closes on September 13.</p>

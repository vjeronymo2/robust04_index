			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KERSEE HOPES TO REPLACE DEVERS WITH A BALANCED UCLA TEAM  </P> <P> Bob Kersee, UCLA women's track coach, reasons that it takes the equivalent of  three athletes to replace Gail Devers.  </P> <P> Devers, an accomplished multi-event performer who led the Bruins to the Pacific  10 Conference championship the last two seasons and second place in the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet in 1988, has graduated.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Kersee expects a balanced team to make up for her absence.  </P> <P> Leading the team are sprinter-hurdler Janeene Vickers and weight event star  Kris Larson.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Vickers placed fourth in the 400-meter hurdles in the NCAA meet  and then anchored the 1,600-meter relay team to victory.  </P> <P> Larson won the javelin, discus and shotput in the USC dual meet last year and  placed fourth in the discus in the NCAA meet, one place behind teammate Tracie  Millett.  </P> <P> Other athletes with NCAA meet experience are relay runners Tonya Sedwick and  Caryl Smith, hurdler Nikki Williams and 1500-meter runner Laura Chapel.  </P> <P> Kersee has benefited from a good recruiting class, namely middle-distance  runners Jennifer Ashe and Kristi Bache, triple jumper Brooke Bartholomew and  half-miler LaMonica Smith.  </P> <P> Mike Bailey, first year USC coach who succeeded Fred LaPlante, now at Eastern  Michigan, has lost two top athletes, Wendy Brown and Yvette Bates.  </P> <P> Brown and Bates, the long- and triple-jump tandem, were mainly responsible for  USC's top-10 finishes in the NCAA meet the past three years. Brown was also the  1988 NCAA heptathlon champion and a member of the U.S. Olympic team.  </P> <P> The Trojans, however, will be bolstered by the return of Leslie Maxie, who  red-shirted last season while earning a place on the U.S. Olympic team in the  400-meter hurdles.  </P> <P> Among other athletes who figure to contribute are sprinters Michelle Taylor and  Louan Guialdo, hurdler Karen Koellner, high jumper Yleana Carrasco and Lesley  Noll, the school record-holder in the 800 at 2 minutes 3.30 seconds, and the  1,500 at 4:17.25.  </P> <P> Promising newcomers are hurdler Michelle DeCoux, a double winner last year at  the California high school state meet, and 800-1,500 runners Amy Goodwin,  Robbyn Bryant and Tracy Boudreau.

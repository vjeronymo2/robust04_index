			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs extend outside interests MR KENNETH Baker has used the nine months since he left the cabinet to become a non-executive director of one blue-chip British company and an adviser to two more. The new register of members' interests, published yesterday, reveals that the Conservative MP for the Surrey constituency of Mole Valley has joined the board of Hanson, the multinational conglomerate. A former minister for information technology, Mr Baker has also signed up as an adviser to Cable and Wireless - the communications group chaired by his former cabinet colleague Lord Young - and to ICL, the computer company. His entry in the new register indicates that he has further supplemented his portfolio of interests with directorships of Torrey Investments Inc and the UK-Japan 2000 Group. The register - which logs members' interests as at December 1 1992 - covers nine classes of interest including directorships, sponsorships and shareholdings as well as overseas visits where the cost has not been wholly borne by the member or public funds. Another former cabinet minister who has taken on a new outside interest is Mr Tom King, previously defence secretary, who has become a director of Electra Investment Trust. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, became chairman of the National House Building Council in June 1992. He continues to list a directorship of Group 4 Securitas, which manages Britain's first privately managed remand prison at Wolds in Humberside. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, has become a development adviser to the China Investment and Development Fund and to Kleinwort Benson China Management. The number of MPs who are Names at Lloyd's of London, the troubled insurance market, has fallen below 50, but still includes a number of ministers. Mr Robert Banks, Conservative MP for Harrogate, notes for the first time that he resigned from Lloyd's in 1989. Ms Jacqui Lait, Tory MP for Hastings and Rye, indicates that she resigned from the market in December 1991. Several MPs who have entered parliament since the last register was published have declared ties to prominent companies. Mr Barry Legg, Tory MP for Milton Keynes South West, is a consultant to Hillsdown Holdings, the food group in the news recently for paying to landscape a pond in the grounds of agriculture minister Mr John Gummer's country house. Others include Mr Bernard Jenkin (C Colchester North) who advises Legal and General, the insurance group; Mr Peter Ainsworth (C East Surrey) who is a consultant to SG Warburg Group; and Ms Judith Chaplin (C Newbury) who is a consultant to Kleinwort Benson Securities and parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, lists a trip to the Democratic party convention in New York in August last year, at which the visitors' programme was funded by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Among select committee chairmen, Sir Malcolm Thornton (education) has become parliamentary consultant to the Littlewoods Organisation, while Sir Jerry Wiggin (agriculture) continues to list consultancies to both British Sugar and Sears. Mrs Marion Roe (health) has visited the Seychelles and Angola to monitor elections. In June, MPs backed new procedures to ensure those elected to the chairmanships of Commons committees do not have business interests likely to conflict with their parliamentary duties. The register, which is available from HMSO, weighs in at 90 pages against 106 pages last January, and costs Pounds 1.35 less at Pounds 15.25.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / SANTA ANA CITY COUNCIL;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOR COUNCIL AS VARIED AS CITY ITSELF;  </P> <P> ELECTION: FOUR INCUMBENTS FACE CHALLENGERS WHO ARE BREAKING AWAY FROM THE IMAGE  OF TRADITIONAL POLITICIANS.  </P> <P> It is fitting that residents of Santa Ana -- the largest and most diverse city  in Orange County -- get to select from a varied group of challengers and  incumbents in this year's city election.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P> An automotive engineer with a passion for music is running against the mayor.  </P> <P> In one council race, a two-time challenger for the U.S. Senate is taking on the  youngest school board member ever elected in the city, as well as an incumbent  who is a high school teacher.  </P> <P> A Latina with a Cinderella background is going against an up-and-coming  attorney and the incumbent, a swap meet operator, in another council race.  </P> <P> In the third council race, a diminutive woman with a dramatic speaking style is  walking neighborhoods to snare votes from the incumbent, a muffler shop  employee who once fought City Hall.  </P> <P> "It's a new breed of people who are not tied to any special interest groups,"  said Rueben Martinez, former treasurer for the county's Democratic Party and an  observer of Santa Ana politics for 12 years. "They are knocking on doors and  talking about the city they care about."  </P> <P> There are three council seats and the mayor's seat up for reelection on Nov. 6.  Daniel H. Young faces one challenger for the two-year mayoral term, while three  incumbent council members battle five candidates for their seats. In Ward 6,  the southern portion of the city, Richards L. Norton has two challengers. In  central Santa Ana -- Ward 2, the oldest section of the city -- incumbent Ron  May has two opponents. And in Ward 4, the lower east side, Miguel Pulido has  one challenger.  </P> <P> With two months before the election, challengers and incumbents are testing the  political waters by finalizing campaign strategies and beginning their  door-to-door neighborhood walks.  </P> <P> Mayoral candidate Richard G. Moser is best known at City Hall for throwing a  birthday party for himself in August and inviting all the council members to  attend. He knows his chances are slim to win against Young, one of the most  visible politicians in Orange County. But Moser said he is trying,  nevertheless, because he believes that the issues of crime, homelessness and  eminent domain are not being addressed by the City Council. He has set a $1,000  spending limit, and in his statement, Moser posted his home phone number and  asked voters to call him.  </P> <P> The usually outspoken Young is taking a kid glove approach to his challenger.  Instead of knocking Moser, the mayor is concentrating on the need to revitalize  the city.  </P> <P> "There's no question that Santa Ana is going to have an opportunity to pick  people who are very different from each other this year," Young said. "They  won't have a problem in making distinctions."  </P> <P> Incumbent Norton, a swap meet operator, likes the idea of diverse candidates,  even though two of them are determined to take over his seat.  </P> <P> 'When I first ran, we always got the same kind of candidates from the Old  Guard, very traditional and very bureaucratic," Norton said. "Now everyone has  a shot at being on the council."  </P> <P> His challengers are Irene Martinez-Griffiths, president of the Mexican-American  Women's National Assn. of Orange County, and attorney Glenn Mondo, who  specializes in real estate cases.  </P> <P> Mondo has asked the attorney general's office to investigate whether Norton  broke a state law prohibiting elected officials from accepting discounts from  transportation companies. In July, Norton accepted an airline ticket upgrade  from coach to first class. Norton said he got the upgrade because a ticket  agent discovered that he and his wife were on their honeymoon trip.  </P> <P> Since taking office, Norton has found himself immersed in controversy. His own  wedding became a political dart because he had to return several gifts that  cost more than the $250 limit allowed by the city charter.  </P> <P> Mondo asserts that Norton has a "pattern" of saying he does not know he is  violating the law.  </P> <P> "Yes, it is funny sometimes, and somehow it seems it can't be all that  harmful," Mondo said. "But his actions show he is somebody who doesn't  understand the seriousness of public office, and that's why I'm concerned with  that kind of conduct."  </P> <P> Norton shrugs off the charges.  </P> <P> "It's rubbish," Norton said. "All these charges come from political people and  have no merit. They can charge me with anything they want, there's no substance  to it."  </P> <P> In any case, Norton has hired political consultant Harvey Englander, whom he  once called a "sleazy political consultant known for smear campaigns" in his  1988 political flyers. Englander handled Councilman Daniel E. Griest's campaign  against Norton.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Martinez-Griffiths, a program coordinator for a nonprofit community  organization, already has begun walking neighborhoods. Martinez-Griffiths, who  married at age 14 and worked her way through night school as a teen-ager, said  she hopes to win despite little name recognition.  </P> <P> "I'm taking the campaign to the people," she said. She is following a strict  strategy of meeting residents 3 1/2 hours every weekday and all day on  weekends. "I'm not getting myself involved in the political talk. I'm making  myself visible to the people and developing support instead."  </P> <P> In another ward, May and his strongest challenger, Robert L. Richardson, have  been bickering endlessly, even in their campaign statements. Richardson, a  school board member, asserts in his statement that "the incumbent's do-nothing  attitude has contributed to the decline of the quality of life in Santa Ana."  </P> <P> May, a Santa Ana High School history teacher, declared that Richardson has  special interests as an assistant to Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton.  May wrote that his opponent "has serious conflicts of interest from his county  job that could keep him from representing you."  </P> <P> Robert Banuelos, a senior citizen counselor for the city, is the dark horse of  the three. A former Pacific Bell employee, Banuelos ran for U.S. Senate in 1986  and 1988.  </P> <P> Banuelos is the only candidate who did not file a campaign statement, included  in sample ballots mailed to registered voters, detailing where he stood on  issues. He said he wanted to save the $700 statement fee so he could spend it  on campaign mailers. In an interview, Banuelos said he wants to improve the  city's senior citizens' food program and increase money for community services.  </P> <P> Coween Dickerson, a fiery business systems analyst, is incumbent Pulido's sole  challenger. In recent council meetings, Dickerson, who is 4-foot-8, has  literally stepped onto a footstool to speak into the microphone and address the  council on subjects such as the council's rejection of a cable consultant  contract.  </P> <P> She says she is not a "professional politician seeking higher office like the  incumbent."  </P> <P> In his campaign statement, Pulido declares he is proud of his four years in  office.  </P> <P> "Each time I see a freshly painted, non-graffiti-filled wall, I am proud. And I  wholeheartedly accept and embrace my reputation as someone who is stingy with  taxpayer dollars," Pulido said in his statement.  </P> <P> As for Dickerson's assertion that he has done little for the city, Pulido  replied in an interview, "I think I've done a pretty good job."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SANTA ANA ELECTIONS  </P> <P> MAYOR:  </P> <P> Daniel H.

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Which is the largest U.S. branch of Judaism: Reform or Conservative? It turns  out that no one has precise figures, and top officials put the two movements at  about the same size.  </P> <P> In separate stories this week, The Times identified Reform and Conservative as  the biggest.  </P> <P> Reform officials have estimated their U.S. members at about 1.3 million and  worldwide membership at about 1.5 million.  </P> <P> Despite higher estimates by some Conservative officials, Rabbi Jerome Epstein  of New York, chief executive officer of Conservative's United Synagogue of  America, said Thursday that Conservative Judaism may have between 1.3 million  and 1.4 million U.S. members and about 1.5 million members worldwide.  </P> <P> "Reform and Conservative Judaism are still neck-and-neck," Epstein said. "The  trouble is that in both movements many synagogues only report how many families  are members, not how many individuals."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bruce Phillips of Hebrew Union College's Los Angeles faculty said at  the annual convention of Reform rabbis in Seattle this week that he thought  Conservative enjoys a slight edge over Reform in affiliations, but that the  standings will change soon.  </P> <P> "The demographic trend is toward a more liberal Judaism in terms of how people  think of themselves," Phillips said. "It will be the only movement in the  United States that will be able to attract . . . fourth- and fifth-generation  Jews, Jews in mixed marriages and the children of those marriages."  </P> <P> Orthodox Judaism, widely considered third nationally in synagogue affiliations,  is represented by many different organizations but will continue to grow,  Phillips predicted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DATES  </P> <P> The Conservative Baptists of America, which has 1,200 member churches in this  country, opened its six-day national convention Friday at the Anaheim  Convention Center.  </P> <P> "Jesus and Woody Allen: Two Jewish Theologians" is the topic of New Testament  scholar Bernard Brandon Scott 8 p.m. Thursday at Mount St. Mary's Doheny campus  in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> More than 15,000 U.S. and Latin American Catholics are expected to attend the  16th annual, three-day "Encuentro Latino Internacional" starting Friday at the  Los Angeles Sports Arena.

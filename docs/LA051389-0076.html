			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'JUNK BOND' ISSUE BY RJR IS SNAPPED UP;  </P> <P> $4-BILLION SALE GOES BETTER THAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco Inc.'s $4-billion "junk bond" sale, the largest such public  offering in history, sold out Friday as buyers snapped up securities that had  been priced low enough to assure demand.  </P> <P> Registrations of the mammoth issue were also declared effective by the  Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning the securities could be traded. "It  seems that almost everyone wants a piece of the action," said one junk bond  trader, noting that the bonds had moved better than some had expected.  </P> <P> The registration was so large that it immediately doubled the underwriter  Drexel Burnham Lambert's share of the high-yield, high-risk junk bond market  for the year. Drexel's share jumped to 50.2% from 21.5%, according to  Securities Data Co.  </P> <P> Nabisco, maker of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, went private last year in a  record $24.7-billion leveraged buyout. The company, bought by LBO specialists  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., is now working to pay back the $23 billion  it borrowed for the deal.  </P> <P> The five tranches, or installments, in the offering were selling at near the  bonds' par value, or higher, traders said, reflecting the strength of demand.  Typical buyers in such offerings are thrifts, insurance firms, high-yield funds  and money managers.  </P> <P> The Friday offering is part of an $8-billion securities package. Analysts and  traders said the bond sale will probably be considered a benchmark in the  nearly $190-billion junk bond market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solid Credit Risk  </P> <P> Drexel, lead manager of the offering, priced RJR Nabisco's offering late  Thursday. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets co-managed the deal, which has five  installments. The formal name of the issuer is RJR Holdings Capital Corp.  </P> <P> Investors are scooping up the debt issue because RJR is regarded as a solid  credit risk, analysts said.  </P> <P> "It is one of the strongest companies around in terms of resisting a  recession," said Tom Razukas, high-yield analyst with McCarthy Crisanti Maffei  Inc. "Historically, food sales are not hurt during economic downturns. People  still have to eat."  </P> <P> "There is a lot of confidence in the RJR Nabisco deal," said Michael Dahoud, a  high-yield analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "The company has  recession-proof businesses, there are indications of a lot of interest in the  assets RJR is planning to sell, and Kohlberg Kravis has a good track record in  leveraged buyouts."  </P> <P> In addition, RJR has a wide arsenal of products, such as Winston, Salem and  Camel cigarettes, an array of baked goods and the Del Monte, Planters and Life  Savers brands.  </P> <P> All of the debt securities are rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and  B-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Some of the coupons were raised from  initially expected levels to attract and win over investors, analysts said.  </P> <P> The mammoth size and complex pricing of the RJR issue drove yields well above  the levels Drexel initially expected, analysts said.  </P></p>

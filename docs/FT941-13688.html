			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / EU enlargement pessimism: Negotiations by four newcomers set to miss March deadline Negotiations to bring Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway into the European Union now look unlikely to be completed by the March 1 deadline required for the enlargement to take place as planned in January next year. With five weeks to go, progress on crunch issues like agricultural subsidies is slowing down, negotiators on both sides acknowledge. Moreover, opinion inside the European parliament, which has to approve the accession treaties, is hardening against 'fast-track' ratification. Because of elections to the parliament in June, the Strasbourg assembly has set March 10 as the last date by which MEPs can examine enlargement, in time for referendums in each of the four countries later this year. Senior EU officials now believe that it may be possible to reach an outline agreement next month on the main outstanding issues. But one official admitted that 'there is no majority in the (European) parliament for the fast-track' in the negotiations. If Strasbourg insists on waiting for completed treaties, the official said, membership for Austria, Sweden and Finland could be delayed to mid-1995, and for Norway, which has the most obstacles to overcome, until January 1996. There is nothing in EU law which requires Strasbourg to wait for completed texts before starting ratification, officials say. But with MEPs clearly in the mood to use the new muscle they acquired from the Maastricht treaty, they are reluctant to be seen rubber-stamping 'headline' agreements reached by the council of ministers of the Twelve. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of Socialist MEPs, the largest bloc at Strasbourg, wrote last week in the Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter that parliament's approval was not realistic before September, 'even if the negotiations are concluded by March 1994'. A more hopeful EU diplomat pointed to the achievement of reaching last December's deadline to conclude the Uruguay Round, seen as improbable only weeks beforehand. 'If we get this on to a Gatt plane, and everyone moves up an extra gear, then maybe,' he said. Less sanguine Brussels diplomats point to the sequence of missed Gatt deadlines; the four deadlines required before the European Economic Area, grouping the Twelve and the applicants in a free trade zone, came into effect this month; and the missed deadlines and extra European summits needed to conclude previous enlargements in 1973, 1981 and 1986. The current Greek presidency of the EU is prepared to call a special summit next month if success looks likely. But negotiations at senior level last Friday failed to yield hoped-for breakthroughs. Norway, moreover, raised the stakes by saying in writing that it cannot accept EU objections to its hunting of whales and seal pups - an emotive issue clouding already complicated negotiations with Oslo over farming, fisheries and oil and gas exploration rights.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Direct Line may apply for its own full banking licence DIRECT LINE, the rapidly growing telephone insurance company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, may apply for a full banking licence so that it can provide a broad range of financial services, including savings accounts. The plan was disclosed yesterday as Direct Line reported a trebling of pre-tax profits to Pounds 15m in the six months to March 31. It helped raise Royal Bank's pre-tax profits to Pounds 91.6m in the first half of its financial year. Direct Line, which is poised to become the UK's biggest motor insurer, is also preparing an assault on the home insurance market in the autumn and hopes to launch a telephone-based loans operation in September. The group is also planning subsequently to sell mortgages, life insurance and deposit accounts. In order for Direct Line to offer savings accounts, the Bank of England would have to grant the subsidiary its own banking licence. Although Royal Bank insists there is no conflict between Direct Line and other operations, such as branch and telephone banking, an application for a separate banking licence may raise further questions about the relationship. Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line's chief executive, said the company was in the process of developing financial products 'that offer the Direct Line brand values'. He said that in the longer term, it could even diversify into the travel agency business. Mr Wood is expected to earn at least Pounds 10m this year after being paid Pounds 6m last year. His remuneration package, negotiated when he sold 25 per cent of the company to the RBS in 1988, is linked to the rate of Direct Line's asset growth. Mr Wood said Royal Bank of Scotland could float Direct Line on the stock market if the bank's share price failed to reflect the value of its rapidly growing insurance subsidiary. Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive said that a flotation was 'not currently part of our plan'. He expected Direct Line and Royal Bank's other insurance subsidiary eventually to contribute over 20 per cent of earnings. Direct Line's interim figures, released yesterday, show strong growth. Premium income over the six months doubled to Pounds 160.6m (Pounds 82.7m), and the number of motor policyholders rose from 500,000 at the end of March last year to 903,500 this year. The company expects to insure at least 1.2m of the 18m motorists holding insurance by the end of the year. At the moment, 229,000 households buy insurance from Direct Line, following 26 per cent growth in the last six months. Lex, Page 18 Royal Bank results, PAge 21</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / BAe flies away from Rover with a sackful of cash: How BMW snatched the prize from Honda With Pounds 800m on the table from BMW, it took the British Aerospace board less than five hours last Thursday to decide that it would quit the car industry and put an end to its five-year relationship with Honda. Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman and the man who believed the relationship with Honda to be 'the natural path', was told to take the next flight to Tokyo to face a company which had thought its offer was a fait accompli. Six days earlier Honda had agreed to increase its stake from 20 to 47.5 per cent, pumping Pounds 165m into BAe and valuing Rover at Pounds 600m  -40 per cent less than the eventual winner. Honda had started from a seemingly unassailable position, given its 20 per cent stake and its 14-year relationship with Rover. But ultimately, it was BAe's desire to find an exit from its five-year-old investment that proved the key. BMW's assault started last September, when it identified Rover as a target that would extend its car range and achieve economies of scale in distribution, component sourcing and R&amp;D. Its initial offer to BAe was repulsed because of Rover's relationship with Honda. Dr Hagen Luderitz, director of corporate planning at BMW, says BMW delivered a letter to Honda chief executive Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, stating its interest in Rover. No response was received. Mr Kiyoshi Ikemi, councillor to Honda's president, denies any direct approach, claiming Honda received only indirect hints of BMW's intentions. 'We weren't informed properly until Friday last week,' he protested. Unperturbed by the original rebuff, BMW went ahead with its scrutiny of Rover. Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's research and development director, unobtrusively visited the UK plants. Back in Germany he test drove the entire fleet. After two months, he was convinced. On January 19, a special meeting of BMW's supervisory board discussed the prospect of making an offer for Rover. They decided unanimously to go ahead and informal negotiations were opened with the target. Having been informed of outside interest in Rover, Honda was under pressure to act. 'If we took a larger percentage, BAe said it would be a clear signal that the rest of the company was not for sale,' said Mr Ikemi. On January 21, Honda agreed to increase its stake to 47.5 per cent. Rover had become core to Honda's strategy for Europe, and the relationship had been of mutual benefit. Honda had been the key to turning round Rover's car business, providing technology and saving large amounts in R&amp;D. This offer was also before the BAe board on the Thursday morning. It was a fierce race to the finish. Mr Luderitz admits the speed of the deal limited BMW's ability to perform due diligence, although he was confident the synergies justified the Pounds 800m price tag - valuing Rover at Pounds 1bn. He delivered the formal offer personally last Wednesday. At 9.15 on the following morning, the British Aerospace board of directors sat down to decide. Before them was the prospect of selling a business which was non-core and required substantial capital spending. The BMW offer had a deadline of midnight last night. The BAe board decided it wanted out - and Mr Simpson was sent to Tokyo to see if Honda would make a better offer. According to Mr Ikemi, it was made clear that an increased offer might be acceptable to BAe. The board of Honda decided it was not interested in control. 'If they'd committed to 49 per cent and floating in five years we would have done it', said Mr Simpson. On Saturday BMW discussed its proposals with the British government, which had expressed concern over the impact of the deal on jobs, and about the relationship between Rover and Honda. BMW cleared the move at a meeting with Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister. The final decision by BAe was made on the same day. The board had left this in the hands of Mr Richard Evans, chief executive, Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, Lord Hollick, non-executive director and Mr Simon Robertson, deputy chairman of the company's merchant banker Kleinwort Benson. They met on Saturday, but with an unequivocal 'no' from Honda, it was a relatively straightforward decision. Neither BAe nor Honda wanted control of the British carmaker. So BMW had won.

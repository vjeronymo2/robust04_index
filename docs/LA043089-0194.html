			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTHERING ABOUT AMERICA;  </P> <P> REDISCOVERING AMERICA'S VALUES BY FRANCES MOORE LAPPE (BALLANTINE: $22.50; 352  PP.; 345-32040-9)  </P> <P> At times of great religious or ideological change, when two contending world  views threaten to tear civilization apart, concerned intellectuals have tried  to frame the issues as clearly as possible in dialogues, literary discussions  between two imaginary speakers on opposite sides of the chief controversies of  the day.  </P> <P> This is what Frances Lappe, author of "Diet for a Small Planet," has tried to  do in her new and unusual book, "Rediscovering America's Values." She quite  rightly sees that the debate between two related but conflicting philosophies  -- liberal and conservative -- lies at the heart of contemporary American life  and hopes to clarify the issues while advancing her own preference for what we  might call the post-liberal option: not the centralized system of 20th-Century  socialisms but a decentralized, communitarian alternative that has roots in  American radicalism and affinities with the "small is beautiful" movement.  </P> <P> Often, though not always, Lappe succeeds in clarifying, if not reconciling, the  differences between these rival voices in American life. Unlike many left-wing  critics, she both understands and is prepared to discuss the passionate  commitment to freedom which lies behind the opposition of many on the right to  the welfare state. To recognize the insight contained in an opposing point of  view is one of the hardest things to do, and the mark of a generous mind; Lappe  succeeds brilliantly in this difficult task.  </P> <P> Over the course of this book, unlike any other you are likely to see anytime  soon, the two voices conduct a running argument over subjects as diverse as  welfare, defense policy, employee ownership, affirmative action and the minimum  wage. In a pyrotechnic exhibition of erudition the arguments of both sides are  supported by statistics and by citations from philosophers, economists and  statesmen who have grappled with these questions through the ages. For much of  the book, both liberals and conservatives will feel that Lappe has succeeded in  presenting their views fairly and completely.  </P> <P> Not everyone will agree that she has succeeded everywhere, and total success is  ruled out by the dialogue form, which limits to two the number of views that  can be aired on any one subject. This can sometimes cause problems. Differences  among conservatives, for example, are wide and deep; some conservatives are  libertarians who want to see the state out of the bedroom as well as the  boardroom; on foreign policy issues a substantial and possibly growing  conservative minority would like to see the United States pull troops out of  Europe and confine its military strategy to the defense of the national  territories. Given the dialogue form, only one conservative position can be  expressed, and it is not always clear that Lappe has chosen the strongest  alternative.  </P> <P> Still, Lappe's relentless fair-mindedness helps make this a remarkable and  valuable resource for groups in churches and other organizations who are  seeking common understandings and approaches to social problems. It will also  help individual readers clarify their own personal values and one hopes that it  will be widely used in college programs on current affairs.  </P> <P> A running dialogue between two unnamed speakers on a variety of political  topics may not seem like the most entertaining read on offer today, and this is  certainly not a book to be swallowed in a single sitting. But the questions the  book addresses are so important, and Lappe manages to engage us so thoroughly  in the unfolding argument, that we get involved in the running debate. We cheer  and hiss as different points of view are put forward; at times one wants to  throw the book across the room in frustration; at times one wants to cheer  Lappe's ability to reduce the conflict of our time into a clear outline.  </P> <P> But since debates over values will never be settled, the argument over them in  Lappe's book sometimes gets stuck. The topic may change from chapter to  chapter, but the underlying debate is the same all through the book. As a  result, the book lacks a dramatic quality of moving toward a conclusion and  sometimes sinks into a stale reiteration of old arguments on both sides  </P> <P> As a child, Lappe would listen to her parents and their friends debating the  issues of the day in their Texas kitchen and in their church groups. She pays  tribute to the work of Robert Bellah and the co-authors of "Habits of the  Heart" in exploring the connections, or lack of them, between the religious and  political values that shape American life. Yet there is very little explicit  discussion of religion in "Rediscovering America's Values."  </P> <P> The relative absence of religion from a book about values reflects the extreme  difficulty of the task Lappe set for herself. "America's Values" grow out of a  large number of sometimes contradictory religious and philosophical movements.  The debate over our values is not so much a dialogue as a deluge of voices, and  Lappe's effort to bring order out of this Tower of Babel necessarily  oversimplifies and sometimes misleads.  </P> <P> However, these difficulties do not detract from the real accomplishments of  this book. Indeed, if more Americans had Lappe's willingness to subject her  deepest moral and political convictions to such searching scrutiny, we would be  a less divided, more moderate, less ideological and more thoughtful nation.  Unusual, original, provocative, sometimes exasperating, always striking,  "Rediscovering America's Values" deserves a wide and attentive audience.  </P> <P> You can't blame poverty on crime when crime rates didn't rise, and might even  have fallen, when poverty was much more widespread -- during the Great  Depression. Rising crime rates reflect a shift in social mores, the breakup of  the family, and the decline in the role of religion. They reflect an embrace of  self-expression as a value in itself, further eroding self-discipline. And high  crime rates also result from a law enforcement pattern that encourages  lawbreakers by making penalties so weak that, in effect, crime does pay.  </P> <P> But violent crime rates in America are several times higher than in other  industrial countries, despite much harsher anti-crime attitudes and more severe  punishment here. Crime is linked to the deprivation of poverty.  </P> <P>  Poverty's cost to society can also be measured in the loss of potential  wealth. Each class of high school dropouts represents roughly $240 billion in  lost earnings and tax revenues alone.  </P> <P>  Even in a five-fold increase Headstart could be covered by reinstating only a  fraction of the $60 billion lost in the 1980s tax cuts for the rich.  </P> <P>  Iknew you would answer by increasing our taxes! Tell me, if your defense of a  burgeoning welfare state held water, why are so many people in Western  industrial countries revolting against it? Why? Because most people know that  at least half of what the federal government spends is wasted. From Margaret  Thatcher's England to the Scandinavian countries, by the Eighties the majority  of voters had begun to challenge cradle-to-grave welfarism.  </P> <P> Actually, Western Europeans are seeking more efficient ways to continue or  extend the protections they have achieved. Almost two-thirds of Britons said in  the mid-Eighties that government services should be extended, even if it meant  higher taxes.  </P> <P>  The sad irony is that a blind distrust of government leads to heavier public  spending; for even when we (Americans) do establish public provision, we let  private interests call the tune. Example: In the U.S., the public covers about  half of all medical costs, but we allow the businesses providing the care to  maximize profits by maximizing costs charged to the government. So the public  gets had; government outlays for Medicare have doubled in less than a decade.  </P> <P>  Any such problems, of course, would never arise if we kept government out of  the picture.  </P> <P>  -- From "Rediscovering America's Values"  </P></p>

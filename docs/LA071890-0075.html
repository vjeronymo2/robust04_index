			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON USES QUOTA ISSUE IN NEW TV AD ATTACKING FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> The gubernatorial campaign squabble over appointing women and minorities to  government jobs -- and whether that constitutes a quota system -- spills onto  California's airwaves today when Republican Pete Wilson accuses Democrat Dianne  Feinstein in a television commercial of planning to put "quotas over  qualifications" if she is elected governor.  </P> <P> The new 30-second ad hammering on an area where Republicans hope Feinstein will  be vulnerable was expected to be aired on some small stations Tuesday night,  and will expand to television markets across the state by today.  </P> <P> Wilson, who is in Washington while the U.S. Senate is in session, had no direct  comment on the ad, but his campaign spokesman accused Feinstein of "pandering"  to voting groups by promising to appoint women and minorities in proportion to  their share of the state's population.  </P> <P> "She made those promises to get more votes," said Bill Livingstone, Wilson's  spokesman. " . . . Other women would find it very distasteful to have been  given a job (because of) a quota system."  </P> <P> Feinstein's campaign immediately accused Wilson of "distorting the issue."  </P> <P> "She voted against quotas when she was mayor," said Feinstein's spokeswoman,  Dee Dee Myers, citing her 1980 opposition to a San Francisco City Charter  revision that contained appointment quotas.  </P> <P> Feinstein also could not be reached for comment. She traveled Tuesday to  Washington, where she has scheduled a series of fund-raisers.  </P> <P> In her absence, Feinstein's campaign staff also accused Wilson of doing  precisely what he accuses the former San Francisco mayor of doing -- supporting  proportional representation of women and minorities in government.  </P> <P> They circulated copies of an affirmative action plan used in San Diego during  Wilson's tenure as mayor. The program's objective, as set out in city  documents, was to "make city employment . . . consistent with the minority  composition of the city of San Diego."  </P> <P> Livingstone said that plan, even though its objective is almost exactly that  espoused by Feinstein, was not a quota system. "That is a goal, not something  that would happen immediately," he said of the San Diego plan. "Wilson didn't  go to black groups and promise them 7% of the jobs."  </P> <P> The candidates have been bickering for weeks over whether Feinstein's pledge  represents a quota system or is more akin to traditional affirmative action  programs, which emphasize goals and objectives over specific numbers.  </P> <P> At the root of the dispute is each candidate's desire to appeal to diverse  segments of the voting public -- and particularly to women, who constitute more  than half of the electorate.  </P> <P> The Wilson ad, notably, is being launched at the same time that Republicans  statewide begin to emphasize the role of women and the party's opposition to  quotas. At the state GOP convention this week in Wilson's hometown of San  Diego, prominent Republican women such as Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole are  expected to blast quota systems as demeaning.  </P> <P> The issue was first raised in the closing days of the primary campaign, when  Feinstein explained how she would handle appointments at all levels of  government, from her office staff to judges and department heads.  </P> <P> "Fairness is part of the dream," she told black audiences in Los Angeles on  Memorial Day weekend. "That is one of the reasons we have pledged an open and  accessible administration. That is one of the reasons we have pledged to  appoint women in proportion to their parity of the population -- 50%.  </P> <P> "To appoint people of color in proportion to their parity of the population. To  see that the administration is open. . . . That is the agenda."  </P> <P> When the proposal came under fire from Wilson late last month, Feinstein said  she did not consider her proposal to be a quota system, which she defined as  one excluding certain groups of people.  </P> <P> "Mr. Wilson has never known a quota. I know what a quota is," she said. Her  campaign staff later said Feinstein was referring to her exclusion from private  school as a youngster. The exclusion occurred because Feinstein is Jewish.  </P> <P> Wilson, in previous public comments, has suggested that by promising a certain  proportion of jobs to certain groups, Feinstein was de-emphasizing the  individual merits of job-seekers. His campaign ad underscores that sentiment,  asking in its punch line whether California can "afford a governor who puts  quotas over qualifications and promises over performance."  </P> <P> Wilson aides refused to disclose how much they intend to spend on the  advertisement, except to describe the cost as substantial.  </P> <P> The strategy represents a calculated gamble. Summer is generally thought to be  a season in which voters are not paying attention. But Wilson is apparently  hoping that he can do what Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. did in 1978 against  Republican Evelle Younger -- hit his opponent early and hard. Brown won that  election.  </P> <P> Another candidate in recent months launched a commercial that delivered a lead  in the polls that held until Election Day. That was Feinstein, who won the  primary largely on the strength of a February commercial touting her leadership  in the aftermath of the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Current issues of concern for the population were  discussed today at the plenum of the National Social Prevention  and Attention Commission. One of the issues discussed was  actions against social phenomena that degrade moral values.  Female and male prostitution, streetwalkers, and pimping were  terms that gave rise to comments stressing the need for legal  support and repression to punish these activities closely tied  to tourism. The effectiveness of recent police operations to  preserve an orderly society were also acknowledged. On the other  hand, it was mentioned that the solution to the problem ought to  lie in prevention and in teaching the youth in school to  repudiate socially sanctionable behaviors.    In workshops being conducted in several provinces, students  are found to have a noncritical and, of course, tolerant  attitude due to a lack of information. This reaffirms that the  home must take on an increased level of involvement and  responsibility.    Among the issues discussed by the commission were community  efforts in youth recreation and praise for the accomplishments  attained by the People's Councils working closely with  political, cultural, and sports organizations. There are already  18 discotheques nationwide and several more will be opened this  year; there will also be a significant increase in youth clubs.    The care of people with mental problems was also discussed  and it was clear that even though the Cuban state, with scarce  resources right now, gives priority to these cases, the legal  responsibility for the mentally ill lies with the family, which  in certain cases relinquishes their care.    The plenum of the commission discussed very contemporary  issues which generally cause concern to the population. It was a  very up-to-date and down-to-earth plenum.</p>

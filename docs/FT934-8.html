			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Danes happiest people in EU Denmark has the happiest old people in the European Union, according to the Eurobarometer survey, Reuter reports from Brussels. More than two thirds of them are satisfied with life, while only 6 per cent of old people in Greece and 3 per cent in Portugal are satisfied with their lot. On the other hand, while only 3 per cent of older Danes are dissatisfied, 41 per cent of the Portuguese and 59 per cent of the Greek feel badly done by. The survey reveals vastly different conditions and chances of happiness across the Union. 'The variations between countries cannot be painted over and the challenge the Community faces is to minimise those that derive mainly from differences in socio-economic conditions,' the survey said. It singled out level of pensions and segregation from society as sources of dissatisfaction. However, the survey showed support for the older generation among young people. 'They say loud and clear. . . . that older people are a special case as a deserving cause for action by national governments and the Community as a whole. . . . It would be a mistake to see this as a display of pity for old people,' it said. There was widespread awareness of age discrimination in all member states and a feeling that something should be done to prevent it. But there was also a feeling that older people should stand up for themselves more.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY AGAIN TRIES TO FORM MOSQUITO ABATEMENT DISTRICT  </P> <P> Los Angeles County, in a second effort to get 25 San Gabriel Valley cities or  their residents to pay for mosquito abatement, took the first step Tuesday  toward formation of a valleywide mosquito abatement district.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors, advised that a mosquito-borne encephalitis virus  still exists locally, agreed to file an application to form a new San Gabriel  Valley Mosquito Abatement District and to lobby valley cities to participate.  </P> <P> San Marino and South El Monte, which are already members of a mosquito  district, and Pasadena, which has its own eradication program, would not be  asked to join, county officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Participation Voluntary  </P> <P> The district would be established by December, after hearings by the Local  Agency Formation Commission for comment from the cities. City participation is  voluntary.  </P> <P> A similar county proposal stalled in 1987 after receiving little support from  25 San Gabriel Valley cities, which are among 27 countywide that neither  support an abatement district nor have their own programs, officials said.  </P> <P> The cities were reluctant to split the costs -- now about $325,000 annually --  because the money would have come from their general funds, they said.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, a property tax of about $2 per parcel per year would pay  for the abatement district, said Virginia Collins, finance division director in  the county chief administrator's office. She said no city has yet commented on  the proposal, but she predicted support for it.  </P> <P> "A $2 assessment is so minor, and the benefit is so great in terms of public  health, that we don't believe there will be any problem with it," she said.  "It's cheaper (for property owners) than if they just went out and bought  themselves some insecticide."  </P> <P> Asked about the proposal, officials in Pomona and Temple City, said they would  probably support the new district.  </P> <P> The county Department of Health Services has paid for mosquito eradication in  the San Gabriel Valley and other areas without abatement programs since 1984,  when a surprise outbreak of the St. Louis encephalitis virus infected 16 people  countywide, killing one and contributing to the deaths of two others.  </P> <P> The virus, which attacks the brain and nervous system, causes symptoms ranging  from a mild fever to delirium and severe seizures, health officials said.  </P> <P> Officials said many cities throughout the county traditionally refused to join  mosquito districts because, until the 1984 outbreak, only a handful of  mosquito-borne encephalitis cases had been reported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four Cases Reported  </P> <P> Since the outbreak, four cases have been reported in the county. Though no  cases were reported in 1987 or 1988, county officials say at least three cases  were reported in San Bernardino and Orange counties during the last two years.  </P> <P> There has also been evidence that encephalitis still exists in Los Angeles  County, they said. Last year, the virus was discovered in three of five  "sentinel chicken flocks" that abatement districts keep in open-air cages and  test for the disease. It was also detected in four ponds of stagnant water  where mosquitoes live, county analyst Bonnie Chun said.  </P> <P> "I think we have the situation back under control, and now we want to keep it  under control," said Robert Gates, director of the Department of Health  Services. "But it's still sort of lurking out there."  </P> <P> Gates said a continuing county budget squeeze prompted the new effort to  "spread the burden" of paying for mosquito abatement. With the new method of  financing, he expects cities to join the proposed district, Gates said.  </P> <P> In Pomona, officials said they supported the 1987 abatement plan and would  probably not change their position.  </P> <P> "It's up to the City Council, but I would say the city would certainly support  that," Dayle Keller, deputy city administrator in Pomona, said. "It's not going  to be coming out of our budget, and it's a very small amount compared to most  people's tax bills."  </P> <P> Karl Koski, city manager in Temple City, said that if the health problem is  substantiated, he will recommend participation in the program.  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Virgin cancels launch of service VIRGIN Atlantic Airways yesterday cancelled the launch of its London-to-Johannesburg service from Heathrow airport, blaming a lack of landing slots available at the airport. But Mr Tim Walden, chairman of the Heathrow scheduling committee, said Virgin's claim 'is wholly misleading and inaccurate'. Cabin crew at British Airways yesterday voted to strike over changes to pay and conditions. The TGWU general union said thousands of passengers would be affected.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Canadian Pacific advances to CDollars 110m Canadian Pacific, the transport, resources, hotel and property group, posted net profit in the second quarter to June of CDollars 110.5m (USDollars 80m), up from CDollars 29.6m a year earlier. Including special items, final net profit was CDollars 198.4m, or 60 cents a share, against CDollars 12m, or 3 cents. Consolidated revenues from continuing operations were CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars 1.65bn. First-half final net profit was CDollars 215.6m, or 65 cents, against CDollars 33.7m, or 10 cents, on revenues of CDollars 3.5bn against CDollars 3.13bn. The first quarter was adversely affected by the severe winter, but second-quarter results were better than most analysts had estimated. The half-year included a positive CDollars 9.5m contribution from Laidlaw, the waste management group, against a negative CDollars 5.8m. However, telecommunications losses were up sharply.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Greek demand could delay accession deal The current Greek presidency of the European Union wants to limit the amount of regional aid offered to the remote areas of Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway, in a proposal which threatens to complicate the closing stages of these countries' already difficult negotiations on EU entry. European Commission negotiators in November offered each of the four applicants the highest level of EU structural aid - so-called objective 1 status - for their most disadvantaged regions. Athens wants a clear delineation between some Ecu100bn (Dollars 112bn) in EU funds available in 1994-9 to the poorest regions - such as Greece itself, Portugal, Ireland and Spain - and structural aid to Nordic and Alpine regions whose average income is above the normal objective 1 eligibility threshold. Greece itself should get more than Ecu19bn in EU regional aid in 1994-99. While it is not yet clear whether the Greek presidency's proposal, presented in a confidential paper, will gain the support of its partners, the mere suggestion that the northern areas of the Nordic countries could come off worse inside Europe could harden already sceptical opinion in those countries against EU entry. The Greek proposal says that a 'transitional' and 'additional ad hoc effort' should be made 'in a limited number of areas' in the four countries, to take account of their harsh climate and remoteness. It calls for a new and separate transitional fund to finance regional aid in a number of these areas. The proposal would exclude Norrbotten, Sweden's northern-most province, and two of Norway's four northern counties, from objective 1 status, the treasure trove of regional policy. Athens says these and the Etela-Pohjanma area of eastern Finland should be 'funded separately (over and above) from the existing funds of the (EU regional policy) regulation, which are to be distributed solely among the existing 12 member states'.</p>

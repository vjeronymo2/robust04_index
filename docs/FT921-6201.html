			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Car VAT decision overturned A TRIBUNAL on value added tax has overturned a ruling by Customs and Excise that the cost of cars provided by Co-operative Insurance Society to employees is liable to the tax. The tribunal ruled that VAT was not chargeable on the society's car scheme, which offered employees the choice between a higher salary or a company car. Customs and Excise has maintained that salary forgone in effect represents a contribution towards renting the company car for partly private use. Renting the car for purposes other than the job is a payment liable for VAT. The society argued that its scheme was not equivalent to charging a cash sum for the use of company cars but simply an element in the calculation of salaries. The society's arrangement is relatively unusual and may not apply directly to other company car schemes because it offers employees a choice of two employment contracts. The position for companies offering a single employment contract with either option remains unclear. Several companies and tax advisers have been awaiting the outcome to determine the structure of car schemes. Mr Mike Ward, society taxation manager, said: 'We are pleased with the court's judgment, which we believe is fair and clearly argued.' Customs and Excise said yesterday it had not yet had time to decide whether to appeal. The VAT argument is being watched with close interest by business car operators and vehicle manufacturers.</p>

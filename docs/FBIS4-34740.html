			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Martin Hacthoun] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos  Lage has commented that Canada's resumption of official economic  aid to Cuba shows Canada's willingness to ensure continuity in  bilateral talks. He added: "This pleases us, and we will work  toward that goal."    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage noted: "This is an  important step in terms of Canadian policy toward Cuba  throughout the years." "It is in line," he added, "with an  increase in existing economic and commercial ties, particularly  in the area of tourism."    In discussing the visit by Christine Stewart, minister of  state for Latin America and Africa, the Cuban vice president  said the visit intensifies relations between the two countries,  which are, in fact, already satisfactory. "This relationship is  very important for Cuba," he concluded.    On Monday night, President Fidel Castro received Stewart,  the  highest-ranking Canadian official to visit the island in more  than 18 years since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's visit  to Havana in 1976. Stewart described the meeting as fruitful.    Stewart also met with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina;  National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; Finance and Prices  Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez; and Ernesto Melendez, minister of  foreign investment and economic cooperation.    Together with Lage, last night, the Canadian minister opened  an international businessmen's conference on business  opportunities in Cuba sponsored by THE ECONOMIST magazine. More  than 120 executives from firms in Canada, the UK, the United  States, Europe, and Latin America are participating in the event.    On Monday, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet in Ottawa and  Stewart in Havana simultaneously issued official announcements  ending the suspension of Canada's official economic aid to Cuba.  The aid has been suspended in 1978 in the wake of the Cuban  military aid to Angola in the face of the South African  aggression.    Eduardo del Buey, a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman who  is accompanying Stewart, stressed: "This is an important moment  in the ties between Cuba and Canada" based on "frequent and  honest dialogues."    "It is a dialogue between friends who disagree on certain  things, but who feel mutual respect. It is a dialogue that  serves to consolidate the basis of their relations," Del Buey  told PRENSA LATINA.    In this regard, Bienvenido Garcia, a department director at  the Cuban Foreign Ministry, explained: "There are more points of  agreement than disagreement."    At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart  said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not  only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also  because Canada will benefit.    Canada has large foreign investments in the mining sector,  not only in the traditional nickel sector, but also in  prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as exploring for  oil.    In addition, Canada sends more tourists to Cuba than any  other nation. More than 120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations  in Cuba every year.    Stewart also expressed Ottawa's desire for Cuba to return to  the OAS, where "it can again play an important role with all of  its privileges and responsibilities."    On this subject, she noted that "isolation is unhealthy,"  and  she said her government plans to review with other nations the  possibility of Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization.  Cuba was suspended from the OAS in 1962 as a result of U.S.  pressures. "This is not something we can accomplish overnight,  however; we believe it is a process we must begin to think  about," she added.    She said Canada understands the current difficulties in Cuba  and praised the government's efforts to try to maintain the  benefits of important social programs in areas such as education  and health. On this point, she stressed: "It is difficult, but  vital, to continue these efforts."    With regard to the Canadian Government's willingness to  heighten the political dialogue, Stewart mentioned the interest  expressed by Foreign Minister Ouellet to meet with Cuban Foreign  Minister Robaina at "some appropriate moment."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was recently found that the original estimate  for the construction of the No 10 container terminal planned by  the Hong Kong Government to be built on Lantau Island was too  short and that there will be a delay of two years. This will  cause Hong Kong to lose as much as 2 billion dollars. The Hong  Kong Government is seizing the time to study other channels.    It is learned that the cause of the delay is that  departments  of the Hong Kong Government underestimated the time needed for  construction. The estimate of the Hong Kong Government was  based on past experience, including that of the No 7 and No 8  container terminals in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island, which took  about five years for design and construction. Therefore, the  construction of the first container terminal on Lantau Island is  also based on 5 years and is estimated to be completed and put  into operation around the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.    However, upon further study of the design of No 10 container  terminal, it has been found that the project on Lantau Island is  more complicated than those in Kuai Chung and Tsingyi Island.  Two more years is needed for the project; that is, at the  earliest it can only be completed by the end of 1998.    The Hong Kong Government has estimated that the delay for  two  years in the construction of the container terminal No 10 will  cause Hong Kong to suffer an economic loss as much as 2 billion  dollars. If the No 9 container terminal, on which the Chinese  side has not yet given its approval, cannot be gradually put  into service by the middle of 1996 as originally scheduled, but  has to be delayed for two years, the two container terminals  will cause Hong Kong to suffer a total economic lose of 4  billion dollars.    Moreover, the loss caused by delay will not be confined to  the first two years, but will continue to accumulate. This is  because Kaoshiung in Taiwan, Singapore, and Yantian Port, the  construction of which will soon be completed in Shenzhen, are  close to Hong Kong and they will become powerful competitors.  Because of the delay in the construction of the No 9 and No 10  container terminals, the navigation lines of some container  ships can only be shifted to container terminals in neighboring  areas. It is even more difficult to estimate the long-term  economic losses of Hong Kong.    The Hong Kong Government has, based on the speed of growth  of  the container transport volume of Hong Kong, estimated that by  the end of 1996 it will be necessary for the No 10 container  terminal to be put into service before all the containers can be  handled. This estimation is also based on the operation of No 9  container terminal as scheduled.    The Hong Kong Government is seizing the time to study other  ways, and plans under consideration include giving up the past  practice of asking financial groups to reclaim land from the sea  and build the terminal, and instead doing the work directly by  the government itself. Another plan is to use sea sand to  reclaim land from the sea.    The tentative view of the Hong Kong Government is that the  plan for the government to reclaim land from the sea and to do  the construction work may not save time. Therefore, the  feasibility of this plan is not great. On the other hand, the  second plan may save as much as six months and may enable No 10  container terminal to be completed in the beginning of 1998.    The Hong Kong Government will appoint, as soon as possible,  consultant companies to study how fast the method of using sea  sand to reclaim land can speed up the construction and to study  if there is any other way that may save even more time.</p>

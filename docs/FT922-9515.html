			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Heseltine acts to cut gap in car prices THE GOVERNMENT is to open talks with car manufacturers to remove restrictions on dealerships which have been blamed for keeping British car prices higher than those in other European countries. A two-year European Commission study of the EC car market has confirmed that many models were 30 per cent more expensive in the UK than on the continent. A so-called 'block exemption' allows carmakers to determine which dealerships can sell their brand of cars and where they can be sold. They generally prevent dealers from selling more than one brand of car and do not allow them to import cars themselves. 'I am seeking a better deal for consumers through the removal of some restrictions placed on dealers by car suppliers,' said Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday. He welcomed moves announced yesterday by the European Commission to ensure car companies do not abuse their selective dealership system. Mr Heseltine said the government would now push ahead with the recommendations of the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on new car sales in the UK. This called for the removal of some restrictions placed by some carmakers on their franchised dealers, which the MMC claimed operated against the public interest. As part of the push for fairer pricing, manufacturers are being encouraged by Brussels to publish price lists to help consumers shop around the EC for models with the same specifications. 'We want to ensure people's right to buy the car they want at an undistorted price,' said Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner. He claimed his campaign for cross-border selling in the EC car market would lead to 'a substantial downward pressure on prices and to a more equal distribution of prices'. Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, claimed the EC report showed no evidence that selective distribution was responsible for price variations.

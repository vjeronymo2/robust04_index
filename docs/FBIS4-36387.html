			<p>BFN     [Text] Occupied Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian  National Authority [PNA] official has said the PNA has decided  to form a Palestinian shadow government in east Jerusalem to  face the recent Israeli measures.    The PNA minister, who asked not to be named, asserted that  "there will be no official announcement of the government" that  will run Palestinian economic and social activities in Jerusalem.    According to the Palestinian source, the PNA "has stopped  short of announcing the formation of the shadow government and  announcing officially the creation of a special ministry for  Jerusalem affairs in order not to embarrass the Israeli  government or weaken its domestic political position." However,  the recent Israeli statements on the future of Palestinian  institutions in Jerusalem and the moves under way to pass  legislation against these institutions "could prompt the  Palestinian leadership to adopt steps to escalate the situation  and prevent the Israeli government from changing the status quo  of the city to weaken the Palestinian negotiating stance" before  starting the final negotiations that will determine the fate of  the city, as the Palestinian minister put it.    The Palestinian official told QUDS PRESS the shadow  government, which could be headed by Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat, will comprise several ministries, including "social  affairs, housing, tourism and antiquities, education, sports and  youth, health, and awqaf" in addition to any other ministries  the PNA thinks are necessary to consolidate the Palestinian  presence in the city. The official added that "the activities  of these ministries will not be carried out in public unless the  Israeli authorities adopt measures against Palestinian  institutions in east Jerusalem."    The Palestinian official further said the government's  activities include renovating houses and supporting other  activities that contribute to intensifying the Palestinian  presence "to bolster the negotiating position" of the PNA. The  official asserted that the PNA has decided to hold consultations  with the Palestinian opposition forces in order to coordinate  action to preserve the city of Jerusalem. The Palestinian  minister added that "political views could be different but we  are agreed on the need to maintain the Arab presence in  Jerusalem." The source did not reveal when the consultations  will begin which, he said, "might not be publicized in the  beginning, taking into consideration the political position of  the Palestinian forces."</p>

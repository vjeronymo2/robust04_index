			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by APS: "40 Kg of Kif Seized"] </F>   [Text] An international drug trafficking ring was  dismantled Saturday in Maghnia by elements of the Tlemcen  regional drug enforcement service, who succeeded in arresting  the Moroccan supplier, one of his buyers, and the Algerian  agent, and identifying the Moroccan border runner and the second  Algerian buyer. They also seized 40 kg of cannabis resin or  treated kif. Drug enforcement agents patroling between the Akid  Lotfi border control point and the town of Maghnia apprehended a  certain "B.B.," age 27, unemployed, as he was coming from the  border in a Peugeot 404. In the trunk of the car they found 160  250-gram wafers of kif divided into four parcels--a total of 40  kg coming from Morocco.    The Moroccan supplier, a certain "B.M.," 24, unemployed, who  entered Algeria the same day at the Akid Lotfi border checkpoint  on a valid passport, was arrested by elements of the regional  service. According to the same source, this person filled orders  for drugs in the Moroccan town of Ketama and delivered them to  Oujda. From there, a Moroccan border runner who lives near the  border smuggled the kif into Algeria via a circuitous route,  deliving it to a certain "D.A.," 47, unemployed, in the  socialist village of Akid Lotfi.    Other members of the drug ring had set up a rendezvous for  the following day at the town of Akid Lotfi to conclude their  transaction, which according to police involved at least 20 kg  of kif, according to officials in charge of the investigation.    The second Algerian buyer was identified, and police were  checking into his background and whereabouts.    We would note finally that the border runner charged 1,500  Algerian dinars per kilogram for his services. The drug itself  cost 18,500 dinars and sells for 30,000 dinars (wholesale) in  Algeria.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Human rights talks in Cuba The United Nations' top human rights official, Mr Jose Ayala Lasso, preferred to play the diplomat rather then the judge when he visited Cuba at the invitation of the government last week. The three-day visit was the first to Latin America by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights since he took up the newly created post this year. He stressed his visit was primarily aimed at opening up a dialogue with the Cuban authorities, but he made a point of meeting political dissidents as well as senior members of Cuba's one-party communist government. He said that he had urged the government to ratify existing human rights conventions, such as the Convention against Torture. But he also noted that economic conditions were inseparable from human rights and clearly endorsed a UN general assembly motion calling for the lifting of a longstanding US economic embargo against Cuba.</p>

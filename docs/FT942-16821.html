			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Patten's warm reception fails to thaw Malaysian freeze: Optimism on educational links has done little to improve the trade outlook Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week became the first cabinet minister to visit Malaysia since Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the country's prime minister, announced a ban on British companies winning government contracts. But his visit - to discuss expanding the already considerable educational links between Britain and Malaysia - has not marked any relaxation of the ban, imposed more than six weeks ago, in retaliation for unfavourable reports in the Britsh press about Dr Mahathir and Malaysia. British companies are failing to be shortlisted for contracts and face the break-up of partnerships with local and other businesses. The most serious blow has been to companies involved in a Pounds 2bn-plus project to build an international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. Ajac, a consortium of BICC, GEC-Marconi, Gammon and Trafalgar House of Britain and Marubeni of Japan, carried out initial planning and won the design and engineering contract for the airport. The Malaysian works ministry has now disclosed that it is vetting 29 pre-qualification applications to bid for the airport's construction and none of them is British. John Laing had put in a preliminary tender for a MDollars 3bn (Pounds 753m) terminal at the airport. It is believed to have withdrawn after its local and foreign partners expressed fears that its inclusion could jeopardise their chances. The National Grid company was to have participated in a MDollars 1.6bn project to install power transmission lines for Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's semi-privatised electricity utility. Pressure from local partners is likely to result in National Grid withdrawing. Some companies have decided to carry on regardless. Up to 90 British defence-related companies are due at an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur this month even though the Malaysian defence minister has said there will be no more purchases of arms and equipment from Britain. A group of British oil industry experts recently gave a seminar to Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company. Soon afterwards Petronas announced that British companies would be excluded from future contracts in Malaysia. One British executive based in Malaysia said: 'The longer it goes on, the worse it gets. It seems we are just laying down and being kicked.' Other companies are aware of the opportunities. Britain had hoped for a share of a MDollars 4bn programme to equip the Royal Malaysian Navy with new patrol vessels. During the past 10 days delegations from France and Sweden have been suggesting collaborative work on the vessels. Similar delegations are due from Germany and Australia. Mr Patten said he had been 'heartened by the warmth of my reception'. He added: 'There is an extraordinary atmosphere of friendliness.' He will take an optimistic message back to London on the educational front, where Malaysia needs British assistance. But this week Dr Mahathir repeated that the British press must stop telling 'lies'. He added: 'We will not change our policy as long as this campaign goes on. We will wait and see. We have plenty of time.' The outlook for British companies remains grim.</p>

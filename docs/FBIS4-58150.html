			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker,  Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani, expressed wonder on the naivety  of such a past master as the British Government and believed  that London's becoming a tool in the hands of Washington and  Israel intelligence services would not be beneficial for it.    Talking to IRNA, Rowhani who is also secretary of the  Supreme  National Security Council (SNSC), expressed surprise that the  British Government raised so undocumented and hollow claims, at  a time that European countries are adopting positive views on  their relations with Iran.    He was referring to the recent British allegations that Iran  is backing the Irish Republican Army (IRA).    Rowhani remarked that over the past 15 years Britain had  kept  a close connection with the armed terrorists fighting Iran and  that its officials and media had repeatedly ignored the  diplomatic norms by supporting the anti-revolutionaries both  overtly and covertly.    "By backing terrorist groups they have violated  international  laws," said Rowhani.    He regretted that the British media had become an instrument  for political games because its political figures realize better  than all the hollowness of such claims.    "Iran, as a victim of terrorism, had always called on the  Western countries especially the European Union to conduct  coordinated and joint measures against armed terrorism but  received no answer from them," he added.    Noting that Iran knew well what goals Britain pursued by  such  claims, the SCNS secretary invited Britain to bring its claims  before the free world's public opinion, if it had any reliable  documents, rather than creating tension between the two nations.    He said London's hollow claim is actually designed to cover  up the failure of its police in confronting the IRA, as well as  the public hatred that the British Government's support for the  Serbs in the Balkans has aroused.    Referring to the presence of the American Secretary of  State,  Warren Christopher, in the Middle East, the Majles vice-speaker,  said that the coordinated propaganda of the U.S., Israel and  Britain against Iran, revealed a plot by this evil trio against  the Islamic republic for its support for Palestian and Bosnian  Muslims.    He was pleased to note that after 15 years Britain had come  to realize that backing terrorist grouplets was wrong.    Rowhani concluded by repeating Iran's readiness for joint  measures with the European countries and the European Union in  particular against terrorism.</p>

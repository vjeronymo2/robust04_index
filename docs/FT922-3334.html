			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Lithuania averts political crisis THE government of Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, the Lithuanian prime minister, narrowly survived a vote on his resignation on Tuesday night and will now continue to govern until elections timed for the autumn. Mr Vagnorius has claimed that the bitterly-divided parliament has prevented the passing of urgent laws and has been unable to agree a new constitution for the country. At the same time, the failure of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the chairman of the Lithuanian Supreme Council, to get support in a referendum last month for the reintroduction of the office of president has weakened his authority and that of the right-wing government which he appointed. Ministers said yesterday that no decision could be made on the presidency or on the constitution for some months. At least four versions of a constitution are now drawn up, with their authors being split between options which call for a strong presidency - favoured by Mr Landsbergis - and those which call for a strong parliament, favoured by the opposition groups on the left. Mr Algirdas Saudargas, the foreign minister, said that 'we have no stable majority in parliament but the left-wing is also divided. They don't really want to govern, so we will carry on'. Lithuania, like Estonia and Latvia has so far been unable to persuade the Russian government to agree to its demands to withdraw the 35,000 Russian - formerly Soviet - troops from its territory. A meeting between Mr Landsbergis and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in Moscow at the weekend ended only with a vague promise from Mr Yeltsin to speed up their withdrawal. However, General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, has said that the troops will not be fully withdrawn until 1999. The politics-weary Lithuanians are being asked to vote again on Sunday on whether or not they wish the Russian army to leave the country - a move aimed at putting further pressure on the Russian government, and also at convincing the west to give further support to the demand for withdrawal. However, the vote is widely seen as unnecessary and potentially damaging if there is a large abstention. Economic reform has proceeded rapidly in Lithuania, with 50-60 per cent of flats and many small businesses and shops privatised, and with a claimed 48,000 farms transferred from state to private hands. Meanwhile, the planned introduction of a stock market on July 1 is likely to be delayed by two months The introduction of the new unit of currency, the Lit, has been delayed and will not happen until the end of the year. An economic programme is now being discussed with the IMF, with further negotiations timed for next week. Mr Vytenis Aleshkaitis, the minister for foreign economic relations and the main economic reformer in the government, said yesterday: 'We need a period of stability urgently in order to introduce the new currency and to cope with the economic shocks associated with it. 'But I think that the direction of policy is now so clear that any government will have to continue our policies.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai and Cambodian officials  yesterday agreed to reopen the Poipet-Khlong Luk border  checkpoint on July 1.    The closure of the border point on April 9 following  fighting  between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas  has hurt Thai traders and caused hardship to the Cambodians.  Tourism has also slumped.    Earlier, the border was set to be reopened on June 1 but  minor hitches delayed this by a month.    An agreement to reopen the border was signed yesterday after  successful talks between the Cambodian delegation led by Banteay  Meanchey Governor Gen Duong Khem and the 12th Army Division  commander Gen Lai Vira and Thai representatives headed by Sa  Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit and Burapha Task Force commander  Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit.    Governor Kasem said although fighting had scaled down in  Cambodia, stray shells still fell occasionally on the Thai side,  causing damage to property and inflicting casualties.    Maj-Gen Niphon said he had proposed the setting up of a  Thai-  Cambodian coordinating office to deal with cross-border robbery  and banditry by armed Cambodians.    Banteay Meanchey police chief Pol Maj [Police Major] Mar  Putthou said Highway 5 from Poipet to Sisophon was under  military protection and safe for travel.    At the crossing yesterday about 5,000 traders and villagers  from both sides gathered at the border checkpoint, hoping to  cross the border to resume their trade. But their hopes faded  as officials barred them from crossing.</p>

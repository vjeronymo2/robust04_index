			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an additional report from the Pailin  battlefield on 27 April.    On 27 april, we launched a sweep operation against the  two-headed elements along Route 10 beginning from the west.  After fighting for the whole day from 0600 at dawn to 0630 in  the evening, we smashed and liberated the 4th Division command  post at Treng on Route 10. This area has been a strategic  position of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese  puppets, and two-headed government since 1979. Treng, the  bridgehead of the defense line of Battambang town, has vanished.    Hul Savoan, four-star general and commander of Battambang's  5th Military Region, who fled from Pailin to hide in Treng after  being routed, has disappeared from this area.    We also totally swept the enemy positions at Phlov Meas and  Phum Tuol. We seized four 37-mm, three 76.2-mm, and six 12.7-mm  artillery pieces and a large quantity of small guns.    We are pushing forward.</p>

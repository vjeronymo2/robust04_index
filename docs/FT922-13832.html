			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Seats that hold key to No 10 - Today's election promises to be the closest since 1974. Gareth Smyth provides a guide to the results to watch for in the seats that will be crucial for the parties LABOUR needs a net gain of 97 for an overall majority. To do this it needs a uniform swing of 8 per cent. There are 651 seats, and with 50 not declared until tomorrow, voters may have to wait until then to know which party - if any - has won most. This is the countdown, with the expected times of declaration - but if results in marginals are close, there may be delays for recounts. 10pm The polls close. ITN and the BBC reveal their exit polls. In 1987 both underestimated Margaret Thatcher's majority. 11pm The real results. Torbay was first in 1983 and 1987. Torbay: A Liberal Democrat long-shot. If Adrian Sanders is even close to removing Tory Rupert Allason, Paddy Ashdown is in for a good night. Guildford: is a safe Conservative seat, but watch for any large swing to Labour. Basildon: Will Labour overturn David Amess's 2,649 majority? The Conservatives can lose the seat and still have an outright majority. 11.30pm Cheltenham: Liberal Democrat Nigel Jones seeks to overturn the 4,896 Conservative majority, defended by black barrister John Taylor. Hyndburn: In 1987, Conservative Kenneth Hargreaves, against the national trend, increased a majority of 21 to over 2,000. Dudley West: A comfortable Labour win suggests an outright Labour majority. Pendle: It will fall to Labour on a small swing. MIDNIGHT Blyth Valley: The Labour seat most marginal to the Liberal Democrats. Hartlepool: Expect a smooth passage to the Commons in this safe seat for Labour's former communications director, Peter Mandelson. Northampton North: If Labour's Janet Thomas topples Tony Marlow, Neil Kinnock is on course for a comfortable majority. Richmond &amp; Barnes: The Liberals have come close before. With a majority of only 1,766 junior Northern Ireland minister Jeremy Hanley is under pressure. Western Isles: The SNP needs a swing of 7.1 per cent to unseat Labour's Calum MacDonald. Nuneaton: If Labour's Bill Olner achieves the 5.2 per cent swing needed to win, John Major will probably have lost his majority. Gloucester: If Labour wins, Conservatives can go to bed now: Neil Kinnock will have a very comfortable majority. Putney: The polls have suggested that Treasury Minister David Mellor may be in trouble. Also in the London borough of Wandsworth is Battersea where fellow-Tory John Bowis defends an 857 majority. Erewash: A Labour gain in this east Midlands seat probably means Neil Kinnock will (just) win an overall majority. If Labour fails here, but has won Nuneaton, we are in hung parliament territory. Don't be surprised if health minister Virginia Bottomley holds South West Surrey (majority 14,343). Both Plymouth Drake and Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth are three-way marginals where anything can happen. Paddy Ashdown will be the first party leader to know the result in his constituency: Yeovil is expected at 12.15. 12.30am By 12.30 the TV pundits should be predicting the final result with more confidence, unless it is very close. Amber Valley: Another crucial east Midlands seat. The defeat of Phillip Oppenheim should confirm an overall Labour majority. Mitcham &amp; Morden: Labour's Siobhain McDonagh needs a 6.5 per cent swing to unseat home office minister Angela Rumbold in this south London seat. Hazel Grove: The Lib Dems are very confident of removing Tory vice-Chairman Sir Tom Arnold in this suburban seat near Manchester. Bury North: A good indication of how well the parties are doing in the north-west, where polls have suggested Conservative support holding up better than elsewhere. Ribble Valley: It will be a remarkable achievement if Lib Dem Mike Carr holds the previously rock-solid Tory seat he snatched in a 1991 by-election. Bath: Tory Chairman Chris Patten defends a 1,412 majority against Lib Dem Don Foster. Birmingham Hall Green: Another weathervane seat, socially typical of the west Midlands. Its capture means an overall Labour majority. Labour will win Gravesham with a 7.7 per cent swing. Roy Hattersley should be re-elected for Birmingham Sparkbrook just before 1.00. 1am By 1.30 around 300 results, nearly half, will be in. Hampstead &amp; Highgate: The bookies were quoting Glenda Jackson 1-9 on to make the Westminster stage. Erith &amp; Crayford: Labour needs a 7.9 per cent swing. A good indication of how well Mr Kinnock is doing in London. Eastbourne: Lib Dem David Bellotti won the seat in an October 1990 by-election. Oxford West &amp; Abingdon: If Paddy's army remove home officer minister John Patten, they may win around 35 seats. Brentford &amp; Isleworth: A close result beckons in this London seat. If Labour fails here, they will probably be short of an outright majority. A close result is on the cards in Southwark &amp; Bermondsey where Lib Dem environment spokesman Simon Hughes defends a majority of only 2,779 against Labour. Around 1.30 we should hear if Neil Kinnock has retained Islwyn (maj 22,947) and if Michael Heseltine has hung on in Henley (maj 17,082). Gaining St Ives at the tip of Cornwall would be an excellent result for the Lib Dems. 1.30am Wallasey: Overseas development minister Lynda Chalker defends a tiny 279 majority. Derbyshire South: Edwina Currie's personal standing may save her even if Labour achieve an 8 per cent swing. Westminster North: Held with a 3,310 majority by Sir John Wheeler. Conservatives have been strong in local government and electoral register has shrunk in recent years. Edinburgh Pentlands: If the polls are right transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind should just hold on, barring an anti-Tory tactical surge north of the border. If Ian Lang loses Galloway, he would be the first cabinet minister defeated since Shirley Williams in 1979. Don't expect Labour to lose Doncaster Central, Holborn &amp; St Pancras or Glasgow Pollak, or the Conservatives to lose Wansdyke, Wellingborough or mid Worcestershire. 2am Falmouth &amp; Camborne: Seb Coe attempts to take over the baton from retiring Cornishman David Mudd. If the Lib Dems are to gain extra seats, Terrye Jones needs to win here. Davyhulme: Labour needs an 8.1 per cent swing to remove Winston Churchill. If Barry Brotherton wins, Neil Kinnock will almost certainly have an outright majority. Colne Valley: A three-way marginal. Barrow &amp; Furness: The reliance of the town on defence (nuclear submarines) may save Tory Cecil Franks. The result from John Major's seat, Huntingdon, is expected around 2.30. By now around 550 results will be in. 2.30am Perth and Kinross: An SNP target, needing an 6 per cent swing. Labour should pick up Ayr and Dulwich. Denzil Davies should hold Llanelli where he has a majority of over 20,000. 3am Former cabinet minister John Biffen will hold Shropshire North. The results from Northern Ireland start to appear: West Belfast may be close between Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the SDLP. The last results 'tonight' should be about 4.15. The next result will be around 11.00 am on Friday. There are only two possible Labour gains left - Kensington and Brecon and Radnor. Neil Kinnock needs to have won at least 321 seats before dawn if he is to have won an outright victory. If John Major has won around 300 he can expect an outright majority. If both have won less, we have a hung parliament. Time for bed. Thanks to the BBC political research unit for the declaration times, which are estimates and subject to recounts.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK drive to resolve Maastricht deadlock BRITAIN led a diplomatic drive yesterday to narrow differences on the Danish question and the European Community budget in an effort to break the threatened deadlock at the Edinburgh summit. The British presidency tabled a new draft plan to meet Danish demands for opt-outs on the Maastricht treaty and promised a revised budget package which would channel more resources to the EC's poorer states. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, praised the draft as 'extremely subtle' which encouraged him to believe that a solution could be found this week, allowing a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty next May. In Bonn, an official said the latest British proposals amounted to 'a very good basis for a possible solution of the problem', although there were still 'one or two points to be watched'. In a pre-summit letter to fellow heads of government, Mr John Major, the prime minister, voiced optimism that governments 'share a determination to reach agreement at Edinburgh'. He said an agreement with Denmark would allow the Community to go ahead together, adding that the suggested presidency declarations 'do not require any reopening of the Maastricht treaty, nor, we believe, reratification by member states'. A senior EC official cautioned, however, that several member states, notably Spain, had warned that to enshrine Danish demands in quasi-treaty form would present constitutional problems which might require reratification of Maastricht. Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said the amended British text 'goes a long way to meeting Denmark's wishes'. 'It is a much better paper than the first. The task in Edinburgh is to achieve a solution. It will be difficult, but I think we shall succeed,' he said. But two of the main opposition parties behind Denmark's seven-party national compromise continued to voice opposition. Mr Major also offered his opposite numbers revised budget proposals. British officials said that the plan would retain the UK presidency's suggestion that the overall increase in Community spending be held to the limits it outlined earlier this month. To the fury of Spain in particular, Britain - backed by Germany - has suggested that the maximum size of the EC budget, the so-called own resources ceiling, should be raised to 1.25 per cent of EC gross national product by the end of 1999. That compares with 1.2 per cent at present and the 1.32 per cent ceiling suggested by the EC Commission. But the officials said new adjustments to the formula - based on VAT receipts as well as GDP - under which national governments contribute to the EC budget, would channel more cash to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. So would the allocation to poorer states of uncommitted contingency funds. It was unclear, however, whether the poorer countries would back the UK plan. Mr Delors seems certain to oppose it. He appealed for support for his own financing plan, saying that a restrictive UK compromise on the budget would emasculate the Community. In spite of the new proposals, British ministers were last night still voicing caution on the outcome of the summit. The prime minister yesterday discussed how the European exchange rate mechanism could be reformed at a private meeting with trade unionists and European employers. Downing Street said the government was 'continuing to look' at possible improvements to the ERM before Britain rejoined. The UK presidency, Page 2 The Edinburgh menu, Page 3</p>

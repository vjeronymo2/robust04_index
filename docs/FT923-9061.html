			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia tries to fight off palm oil competition MR Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's Primary Industries Minister, is leading a palm oil selling mission to Pakistan and India in an effort to counter what Malaysia sees as rising competition from other palm oil producers. 'We see a necessity to step up efforts not only to seek and expand new markets but more importantly to protect our existing markets in the face of rising competition,' said a Malaysian official. Malaysia, the world's largest palm oil producer, faces increased competition for export markets from Indonesia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and a number of producers on the African continent. India was once the main export market for Malaysian palm oil. But sales to India have dropped dramatically in recent years, because of what Malaysian officials describe as India's 'foreign exchange constraints'. In 1987 Malaysia exported more than 1m tonnes of palm oil to India. In 1991 sales to India were only 160,336 tonnes. But sales to Pakistan have improved considerably - from 117,397 tonnes in 1980 to 961,841 tonnes last year. Malaysia produced 6.14m tonnes of palm oil in 1991 and expects to increase this to 6.5m tonnes this year.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALMANAC / MILLION-DOLLAR DEALS: 2 O.C. CITIES IN TOP 15 MARKETS  </P> <P> Almost 700 homes in California sold for $1 million or more in the first three  months of this year, and two Orange County communities ranked among the top 15  housing markets.  </P> <P> Newport Beach and Laguna Beach ranked fifth and 12th, respectively, in a survey  of home sales by Dataquick Information Systems of San Diego. In Newport Beach,  there were 23 million-dollar home sales, while Laguna Beach recorded 12. The  highest-priced home in both cities sold for $3.4 million.  </P> <P> The most expensive house of all sold during the quarter was a  13,423-square-foot mansion built in 1935 in the Bel Air area, a 15-bedroom,  10-bath number that went for $9.25 million in January.  </P> <P> The 685 sales for $1 million or more statewide represented about a 40% increase  over the same quarter a year ago. In more than 30% of the deals, buyers paid  cash, contrasted with just 7% of middle-of-the-road home markets.  </P> <P> But $1 million won't go as far in Beverly Hills as it does in, say, Boise. A  late-1989 Coldwell Banker price survey found that a similar-sized,  middle-management executive home cost $916,666 in the wealthy Los Angeles  suburb but just $82,667 in the Idaho capital.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP 15 MARKETS FOR MILLION-DOLLAR HOMES  </P> <P> Here are the number of million-dollar homes sold in each of the top 15  California markets and the highest price paid in each market during the first  quarter of 1990.  </P> <P> Malibu: 19  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades: 23  </P> <P> Santa Monica: 22  </P> <P> Beverly Hills: 41  </P> <P> Los Angeles: 67  </P> <P> Palos Verdes: 14  </P> <P> Pasadena: 11  </P> <P> Newport Beach: 23  </P> <P> Laguna Beach: 12  </P> <P> </P> <P> MOST EXPENSIVE HOME PURCHASED IN EACH MARKET  </P> <P> In millions of dollars:  </P> <P> Los Angeles : $9.25  </P> <P> Beverly Hills: $6.25  </P> <P> San Diego: $4.70  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades: $4.30  </P> <P> Santa Barbara: $4.20  </P> <P> Malibu: $3.66  </P> <P> Hillsborough: $3.60  </P> <P> Newport Beach: $3.40  </P> <P> Laguna Beach: $3.40  </P> <P> San Francisco: $3.30  </P> <P> Indian Wells: $2.90  </P> <P> Santa Monica: $2.85  </P> <P> San Rafael: $2.65  </P> <P> Palos Verdes: $2.63  </P> <P> Pasadena: $1.95  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Royal Life maintains bonuses on endowments ROYAL LIFE, the life arm of Royal Insurance, has maintained the bonuses on its endowment savings policies. Final pay-outs on 25-year term policies increased by 12 per cent, the highest increase recorded by a life company so far this year. However, Royal's performance on 25-year policies is still a long way behind its competitors - using standard industry assumptions, a 25-year Royal Life policy now pays out Pounds 55,062, while Commercial Union announced last week that an exactly equivalent policy would pay out Pounds 65,596. Pay-outs on 10-year policies fell 5 per cent, in line with an almost universal trend in the industry. Royal Life appears to agree with the theory expressed by Norwich Union when it announced its bonuses last month that investment returns will be lower in the next decade, thanks in part to the discipline of membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Icki Iqbal, actuary for Royal Life, said: 'We may be entering a decade of low inflation, with consequently lower investment returns. Any reduction in bonus rate that is brought about by an era of stable money must be seen as good news for customers.'</p>

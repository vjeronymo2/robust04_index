			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Reading the tea leaves Mr Kenneth Clarke wanted to be chancellor of the exchequer. Now he is learning how difficult the job can be. It was relatively easy to know what to do after sterling had been pushed out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992: interest rates had to be cut and the budget had to be tightened. Today, policy judgment is more finely balanced, with the tax burden about to increase sharply, the base rate of interest down to 5 1/4 per cent and the economy enjoying a modest recovery and falling inflation. Inflation continues to look more than satisfactory. The retail price index, less mortgage interest payments, is up only 2.8 per cent over the 12 months to January 1994, after a 0.4 per cent fall in the latest month. This was a substantially better outcome than generally expected and came despite the budget increases in excise duties. One explanation was heavy discounting in the January sales. But producer output prices - excluding both the volatile food category and tax-distorted beverages, tobacco and petroleum - rose not at all in January and by only 2.6 per cent over the 12 months to January. This was a remarkable performance following a substantial devaluation. Good performance Meanwhile, underlying annual inflation of earnings has been running at 3 per cent for four months. This ought to be consistent with price inflation of less than 2 per cent, which would be within the government's inflation target for the end of this parliament. The question is whether pay inflation can stay so low. Worries include a small rise in pay settlements this year and the probably transient effects of the government's tough pay policies for the public sector. Nevertheless, inflation performance is good. So it must remain, since it is important that a target is actually met, for once. If performance on inflation looks good, that on the recovery is decidedly mixed. The volume of retail sales - up 3.5 per cent in the year to January 1994 - has been growing more rapidly than output of manufacturing, up only 2.2 per cent in the year to December 1993. Meanwhile, the volume of exports, excluding oil and erratics, is estimated to have fallen by  1/2 per cent between the three months ending November 1992 and the same period of 1993, although the volume of comparable imports was up 4 1/2 per cent. All too typically, the unit values of these exports rose by 11 per cent. This, then, has all the appearance of an unbalanced consumer-led recovery, with export prices pushed up to take advantage of devaluation and weak performance of both exports and manufacturing, despite the devaluation. Tail off Prospects are made worse by the high increases in earnings within manufacturing industry, running at 4 1/4 per cent. The annual rate of productivity increase in manufacturing has also halved since last July. As a result, unit costs in manufacturing, which fell 1.7 per cent in the year to the three months ending in July 1993, rose by 0.8 per cent in the year to the three months ending in December. Exports may still improve when the recession in continental Europe comes to an end. Meanwhile, the importance of price cutting for sustaining the growth of retail sales demonstrates that domestic consumption is hardly running away. The growth of consumption may also tail off when the reality of April's tax increases dawns on the population. If so, the pattern of demand would begin to look far better balanced. Demand may also prove disappointing. It would be wrong to get too excited over one month's small jump in unemployment, particularly after four months of decline. But account does need to be taken of the shift from full to part-time employment, which is hidden in the aggregate figures. The overall impression is that the economy is not growing fast enough to tighten overall capacity by very much. If so, unemployment will continue to remain higher than is necessary to contain inflation. On balance, the evidence presented by the veritable avalanche of statistics of the last few days suggests that further loosening of monetary policy may well be required. Lower interest rates are likely and, as happened earlier in the US, should prove consistent with still lower inflation.</p>

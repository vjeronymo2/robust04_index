			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLOJO ADDS SULLIVAN TO HER CACHE;  </P> <P> GRIFFITH JOYNER GETS AWARD TO GO WITH 3 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS  </P> <P> Florence Griffith Joyner, named the Sullivan Award winner for 1988 as the  nation's top amateur athlete, says she's finding retirement difficult to  accept.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I would miss it this much," said FloJo, who announced her  retirement last month.  </P> <P> "I know I looked forward to the days when I wouldn't have to get up and run  around and lift weights, but I really miss it," she added.  </P> <P> Griffith Joyner won three gold medals and a silver at the 1988 Olympics at  Seoul.  </P> <P> Supported by her husband, Al Joyner, and wiping away tears, she said: "It took  me 20 years to get a world record and a gold medal. If I had to do it all over,  I wouldn't change a thing."  </P> <P> She thanked her husband, who served as her coach in the final months of her  career.  </P> <P> "He's done so much," she said. "Getting up in the morning for workouts and  sometimes at midnight. He gave up a lot of his career."  </P> <P> Joyner, 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the long jump, is now being coached by  his wife.  </P> <P> "I've asked myself, 'Was I this hard on her?' " he said. "She shows no pity for  me. She really makes me work."  </P> <P> The stop in Indianapolis is just another mark on a hectic international travel  schedule the 29-year-old from Los Angeles has maintained since setting two  world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the Olympics.  </P> <P> "In recent months I've been to Germany, Harvard, New York, back to Los Angeles,  San Francisco, Houston and back to San Francisco. I'll be home a couple of days  and then I'll be on the road again," she said. "In May, I'll be heading to  Japan for two weeks."  </P> <P> Griffith Joyner joins her sister-in-law, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, on the list of  Sullivan winners. Joyner-Kersee was the 1986 winner.  </P> <P> "What has happened is way beyond anything I ever dreamed," Griffith Joyner  said.  </P> <P> Nine other Olympians also were finalists -- swimmers Matt Biondi and Janet  Evans, figure skater Brian Boitano, kayaker Greg Barton, speedskater Bonnie  Blair, volleyball player Karch Kiraly, boxer Roy Jones, basketball player  Katrina McClain and wrestler John Smith.  </P></p>

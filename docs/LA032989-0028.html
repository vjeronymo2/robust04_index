			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSPAPERS AND YOUNG READERS  </P> <P> The articles on declining newspaper circulation among young people neglected  one important point: advertising. The volume and size of advertising in the  typical American newspaper detracts from its appeal in at least two important  ways. It's responsible for the sheer, physical cumbersomeness of the medium,  and it makes it difficult to take the news content seriously, not when the  articles are spread out over the tops of 3, or 4, or 5 pages.  </P> <P> If newspapers seriously want to enhance their appeal, to young and old readers  alike, they should adopt a tabloid-size format and confine advertising to its  own separate sections. The paper may have to accept less in fees for  "segregated" advertising, but if circulation keeps falling, that's going to  happen anyway. Sooner or later newspaper publishers are going to have to decide  whether they're purveyors of news or merely conduits for retail advertising.  </P> <P> MARK KAARTINEN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

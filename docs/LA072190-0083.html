			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> CITY WARNS CALTRANS ON 10-LANE FREEWAY  </P> <P> More than 60 homes and businesses, including key redevelopment projects, could  be eliminated if the state Department of Transportation widens the Santa Ana  Freeway beyond eight lanes, city officials said this week in a report to  Caltrans.  </P> <P> Ten or 12 lanes "would have an adverse impact on the community," Director of  Engineering Don Jensen said. "We endorse eight lanes."  </P> <P> But Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said a tentative decision has been made  to widen the freeway to 12 lanes in the communities south of Buena Park,  including Anaheim. A determination regarding Buena Park has not been made at  this time, he said, adding that the 12-lane configuration is preferred.  </P> <P> The project is part of a billion-dollar expansion from the intersection of the  Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in Orange County to the San Gabriel River  Freeway (605) in Los Angeles County. Buena Park would be included in the last  phase.  </P> <P> According to the report sent to Caltrans, Buena Park would lose $1.75 million  in annual sales taxes if the freeway is expanded beyond eight lanes. Two  redevelopment projects could be jeopardized -- an auto mall and a retail center  that are being developed adjacent to the freeway for visibility.  </P> <P> "Several, if not most, of the automobile dealers would be faced with relocation  to another city," the report states.  </P> <P> Despite the threat, officials say they will proceed with the redevelopment  projects. "We are going ahead," said Gus Duran, acting director of  redevelopment, about the retail center at Artesia Street and Manchester  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Duran said city officials pursued the projects despite plans for the freeway  widening because it seemed Caltrans would never have adequate funding to carry  out the project. Funding for the Buena Park phase still has not been secured,  Miranda said. Because of this, construction might not begin for seven years, he  said.  </P> <P> The state will hold a series of public hearings on the project before a final  decision is made.  </P> <P> The purpose of the widening project is to reduce traffic congestion and  increase the capacity of existing freeways. A total of 17.5 miles of freeway  are expected to be included in the makeover. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

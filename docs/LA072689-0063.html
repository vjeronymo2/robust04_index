			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER MONUMENTAL BATTLE IN THE WORKS  </P> <P> In what suddenly is becoming a part of San Fernando Valley protest culture,  another group of homeowners is hoping to halt a shopping center development by  having the site declared a "cultural monument."  </P> <P> Residents of Sherman Oaks said Tuesday that they may ask Los Angeles officials  to award landmark status to a 1940s-era row of storefronts that until recently  housed the famed Scene of the Crime mystery bookstore and other neighborhood  shops.  </P> <P> Such a designation would stall a developer hoping to replace the block-long  collection of one-story shops with a new three-story building. The one-year  delay would give the city time to pass a proposed law restricting construction  in the 13600 block of Ventura Boulevard to only two stories.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsuccessful Appeal  </P> <P> Residents of next-door Studio City were unsuccessful last week in an appeal to  the city's Cultural Heritage Commission for cultural monument status for a  carwash, gas station and coffee shop at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards.  Their campaign -- which focused worldwide attention on the Studio City corner  -- was aimed at delaying construction of a $15-million mini-mall until it could  be redesigned.  </P> <P> Richard Close, president of the influential Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said  residents have asked his group to press for such a designation for the  storefronts after Jama Enterprises quietly applied last week for a demolition  permit for the block.  </P> <P> City Councilman Michael Woo interceded to temporarily block the permit,  complaining that Jama reneged on a promise to discuss its planned development  with homeowners before seeking any city permits.  </P> <P> "It's something we've been asked to look at by a lot of residents," Close said.  "It could help us accomplish our goal."  </P> <P> On Friday, Close and Woo both accused Jama of racing to beat the proposed  two-story height limit, included in a preliminary Ventura Boulevard  growth-control recommendation expected to be acted on later this year by the  Planning Commission and City Council.  </P> <P> On Monday, Jama's lawyer, Benjamin M. Reznik, challenged the accusation and  Woo's suspension of the demolition permit.  </P> <P> Reznik said Woo "overreacted, to say the least." He said Jama Enterprises  promised homeowners that it would discuss the project before it sought a  building permit for the new structure, not a demolition permit for the old  storefronts.  </P> <P> He said development plans are being prepared and will be shared with Woo and  homeowners when they are completed.  </P> <P> Reznik said he believes that Woo had no legal right to prevent the demolition  permit from being issued last week. He said Jama will file a lawsuit if the  city tries to delay the project until after the City Council votes on the  boulevard growth controls.  </P> <P> "I hope we can get back to logic, calmness and reason and allow that stretch of  old buildings that are falling apart to be removed," he said.  </P> <P> Unaware of homeowners' plans, Reznik joked: "I shouldn't feel too bad. At least  it's not being considered a cultural landmark."  </P> <P> He could not be reached Tuesday for comment.  </P> <P> Diana Brueggemann, a deputy to Woo, predicted that such a campaign would fail.  "We looked into landmark designation for that site at the first of the year,"  she said. "Our impression was it didn't qualify."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historical Preservation  </P> <P> Other Valley-area residents, meanwhile, have indicated that they may turn to  historical preservation to cope with what they consider overdevelopment.  </P> <P> In Calabasas, residents have started a drive to declare a block-long row of  60-year-old storefronts in Old Town a state "Point of Historical Interest" to  block builders.  </P> <P> And in Woodland Hills, residents hinted this week that they may seek a cultural  or historical designation for 63 old-fashioned street lamps in their community  if the city does not drop a proposal to replace them with modern light  standards.  </P></p>

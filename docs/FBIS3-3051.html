Inevitably, many new problems have  cropped up as a result, including personnel drain. The severity  of this problem has deeply disturbed the relevant authorities  for quite some time. In recent years, there have been cases of  air force pilots being recruited by the civil aviation industry,  which has shocked the air force leadership, the State Council,  high-level CPC officials, and the CPC octogenarians. They gave  instructions and issued orders demanding an end to this  phenomenon, but the problem has yet to be thoroughly solved.  <H5>  Personnel Drain in the Air Force Undermines Morale </H5>   According to informed sources in Beijing, civil aviation  companies nationwide have been recruiting personnel from the  People's Liberation Army air force since the beginning of last  year in order to cover a serious shortage of pilots. As a  result, over 150 trainers and new graduates from the military  aviation academies and schools were engaged by those companies  as pilots and ground personnel, and dozens of air force pilots  ranking at and above the regiment commander level have applied  for early retirement or demobilization under various "excuses"  such as health reasons, after which they joined the contingent  of civil aviation pilots. Throughout the year, over 500 other  servicemen in the air force requested early retirement or  demobilization. In order to achieve their goals, they either  forged physical examination papers or became disgruntled and  slacked off in their work. This has shaken the service's morale  to a certain extent and has undermined the building of the air  force.    Under the impact of the market economy, while air force  personnel are being tapped, what is happening in other fields?  With the development of the economy, ocean cargo in mainland  China has been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, which  urgently requires the expansion of the shipping contingent.  Because the number of ocean shipping college graduates cannot  meet the demand, there have also been some cases in which ocean  shipping departments have recruited navy personnel. A report  issued by the State Council at the beginning of this year shows  that over 25 percent of the middle-aged scientific and  technological personnel in the research institutes under the  ministries of the State Council have left their posts or joined  other trades, leaving over 20 percent of the institutes at a  standstill. As many as 30 percent of the senior teachers in key  middle schools in major cities have left campus. Institutions  of higher learning have lost over 10 percent of their  middle-aged teachers. In big cities, 30 percent of the chief  physicians in hospitals have left, resulting in a serious  shortage of medical staff. The number of economic and financial  management personnel in the relevant departments at the  provincial or ministerial level who give up their original posts  to set up economic entities or accept jobs with by wholly or  partially foreign-funded enterprises is constantly growing. In  Guangdong Province, 30 percent of economic administration  personnel at the section and bureau level have left their jobs  on their own accord. In Shanghai Municipality, over 20 percent  of economic administration personnel at the section level have  moved into economic entities, financial departments, and wholly  or partially foreign-funded enterprises.    All this shows that the phenomenon of professional personnel  being tapped, changing profession, or going into business is  very serious. This will certainly promote the growth of new  organizations which badly need professionals, but it has caused  a great deal of difficulty for the organizations where these  people used to work and has undermined their stability.  <H3>  The State Council Issues an Order Prohibiting Such  Recruitment </H3>   The sources said: The most important cause of such personnel  drain is that new organizations do urgently need professionals,  and they offer much more handsome salaries and benefits than the  units where those people used to work. For example, the  economic and financial management personnel from government  departments receive 50 percent to over 300 percent more pay  after they have transferred to wholly or partially  foreign-funded enterprises.    Take again the case of civil aviation departments tapping  air  force personnel. Figures indicate that China's aviation sector  suffered from a lack of professionals for many years. Beginning  in the mid-1980's, the industry grew at an annual rate of 25  percent, but the increase of professionals was only about 12  percent. Into the 1990's, the industry has maintained a growth  rate of 25 percent each year, but the annual rate of personnel  increase has been less than 20 percent. Hungry for qualified  professionals, the industry turned its attention to the air  force, flaunting its high salaries and benefits.    It has  been learned that the monthly salary of captains who fly the  main lines of all aviation companies is normally 4,000 yuan to  6,000 yuan (renminbi, similarly hereinafter), which is  equivalent to 10 or 15 times the monthly salary of an active  military officer ranking at the regiment or division level.  Besides, those captains are also entitled to housing, job  placements for their family members, long holidays, and liberal  benefits. For example, a pilot working for Air China can get  extras in kind worth 3,000 yuan a year. The extras in kind that  a flight attendant working for Eastern Airlines can get each  year are worth nearly 5,000 yuan. Such handsome conditions are  very attractive to officers on the active list, who would try  every possible means to retire or demobilize earlier and join  the civil aviation industry.    The civil aviation industry's recruitment of pilots from the  air force has shocked the air force CPC committee and high-level  CPC officials, and they had to adopt countermeasures to prevent  such cases from spreading. In mid-January, General Cao  Shuangming, commander of the air force, announced the procedures  for processing officers' applications for early retirement or  demobilization at an enlarged meeting of the air force. The  application for early retirement or demobilization of a cadre  ranking at or above the regiment commander level must be  submitted to the air force headquarters for examination and  approval, and a cadre ranking at or above the division level  must submit these types of applications to the general office of  the Central Military Commission for review. If the reasons are  found to have been fabricated or the documentation forged, they  will be subject to military disciplinary action, which includes  striking their names off the Army roll and expelling them from  the party.    In the meantime, State Council Premier Li Peng issued a  "Strict Ban on Recruiting Servicemen as Civil Aviation Air and  Ground Personnel." This order stipulates: Civil aviation  companies are not allowed to recruit air and ground personnel of  the air force on the active list for any reason; or to admit  into the civil aviation industry military personnel who do not  hold retirement or demobilization certificates issued by the  Central Military Commission General Office, the Ministry of  National Defense, or a given military region; or to recruit  teachers and students of military aviation academies and schools.  <H5>  The Permanent Cure Is To Generate More Professionals </H5>   A personality from the political circles in Beijing pointed  out: The air force party committee's decision and the State  Council's order will only curtail the recruitment temporarily  and do not represent a permanent solution. To effect a thorough  cure, it is necessary to liberate the mind, deepen reform, and  bring up more professionals. This matter should be arranged by  the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] under an  overall plan.    According to this personality, the CPC octogenarians and  high- level party officials frequently discussed the issue of  training the civil aviation industry's air and ground personnel.  Last December, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed:  "To develop civil aviation, priority should be given to  training civil aviation pilots, ground technical personnel, and  flight directors as well as expanding the civil aviation  contingent. Only by so doing can we ensure the quality of civil  aviation personnel, implement the policy of safety first, and  show our commitment to the people's cause." The "Decision on  Certain Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist  Market Economic System," adopted at the third plenary session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee last November, also clearly  pointed out: "The establishment of the socialist market  economic system and the realization of modernization ultimately  depend on the improvement of the quality of the people and the  training of professionals." Therefore, "it is necessary to  resort to a variety of forms and methods to bring up a large  number of skilled workers and all kinds of professionals."  Regrettably, this decision has not been conscientiously  implemented. But there have been signs of change recently. On  21 February, the very day when the CAAC held the largest-scale  flight safety work conference in the history of China's civil  aviation sector, the Northwest Space Training Company [xi bei yu  hang xun lian gong si 6007 0554 1342 5300 6064 4886 0361 0674],  a subsidiary of Northwest Airlines of the United States,  announced that it has reached an agreement with five Chinese  aviation companies, Southwest Airlines, Eastern Airlines, North  Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and Xiamen Airlines, which involves  training in piloting MD-82 and Boeing 757 passenger planes for  the 250 pilots of these companies. This company will also  undertake the training of 30 Boeing 757 flight attendants for  Xiamen Airlines, and this number may be raised to 200 some time  later. Now it all depends on whether or not Chen Guangyi, the  newly appointed CAAC director, can seize this opportunity and  push the industry's personnel training one step ahead.    The personality from Beijing's political circles believed  that the Army and other fields also need reforms, including the  reform of salary system, to avoid personnel drain. But this  depends on the vision and determination of high-level CPC  officials.</p>

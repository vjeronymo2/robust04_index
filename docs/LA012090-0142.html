			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> FULL-TIME GRAFFITI REMOVER TO BE HIRED  </P> <P> The City Council this week unanimously agreed to hire a worker whose full-time  task will be to remove graffiti throughout the city.  </P> <P> Graffiti has increased in recent years, making it cheaper to hire an employee  than to continue to pay a private company to eradicate the paint, Community  Services Director Ronald E. Hagan said.  </P> <P> Along with the worker, the city will purchase a truck and other equipment  needed for the anti-graffiti effort. Yearly expenses should be about $52,000,  about $8,000 less than the city pays to Commerce-based Graffiti Removal Inc.  </P> <P> Volunteers still will be used to paint out graffiti on some private property in  the city.

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (2): Back from the honeymoon - Inflation is a pressing problem for the economy ANYONE WHO uses a taxi in Lisbon instantly confronts one of the most pressing problems of the Portuguese economy. Prices are rising so quickly that the meters cannot keep track, and all the taxis have to carry a chart to show the latest 9 per cent fare increase. The continued high rate of inflation, combined with a recent slow-down in the growth of the economy, remain among the chief challenges facing the country. If Portugal's economic honeymoon since joining the European Community in 1986 is not yet over, then it has certainly run into its first significant lovers' tiff. The economic record during the first few years after accession to the EC looked extremely impressive. Fuelled by investment and export growth, national output grew during 1986-90 at an average of 4.6 per cent a year, compared with 3.1 per cent across the EC. As new jobs were created, unemployment halved over the period, to 4.2 per cent, or just a fraction of the figure in many of its neighbouring states. Meanwhile, the budget deficit also fell sharply. But now conditions have changed. Growth has slowed to an estimated 2.7 per cent for 1991, and the residual problems of a continued high deficit and inflation - estimated at 11.4 per cent last year  - have dampened the original optimism. Many economists believe further progress to improve the state of the economy will prove increasingly difficult. Miguel Namorado Rosa, a senior economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, says he believes prospects for the corporate sector are now much gloomier than they appeared last autumn. The economy, which is extremely open, has moved from one in counter-cycle to the rest of Europe to one closely linked to it. As a result, recession elsewhere on the continent has inevitably contributed to the current slow-down. 'We saw some signs of deceleration which were acceptable after the rapid pace of growth over six consecutive years,' he says. 'But what we did not realise then was the extent of the cooling of the economy: 1991 was clearly a climax of political and economic goals.' His most recent projections suggest that growth will continue to slow to 2.2 per cent in 1992, and increase only marginally to 2.3 per cent next year. That compares with more optimistic estimates in the government's current plans of 3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1993. The continued appreciation of the escudo, fuelled in part by high interest rates, has had a detrimental effect on the economy by reducing the competitiveness of Portuguese exports, argues Mr Namorado Rosa. The strong growth of tourism has compensated in part for the decline in the export of products. He questions how much longer this trend can last as the recession lifts across Europe, the civil war ends in Yugoslavia and other parts of eastern Europe begin to develop as holiday destinations. Traditional exports such as textiles, footwear and clothing do not generally use imported raw materials - whose cost to producers has fallen as the exchange rate has risen. However, the price of Portuguese goods abroad has increased because of the strong escudo. Combined with recession in many key markets, demand has slumped. At the same time, these key sectors are labour-intensive, and so they have been severely affected by high wage demands spurred by continued inflation. The high cost of capital has also had a depressing effect on investment. Very tight monetary policies have been introduced to control inflation. But that has sustained interest rates above 20 per cent and discouraged businesses from taking out loans. However, high interest rates have attracted capital inflows which are undermining the central bank's monetary policies by keeping liquidity levels high. Inflation remains a key concern, but one that he believes may be difficult to reduce much further. He estimates that it will fall to 9.5 per cent in 1992 and 8 per cent next year. 'As we approach 8 to 9 per cent inflation, further progress may prove very difficult,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. 'Perhaps this is a structural level of minimum inflation the economy is beginning to accept.' His pessimism is shared by Professor Alfredo de Sousa, a respected independent commentator on economic affairs. Prof de Sousa says he is disappointed with the government's 1992 budget, which was debated in parliament last month. While the budget deficit is likely to fall from 6.3 per cent in 1991 to a planned 5.2 per cent this year, the reduction is being fuelled by greater tax revenues, reflecting changes in VAT rates and greater efficiency in collection. Together these should help to increase direct tax revenues by 22.1 per cent and indirect taxes by 27.5 per cent. Nevertheless, government expenditure is also rising sharply for a wide range of functions, including a public works programme. New money will be required for a substantial public-sector wage settlement. A proposal for a 10 per cent rise is likely to be translated in a real increase of nearer 14 per cent, with considerable inflationary implications. Prof de Sousa argues that the Banco de Portugal, the central bank, has tried to compensate for government policy, keeping up interest rates because the state has failed to control spending sufficiently. 'Lighter monetary policy to help investment, and a tougher budget would be better,' he says. 'The rigour in the budget is not so much for the state as for the taxpayers: they will have to pay for it. Austerity is being transfered from the government to the taxpayer and the bank.' 'It would be politically unpopular to restrain salaries. The government doesn't want to lose votes in forthcoming local elections or risk social unrest, particularly while it holds the EC presidency,' he says. The challenge falls particularly on Jorge Braga de Mercado, the recently-appointed finance minister, who is already raising eyebrows with his outspoken manner. Professor de Sousa believes that the economy could continue to grow at 3 to 4 per cent over the next two years, but only if it is accompanied by what he calls 'a rational budget policy'. He says the budget is rational in political, not economic, terms. 'The current policy is unsustainable,' he says.</p>

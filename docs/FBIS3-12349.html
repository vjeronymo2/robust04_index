Hundreds of Palestinian women marched alongside the  demonstrators carrying black flags in mourning for the 52  Palestinian Moslems who were killed in a West Bank mosque on  Friday by an Israeli settler.    They shouted "Death to 'Arafat" and "Death to Zionists"  before burning an effigy of the PLO leader at the Martyrs  Cemetery, where many Palestinians killed in confrontations with  Israelis are buried alongside Lebanese.    Supporters of Hezbollah and radical Palestinian  organisations  based in Damascus participated in the demonstration which took  off from outside a mosque in Beirut's mostly Shiite Moslem  southern suburbs.    Many denounced the September 13 peace deal between the PLO  and Israel.</p>

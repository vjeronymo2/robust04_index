			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo trembles The prospect of Glaxo's forthcoming patent tussle was highlighted in the Sunday press and sent the pharmaceutical group's shares down 13 1/2 to 534p. The court case with drugs group Novopharm over the patent for Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug Zantac starts next Monday. If Glaxo loses the case, generic or unbranded versions of Zantac could be available in the US as early as 1995, eating into the earnings of a product that represents some two-thirds of Glaxo's profits. Selling in London continued in New York and the concern gave dealers a chance to take profits elsewhere in the sector. Wellcome suffered on criticism of its latest Aids drug research and shed 4 to 683p, while SmithKline Beecham was given a push by Nomura's pharmaceuticals team, which argued that the stock had outperformed the sector and it was time to take profits. SmithKline 'A' dipped 4 to 441p.</p>

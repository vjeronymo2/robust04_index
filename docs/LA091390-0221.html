			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEACH SLAYING SUSPECT 'WAS LIVING IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE,' FATHER SAYS;  </P> <P> CRIME: TEEN-AGER IS DESCRIBED AS 'REMORSEFUL' OVER THE KILLING BUT INSISTS HE  ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.  </P> <P> The parents of a Laguna Niguel youth who allegedly shot to death a Capistrano  Beach man said Wednesday that their son is "remorseful" but insisted that he  acted in self-defense.  </P> <P> "He was living in fear of his life," said Don Steffens, father of the Dana  Hills High School junior accused of murdering Robert James Elliott, 18. "He was  constantly beaten up, and there was nothing I or the police could do. So he  took matters in his own hands."  </P> <P> Charged with murder and assault with a deadly weapon, Christian Aaron Steffens  appeared for his detention hearing before Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert  Jameson. Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper recommended that the 16-year-old be  tried as an adult. Jameson is expected to rule on the recommendation when the  hearing resumes Wednesday.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Chris Collins, who was appointed Wednesday to represent  Christian Steffens, requested a postponement, saying he needed additional time  to review the case.  </P> <P> The killing occurred about 1 p.m. Saturday after an argument between the two at  the Dana Strand beach in Dana Point. Witnesses said that they had argued, that  Steffens walked away and that Elliott pursued him.  </P> <P> Steffens drew a gun, turned and pulled the trigger, witnesses said. The gun  didn't fire, but he pulled the trigger a second time, striking Elliott in the  chest, according to witnesses.  </P> <P> Standing outside the courthouse, Don Steffens spoke to reporters for the first  time since his son's arrest last Saturday and disputed reports that the killing  stemmed from a broken window in Elliott's truck. Elliott's friends said  Christian Steffens had reportedly smashed the window with a baseball bat about  three weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It's a lot more than a $50 (window)," Don Steffens said. "It is what happens  when youths break away from 'wannabe skinheads.' They kept following  (Christian) as if they were on a recruitment drive."  </P> <P> Don Steffens said his son had been beaten "numerous times" during the last year  by Elliott and his friends. He said Christian had belonged to a group of  "wannabe skinheads" who hang out on beaches in South County.  </P> <P> Don Steffens said the beatings of his son intensified during the last few  weeks, adding that the wall near his son's room had been shot at. The father  said he made a few reports to police about the harassment but that no action  was taken.  </P> <P> "I thought Christian's (complaints) were a typical teen-ager's  over-exaggeration," Don Steffens said.  </P> <P> Lt. Robert Rivas, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, said  investigators are looking into a report that Christian Steffens was beaten by  youths who live in the area. He declined further comment.  </P> <P> Elliott's parents and close friends have denied that the victim belonged to a  skinhead gang or that he had threatened the accused. They maintain that Elliott  simply wanted restitution for the window the young Steffens had broken.  </P> <P> Craig Whittaker, a pastor with the Calvary Chapel of Capistrano Beach, said  Wednesday that Elliott was an active member of the church's youth group.  </P> <P> "We're going to miss his involvement," Whittaker said. "He enjoyed coming here,  and it was nice having him around."  </P> <P> Christian Steffens appeared in court wearing a blue T-shirt, blue elastic  trousers and blue jogging shoes.  </P> <P> His mother, Cynthia Steffens, 38, said that her son was "remorseful" and that  he had been placed on a suicide watch at Juvenile Hall in Orange. The parents  said they did not know where their son obtained the gun that he allegedly used  to kill Elliott.  </P> <P> Don Steffens said that since the shooting he had moved out of his Laguna Niguel  apartment with his wife and 11-year-old son because he feared reprisals.  Steffens said he would not return to the neighborhood "for the safety of my  family."  </P></p>

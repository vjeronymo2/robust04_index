			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Eurocorps aims outside region Eurocorps, the newly-formed army group with divisions from France, Germany and Belgium, will provide rapid reaction forces for Europe even beyond EU boundaries. Lieutenant General Helmut Willmann, its commander, said yesterday it would provide rapid deployment forces outside the central European area once German constitutional difficulties had been resolved. This would be in addition to its role of defending continental Europe. Eurocorps currently has 650 main battle tanks and 50,000 troops. At present it would have to use transport aircraft such as the Hercules for its rapid deployment forces. However, it is, thought keen to use the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), a bigger military transport being designed by a European consortium. The endorsement will come as a boost to the consortium, which is facing an uphill battle in Britain. The Royal Air Force has to choose between ordering the new generation of Hercules C-130J aircraft, and refurbishing its existing fleet while waiting for the FLA. British Aerospace, part of the FLA consortium, argues that Britain will lose its position as sole wing manufacturer for such European projects if the RAF chooses the US Hercules.</p>

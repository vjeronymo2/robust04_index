			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["From the Guidance of Islam" column by Shaykh </F> 'Abd-al-Ghaffar al-'Abbasi: "The Faith Campaign Sought by the  Leader Needs Care and Following Up"]    [Excerpts] Religious upbringing is important, because  religion is basic to the life of the individual and society.  [passage omitted]    The faith campaign [al-hamlah al-imaniyah], whose positive  results have been felt by our upright leader President Saddam  Husayn, shows the leader president thinks highly of the faith  issue, which is represented by the call to follow the teachings  of the Holy Koran, not just repeat them. The Koranic courses,  which will be held for children in mosques during the Summer  holidays, will consist of the true thought which came in the  revelation to Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of  God be upon him. The call of faith has come in response to the  revelation's aims of bringing up children according to the  teachings of the Koran. This call has come at the right time,  when the nation is facing the revelation's enemies, the enemies  of justice and the people. The leader's ambitions will be  achieved by the preachers in the field. The Koranic sessions  are only one aspect of bringing up children according to the  teachings of the Koran. Therefore, we appeal to guardians to  urge their children to respond to this luminous call, which the  leader and God's faithful servant Saddam Husayn has adopted and  advocated in order to bring up a faithful generation that will  love God, the homeland, and the leader through the sublime  principles they will learn from the Holy Book they will read.  This will prepare them to resist the evils of the enemies.  When the young generation is strong by its faith and its  struggle for the sake of principles, the enemies will retreat.  This is the state we are all struggling for so the plots will  backfire on the enemies. As the leader president said: We are  gaining the youths in order to guarantee the future.

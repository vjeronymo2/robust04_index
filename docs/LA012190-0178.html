			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ISRAEL;  </P> <P> PAPER SAYS ETHIOPIA GOT CLUSTER BOMBS  </P> <P> U.S. officials reportedly suspect Israel of sending cluster bombs to Ethiopia  and have unconfirmed reports that the Marxist government there has used them  against rebels.  </P> <P> The unnamed officials did not say when Israel might have sent the weapons, how  many were involved or whether the bombs were American- or Israeli-made, the New  York Times reported. It said Israel is seeking to establish strong relations  with Ethiopia because it wants Addis Ababa's cooperation on allowing Ethiopian  Jews to emigrate to Israel. An Israeli Embassy spokeswoman in Washington denied  that Israel gave or sold cluster bombs to the Ethiopians.  </P></p>

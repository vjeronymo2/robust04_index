According to data from the General Staff, every year only  half of all young men who are legally obliged to perform their  "citizen's duty to the motherland" actually serve in the Army.  Because the number of recruits using various kinds of  deferments is so huge, when it comes to the remaining  candidates, the choice is severely limited. "The Army gets  those who were not successful in fleeing"--that is the malicious  way in which those who know a lot about yearly conscriptions  describe the phenomenon. Even if such views are exaggerated,  statistics regarding service waivers for potential conscripts  are a very serious problem for commanders of military units. In  some subdivisions, during the first weeks and months of  service--that is, within the so-called short way--as many as 15  to 20 percent of soldiers drop out for, among other reasons,  ailments that have just been diagnosed. It is practically  impossible to make up for losses in incomplete crews of combat  vehicles, while legal provisions do not provide for the  possibility of conducting a follow-up conscription.    The civil rights spokesman has already several times  described the situation of an insufficient number of soldiers  having to perform tasks designated for full subdivisions--which,  by definition, means that the soldiers have a much greater  burden to bear--as violating the principles of equality, which  also means a violation of civil rights.    According to officers responsible for the recruitment and  adaptation of young soldiers, many conscripts conceal their  ailments on purpose--at the point of recruitment, as well as for  the first few days--to be able to avail themselves of the right  to full medical treatment at the state's expense after a medical  board issues a judgment saying the ailment could have been  acquired during service. "A citizen aware of his rights simply  uses them"--this is the way officers comment on that phenomenon  and also on conscripts leaving service after the first several  days not only with a medical waiver, which practically puts  their future use to the Army into question, but also being  financially supported. That is because every soldier,  regardless of whether he has served a day or a year in the Army,  is currently entitled to an allowance of approximately 4 million  zlotys, on average.    According to medical services, there is nothing strange in  all kinds of human deficiencies and ailments coming to surface  in the initial period of military service. Often, it is the  first time in years that young men are subjected to such intense  physical training, which helps surface all problems associated  with the spine, flat feet, or concealed deficiencies of the  circulation system. High stress levels and a sudden change in  life-styles are also often the basis for a so-called  disadaptation syndrome, which manifests itself in an inability  to adapt oneself to the extreme conditions under which military  service takes place. But we are not an exception in that  regard: Psychologists for almost all armies have been observing  the same syndrome.</p>

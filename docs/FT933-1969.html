			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Traders take initiative as Frankfurt rises 1.6% THERE WAS some talk that a firm dollar early in the day gave bourses a good start, but most centres had their own story to tell, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended Friday's rally, the DAX index rising 30.85, or 1.6 per cent, to 1,912.84 on the session and by another 10 points in the post bourse. Following the relaxed line taken last week by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the retiring Bundesbank president, there were hopes of lower repo rates this week after the upcoming M3 and inflation indications. However, Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that this was a traders' market. 'Investor interest was rather weak,' he said. Turnover fell from DM12.5bn to DM7.8bn. Daimler, which disclosed big losses last Friday, once again led the rally, putting on DM24.50 to DM746 in the official session and climbing further in the London afternoon. Having been told that the September quarter is going to be no better for Daimler, traders were saying that all the bad news was now in the price - which has risen from DM610 in the past three months. PARIS closed moderately higher, erasing midsession losses. The CAC-40 index ended up 7.86 at 2,107.36 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn. With the publication yesterday of the preliminary prospectus for the privatisation of BNP, the bank's investment certificates shed FFr18 to FFr544. The government has said that the privatisation process will be completed by December 20 at the latest. Michelin lost FFr2.2 to FFr177.3 ahead of today's interim results. The consensus is that the tyre manufacturer will release a substantial first half loss. Mr Christopher de Mattos at Hoare Govett said: 'excluding restructuring provisions we are forecasting a loss of FFr600m for the period. The size of restructuring provisions is far from clear, but the company is laying off at least 10,000 workers over the 1993 and 1994 financial years, possibly leading to provisions of FFr2bn to FFr3bn this year. In spite of this poor short term outlook, we remain positive on the share for the longer term'. Elsewhere in the automotive sector Valeo rose FFr29 to FFr1,056, but off the day's high of FFr1,080, believed to have been the result of a buy recommendation. AMSTERDAM was driven mainly by options trading which lifted the CBS Tendency index by 1.4 to 125.4. With the major companies now having released interim results the main news this week will come from the release of the budget, expected today. 'With a general election scheduled for May 1994,' said UBS in London, 'the government is more likely to accept some modest overshooting of budget targets, rather than proposing more spending cuts'. ZURICH took advantage of a firm local currency to advance 1.4 per cent, with banks and insurance in the van. The SMI index rose 33.2 to 2,418.4, Zurich Insurance adding SFr26 to SFr1,202 in continued response to last Friday's half-year figures and UBS, in strong demand, rising SFr22 to SFr1,180. Georg Fischer, the engineering group, fell 2.9 per cent in immediate response to its forecast of a worse than expected loss of up to SFr50m for the full year. However, the shares ended just SFr11 easier at SFr885 after the group said it expected to break even in 1994. Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, which were under pressure last week, picked up to finish SFr40 higher at SFr1,085. Jelmoli, the retail group, surged SFr60 or 8.2 per cent to SFr790. Hoare Govett, which has recommended the share, has forecast doubled earnings in 1994. MADRID rose on both technical and fundamental grounds, said FG, the brokers, derivatives traders buying baskets of equities as they sold futures at a premium, and banks gaining as the Bank of Spain lowered their reserve requirements. The general index closed 3.85 higher at 288.85 in turnover estimated at Pta17.8bn. Bankinter and BBV led the banking sector with gains of Pta350 to Pta10,500, and Pta80 to Pta3,500 respectively. MILAN edged lower, the Comit index losing 5.30 at 590.85. Insurers were an exception following the start of Allebanza's rights issue last Thursday. Allianza rose L364 to L16,996, while Generali added L280 to L39,800. Ferruzzi remained volatile, opening limit down before bouncing back to close L26.50 higher at L291.50 in highly speculative trade as investors decided that the 10 per cent declines seen in each of the six previous trading sessions had been overdone. BRUSSELS fell back, with the Bel-20 index dropping below the 1,300 level for the first time since early July. The index ended off 10.82 at 1,290.84 in turnover of BFr1.25bn on the last day of the account. ISTANBUL lost 2.4 per cent on profit-taking after an early rally had carried the market to an all-time high at midsession. The composite index closed down 333.3 at 14,126.5 in turnover of TL1,600bn. WARSAW plunged after a strong showing by left-wing parties in Sunday's elections, the WIG index falling 443, or 6.3 per cent to 6,611.7.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 20                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1269.99    1271.40     1273.25    1274.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1274.85    1274.86     1276.40    1278.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00       15.00      Close FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1345.63    1348.13     1348.92    1348.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1348.24    1349.26     1348.72    1351.78  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Sep 17    Sep 16    Sep 15    Sep 14    Sep 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1265.02   1257.07   1260.47   1279.94   1276.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1343.60   1335.87   1337.35   1357.12   1351.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value   1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1278.11; 200 - 1355.42 Low/day: 100 - 1269.71 200 - 1345.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Self-regulation, no last chance IT IS now accepted wisdom that, after all the scandals of the last few years, self-regulation in the City of London is down to its last chance. But accepted wisdom is always a lagging indicator. If the City believes its own research project from the Corporation of London and the London Business School, which has just produced its interim report, there is no time for another try. Its most important preliminary finding is that regulatory troubles could be the greatest threat to the City's future in Europe. It is not just that the present system is both cumbersome and ineffective (though that should be enough to merit a death sentence). The real danger is that any revised and 'improved' system is likely to be over-ridden by Brussels. Revision would therefore be a dangerous waste of time, despite the persistent belief that self-regulation is a source of London's strength. However, there should still be time for the City to take the kind of lead in effective regulation that the Commission might regard as a model. The would-be revisers are living in the distant past. It is true that self-regulation in London was once a source of strength, but it could not be sustained after the Big Bang. It used to work because though the rules were imprecise - simply a consensus on what was acceptable conduct - enforcement, through the blackball, was swift and ruthless. The post-1986 rules turned this system upside down: we were left with huge doorstops of rule books, but no effective enforcement at all. There are two further weaknesses in the current system: it is run by the wrong people, and for the wrong objectives. Those inside the market could run an informal system very effectively, and they always knew that the prime objective was to make the City's services completely trustworthy for the outsiders who used them. Enforcing detailed rules, by contrast, is a job for lawyers, not traders; no wonder it has been ill-done. The traders have made matters worse by devoting too much of their attention to protecting rival insiders rather than users and outside investors. This was perhaps inevitable while excessive competition squeezed margins almost out of existence, but the result has been to bring us to the brink of the very disaster that the City used to avoid at all personal cost: a loss of public confidence in the markets. This threshold has already been crossed in Tokyo, as it was in New York after the 1929 crash, and with the same result: a collapse in volume. Visibly effective regulation may well, then, be the price of survival, as it was seen to be in New York when the 1933 Securities Act was brought in, as one of the first moves in the New Deal. The markets were demoralised by low reputation and reduced incomes (does this sound familiar?); so James M Landis, the brilliant young lawyer in charge of the legislation, and later first head of the Securities and Exchange Commission which its created, saw at once that he could harness market self-interest to the cause of tight regulation. Though markets have changed out of recognition in six decades, the basic Landis approach still looks valid. First, adequate, verifiable information; second, effective powers to enforce disclosure on those who are reluctant; third, adequate staff to pursue wilful wrongdoers. All the things, in short, that were lacking in the Maxwell affair. He first won the enthusiastic support of the accounting profession, whose efforts to impose better standards had limped along for years on a voluntary basis (familiar again?), and the acquiescence of traders. The result was an Augean clean-up at a pace that Hercules might have envied. The legislation passed almost unopposed. Sam Rayburn, in charge in the House of Representatives, remarked that he did not know whether this was because 'it was so damned good, or so damned incomprehensible'. The SEC got off to a flying start: in its first 15 months not a single decision was challenged in the courts. Men like Landis are born, not made; but his system still works, and we can learn from it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the newspaper GRANMA printed Decree-Law No.  149 on the confiscation of goods and assets obtained through  illegal enrichment. The document reflects the decision adopted  by the Cuban parliament in response to demands by the majority  of our people, charging the Council of State with adopting  effective and exemplary measures against those who obtain  illegal possessions as a result of theft, speculation,  embezzlement, black market activities, or other forms of  enrichment that negatively affect the most vital interests of  our society.    The decree-law provides for the confiscation and  expropriation by the Cuban State, without any right of  indemnification, of goods and assets obtained by people who  directly or through third parties illegally increase their  possessions in amounts beyond their normal income.    The minister of finance will impose, through a resolution,  the sanction of confiscation of goods and income in cases to  which Decree-Law No. 149 refers. The Republic's attorney general  will have the authority and legal faculties necessary to conduct  investigations, and to substantiate procedures of confiscation,  acting on his own initiative by virtue of any information  obtained.    The confiscation process will be directed against property  owners, holders, or bearers of goods and assets, including those  of third parties who benefited from them and who fictitiously  appear as their owners. The attorney general's office, according  to the results of the preliminary investigations, through a  resolution, can retain the goods and assets of the person  affected, and take any precautionary measures necessary to  guarantee the fulfillment of the law.    The attorney general's office will also determine any  actions  required by public officials, employees of any entity, or by  administrative or public officials to substantiate the case, and  to implement any preventative measures that it may determine.  These actions must be executed within a specific period of time.    According to the decree-law, once the attorney general's  office adopts the necessary preventative measures on goods and  assets, he will immediately call for legal proceedings in which  those actions must be substantiated, and where those affected  can present documents to justify the legitimacy of possession of  those goods. According to the result of the proceedings, the  attorney general's office will adopt one of the following  actions:    Prepare the preventative measures that correspond to the  goods and assets in case of not having already done so, and in  that case, to ratify or modify the established measures or to  annul them;    Pigeonhole the case file and annul the preventative  measures,  granting the return of goods and assets to their legal  titleholders and owners;    Present the records with the confiscatory claim to the  minister of finance and begin penal proceedings independent of  the confiscatory action, if the investigation determines the  existence of a crime.    Decree-Law No. 149 establishes that its implementation will  be retroactive, given social interest, public use, and national  needs. All acts carried out in an attempt to cover up the  illegal character of an acquisition of goods or assets to which  the document refers, and all actions carried out to avoid its  application are annulled and lose all judicial value.    The Council of Ministers is in charge of dictating  regulation  of the decree-law. All laws, decree-laws, decrees, and other  legal dispositions that oppose the fulfillment of this  Decree-Law No. 149 are abolished. Decree-Law No. 149 will become  enforceable from the moment of its publication in the official  gazette of the Republic of Cuba.</p>

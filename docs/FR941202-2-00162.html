			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State governments shall be the primary accrediting authority. The state's Laboratory Accreditation Program will be audited and approved by the Director's Office. As the accrediting authority, states will have full responsibility for ensuring conformance with the national standard established by NELAC. States will be responsible for accrediting applicant organizations through approving applications, performing on-site assessments and maintaining performance evaluation sample programs. States are responsible for ensuring that on-site inspectors are trained in accordance with NELAP requirements. States shall submit the names, and appropriate accreditation material, to the EPA for inclusion in the National Laboratory Database. States may choose to contract accreditation activities to a third party (non-government) agency. If contracted to a third party, states remain the accrediting authority and retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with the standards established by NELAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.4.3&blank;Joint Federal and State Roles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NELAC (Conference) shall be the joint responsibility of the Federal Government (Agency) and the state accrediting authorities. As provided in the following section on structure of the Conference and the Conference Bylaws, state accrediting authorities and the Agency share responsibilities of governance, analysis and establishment of policy, and analysis and establishment of technical standards as they apply to the NELAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.4.4&blank;Other Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All other interested parties including, but not limited to, the laboratory industry, clients of the laboratory industry, environmental or other public interest groups, and the general public, shall function as contributors to the Conference. In this role, these other parties shall bring technical and policy issues to the attention of the Conference, its managing Board, or its subcommittees. It is anticipated that these issues shall be brought to the Conference in the form of reports, presentations, discussion material, or other forms of documentation for presentation at the annual Conference, committee, or subcommittee meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1.5&blank;Scope of the Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The scope of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program shall encompass the necessary scientific testing to serve all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring, compliance or other functions mandated by statutes and pursuant regulations. Some of the statutes are the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA): the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act); the Clean Air Act (CAA); and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In addition, the program shall also include provisions to permit special requirements or fields of testing promulgated by any of the States and/or Territories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the program shall not be implemented or administered in a way which limits the ability of local, state or federal agencies to investigate and prosecute enforcement cases. Specifically, when engaged in the collection and analysis of forensic evidence to support litigation those agencies may use any procedure that is appropriate given the nature of the investigation, subject only to the bounds of sound scientific practice. This program shall not apply to those government laboratories engaged solely in the analysis of forensic evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

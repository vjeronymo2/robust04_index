			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Technology: Curb on Czech software copycats International software producers are starting to take action against copycats in eastern Europe. In the first concerted attempt to enforce software copyright legislation in east European courts, the Czech branch of the Business Software Alliance, an international association of software companies, is acting against two local companies. Robert Holleyman, president of the US-based BSA, said in Prague that police from the city's criminal investigation department had raided the offices of Dialog Agro - a computer company with Czech, US and Russian capital - on March 17, seizing 'suspected pirate copies' of packages from Microsoft, Lotus, Symantec and two local developers, PJ Soft and Software602, all installed for the firm's own internal use. Holleyman also said a Czech computer distributor, VT Data - suspected of reselling pirated programs - was raided by police in January and that civil and criminal actions had been initiated. Under the terms of the Czech Republic's criminal code, anyone found pirating software faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or a Kcs2m (Pounds 46,000) fine. The BSA estimates that 86 per cent of computer programs in use in the country are copied illegally, a proportion similar to that of Spain and Italy but lower than in most other east European states, while the legal market employed 15,000 locals and produced revenues of Kcs9m last year. Lori Forte, BSA's European affairs director, said that, if anything, Poland rather than the Czech Republic had been the 'black sheep' in the region with pirated software packages sold openly on market stalls in Warsaw. A comprehensive copyright law stipulating maximum five-year jail terms for offenders was ratified by the Sejm (Czech parliament) on February 4.</p>

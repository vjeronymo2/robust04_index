			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Deadline in IRA extradition case A US federal judge in the extradition case of a suspected IRA member yesterday gave the British government one week to hand over eight sensitive documents on British policy in Northern Ireland. District judge Barbara Caulfield gave the prosecution until June 18 to produce the classified documents which a defence attorney maintains are vital to the case of Mr James Smyth, one of 38 prisoners who escaped from Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1983. The documents, most of which have not been made public in Britain, include one alleging collusion between security forces in Northern Ireland and Protestant paramilitary groups.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: As the negotiations get progressivly  tougher, so the reality of Palestinian national will and the  correctness of Palestinian decisions grows increasingly more  visible. More importantly, so does the reality of the  relentless and tireless struggle of the Palestinian people to  achieve the Palestinian interpretation of the Declaration of  Principles agreement so as to open the road to a Palestinian  state.    It is out of the question for the negotiating teams to  bargain away Palestinian rights. If anything, the negotiators  are being firm and steadfast. This explains why the talks are  proceeding by fits and starts and failing to reach workable  solutions. This is because the Palestinian negotiating team is  refusing to meet the Israeli negotiators' terms and sticking to  its interpretation of the declaration of principles. Had the  Palestinian negotiators been compromising and yielding to the  terms and dictates of the Israeli negotiators, the knot would  have long been untied and the talks would have proceeded  smoothly, without experiencing these numerous interruptions.  Had the Palestinian interlocutors been compromising, the  negotiations would not have been so tough.    It is then high time some people reconsidered their stands  and thought long and hard about the supreme national interests  of the Palestinian people and looked at the Palestinian  negotiators' national struggle in perspective -- the struggle  that aims at laying the first bricks in the structure of the  Palestinian state. It is time some people reconsidered their  position and viewed things from the perspective of Palestinian  interests and objectives and their ambitions to lead a free,  dignified, and independent existence. It is high time they  reconsidered their position and understood that talking to the  Israelis puts an end neither to the conflict nor to history.  Talking is a form of the conflict that we must adopt and then  take whatever responsibilities this option entails.    At some point down the road, negotiations are the right  course of action. Hopefully, some Palestinians will grasp this  truth and adapt to changing times and the circumstances of the  Palestinian national struggle. Hopefully, more Palestinians  will come to grasp this truth and so contribute to a more  cohesive Palestinian front. We will work to achieve that goal,  since it is the only guarantee for our people to advance their  objectives and their yearnings for the inevitable freedom and  independence.</p>

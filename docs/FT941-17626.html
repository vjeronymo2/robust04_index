			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: The dramatic tales of other people's lives - Biography and autobiography, political or otherwise, seem to be publishers' favourites for 1994 The best thing about the British publishers' lists for the next six months, you may feel, is that the 1993 flood of political autobiography has dried up. True, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Lady Thatcher (part II) and, we suspect, Norman Lamont have been scribbling away, but they do not look like landing in the bookshops before the summer. Addicts of Westminster will have to make do with Robert Shepherd's biography of Iain Macleod (Hutchinson) or even with ex-Catholic Herald editor Peter Stanford's life of Lord Longford (Heinemann) - or perhaps Clare's Kitchen by Clare Latimer will offer more than menus and recipes from Downing Street (Bloomsbury). Another grim option is Edwina Currie's first thriller, A Parliamentary Affair (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). Enoch Powell has come up trumps - but with a new translation of St Matthew (The Evolution of the Gospel: Yale). More compelling drama seems likely to come from Clive Ponting's Winston Churchill, promised to be an 'at times painful and uncomfortable reassessment' (Sinclair-Stevenson). We are also supposed to look forward to revelations about Lord Mountbatten (Mountbatten: The True Story by Brian Hoey: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson). At least we can be sure that Kenneth Harris's The Queen will be respectful (Weidenfeld). It may do a little to balance the memoirs of Major Ronald Ferguson (The Galloping Major: Macmillan) and Diana: Once Upon A Time by the Princess of Wales' childhood nanny, Mary Clarke (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson). * As the literary pages demonstrate, the British love biographies, and they seem to have a particular penchant for the lives of writers, which can only be because people somehow think the revelaiton of the writer's life will disclose the secret of craft. These next months will bring what promise to be important books on Kipling the Poet by Peter Keating (Secker &amp; Warburg), Roald Dahl by Jeremy Treglown (Faber), Richard Hughes by Richard Perceval Graves (Andre Deutsch), Charlotte Bronte by Lyndall Gordon (Chatto &amp; Windus) and Christina Rossetti - on the centenary of her death - by Jan Marsh (Jonathan Cape). Add to these Shakespeare: A Dramatic Career by our foremost Stratford scholar, Stanley Wells (Sinclair-Stevenson), and The Life and Lies of Bertolt Brecht by John Fuegi (HarperCollins). Then there is a batch of French 19th-century writers: Baudelaire by Joanna Richardson (John Murray), Stendhal by Jonathan Keates (Sinclair-Stevenson) and Mallarme (A Throw of the Dice by Gordon Millan: Secker). The American list is even stronger: Scott Fitzgerald by that most prolific of literary biographers, Jeffrey Meyers (Macmillan), John Steinbeck, the authorised biography, by Jay Parini (Heinemann), James Baldwin by David Leeming (Michael Joseph) and Edith Wharton (No Gifts From Chance by Shari Benstock: Hamish Hamilton). More interesting still, there will be the first volume of the two-part John Betjeman: Letters, edited by his daughter, Candida Lycett-Green (Methuen) - and, most important of all, the first two volumes of the mammoth eight-part set of The Collected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson (Yale), in which editors Bradford A Booth and Ernest Mehew after years of labour bring together 2800 letters, most of them unknown. * Away from these literary preoccupations, we have the long-promised biography The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (Century) in which Roger Lewis will reveal much if not all, Grace, in which Robert Lacey will try to do the same for Monaco (Sidgwick), a new life of Billie Holiday, Wishing on the Moon by Donald Clarke (Viking) and Han Suyin's no doubt reverential life of Zhou Enlai (Eldest Son: Jonathan Cape). Marie Curie by Susan Quinn (Heinemann) or a mjaor bioghraphy of the physicist Richard Feynman (The Beat of a Different Drum: Oxford). And at last we have the authorised biography of diva Joan Sutherland by a certain Norma Major (Little, Brown &amp; Co.), Autobiography even by non politicians is a popular pursuit, and this season Conrad Black of the Daily Telegraph will be telling how he became a press tycoon. A rather different sort of author, the novelist Penelope Lively, is writing about her 1930s childhood in Egypt (Oleander, Jacaranda: Viking) and JP Donleavy tells The History of The Ginger Man (Viking). Methuen is publishing Joan Littlewood's Autobiography and Andrew Sinclair goes back to the 1960s in In Love and Anger (Sinclair-Stevenson). Keith Waterhouse has a memoir about Leeds and London (City Lights: Hodder). * The history lists are led by a major new biography, Joseph Chamberlain: Entrepreneur in Politics by Peter T Marsh (Yale), but there is also a strong German theme: there are two books pegged to the 50th anniversary of the July Plot - An Honourable Defeat by Anton Gill (Heinemann) and 'Secret Germany' the story of Claus von Stauffenberg, by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh (Cape). Regular Weekend FT food writer Giles MacDonogh appears in his professional-historical guise in Prussia: The Perversion of an Idea (Sinclair-Stevenson) and the same publisher has Behind the Battle: Intelligence in the War with Germany by ULTRA expert Ralph Bennett. Husband-and-wife Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper, who have separately written about Crete, Cairo and Spain, turn to Paris After The Liberation: 1944-1949 (Hamish Hamilton). The distinguished historian of Italy, Denis Mack-Smith, will give us his life of Mazzini (Yale). David Cannadine's Aspects of the Aristocracy (Yale) sounds like a spin-off from his successful The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy,, but that may be unfair. Peter Gay delivers the third volume in his majestic study of Victorian culture, The Bourgeois Experience (The Cultivation of Hatred: HarperCollins). Richard Pipes completes his magisterial trilogy on the Russian Revolution with Russia Under The New Regime, 1919-1924 (Harvill). In more rollicking mode, Peter Hopkirk carries on his sequence of books about the Great Game with On Secret Service East of Constantinople (John Murray). Ian Buruma describes and analyses post-war Germany and Japan in The Wages of Guilt (Cape). Sir Nicholas Henderson, it is suggested, has defied Foreign Office objections to publish his memoirs, Mandarin: The Diary of an Ambassador (Weidenfeld). Australia's ex-PM Bob Hawke's The Autobiography (Heinemann) claims to be frank and controversial: we will see. There is a trio of topical Middle East books: Jericho First, Jane Corbin's story of the Palestinian-Israeli peace initiative by Norway (Bloomsbury), Said K Aburish's lid-lifting report on The House of Saud (Bloomsbury), and FT contributor Michael Field's Inside The Arab World (John Murray). * The travel shelves appear to be less crowded than in 1993. The London-based South African writer Dan Jacobson goes home in The Electronic Elephant, which the Hamish Hamilton blurb is unable to resist describing as 'a personal quest'. John Murray is publishing four more of their excellently readable Literary Companions - Spain (by FT staffer Jimmy Burns), China (by Weekend FT book reviewer Anthony Grayling and Susan Whitfield), Greece by Martin Garrett and Ireland by poet Patrick Kavanagh. It is not clear whether former City Editor and banker William M Clarke's In Search of the Tsar's Lost Fortune (Weidenfeld) is a travel book or a 'business' book. Firmly on the business pages will be John Banham's The Anatomy of Change: Blueprint for a Thriving Britain (Weidenfeld), Charles Handy's latest, The Empty Raincoat: Making Sense of the Future (Hutchinson), and Robert Heller's The Fate of IBM (Little, John). Then there's Tim Jackson's biography of The Virgin King (HarperCollins) about - who else? Finally, one of the important books of the year, with a social and political as well as a business dimension, is likely to be The City of London: A World of its Own, 1815-1890, the first of a three-volume major history by David Kynaston, previously historian of Cazenove and of the FT. * That leaves the fiction lists. The spring is looking promising even though not many of the really big guns are going to be in action. VS Naipaul returns with A Way in the World (Heinemann)), which is mysteriously (alarmingly?) described as 'unconfined by the conventional narrative form, but in a classic story-telling tradition'. JM Coetzee stays clear of his native South Africa with The Master of Petersburg, set in 1869 Russia (Secker &amp; Warburg). John Updike's Brazil is described as 'erotic joy and criminal mischief, politics and sorcery'(Hamish Hamilton). William Gaddis, recently elevated as a 'Penguin Twentieth-Century Classic' , has at last produced his fourth novel, A Frolic of his Own (Viking). Then there are the regulars: Anita Brookner (A Private View: Cape); Alison Lurie (Women and Ghosts: Heinemann); Edna O'Brien (House of Splendid Isolation: Weidenfeld); Nicholas Baker (The Fermata: Chatto); Carlos Fuentes (The Orange Tree: Andre Deutsch); Alan Massie (King David: Hodder). David Caute returns with Dr Orwell and Mr Blair (Weidenfeld). More interesting, the promising members of the younger generation are much in evidence: Alan Hollinghurst (The Folding Star: Chatto); James Hamilton-Paterson (Ghosts of Manila: Cape); James Kelman (How Late It Was, How Late: Secker); Candia McWilliam (Debatable Land Bloomsbury); Lindsay Clarke (Alice's Masque: Cape); Charles Palliser (Betrayals: Cape). Not to speak of Stephen Fry's second novel, The Hippopotamus (Hutchinson), which will probably do as well as all of them put together. But the gifted Mr Fry will not be outselling the new - the fifth - John Grisham legal thriller, which Century have not yet got round to titling. Nor will he beat Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend by Robert James Waller (Heinemann), which, already in some bookshops, is even mushier - sorry, more moving - than the fortunate Mr Waller's recent runaway success, The Bridges of Madison County. You have been warned.</p>

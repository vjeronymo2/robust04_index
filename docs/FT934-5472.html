'The charge upon which he was tried was a single charge,' Sir Derek said. He added: 'The Crown wanted him tried on a number of charges, and they argued strongly for the inclusion in the indictment of a number of charges. 'After the indictment had been reduced to a single charge, they argued strongly for the inclusion in the trial of a wide range of evidence. The judge ruled against them.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Verchere article: "UK Under Pressure To Rejoin </F> Military Project"]    [Text] Britain has been told by France, Germany, Italy and  Spain that it must rejoin a $7 billion project to build a  European military transport aircraft by the end of this year.  If not, it will be excluded from a major European defence  programme -- dubbed Euroflag -- expected to secure 37,500  aerospace jobs and generate sales of $55 billion.    The demand comes as Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale of  France, British Aerospace [BAe], Italy's Alenia and Spain's Casa  [Dasa] prepare to challenge U.S. domination of the world market  for military transport planes by building a European  alternative. The so-called Future Large Aircraft is designed to  meet the needs of the Western European Union [WEU] defence  forces and enter into service by the year 2002.    WEU air forces have total requirements for 300 Euroflag  aircraft in the transport and tanker roles. Euroflag also hopes  to win additional contracts for another 300 copies from  non-European air forces.    Despite early support for the Euroflag project, the British  Government withdrew in 1989 and assumed "observer status" within  the European partnership as its Ministry of Defence and Air  Force considered a cheaper offer from Lockheed to refurbish its  existing fleet of 61 U.S.-built Hercules C-130 transports and  eventually to replace them with an upgraded C-130J variant.    Other members of the consortium say that a British decision  in favour of the Lockheed offer would be anti-European and give  U.S. manufacturers continued domination of the European market.  "Lockheed hopes to kill off the Euroflag," said a British  Aerospace spokesman, "and continue to monopolise the military  large aircraft market in Europe and worldwide."    Britain's fleet of C-130s dates from the 1960's and is now  suffering from "a number of corrosion, fatigue and age-related  problems," according to a recent parliamentary defence committee  document.    BAe this week launched a campaign to persuade UK legislators  that support for the $7 billion development phase of Euroflag is  vital if Britain is to avoid repeating its disastrous decision  in 1969 not to join the Airbus Industrie consortium at its  inception. Although BAe subsequently sought membership, it has  ended up as a minor player in Europe's most successful aerospace  venture to date and forfeited billions of dollars in lost work  as a consequence.    The Euroflag consortium which also includes Belgium,  Portugal  and Turkey as associate members -- plans to develop a  four-engined aircraft capable of transporting up to 25 tonnes of  military hardware and personnel over ranges up to 3,700  kilometres.    It will have 2.5 times the airlift capability of the  U.S.-built Hercules C-130J and, says a Dasa spokesman, is  designed for the rapid deployment of forces.    Growing pressure from member governments to reduce the  project's development and productions costs has prompted a  recent decision to make the Euroflag a turboprop rather than a  jet-powered aircraft.    Euroflag plans to run the programme within the framework of  Airbus Industrie "in a professional and commercial fashion,"  explained an industry insider. This will involve the creation  of a special Airbus subsidiary and will be the first time it has  been able to accommodate the Italian aerospace sector through  the involvement of Alenia. Each of the partners will have a 20  percent stake and share of the work schedule.    Through this structure, Euroflag hopes to allay fears in  Germany and Britain that the programme will experience the usual  budget over-runs associated with cost-plus defence contracts.  According to a Dasa spokesman, Bonn does not expect to face the  same level of opposition as that experienced over the  Eurofighter which has been consistently attacked as a Cold War  weapon system.    French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last week urged WEU  governments to throw their weight behind the Euroflag programme.  "I invite our main partners to develop this European aircraft  with us," he said in a pointed reference to British vacillation.    The project was, he said, "a bearer of hope for common  European defence."</p>

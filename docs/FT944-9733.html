			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (6): The banks' scars begin to heal - After the difficulties of the past few months, prospects are brighter After the storm, the calm. Prospects are beginning to improve for French banks as they digest the difficulties of the last few months and raise their eyes to look towards the rather hazy future ahead. It has not been an easy time for the sector. The latest set of results in the last few weeks still show some of the scars caused by turmoil in the cap- ital markets and the overhang of enormous property and bad debt provisions following extravagant lending turned sour. One of the low points of 1994 - without which no com- mentary on the sector would be complete - refers to the continuing saga of Credit Lyonnais, the embattled state-controlled banking group, which has been hit by one piece of bad publicity after another. Its rival banks - many now in the private sector - have looked on with some annoyance at the additional state support provided without much evidence so far of a particularly aggressive strategy to sell any of the more profitable or core parts of the bank. However, most grudgingly admit that Mr Jean Peyrel- evade, the chairman appointed by the state last November in place of Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, has played a shrewd political game in his efforts to nurse the bank towards recovery. In a battle that became public at the end of September this year, the bank was forced to delay publication of its half-year results as a dispute raged between its directors, the auditors, the treasury and the banking commission over the size of provisions necessary to cover past losses. It finally reported losses of FFr4.5bn for the first six months of the year, and an additional FFr10.1bn in provisions - on top of losses for 1993 announced in March of FFr6.9bn, a ring-fenced property portfolio of FFr40bn underwritten by the state, and a recapitalisation over the summer. Substantial further provisions are likely, and - while stressing that everything must done in the right order, starting with a detailed justification of the provisions that will be necessary - the government seems set ultimately to provide the support to keep the bank solvent. That has helped start to boost the price of its non-voting certificats d'investissement, its only traded shares, albeit from a record low. Elsewhere across the sector, analysts are more confident. 'The first half figures have got the banks off to a nice beginning,' says Ms Sheila Garrard, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. 'Their two big problems were real estate lending and the small and medium-sized companies.' She argues that 'things have stopped getting any worse' regarding provisions, while economic recovery in France should begin to make loans to companies more stable again from the start of next year. Mr Jean Sassus, an analyst with Societe Generale in Paris, says: 'Things are not bad at all. European banks have not suffered from the drop people expected because of the decline in capital markets business.' The primary reason, he argues, is that most banks 'dramatically over-provided' in 1993 on their loan losses. They were then able to feed back the provisions against their capital markets activities, which inevitably dropped back this year after an extremely profitable but exceptional previous few months. 'One of the advantages of universal banking is that you cannot lose at the same time in every business. The investor is quite sure they will get a dividend,' he says. One outstanding challenge for the banks is to continue to cut costs - particularly through staffing reductions. Unlike the dramatic job losses in a short period in the UK and US, in France the process has been moderated by sensitivities to unions and employment legislation. But reducing costs is not the only challenge. 'The big question-mark is: where is the revenue going to come from?' says Ms Garrard. 'It's much tougher and there is no obvious area that the banks can develop that they are not working on already.' One battle that the banks seem to have won is for the sale of life assurance. Their existing customer base and wide retail network has allowed them to dominate the market in the face of competition from the insurance companies when handling effectively a simple savings product. This diversification of activity is set to continue, with international growth and capital markets expansion being high up the list. Credit Lyonnais, for example, remains committed to the high-cost, long-term strategy of building a strong retail branch network across Europe. Mr Sassus says the future for banks lies in the provision of more value-added services such as asset management, capital markets and possibly a battle for control of pension funds as the French industry begins to develop over the next few years. Certainly Mr Marc Vienot, head of Societe Generale, says: 'I am personally totally convinced about the role of capital markets. Derivatives will continue to develop with or without international supervision.' Equally, Ms Garrard sees the scope for greater packaging of financial products, with banks beginning to start charging more systematically for services provided to customers. Meanwhile, banks need to face changes to the distribution systems of their products. In late September, Paribas launched a telephone banking service amid much publicity, modelled along the lines of the success of the similar provision in the UK. This may herald an important trend for the future, although rival banks have been keen to point out the existence of their own long-standing equivalents  -not least the services accessible through Minitel, the computer information network available by phone to every French household. More controversially, Mr Sassus suggests there is still scope for reform of current French legislation, which prevents banks paying interest on current accounts. The traditional fear has been that this may cause inflationary pressure, and that the corresponding increase in charges on accounts will act against the interests of customers on lower incomes. 'That really would change the banking landscape,' he says.</p>

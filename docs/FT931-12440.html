			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Press watchdog condemns bugging THE Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory body for the newspaper industry, said yesterday that bugging private telephone calls was an invasion of privacy and therefore contrary to the industry's code of practice. But it recognised at its latest monthly meeting that exceptional circumstances might arise justifying publication. It called for legislation to clarify the law surrounding the issue. The commission also deplored publication by some newspapers of a transcript of a conversation allegedly between the Prince of Wales and Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles. It proposed changes to toughen the existing system of regulation, and agreed that the composition of the commission should change to include a majority of lay members to underline the its independence. It also urged editors to endorse a 'strengthened' code of practice which would be recognised as fair by the public. The commission welcomed moves to include copies of the code of practice in some journalists' contracts.</p>

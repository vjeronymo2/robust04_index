			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise elaborates on logic in Lasmo bid Enterprise Oil yesterday sought to meet criticisms over its Pounds 1.3bn bid for rival explorer Lasmo with a letter to the target's shareholders setting out the logic behind both a takeover and the unusually structured all-paper offer. It comes just two days before Lasmo is expected to announce an independent valuation of its own assets as its final shot in the bid battle. Under takeover rules, Lasmo may release no new information after Friday. The valuation has been done by DeGolyer &amp; McNaughton, a leading US petroleum consultant. It is likely to show a net asset value per share of substantially more than the offer value of 126p based on last night's 137p close for Lasmo and 391p for Enterprise. Enterprise's commercial argument, meanwhile, is based on the assumption that the risk and reward profile of exploration/production companies must be smoothed out to ensure a steady return to shareholders. By combining the two companies, shareholders would see benefits from complementary assets in the North Sea and abroad; greater recovery from the maturing North Sea through joint geological knowledge; an increased potential to swap assets; accelerated exploitation of assets in south east Asia; and a strong balance sheet. Enterprise also argues that the enlarged company would have improved chances of profitable exploration through the use of Lasmo's facilities in Liverpool Bay. Enterprise sought to clear up questions over its complicated all paper offer  -which comprises 27 A shares with limited dividend rights and 12 warrants for every 80 Lasmo shares. The offer included tradeable warrants, the group said, 'to reflect the difference in dividends between the A shares and the Enterprise ordinary shares'. Lasmo rejected Enterprise's commercial arguments as flawed. 'I think their statement that we have complementary assets means we have different assets,' said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive. Lasmo said Enterprise was also wrong in claiming it could benefit from Lasmo's Liverpool Bay infrastructure. 'They would have the same access and pay the same tariffs whether or not they owned Lasmo. How is value added here?' asked Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman. Lasmo challenged Enterprise to follow its example in valuing the assets behind the all-paper bid. 'We have come up with a value for our paper. The only way they can prove their offer is fair value is if they do the same,' an adviser said. See Lex</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Jobs data give mixed signals to investors Wall Street US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday after a mixed September employment report buoyed bond markets but left equity investors confused, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.11 at 3,584.74, well off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.12 higher at 460.30, while the Amex composite ended up 0.75 at 464.70, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.78 at 764.27. Trading volume on the NYSE was 244m shares. The markets opened firmer, buoyed by surging bond prices. The Treasury market rally was sparked by the morning release of the September employment report. Although this showed a 156,000 increase in non-farm payrolls last month, in line with expectations, bond market investors focused on the underlying weakness in manufacturing jobs revealed by the data. Deciding that the overall picture of the labour market still looked weak, investors bought bonds in heavy numbers, pushing the benchmark 30-year issue up 1 1/4 points, and lowering the yield to 5.917 per cent. Although the sharp drop in bond yields initially supported stocks, especially interest rate-sensitive sectors such as banks, the equity markets gradually turned tail, and by late morning prices were firmly rooted in negative territory as investors judged the jobs data to be, on balance, bad for stocks. A late round of buy progams, however, helped prices recover all their losses and end the day with slight gains across the board. Like the wider market, bank stocks struggled to hold their early advances. Citicorp finished down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 38 1/4 , Chemical off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 45, and NationsBank down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52. Brokerage stocks, which would normally benefit from falling interest rates, also see-sawed, opening with heavy losses but bouncing back to end higher or mixed. They were originally undermined by analysts' comments that the sector may have peaked after a long bull phase, but expectations of strong earnings growth remain high. Merrill Lynch ended up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 98 1/8 , Salomon up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 and PaineWebber unchanged at Dollars 32 3/8 . Morgan Stanley failed to rally, finishing down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 84 3/4 . Sears, Roebuck was a notable loser, falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 5/8 as concerns about the economy and consumer spending hurt retailing stocks. On the American Stock Exchange, Amdahl fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 5 after the company warned of a third-quarter loss. Canada TORONTO posted a modest gain in light trading. The TSE-300 composite index rose 6.65 to close at 4,067.44. Today's volume of 48.8m shares was worth CDollars 481.1m.</p>

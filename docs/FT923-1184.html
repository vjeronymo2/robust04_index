			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / People: Simon Davies leaves Wentworth International Simon Davies has resigned as group development director of Wentworth International Group and has left the USM-quoted plastic packaging products company. He had fulfilled many of the functions of finance director and indeed had been responsible for preparing the group's accounts. In July Haque Khan retired early as chairman and chief executive and was replaced by Robert Gill, who issued a dividend warning on August 26. He described the group's past accounting practices as 'sharp' and 'at the cutting edge'; he said the board was looking critically at practices previously employed, such as the capitalisation of interest, fair value accounting, the charging of consultancy fees to acquisition targets, and the capitalisation of acquisition costs. Tim Palmer, finance director, will now assume Davies' financial duties.</p>

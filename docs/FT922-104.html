			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Major hits back at Thatcher over Maastricht MR JOHN MAJOR scornfully dismissed Mrs Margaret Thatcher's fears of a European superstate yesterday as an unreal nightmare, underlining the depth of his rift with his predecessor. In an acerbic House of Commons performance, the prime minister flatly rejected Mrs Thatcher's call for a referendum on the Maastricht agreement. Speaking on the eve of Mrs Thatcher's entry into the Lords as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, Mr Major did little to disguise his irritation with the weekend tirade in which she described Maastricht as a 'treaty too far'. Mrs Thatcher is expected to continue her onslaught in her maiden speech in the Lords on Thursday. Many Conservative MPs joined yesterday's concerted attack on their former leader as Mr Major reminded her pointedly of how in 1975 she had approvingly quoted Lord Attlee's judgment that the referendum was 'the device of demagogues and dictators'. Mr Major responded sharply to a sprinkling of attacks from Tory Euro-sceptics. He repeatedly underlined his determination to ratify the accords on European political and economic union, stressing that they would reverse the 'centralising' trend of the Single European Act - an agreement signed by Mrs Thatcher. He said fears of a centralised European state was the 'stuff of nightmares' for a few people. The reality was that we were 'now in a position to begin to turn that tide back and it would be folly if we were to sideline ourselves when we have an opportunity of achieving that'. Mr Major acknowledged that the Maastricht legislation would not be debated by MPs again until the Danish government had given a clearer indication of its response to its electorate's rejection of the treaty. That response is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the French referendum. Mr Major said Britain's presidency of the Community, which begins tomorrow, would give substance to the concept of subsidiarity enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. That would involve a review of all areas of EC activity to ensure that the only decisions taken in Brussels were those which could not be effectively taken by national governments.

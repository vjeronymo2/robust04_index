			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A few months ago, a debate was sparked between  economic commentators and monetary authorities regarding the  possibility that the country might have to endure a significant  budget deficit next year because public spending was growing out  of control. Backed into a corner by this questioning, Finance  Minister Rudolf Hommes pulled a card out of his sleeve and said  to some who were expressing concern about the growth of  spending: "Those accounts do not include what cellular telephone  companies will pay in licensing fees, which will amount to about  $500 million."    Hommes was right in saying that this money would go a long  way toward solving the deficit problem, but his calculations  were a little off. As it became clear this weekend, when the  bids of the various cellular phone companies were opened, the  minister's figures will be doubled: Private companies will pay  nearly $600 million, and their mixed-band competitors, who will  be chosen in the next few weeks, must pay 95 percent of that  amount, for a grand total of around $1.2 billion.    If we add to that the more than $400 million (347 billion  pesos) that the nation will receive from the sale of the Bank of  Colombia, after deducting the funds earmarked for replacing  capital and guarantees that were uncovered, the result is that,  thanks to these two items, the nation's coffers will be richer  by more than $1.6 billion. This is equivalent to about 3 percent  of the Gross Domestic Product, and is more than double the  amount that the latest tax reform will bring in over a period of  one year.    The cellular phone situation is perhaps the most interesting  development, because in the final analysis the sale of the Bank  of Colombia means that the state is recouping the investment it  made 10 years ago when it intervened and nationalized that  entity. But despite the difficulties that arose at the last  minute in both cases, it appears that the auction mechanism is  here to stay in this country. It is not such a novelty in the  sale of a bank; the gavel has been used in the past to sell off  financial institutions. But with respect to bidding to operate  public services, this development represents a major change,  with two great virtues: its transparency, since subjective  criteria give way to a very objective evaluation criterion  (whoever offers the most money wins); and the way it optimizes  state resources. If the government had set the value of the  licenses according to its calculations, it would not have  received even half what it actually obtained, given that the  competition among several bidders to offer the best price  necessarily drives up that price. The redistribution factor is  another positive element of the auction; for example, much of  the revenues from the sale of the Bank of Colombia will be used  to pay overdue pensions.    To be sure, the auction can also be criticized because  driving up prices will, in the long run, raise rates as the  companies try to recoup what they invested in license fees. But  since there will be competition between at least two companies,  rates cannot climb too high. On the contrary, they may just  lower the rates to attract more customers.    A more valid criticism may be that if all bidding is done  through auctions from now on, only those with the most money  will be able to participate: the same old handful of companies,  which could lead to a greater concentration of wealth in  Colombia. For many years now, analysts have seen that as one of  the country's most serious problems. One way to mitigate these  effects may be to pass antitrust laws, setting limits to the  concentration of ownership. The incoming government will surely  have to debate this issue.    In the meantime, the finance minister can rest assured: with  full coffers, the specter of a runaway budget deficit seems to  have been chased away.

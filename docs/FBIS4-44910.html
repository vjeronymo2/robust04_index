			<p>CSO     [Text] This report outlines the fiscal year 1993 research  plans of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)  research laboratories and discusses R&amp;D-related support  services. It is being published to provide a deeper  understanding of the role of AIST laboratories.    This is the 32nd annual laboratory research plan published  by  the AIST going back to 1962 and is reported to provide the most  in-depth look at AIST laboratories.    Looking back at the previous year, we noted that many  countries around the world anticipated last year to be a major  turning point. An international accord was reached at a  UN-sponsored conference on the issue of environmental protection  versus economic growth in June in Brussels in which countries  agreed to work with one another under the banner of "sustainable  development." Turning an eye toward the domestic front,  meanwhile, we note that a Five-Year Plan was enacted in June to  have the standard of living in Japan match that of the major  powers in the world in terms of building an economy in which  people experience a real sense of being rewarded for their work.  This has been the result of both re-examining the  mass-production, consumer-oriented society that Japan has  created, and, together with that, recognizing the importance of  establishing a foundation of growth built on a harmonious  relationship between the environment and society.    Working on that basis, the MITI AIST has produced a  comprehensive industrial science policy for 1993 that should  contribute to continued growth and popularity of science and  technology in Japan.    In 1993, in particular, we note the opening of the new  National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research  (NAIR), a new research laboratory that promotes joint research  between government, industry, and academia, between different  scientific disciplines, and between countries. This year also  marks the start of the National Institute of Materials and  Chemical Research (NIMC) and the National Institute of  Bioscience and Human Technology (NIBH), which were both  established to attract researchers in relevant fields of  research to conduct research in the area of substances and  materials and biotechnology-related fields. In addition, many  earlier research projects were reincorporated into the  Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) and  New Sunshine Project. Besides the radically new R&amp;D project  system, the agency has been formulating various policies to form  a three-pillar support structure to promote cooperative  international research.    The agency has also been actively working to increase  funding  of the Japan Key Technology Center that was founded to promote  development of private-sector technologies, and has initiated  joint private-sector research projects in regional areas such as  the local Large-Scale Project centered around public examination  and technology centers that promotes technologies with a local  character to them, and on standard basic research aimed at  raising the standard of living in Japan to that of other  advanced countries.    The R&amp;D being done in science and technology in Japan  has to  be further consolidated in the future, not merely to sustain  economic growth in Japan but also to sustain the growth of the  international economy as a whole, and in that context, AIST  research laboratories are being counted on to play a major role  to make this happen. The great expectations being placed in AIST  research laboratories creates complex circumstances for them to  operate in, but we believe that it is still possible to energize  research activities and produce even more outstanding results.    September 1993    Hiroshi Kashiwagi, Director-General, Agency of Industrial  Science and Technology</p>

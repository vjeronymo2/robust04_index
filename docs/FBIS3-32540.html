We do not  need to bring in labor forces, not even to carry out exercises.    [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party] I think this sort of  operation was mishandled from the very beginning. It should have  been clearly explained and not with half-truths.    [Miguel Maza Marques, Conservative Party] Besides blowing it  by allowing their presence, the country has been lied to. This  is, in my opinion, a doubly unfortunate position by the  president.    [Gabriel Melo, Conservative Party] That was a shameful  agreement. Foreign troops were granted permission to bear arms,  use all ports and airports, and conduct emergency night flights,  according to the agreement. All this to build a small school?    [Carlos Lemos, Liberal Party] The country has not been told  the truth. Proof of this is that when the defense minister  returned to work after a heart ailment, he told the country that  it was about time to clarify what had happened in Juanchaco and  other parts of the nation.    [Enrique Parejo, Conservative Party] I do not think they  fooled the president. Who knows what is behind all this.  Therefore, it is important the president explain.</p>

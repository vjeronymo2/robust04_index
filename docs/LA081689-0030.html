			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRASH OF PRIVATE PLANE NORTH OF CASTAIC KILLS 1  </P> <P> A private plane crashed into a steep mountainside about 6 miles north of  Castaic on Tuesday, killing a passenger and critically injuring the 22-year-old  pilot, authorities said.  </P> <P> The plane, a two-seat Cessna that had been missing since 9 a.m., was owned by  Southland Aviation, based at Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, said Los Angeles  County Fire Department Inspector Joe Silva. The victims were a student pilot  and an instructor, he said.  </P> <P> The name of the dead instructor was not released until relatives could be  notified.  </P> <P> The pilot, Andrew Conejo of Los Angeles, suffered head injuries, facial cuts  and a broken left arm, said Rose Morelli, nursing supervisor at Henry Mayo  Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia.  </P> <P> Conejo was later transferred to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills,  where he was in stable condition and able to speak, said Holly Lyons, a  hospital nursing supervisor.  </P> <P> The cause of the crash was not known. Investigators from the National  Transportation Safety Board briefly surveyed the crash site from a helicopter  Tuesday and were scheduled to return for further inspection this morning,  officials said.  </P> <P> The plane crashed in rugged territory just north of Templin Highway, about four  miles east of the Golden State Freeway in the Angeles National Forest.  Firefighters had to be flown in by helicopter and cut through 10-foot-high  brush to reach the plane, said Bob Dunbar, who piloted the helicopter for the  Fire Department.  </P> <P> The exact time of the crash was not known, officials said.  </P> <P> Tom Axelrod, an electrical power plant engineer at a Los Angeles Department of  Water and Power pumping storage facility just east of the crash site, said  another plant employee noticed the downed plane as the men were riding home in  a company van at about 3:45 p.m.  </P> <P> "He looked at the hills, saw a plane sitting there and said, 'That wasn't there  yesterday,' " Axelrod said. The man called authorities.  </P> <P> The plane appeared to have crashed into the mountainside from the east, Dunbar  said.  </P></p>

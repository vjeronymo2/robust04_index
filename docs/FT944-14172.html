			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Loose guns mar US effort in Haiti: Aristide opponents hold up to 15,000 weapons Since the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a rash of new graffiti has appeared on walls around Port-au-Prince. 'US Army stay for 50 years to change system,' one red spraypaint slogan spells out. The plea appears to be in vain. The US has no intention of keeping troops here for very long, and wants to turn the Haiti operation over to United Nations peace-keeping forces within six months. But while US forces are here, many, including UN military planners, complain that US soldiers are leaving too much of the old repressive system intact by failing to arrest and disarm many of Aristide's most rabid opponents. Since the US occupation of Haiti began five weeks ago, about 11,000 weapons, some as powerful as anti-tank grenades, have been seized from Haitian civilians. Even the most conservative estimates put the number of weapons still in the hands of Aristide opponents at around 15,000. . At night and in isolated areas not firmly under the control of US forces, these arms are being used by Aristide opponents to 'perpetrate some of the little incidents of violence that are occurring every day in Haiti,' according to US military spokesman Col Barry Willey. 'We are supposed to take over a stable environment but with all those weapons and bad guys still out there I would say it's more like enforcing a truce,' says a UN commander here on a reconnaissance trip. 'We would like to see some more forceful disarmament before we arrive.' Around the capital, tipping off the US military about suspected weapons hideouts is often an exercise in futility. Early last week, Berel Jenestile, an Aristide supporter who recently came out of hiding, flagged down a convoy of military police in the streets of Port-au-Prince to tell them of a arms cache he had seen being hidden in the hills around the hamlet of St Jude, located just outside the capital. Staff Sergeant Innocenzo Schiavo dutifully filled out a report but was not optimistic anything would be done: 'Its got to be cross-referenced, cross-checked, screened, processed and synthesised with other military intelligence before a search might be ordered.' US officials, still afraid of Somalia-like 'mission-creep', insist that policing and investigatory work is the job of the still largely non-existent Aristide government. Arrests and raids are made only when the security of US troops is threatened or a US soldier directly witnesses a heinous crime being committed. 'We have to get away from the perception that we have the capability to check out everything,' says Col Willey, adding that 75 to 80 per cent of the raids in the capital come up empty. Mistaken and awkward raids on a UN child-vaccination clinic and a famous botanical garden have made the US military even more reluctant to act. But equally embarrassing has been a case in Miragoane, where a bus crashed into a pro-Aristide demonstration, killing 12. US troops arrived on the scene, took pictures and statements from witnesses and obtained the license plate numbers of the bus. US forces say that information has not been followed up on. Civilians armed with automatic weapons can still be seen patrolling the roads outside Miragoane. 'The US forces have the leads necessary to do normal investigative work,' says Mr Ira Kurzban, a lawyer for President Aristide. 'We are not saying that they should search every house in the country, but they should act on information.' Capt Mark Adams, head of military intelligence for the region encompassing Miragoane, counters by saying that 'there is a line that has to be drawn between military and civilian roles. Our information about the bus crash will be turned over to the Haitian police and judicial system, when there is one. We've got to force the judicial system to get on line, because eventually it will be Haitians who will have to deal with their own problems.' In the capital, less than 50 per cent of police officers show up for work each day and of those, only about half can be persuaded to go out on patrol, fearing their own safety. One late afternoon at the Cafeteria police station, Mr Alexi Charles walked in to report that he had been robbed by a black market money changer. Mr Charles says he was told by the desk sergeant to come back the next day, because police were not making arrests after 6 pm. Some of those arrested by the US military, including Haitian military officers accused of human rights violations, are eventually turned over to Haitian police, who often let them go for lack of a functioning judiciary. The Aristide government, recognising that the uncollected guns are not likely to be used while the US military is in place, has said American forces can stay as long as Washington wants, leaving the decision up to the US Congress and the UN. Yet some are beginning to worry that the honeymoon between the US military and the Haitian people cannot last forever. US commanders say that while normal infantrymen only patrol in Port-au-Prince to keep order, in the countryside, where three-quarters of Haitians live, special forces troops are working to break old habits of violence and develop local government structures for the UN to oversee. 'If we left now, people would be very unhappy. We still have a lot of work to do,' says Capt Jim Mis, operational officer for special forces in Les Cayes, a city 250km south of Port-au-Prince. 'But our goal is to make the situation stable enough so that we work ourselves out of a job.'</p>

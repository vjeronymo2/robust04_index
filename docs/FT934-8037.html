			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: French minister and Volvo chief discuss Renault deal MR Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, yesterday held talks with Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, to discuss how to reassure Volvo shareholders who are opposed to the planned merger between Renault and the Swedish motor group. Opposition from Volvo's shareholders, which has centred on the lack of a clear timetable for the privatisation of the merged group and the French government's plan to retain a golden share in the company after privatisation, threatens the merger of the two groups' truck and car activities. Earlier this month, Volvo postponed until December 7 a shareholder vote on the link-up with Renault. Mr Gyll, who admitted last week that Volvo's shareholders were 'completely against the deal', explained the concerns of Swedish investors but did not ask for a renegotiation of the deal, according to French officials. The French government continues to resist changes to the merger agreement and insists that shareholder opposition can be overcome by clearer explanation of the controversial points and emphasis on the industrial logic of the deal. Volvo shareholders are opposed to the golden share because it could be used to reduce their voting rights from 35 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of the dissolution of the merged group's holding company. Mr Longuet stressed the proposed golden share would never be used against Volvo and was necessary to defend the merged group from a hostile takeover. Industry observers said verbal reassurances on the golden share and on the French government's plans to privatise the merged company next year, were unlikely to satisfy Swedish shareholders. They speculated that opposition to the deal could be fuelled by the two groups' results for the first nine months of the year which are due to be released tomorrow. Volvo is expected to show an improvement over the losses incurred in 1992, while Renault is expected to announce a steep downturn in profits. Renault announced yesterday that it would launch its new Laguna upper mid-range passenger car in January.</p>

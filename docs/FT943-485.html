			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Satellite group aims up-market Eutelsat, the European satellite organisation, is planning to target the UK in a campaign designed to take satellite television more up-market. Until now the British market has been dominated by channels on the Astra satellite system, particularly the subscription channels of British Sky Broadcasting. Eutelsat hopes to use new English language channels on its Hot Bird satellite, due to be launched at the end of November, to reach UK viewers. Dow Jones has decided to use the Eutelsat satellite for its 24-hours a day European Business News, as has NBC SuperChannel, which is being revamped in January to concentrate on business programming during the day. Two new BBC channels to be launched early next year will also use Eutelsat. They are to be run by the BBC in a joint venture with Pearson, owners of the Financial Times. One will be a 24-hour television news channel, the other entertainment. Mr Giuliano Berretta, commercial director of Eutelsat, said: 'We are concentrating on quality, free-to-air television.' Eutelsat is owned by the main telephone organisations of Europe. From early next year Eutelsat will have seven channels in English, including MTV, Euronews and Eurosport as well as television channels in French and Polish. Eutelsat believes its channels are received on around 300,000 UK satellite dishes. At the end of June BSkyB said it had 3.45m subscribers - 74 per cent of them on satellite dishes.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN CELEBS TURN OUT FOR BOP BASH TOUTING POP'S NEW KIDS  </P> <P> Teen dream Kirk Cameron wasn't there (although his three sisters were), and  Tiffany was a no-show. Otherwise, a Who's Who of teen-age Hollywood -- from  Soleil Moon Frye of TV's "Punky Brewster" to "Growing Pains' " Jeremy Miller --  turned out for a party Tuesday night feting the hot new teen singing group, New  Kids on the Block, who are as wholesome as the Osmonds.  </P> <P> Still, just in case things got out of hand, party organizers had hired five  beefy security guards in addition to the two who just look after the New Kids.  (Also stationed outside was a phalanx of Chuck's parking valets who stood idle  most of the time -- half of this crowd wasn't old enough to drive.)  </P> <P> But as guests downed virgin mai tais, Coke and cases of designer water, it  became clear that young Hollywood knows its P's and Q's. Pubescent entertainers  arrive with their publicists or their parents in tow. They make eye contact and  say "thank you" to reporters. They talk about the "Batman" premiere and their  own upcoming work. Savvy Keith Coogan, 19, who appears in "Cousins" and  "Adventures in Babysitting," says: "Coming this summer I'm in 'Cheetah and  Friends' from Disney Films. Well, I gotta plug it. That's what I'm here for."  </P> <P> In fact, just about the biggest shocker of this party was David Faustino, 15,  of "Married With Children," who walked in holding a plastic cup from  McDonald's, where he had eaten two burgers and a large order of fries before  arriving. "I thought it might be like anchovies and stuff like that," Faustino  said of the party fare. (Actually, it was fajitas, hamburgers, hot dogs and  baby pizzas.)  </P> <P> The event was hosted by Bop and the Big Bopper magazines. Julie Laufer, the  magazines' 26-year-old editor, held court in her parents' Woodland Hills home,  which had been equipped with a disco floor and a battery of speakers on which  New Kids' hit song, "I'll Be Loving You (Forever)," replayed all evening long.  </P> <P> In the crowd were Rain Pryor, 20, of "Head of the Class;" Jason Marsden, 14, of  "The Munsters Today;" 12-year-old Brandon Call ("Formerly of 'The Champ' and  'Santa Barbara,' " trumpeted his mother, Elyse); sisters Danica and Crystal  McKellar of "The Wonder Years"; members of the pop group The Boys; 13-year-old  modeling star Mila Jovovich, and Josh Harris, 10, of "Dallas."  </P> <P> Laufer, in a pink leather suit, predicted that New Kids will be bigger than the  Osmonds. "I think they'll go beyond that just from the signs we've seen," she  said knowingly.  </P> <P> Her brother, Scott Laufer, 28, president of Laufer Publishing, envisions  greatness even beyond that of Kirk Cameron, star of "Growing Pains" and  perennial Bop cover boy. "They'll be at least three times hotter than Kirk, at  least for selling magazines," he said. New Kids grace Bop's July cover, which  is on its way to becoming the biggest seller in Bop's history, with anticipated  newsstand sales of 250,000.  </P> <P> About two hours late, three black Cadillac limousines snaked up the street  carrying the Kids and their entourage. Although this was supposed to be the  first chance for the five members of the Boston-based group to mingle with  stars (they're in town to open for Tiffany at the Universal Amphitheatre on  Sunday), they kind of stuck together.  </P> <P> New Kid Jordan Knight, 18, said he didn't watch TV at all -- "I know it seems  kind of funny, but I don't" -- and so he didn't recognize anyone.  </P> <P> But Donny Wahlberg, 19, who wore a suit cut off at the knees, spats and white  socks, ponytail and three earrings, said his head was elsewhere. "Lately, I've  been in a deeper thought," he explained. "I mean, I appreciate having parties  thrown in my honor. I enjoy it. But my main concern, and the group's main  concern, is creating a better atmosphere for the youth of America. I'd rather  make a better world than be rich and famous."  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Shake-up in French regional banking CREDIT Mutuel, the group of regional French banks, is restructuring some of its provincial banking networks in response to the competitive state of French financial services and the changes within the European banking system. Three networks under the Credit Mutuel umbrella - those for northern France, the Champagne-Ardois region east of Paris and Artois-Picardie north of the capital - are merging to create Credit Mutuel du Nord-Est. The new network will be the third-largest in the Credit Mutuel group, after those covering central and eastern France and Britanny. Credit Mutuel du Nord-Est will manage savings funds worth FFr41bn (Dollars 7.59bn) and FFr16bn of credit. France's banks have had a tough time in the past year. High real interest rates have depressed demand for credit from both consumers and the corporate sector, intensifying competition. The banks have also suffered from the economic slowdown, which has affected the value of their industrial investments and property portfolios. These problems have intensified the pressure on smaller, regional players, such as those within the Credit Mutuel group. The regional banks have also been anxious to ensure they will meet the new standards to be imposed on European Community banks.</p>

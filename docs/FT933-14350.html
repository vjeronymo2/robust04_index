			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Croat plan 'likely to restart war' CROATIA'S plan to re-open a strategic bridge this weekend risks re-igniting the Serbo-Croat war, a senior UN official warned yesterday, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN mission in former Yugoslavia, said: 'Both sides are armed to the teeth, and both have brought up reinforcements. Both are preparing for an escalating conflict. 'In these circumstances, the risk of war breaking out again becomes really very high.' Frustrated by Serb intransigence on the opening of Maslenica bridge, which links the main coastal motorway with central Croatia, and the nearby Zemunik airport, Croat authorities are poised to re-establish the vital road link. Serb forces from the self-styled state of Krajina have warned they will bombard the bridge if the Croats go ahead with a temporary pontoon bridge. Serbs have trained three Frog missiles on Zagreb, the Croatian capital, say UN officials posted in the region. 'The Croat authorities and the territorial defence forces of the Serbian Krajina are engaging in brinkmanship around Maslenica and the Zemunik airport,' Mr Thornberry said in Belgrade. Croat forces seized control of the area in their offensive on January 22 across UN lines. Since then, they have ignored a UN Security Council resolution calling for their withdrawal to the ceasefire line agreed on January 3, 1992. Croatia wants to re-assert authority over Serb-held parts which comprise the four UN zones. Resentment has mounted against UN peacekeepers for failing to fulfil the peace plan to allow the return of Croat refugees to UN zones.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sombre Context"] </F>   [Text] The republic enters its 45th year at a time of  disquieting uncertainty in the rest of the world. If, in the  past, the compulsions of the cold war created many a hurdle in  the consolidation of freedom won by the third world countries,  the transition to a new international world order has also not  freed them from all anxiety about their future. This is a time  not just of promise but also of potential pitfalls. It is in  this sombre background that President Shanker Dayal Sharma has  found it necessary to sound a note of caution. In his Republic  Day message to the nation, he has referred to the danger of  foreign interference in India's internal affairs. He has clearly  in mind not merely the continuing sustenance of terrorism in  Kashmir by Pakistan and evidence of a foreign hand in insurgent  activity in the north-east but also instances of US-based  terrorist outfits being blessed with words of solace from the  White House itself. It may not be a deliberate policy of the US  to promote destabilisation in India. But New Delhi cannot be  indifferent to the disturbing fact that separatists have found  it easy to maintain a channel of communication with President  Clinton's aides. They have played on the American concern for  human rights for their own nefarious purposes. White House  officials have refused to be wary of the way they are allowing  themselves to be manipulated to harm India's interests.    This suggests a continuation of the essence of the  four-decades- old American policy towards Indo-Pakistan  problems. In the past it consisted of humouring Pakistan just  because the latter helped strengthen the American anti-Soviet  strategy. Even if, in recent years, Washington has claimed to  have been guided by a so-called evenhanded approach to this  subcontinent, its practice has not ceased to be overly  influenced by a sympathetic view of Pakistan's causes. The  Pressler amendment, as the name itself signifies, was not the  result of the administration's initiative. The administration  has actually found it an inconvenient constraint. American  praise for the democratic system in India from time to time  cannot blind its policy-makers to the constant threat of its  interests being compromised by the instinctive American habit of  tilting towards Pakistan on all contentious issues.    The best way of countering this threat would certainly be to  invest Indian diplomacy with some punch. The traditional way of  trying to convince others of the justness of any Indian cause  will not suffice. Every time the Americans say or do things  which palpably go against this country's interests, no punches  should be pulled in exposing their mischief. This style, sadly,  is still alien to Indian diplomacy as was amply clear from the  defensive ring of protests against the latest anti-Indian  manoeuvres in the White House.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday stated  that in a letter sent to the U.S. Embassy, the Bolivian  Government made it clear that it acts and will act in keeping  with its domestic legislation. It further stated that it  condemns any interference in matters that come under its sole  jurisdiction.    The foreign minister made this public after reporting that  he  had received a letter from the U.S. Embassy, bearing seal number  466, in which the U.S. Government expressed its disagreement  with the alleged granting of a pardon to a person implicated in  terrorist crimes.    Aranibar stated that it is incumbent upon the Bolivian  Government, to the exclusion of everybody else, to grant or not  to grant a pardon to persons involved in some crimes, and that  all the different levels of the judiciary abide by the country's  legislation.    The foreign minister further stated that last 29 November he  had received a verbal note from the U.S. Embassy, in which it  voiced its opinion about the alleged granting of a pardon to a  Bolivian citizen, Marcelo Oliva, who was implicated in an attack  on the U.S. Marines' residence.    "We answered them through another verbal note, as  appropriate, stressing that that was a matter that comes under  the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bolivian Government," he  explained.    He thus indicated that the different levels of the judiciary  will respect the country's rules and legislation, which  establish with striking clarity the independence of the three  branches of government and the duties of each of them.    According to the foreign minister's statement, the long and  the short of it is that the Foreign Ministry has made it clear  that "the Bolivian Government acts and will act pursuant to the  country's legislation." He went on to say that the Bolivian  Government likewise condemns any interference in matters that  come under its sovereign decision.    With regard to the "not too friendly" tone of the letter  issued by the U.S. Embassy, Aranibar said that the response the  Foreign Ministry gave to it was couched "in the tone, terms, and  firmness that was suitable to the occasion."    In its letter the U.S. Embassy states that "the  traditionally  excellent relations existing between our countries may be  adversely affected if a pardon is granted to terrorists or if  any other measure is taken to release them."    To this effect, it points out that "the United States will  hold responsible any individual who, directly or indirectly,  supports terrorist actions against U.S. citizens or U.S.  interests."    The letter openly accuses the Pro-Amnistia group for its  activities toward obtaining a pardon for citizens who have been  taken into custody on terrorist charges. It even threatens with  applying all sorts of retaliatory measures if a pardon is indeed  granted to these people.</p>

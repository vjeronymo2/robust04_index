			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 22 -- By mid-April this year, farmers  in southern Vietnam had basically finished harvesting nearly 1.1  million hectares of the winter-spring rice crop, the 19th such  crop since the liberation. Prior to that there had not been any  such crop. The output of this winter spring crop is estimated to  be about 4.5 million tons, which is equal to the annual rice  output in the early years after the liberation.    Currently, farmer in southern Vietnam cultivate 3 rice crops  a year :winter-spring, summer-autumn, and the year-end rice  crop. The cultivated area of each crop is never less than 1  million hectares. In the early years after liberation, farmers  in southern Vietnam, mainly in the Mekong delta, cultivated only  one rice crop, the year-end rice crop, and obtained an average  yield of about 1.8 tons/hectare. Two more rice crops were  gradually introduced the winter-spring and the summer-autumn and  these became the main rice crops of the year instead of the  year-end crop.    During the years of implementing the party's directive 100  up  to 1988 the area growing the winter-spring and summer-autumn  rice was expanded to about 600,000 ha with an average  productivity of 4.5 tons/ha for the winter spring crop and 3.5  tons/ha for the summer-autumn crop.    Next came resolution 10 of the party's politburo, which  called for renewal of the management of agricultural production.  This has given a real boost to agricultural production and to  the national rice output.    Besides increasing rice crops in a year, southern farmers  were also called upon to reclaim waste land from the Plain of  Reeds, Long Xuyen quadrangle and the western area of Hau River  for rice production. Within a few years, about 200,000 ha have  been reclaimed from these areas and put under two rice crops a  year. Now, Tien Giang, Long An and Dong Thap Provinces in the  Plain of Reeds cultivate 529,000 ha with rice. The average food  share produced by farmers in the plain of reeds, Long Xuyen  quadrangle and the western area of Hau River ranges between 1.5  and 2.5 tons per capita. These 3 areas are now producing an  output of 5 million tons of commodity rice a year, more than the  total yearly rice output of south Vietnam before liberation.    Inspired by their achievements since the start of  renovation, farmers in southern Vietnam are continuing to adjust  the structure of agricultural production and renew the rural  economy in the direction of industrialisation and modernisation,  thus creating conditions for the country to integrate its  economy into the world economy.</p>

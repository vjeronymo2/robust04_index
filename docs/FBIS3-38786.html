			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Heinz Vielain report: "Chancellor Kohl: SPD Has Sinned </F> Against German Unity"]    [Text] Bonn -- According to notes made by the Socialist  Unity Party of Germany [SED], the candidate for chancellor and  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], Rudolf  Scharping, spoke out for the "realization of the Gera demands"  in secret talks with SED Politburo member Hermann Axen in 1987.  The Gera demands contain the recognition of GDR [German  Democratic Republic] citizenship, which would have meant  cementing divided Germany. The same source says that current SPD  Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and former SPD Chairman Bjoern  Engholm also had secret talks with GDR politicians in the late  80's, during which they promised to fulfill important SED  demands.    An official SED Central Committee protocol on Scharping's  talk with Axen says: "R. Scharping spoke out for the  realization of the Gera demands and immediate official contacts  between the People's Chamber of the GDR and the FRG Bundestag."    The "Gera demands," which SED Chairman Erich Honecker  formulated on the opening of a "party course in Gera" in October  1980, contain the following points:    -- Recognition of GDR citizenship;    -- Abolition of the central registration center for human  rights violations in the GDR (an establishment of the land  justice authorities in Salzgitter);    -- Turning the permanent FRG and GDR representations into  embassies;    -- Defining of the Elbe border (between Schnakenburg and  Boitzenburg), in the middle of the waterway.    Rudolf Scharping, who was then SPD Chairman of  Rhineland-Palatinate, paid an official visit to the GDR with a  delegation of his land's party in 1987. The meeting with Axen  took place on 27 October in the building of the SED Central  Committee.    About the recognition of the Gera demands by Scharping, the  protocol of the SED Central Committee, which has been made  available to WELT AM SONNTAG, says that Axen "agreed" with  Scharping on this and other issues. Axen said that, for the  SPD, it was important not to let the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] and Christian Social Union [CSU] take away the fruits of  the new Ostpolitik initiated by Willy Brandt. Axen was a member  of the presidium of the SED Central Committee. It was also he  who, in 1987, worked out the joint SED/SPD program paper on the  "dispute of ideologies and common security," together with the  leading Social Democrats Erhard Eppler and Egon Bahr.    Another Central Committee note on a meeting between the  current deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and Erhard Honecker  on 23 October 1987, which has also been made available to WELT  AM SONNTAG, says that Lafontaine advocated an "absolute  recognition" of a two-state Germany. According to the official  protocol, the SPD politician said: "Taking account of GDR  interests and absolutely recognizing two states, he thinks it is  necessary to find out what steps are possible in the future. In  the FRG, there is a general consensus that a two-state Germany  is a reality that nobody can ignore."    According to the protocol, Honecker had said that all  illusions about reunifying the two German states must be  decisively rejected. As to Lafontaine, the protocol notes  "agreement." The document then notes Lafontaine's statement as  follows: "In his view, it would be good to develop common ideas  in the future, as to what agreements a government led by the SPD  could aim at with regard to the GDR."    Another protocol by the SED Central Committee reports on a  meeting SPD politician Bjoern Engholm had with leading SED  politician Hermann Axen on 6 April 1987, during which  recognition of the GDR as a state was also discussed. Engholm  was a member of the SPD Executive Committee and head of the SPD  land parliament group in Schleswig-Holstein.    According to the protocol, Engholm said that the relations  between the FRG and the GDR require a clearing away of existing  basic problems. The SED protocol quotes Engholm as saying:  "The SPD must speak out for the recognition of GDR citizenship,  for the midstream Elbe border, and the abolition of the  Salzgitter registration center. Both German states have a  historic responsibility for peace. But bigger problems can only  be solved if the existing obstacles are finally cleared away."    A severe dispute broke out at the weekend between Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister President,  Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate for federal president, on  documents saying that Rau received election assistance from the  SED in 1987, in order to replace Chancellor Kohl as head of  government.    These documents, which have been made available to WELT AM  SONNTAG, indicate that a kind of barter business took place  between the SPD and the SED on the eve of the January 1987  Bundestag elections: The SED stops the flood of asylum seekers  from Sri Lanka at the German-German border, which Kohl's  government had tried to do in vain. In return, the SPD assures  the SED of accepting the GDR's sovereignty. The SPD mediator  was Egon Bahr. Election campaigner Johannes Rau could announce  that the flood of asylum seekers via the Berlin-Schoenefeld  airport was stopped on 18 September 1986, as the result of  personal and persevering efforts.    In an interview with SAT-1 television network, Chancellor  Helmut Kohl said that the files that have now been published  show who had mentally "defected" to former SED Chairman Erich  Honecker. What becomes known about SPD policy, is "utterly  disgraceful." He said he does not know of any statement by SPD  presidential candidate Johannes Rau clearly rejecting the idea  of a GDR citizenship.    The chancellor emphasized that he does not want a "dirty  campaign." But especially as a presidential candidate, Rau  would have to face the files that have now been published.    In an interview with the Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio  station  on Saturday [5 February], Rau rejected Kohl's comments: He said  he has not made any concessions whatsoever to the GDR. In his  speeches and in the government program, he always recommended to  "respect GDR citizenship on the basis of the constitution." He  said the CDU apparently wants to "create suspicions." He  appeals to all parties to return to an election campaign where  "the dirty work is not left to the dung beetle."    SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen accused Chancellor Kohl of  "character assassination" and demanded an agreement in which all  parties agree on SED and Stasi documents "not to be used as  weapons in the election campaign."    On Saturday, Chancellor Kohl informed WELT AM SONNTAG that  he stands by his belief "that the SPD has sinned against German  unity." Accepting two citizenships would have "equalled the  expulsion of 17 million Germans."    Politicians in the new laender expressed concern about the  collaboration between West German politicians and the SED.  Former GDR civil rights activist and present CDU deputy  Reverend Rainer Eppelmann told WELT AM SONNTAG: "I am not  saying that Rau should resign because this would be unfairly  condemning him, which is unworthy of a constitutional state.  But he has to speak. He must reply to the accusations."    Eppelmann is chairman of the Bundestag commission for  investigations into the GDR past. In a first assessment of the  goings-on he said: "The human failure in the whole thing is  that leftist democrats of the Federal Republic of Germany seem  to have been involved in shady dealings with leftist dictators  in the GDR, regarding the FRG center politicians as opponents.  It must be made clear that this never happened."    SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who comes from eastern  Germany, told WELT AM SONNTAG he thinks it is advisable that the  clarification of the dealings "be assigned to political  scientists and historians at first." In this connection, the  accusation that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang  Schaeuble promised a redefinition of the Elbe border during  government talks on halting the flood of asylum-seekers from the  GDR would also have to be discussed. Schaeuble had denied this  accusation.    Thierse accused the CDU/CSU of being afraid of an "objective  election campaign." This is why "past events are brought up,  with the intention of triggering heated disputes and diverting  attention from the real problems, such as unemployment and  national debts." He said he finds this "mean."    CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Manager Juergen Ruettgers told WELT  AM SONNTAG that it is "absolutely necessary to inform citizens  about all the details of former internal contacts between the  SPD and the SED, and especially of Johannes Rau's role."</p>

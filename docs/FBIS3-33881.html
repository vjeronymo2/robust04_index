Chavan was talking to newsmen in Jammu at the end of a  three-day tour of Jammu, Doda and Kishtwar. Asked about holding  elections in the state, he said the possibility of the state  going to the polls in the near future cannot be ruled out, but  there is no timeframe for it, he added. In a reply to another  question, the home minister said the Center has no package for  initiating the political process in the state. Mr. Chavan said  Kashmir is a national issue and no party should take advantage  of it.    The monthly cash relief for the Kashmiri migrants has been  increased by 50 percent. The relief per family will now be  1,500 rupees instead of 1,000 rupees. This was announced by the  home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, in Jammu.    Agency reports from Jammu say militants opened fire when the  helicopter of the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, was landing at  Doda yesterday. The reports quoting official sources say the  militants fired from a hilltop at (Deoli) about 3 km from Doda.  The security forces returned the fire silencing the guns of the  militants. The militants could not cause any damage as they  fired the shots from quite a distance.    The union minister of state for home, Mr. Rajesh Pilot, says  the government will not allow agencies like the Inter-Services  Intelligence of Pakistan to succeed in their evil designs.  Addressing a rally in Gandhinagar yesterday, he said Pakistan is  interfering in our internal affairs and it does not want the law  and order situation to improve in the Kashmir valley. The  minister made it clear that tough action will be taken against  the forces which are bent upon breaking the unity of the country.</p>

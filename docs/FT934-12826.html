			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / People: Cohen goes to SGST Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities has hired David Cohen, a City veteran, to help build up its presence in the UK corporate broking business. Cohen knows all about bull and bear markets, having started out in the City in 1962 as an electricals analyst at Simon &amp; Coates, the now defunct UK stockbroker. In 1969, at the age of 27, he became one of the youngest-ever partners in the firm. By 1984 he had built up such a reputation for bringing companies to the USM that the FT ran a profile on him. In the same year he was one of the senior partners who presided over the sale of S&amp;C to Chase Manhattan Bank. For the past 3 1/2 years, Cohen has headed the smaller companies corporate broking unit at Robert Fleming Securities, where his biggest claim to fame was managing the flotation earlier this year of David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis and fitness chain run by the former Davis Cup player.</p>

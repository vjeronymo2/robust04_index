			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Sweet smell of skin-care - A look at a beauty products shop about to open Jo Malone has been tending some extremely high-profile faces for several years in her sweet-smelling flat near London's Sloane Square. From Queens and Princesses to fashion editors and the beau monde every day, an impressively elegant troupe heads up her narrow stairs. Jo used to stay up late mixing her own creams and lotions and her customers soon became addicted to them. For some time they were sold only to private clients. But as word began to spread, and demand increased, Jo began to broaden the range and sell it to a wider public. Next week Jo opens her own shop selling the complete Jo Malone range. Conventional make-up is not on offer - the beauty products are entirely related to skin-care. There is a cleansing milk made from apricot kernel and avocado oil, a skin tonic with juniper, a moisturising lotion with apricot, avocado and almond oil as well as UV screens, eye gel with apricot and loe, night cream with orange and geranium. All smell wonderful. The girls in the shop have been trained by Jo to give proper skin-care advice, not just to sell bottles of products. But as well as the skin-care range, the shop, all cream and white like an old-fashioned French perfumer's studio, will sell sweet smells in a multitude of different packagings - bath oils, body lotions and colognes scented with basil and mandarin, nutmeg and ginger, muguet, Verbenas from Provence, grapefruit and Vertyver with spiced orange, and wild lavender with amber. Then there are scented artichoke trees, bundles of scented wild lavender, pot-pourri smelling of orange and cinnamon, all beautifully packaged in simple solid glass bottles with chrome tops. It should be a splendid source of Christmas presents - heart-shaped folding mirrors, scented candles and candle-holders, a sweet-smelling spray for the linen cupboard, as well as a small selection of old-fashioned linens. The shop opens on Monday at 154, Walton Street, London SW3.</p>

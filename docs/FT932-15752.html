			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Pilots to vote on action at BA BRITISH Airways faces possible industrial disruption by its 3,500 pilots that could ground its 200-strong fleet of aircraft and severely affect the company's finances. Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, warned yesterday that in a ballot later this month his members at BA would be called on to support action, including strikes. The discontent stems from the 40 per cent pay disparity between BA's 100 existing pilots at Gatwick Airport, who earn Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 80,000 a year, and 120 less well-paid colleagues formerly employed by Dan Air at Gatwick. When BA acquired Dan Air last October it established a separate company at Gatwick, European Operations Gatwick. EOG has outlined generally inferior terms and conditions of employment for former Dan Air staff. Mr Darke said that BA's existing pilots at Gatwick were now being re-deployed elsewhere to avoid having to increase the salary levels of pilots who previously worked for Dan Air. 'They want to create a tier of second-class pilots,' he said. 'The fear among BA pilots is that this could undermine the whole of their own pay structure.' He also claimed that future pilot recruits for BA at Gatwick would have to accept the terms and conditions enjoyed by the former Dan Air pilots. But BA said last night that the BA pilots at Gatwick would be able to choose over the next three years whether they moved to BA's main divisions, joined the company's regional division, or EOG. 'We are not forcing anybody to do anything. It is entirely voluntary.' Last month BA agreed to drop a plan to impose pay cuts on cabin crew at Gatwick when the Transport and General Workers' union took it to an industrial tribunal. Mr Charles Stuart, a former chairman of Brymon Airways, has died aged 64. Mr Stuart, who was credited with the concept of airline shuttle services, spent 20 with British European Airways and its successor British Airways.</p>

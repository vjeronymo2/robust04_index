			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The chairmen of four  left- oriented Slovak groupings -- the Democratic Left Party  (SDL), the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS), the  Farmers' Movement (HZ) and the Green Party in Slovakia (SZS) --  today signed an agreement on election and post-election  cooperation.    "The coalition will strive to win the elections. It  represents a chance for Slovakia," SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said  after the signing of the document. Leaders of the three  remaining parties, Jaroslav Volf, Jozef Klein and Jozef Pokorny  backed Weiss's view, saying they believed that their election  grouping was the most acceptable for Slovak voters.    Under the agreement, the new coalition will share places on  the lists of candidates in the ratio 24-6-5-3  (SDL-SZS-SDSS-Farmers' Movement), which, according to Weiss,  corresponds to the results of both pre-election polls and the  latest, June 1992 elections.    The left-wing coalition wants to form a broader social  democratic stream on the Slovak political scene, the policy of  which would ensue from left-oriented traditions and "the green  philosophy." The coalition also wants to try to gain  international support, mainly from the Socialist International  member parties and the Party of European Socialists.    Polls show that the left-wing coalition now can count on  15-23 per cent of the vote in the elections slated for the  autumn. According to latest popularity ratings, the coalition  has been gaining upon the preferences of the opposition Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of Slovak ex-premier Vladimir  Meciar.</p>

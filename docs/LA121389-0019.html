			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> U.S. JUDGE JOINS CALL FOR LEGALIZED DRUGS  </P> <P> Drugs, including cocaine and heroin, should be legalized, taxed and dispensed  by the state because the war on drugs is being lost, U.S. District Judge Robert  W. Sweet said in a New York City speech. The result, he said, "would be the  elimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers." Sweet said the  effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more people is not working. Sweet  said he believes the root cause of the drug epidemic is the attraction of high  profits for those in poverty.  </P></p>

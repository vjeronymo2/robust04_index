			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank gives brief boost to European paper European government bonds had a volatile session, rising in the morning following the latest reduction in the Bundesbank's repo rate but slipping back towards the close amid scant retail demand and reports of overseas selling. 'Investors see value in these markets, but no one wants to be the first to buy,' said Mr Garry Jones, senior strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. He said that 'some people are starting to nibble at the market', buying on dips rather than selling into strength. UK gilts were Europe's weakest market yesterday, shrugging off lower-than-expected retail sales numbers and falling by more than a point as January average-earnings and unit labour cost data reignited inflation concerns. The June long gilt future on Liffe fell by around 1 3/32 point to 110 15/16 . Gilts sharply underperformed their core European counterparts, causing their 10-year yield premium over German bunds to widen to about 115 basis points on an annualised basis from 105 basis points at the open. Friday's expected announcement by the Bank of England of its next gilt auction exerted further pressure on prices. 'In the absence of overseas investors, new supply will have to be taken up by domestics  - who have been keeping a very low profile in recent weeks,' said a trader. German bunds strengthened in the morning, despite some disappointment that the Bundesbank shaved only six basis points off its minimum repo rate, bringing it down to 5.88 per cent. However, the drop was larger than the recent three-basis-point reductions, serving as a reminder that the German monetary easing process continues. According to Mr Carl Holt, head of trading at ABN-Amro, 'the market got a bit over-extended in recent days', and slipped back yesterday amid scant retail activity. He did see some investor interest in shorter maturities, which are seen to benefit from further cuts in short-term rates, but 'people are cautious towards the long end', he said. Looking to today's Bundesbank council meeting, few traders expect a cut in the 5.25 per cent discount rate, although there was continued talk of a reduction in the 6.25 per cent Lombard rate. Until the next meeting on April 14, most traders expect the Bundesbank to continue its policy of cautious repo-rate cuts. The Dutch government today will reopen its 7 1/2 per cent 30-year benchmark bond at an auction that is expected to raise between Fl 1bn and Fl 2bn. US bond prices posted solid gains as more favourable news on inflation brought a wave of relief to the hard-pressed Treasuries market. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 better at 92 29/32 , with the yield falling to 6.806 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was up  3/32 to 99 15/32 , to yield 4.895 per cent. For the second day running the Labor Department eased concerns over inflationary pressures, which represent a threat to the value of fixed-rate Treasury bonds. The government said the February consumer price index had risen 0.3 per cent, matching the consensus forecast of analysts. On an annual basis, the index fell to 2.4 per cent, its lowest level for seven years. It was the last big hurdle facing the market this week. The absence of any unpleasant surprises was enough to allow bonds to extend gains struck the previous session. However, buying continued to be subdued during the morning. Some observers believed prices would remain in a narrow range until after the Federal Reserve's policy-making session next week. The prices data, while confirming that inflation was still under control, failed to shake the consensus that the Fed was poised to lift its target for short-term interest rates soon after the March 22 meeting. Despite such misgivings, prices began to rise again in the final hours of trading and reached the session highs by the close. The steady climb suggested to Mr John Donnelly, chief market strategist at Technical Data in Boston, the recent correction in bond prices could be drawing to an end.</p>

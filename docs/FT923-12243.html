			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Architecture: The long saga of St Paul's precinct draws slowly to an amicable close THE long saga of one of the most important sites in London is slowly drawing to a close. Last Friday Paternoster Associates - a partnership consisting of Greycoat Estates, Park Tower Group and Mitsubishi Estate Company - put in the final planning application for the redevelopment of Paternoster Square to the north-east of St Paul's cathedral. The planning committee of the City of London last looked at the proposals for this vital area in December last year when they seemed to be far from happy on several fronts. It is - in theory - not the role of the planning committee to make architectural decisions and so their objections were mainly to do with the lay-out of the scheme, and how the scheme had followed the rules relating to St Paul's heights. There was at that time a feeling that density was the problem too, and that the proposals were worryingly close to overdevelopment. From July 23 it will be possible to see the revised proposals in The Guildhall in the City - although this time there is no large scale exhibition. What exactly has happened to the scheme since December? It remains the predominantly traditional scheme that received the blessing of the majority of the public and The Prince of Wales at an exhibition. The architects are an interesting list. Tom Beeby from the US designed the highly successful new Public Library in Chicago. Allan Greenberg is the leading American classicist. The British contingent of more or less traditionalist architects are John Simpson, Demitri Porphyrios, Robert Adam, Quinlan Terry, Sidell Gibson and Terry Farrell. The major changes concern the new central square which does not now have a large sunken area but is all on one level. There is a new central market hall designed by John Simpson which shelters the escalators that lead to the underground station and to some shopping. There is now a great deal of shopping at ground level throughout the development. John Simpson has designed, for the market hall, a Doric temple with obelisks at the apexes of the pediments. It could be an entertaining building. The biggest re-design has been carried out on Tom Beeby's large office building at the west end of the site. It now looks like a fine example of Edwardian Baroque and does have less mass and bulk than its predecessor. More views of the cathedral have been opened up throughout the scheme and,although it is hard to overcome the bulk of so many offices, the ground level of the whole scheme is now much more interesting. It has always been my view that there should be more public activities on the site and that an hotel, the City Corporation's art gallery and part of the Museum of London belong on this site. A really fine health club would undoubtedly do well - the one proposed looks on the mean side. Property developers believe their researchers (despite Canary Wharf) who tell them that only offices and more offices will succeed when the recession is over. Although there is optimism that this particular scheme, because of its marvellous location, may well succeed despite the recession I cannot believe that it is too late to look at - what the planners call - enhancing the mix. There are still two very sensitive areas of great concern in the Paternoster proposals. They do not technically form part of the consortium's plans but they are very much related to the final plans for the whole area. One is the site occupied by the ghastly tower block near Newgate Street known as Sudbury House which is now the responsibility of Nuclear Electric. This is to be demolished and its replacement will impinge considerably on the master plan for the whole Paternoster site. A design has been prepared by the Rolfe Judd Partnership for a large low, deep plan block. To date it looks as though it will be a compatible, if unexciting neighbour. The other more significant site is the major one on the north side of Ludgate Hill, close to the West front of the cathedral which is currently occupied by Juxon House. This is in different ownership from the major part of the Paternoster site but talks have been held between the owners to ensure a degree of architectural compatibility. The architect for the replacement of Juxon House, is William Whitfield and he is likely to produce a decent neighbour. He is highly experienced in designing for sensitive sites. He was consultant on a major office building near Westminster Abbey. He has designed the new Chapter House at St. Alban's Abbey and his new offices for the Department of Health by the Cenotaph in Whitehall have won plaudits from a variety of critics. I can see no reason for the City of London Planning Committee to be disappointed in the revised Paternoster scheme - it has been adapted to meet all their criticisms. The site is so well located that its owners feel that it is almost outside the property recession. The present near derelict condition of the site - at the heart of the City  - should shame everyone into action. I recommend a visit to the Guildhall to see the revised model (from July 23) particularly as the exclusive group that runs the Architecture Foundation refused to include Paternoster in their recent 'City Changes' exhibition at the Royal Exchange. When will we have a genuinely catholic architectural culture?</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: Government awaits the political counterpunch IRISH industry and farm leaders at the weekend expressed relief at the government's defeat in its battle to defend the punt. But the reversal is likely to lead to some tough political battles ahead. Mr Michael Noonan, finance spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party, described the decision to devalue as 'an ignominious climbdown and a most dismal defeat for the government. They failed to put domestic policies in place that would convince the international community that we were serious about the defence of the currency and they also failed to convince our colleagues in Europe that they should come to our aid.' The resolve of Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, was finally broken by the loss of political and business consensus at home and the threat of a sharp increase next week in mortgage and bank lending rates. He said yesterday: 'I could not put my hand on my heart and recommend to the government that Irish mortgage holders and business should pay another 3, 4 or 5 per cent (on interest rates) for the sake of trying to win a battle for a European system where I was not getting even equal support that the French were getting.' Since the last of Ireland's exchange controls were lifted at the beginning of the year, interest rate management has been the government's main weapon to defend the punt. This has forced up commercial lending rates to record levels. Several key manufacturing associations, particularly in the textiles, food processing and engineering sectors, warned last week that thousands of job losses were in the pipeline, and urged the government to devalue. Farm leaders have been recommending a devaluation for months. Although the immediate threat of big job losses and more interest rate rises has been averted by the devaluation, it is thought unlikely that commercial lending rates will fall from their current levels for some time yet. As a result of staying within the narrow band of the ERM, downward movements in Irish rates will still have to await cuts in German rates if further attacks on the punt are to be avoided. There is also lingering concern about whether the markets will see a 10 per cent devaluation as sufficient, especially if the UK pursues an aggressive interest rate policy. Mr John Beggs, chief economist at Allied Irish Banks, said: 'In the short term I would expect some improvement on the interest rate front. Looking beyond that, I think we have hitched our wagon to sterling and whether you agree with the devaluation policy or not, that is a problem we face.' Mr Ahern defended his no-devaluation stance. 'If we had given in last September we could well be here today on the third or fourth devaluation.' He said there would be no further devaluations. 'We have built into the figures competitive advantage for future turbulence and we have done that to convince the markets that that is the end of speculation.' The country's priority now was to diversify further its exports away from the UK market. The immediate cost to the government of the devaluation has been to increase the foreign debt by IPounds 1bn and its servicing charge by IPounds 80m per year. The new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition has committed itself to a job creation and public sector investment programme, which will entail a public sector deficit in the region of 3.2 per cent of GDP this year, and there is still some IPounds 300m in commitments whose financing has not yet been resolved. Mr Ahern promised yesterday that next month's budget would be a tough one, as any softening on that front would again encourage the speculators. This is likely to produce tensions within the ruling coalition, as Labour views job creation as a priority and will resist cuts in its favoured investment programmes. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which supported the no-devaluation policy, also hinted yesterday that its policy of negotiated pay restraint over the past six years might now be reviewed.</p>

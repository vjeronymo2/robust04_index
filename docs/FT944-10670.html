			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (4): Debt burden has been eased - Stephen Fidler examines the external economy Bolivia's inflation rate has fallen dramatically and moderate growth has resumed. Its debt burden has been lowered through judicious negotiations with commercial and foreign government lenders. The government has no outstanding debt to foreign banks having bought back the loans to banks, in two stages,at steep discounts to face value. The country remains nonetheless highly susceptible to external financial and price shocks and over-dependent on financial help from foreign governments, multilateral institutions and non-government organisations from abroad. The involvement of these agencies significantly reduces - for better or for worse - the government's freedom of policy action and undoubtedly lengthens the time it takes to make decisions. Bolivia's exports are still highly concentrated in a few commodities, prices of which are dependent on uncertain world markets. Between 1985 and 1993, the government estimates its terms of trade deteriorated by 60 per cent and the deficit on the current account averaged about 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Last year, the deficit widened to an unsustainable 13 per cent of GDP, although the picture has improved this year, helped by a sharp rise in non-traditional exports. To cover its shortfall, the government has needed international assistance. In the past, this has run at some Dollars 700m a year. After the government signed a Dollars 140m three-year loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund in Washington last month, Bolivian officials headed for Paris to secure a further Dollars 1.1bn aid package to help finance their reform programme in coming years. However, the government recognises the reliability of such future flows is open to question. The governments of industrialised countries face intensified budget pressures, and the emergence of competing regions for aid  -the former communist countries, the Middle East and southern Africa - suggest that the future availability of finance cannot be taken for granted. Bolivia has one of the highest per capita dependencies on foreign assistance in the world. 'We are going to lower our dependence on aid. It's not sustainable,' says Mr Fernando Candia, the central bank president. Indeed, debt ratios remain high. Total foreign debt totalled Dollars 3.79bn  -55 per cent of GDP - at the end of last year, of which about Dollars 1.6bn is owed to foreign governments and Dollars 2.1bn to multilateral agencies. The ratio of total debt to exports was 536 per cent at the end of 1992, and debt service accounted for 39 per cent of export revenues. Because the government's reform efforts are expected to increase the budget deficit in the next two to three years - the World Bank says the programme will cost 3.5 per cent of GDP during the period 1994 to 1997 - the government's need for finance will increase. The government is expected to take on the debt of the railways and mining company, but other debts are expected to be transferred to the capitalised companies. The net effect, says Mr Candia, is a net reduction of Dollars 300m in public sector debt. After 1997, the government hopes that increased tax revenues from the capitalised companies will start to improve its financial position. Furthermore, after capitalisation, increased foreign investment flows should allow the country to reduce its dependence on foreign aid and increased exports lower its need for foreign finance. In the meantime, the sharp increase in non-traditional exports - up 83 per cent in the first half of 1994 over 12 months earlier - has helped the current account position. This year's first-half current account deficit fell 67.3 per cent to to Dollars 86.1m from Dollars 263.3m last year. The increase in exports has also been helped by firmer commodity prices. It may also be that at last the economy is responding to a central bank policy which aims to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate and to hold it stable in real terms. At the same time, lower interest rates overseas and an improved perception of the political and credit risk of placing funds in Bolivia has allowed some repatriation of flight capital. As a result, net foreign reserves have now risen to their highest level in Bolivian history: Dollars 550m - equivalent to about 5 1/2 months of imports.</p>

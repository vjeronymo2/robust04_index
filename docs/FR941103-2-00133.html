			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Sponsor will deposit in each Series zero coupon obligations at a price determined by an independent evaluator and shares of a Fund at their net asset value. With the deposit of the zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in a Series, the Sponsor will have established a proportionate relationship between the principal amount of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares so that the initial investors will receive at least their original purchase price, including sales charges, upon termination of the Series. Simultaneously with such deposit, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor registered certificates for units in each Series which will represent the entire ownership of the Series. The units of a Series will be offered for sale to the public by the Sponsor through the final prospectus after the registration statement of Form S&hyph;6 under the Securities Act has been declared effective and clearance with the applicable state authorities has been obtained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The units will be offered initially at a price based on the net asset value of the shares of a Fund selected for deposit in that Series, the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations deposited in the Series, plus a sales charge. An independent evaluator will charge each Series an evaluation fee for the cost of determining the value of zero coupon obligations that are deposited in the Series. No such fee will be charged on Fund shares deposited in the Series because the value of those securities is readily available. Upon redemption, each Series will redeem units in that Series at prices based on the aggregate bid side value of the zero coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund's shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Although it will not be obligated to do so, the Sponsor will contract with a registered broker-dealer (the ``Market Maker''), initially expected to be an organization unaffiliated with the Sponsor, to maintain a secondary market for the units. The Market Maker will repurchase the units at a price based on the aggregate bid side value of the zero coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund's shares (excluding sales loads on Fund shares) and will reoffer the units at this price plus a sales charge. The extent to which the Market Maker maintains a secondary market for the units will reduce the number of units presented to the Series for redemption and thus obviate the need for the Series to sell zero coupon obligations or Fund shares to meet redemption requests. In the event that the Sponsor does not enter into or maintain a contract with the Market Maker, or the Market Maker does not maintain a secondary market in the units, the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to sell Fund shares or zero coupon obligations, the latter only if after the sale the original proportional relationship between zero coupon obligations and unit value is maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Sponsor will be permitted under the Trust Agreement to deposit additional securities, which may result in a potential corresponding increase in the number of units outstanding. Such units may be continuously offered for sale to the public by means of a prospectus. The Sponsor anticipates that any additional securities deposited in the Series subsequent to the initial date of deposit in connection with the sale of these additional units will maintain the proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Each Fund will be an open-end management investment company that is registered under the Act. Each Fund will be advised by the Adviser, have its shares distributed by the Distributor, or otherwise be a fund within the same group of investment companies, within the meaning of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Some of the Funds may impose front-end sales loads (``FESL''), contingent deferred sales charges (``CDSC'') in accordance with an exemptive order (the ``CDSC Order''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  or rule 12b&hyph;1 fees. Any FESL or CDSC will be waived by the Fund on purchases by a Series and any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees will either be waived or rebated immediately to the Trustee of a Series by the Fund. In the event that a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee is rebated in this manner, the Series will use the rebated fee to pay for that Series' expenses and distribute to unit holders any remainder. If rule 12b&hyph;1 fees are not charged by the Fund, the Series will pay for its expenses from any income received from distributions paid on Fund shares and, if necessary, will sell Fund shares to pay for expenses. Zero coupon obligations held by a Series will not be sold to pay for Series or Trust expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20284 (May 9, 1994) (notice) and 20336 (June 6, 1994) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

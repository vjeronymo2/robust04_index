			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Haitians stay calm as Aristide resumes power Haitians largely heeded the call of their returned president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to relax and avoid violence in the wake of his return over the weekend to Haiti after more than three years in exile. President Aristide did his part to keep the peace by remaining in the presidential palace on Sunday morning, skipping a mass he was scheduled to attend. The president's low profile was a victory for US security forces who are afraid that numerous public appearances would make Mr Aristide an easy target while simultaneously whipping his supporters into a fervour that could get out of hand. The president made a speech on Saturday inside a box of bullet-proof glass and was never got within 100m of the general public. At the same time US army vehicles circulated amongst the crowd playing anti-violence messages through huge loudspeakers. In the speech from the steps of the national palace to a crowd of fewer than 100,000, far less than organisers had expected, Mr Aristide pleaded with his people to shun the violence that has torn this country apart for the past 3 years of military rule. At one point he asked the crowd to take an oath against vengeance and for reconciliation. The crowd reply affirmatively with a roaring 'yes.' Mr Aristide's sway over much of the population, even among those who did not attend the rally, was evident. 'Aristide told us to stay cool, so we are going to stay cool. We love the man,' said Ms Dienla Paul as she walked to church on Sunday morning. Some are questioning how long the president, known for his love of mixing with the people, can remain inside his box and still have his anti-violence message remain effective beyond this honeymoon period. Already there have been reports of at least three attacks on supporters of the military coup in the countryside, where Mr Aristide's call may be more faint and the US military presence is less forceful than in the capital. The task of rebuilding the country's economy and spirit will nevertheless be easier now that there is a government that can begin work. 'We have a few meetings scheduled for later this week,' said Lt Raymond Kelly, head of the international police monitoring programme. 'The government knows what needs to be done, it just has to move forward quickly while everything is calm.' Observer, Page 29</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SAUDIS REPORTEDLY LAYING PLANS TO STAY AT TOP OF OIL MARKET  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, plans to spend $15 billion in  the next six years to maintain its supremacy in the oil market, regional  bankers and oil industry analysts said today.  </P> <P> "Saudi Arabia wants to remain a market leader in the 1990s," one oil industry  manager said. "It also does not want its share within OPEC to erode as world  demand grows."  </P> <P> Oil industry sources in the Gulf said the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco)  wants to push the kingdom's oil output capacity to 10 million barrels per day  by 1995 from the current 6.5 million.  </P> <P> Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia's plan was a clear warning to some of  its OPEC partners and to independent producers who might be planning expensive  oil development schemes beyond the year 2000. "Would you contemplate a new  investment in the North Sea if you heard the Saudis will double what they are  producing now by 1995?" an oil industry executive said.  </P></p>

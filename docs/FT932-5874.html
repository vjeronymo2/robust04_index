			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / House prices rise for third month in a row HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1 per cent in May, the third consecutive monthly increase, according to Nationwide, Britain's second biggest building society. The society's monthly price index, published yesterday, provides the firmest evidence so far that the revival in house sales is starting to spill over into price rises. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'House prices have now risen in four out of the first five months of 1993, reflecting increased activity in the housing market.' The average price of a home acquired with a Nationwide loan has risen by 1.9 per cent since the beginning of this year, from Pounds 51,862 to Pounds 52,866. Despite the improvement, the average price of a home last month was still 5.5 per cent lower than during May last year, said the society. House prices collapsed last summer and autumn when the pound came under severe pressure and sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. Sales have improved since Christmas, however, halting the slide in prices. Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported that house prices in April rose by 1.6 per cent, the largest monthly increase for more than four years. Halifax is due to publish house price figures for May on Friday. The society is not expecting the large increases it reported in April and March to be repeated. Building societies say prices traditionally pick up at this time of year and they do not expect monthly price rises to continue at the current rate during the remainder of the year. Mr Davis said: 'We are likely to see a continuing upturn in house sales over the next few months, provided buyer confidence is reinforced as the economic recovery develops. If confidence continues to build, we expect house prices to strengthen somewhat in the remainder of 1993.' Sales figures for 15 of the country's largest housebuilders show that offers to buy new homes rose by 29 per cent during the first 20 weeks of this year. The weekly figures compiled by the Housebuilders Federation measure net reservations (sales on which a deposit has been paid) less cancellations, including purchases by housing associations. They show that the rate of increase in net reservations slowed in April and May compared with the corresponding months last year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the housebuilder, said yesterday: 'The rise in sales is helping builders to reduce sales incentives and discounts.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Slovak Foreign Minister  Eduard Kukan this evening arrived on an official visit to  Bulgaria. Tomorrow he is expected to meet his Bulgarian  counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, President Zhelyu Zhelev,  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and Deputy Prime  Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The sides are expected to review the  legal framework of the bilateral relations. Signing of accords  is not envisaged.    The Bulgarian-Slovak ties date back to the 1939-45 period,  the time of the first Slovak state. Bulgaria was the sixth  country to recognize Slovakia after Czechoslovakia was divided  and immediately after the two countries established diplomatic  relations in September 1993. According to a Foreign Ministry  spokesman, the current state of the bilateral relations can be  described as very good. Experts are now intensively drafting a  number of economic accords.    President Zhelev went to Bratislava during a February 1991  visit to Czecho-Slovakia. In April 1992 then Slovak prime  minister Jan Carnogursky paid a formal visit in Sofia. Informal  meetings between the two parliaments' speakers followed in 1992  and 1993. Slovak President Michal Kovac last August came to the  Bulgarian Black Sea coast on a holiday. In the meantime he met  Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and invited him to visit  Slovakia.    The Bulgarian-Slovak commercial exchange marks an  equilibrium  with figures which are nearly identical in the two directions.  According to experts, the effected levels are too low and do not  correspond to the countries' potentials.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, made a  skeptical assessment of Moscow's proposal calling on Pyongyang  to participate in the international meeting to discuss the  situation on the Korean peninsula.    He, in an interview with reporters in Moscow, said he doubts  whether the meeting is necessary when the majority of parties  that will participate in the meeting are pro-U.S. He also  pointed out that participating in the meeting would place the  DPRK in a very difficult position.    Ambassador Son said he sees the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula as a matter between Pyongyang and Washington. If the  issue is internationalized, (?finding a solution to the nuclear  problem would be even more difficult), he added.</p>

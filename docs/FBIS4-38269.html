			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Amin Abu-Wardah] </F>   [Text] Nabulus -- The Arab Liberation Front [ALF], a PLO  faction, has reaffirmed its lack of commitment to the  Gaza-Jericho accord and all that it construes despite the fact  that the ALF has remained within the PLO's framework. The ALF  stated that it will not follow a specific policy nor abandon any  form of "struggle" while maintaining its freedom to determine  its policy according to the requirements that fulfill the  Palestinian people's hopes and aspirations.    A statement issued by the ALF -- led by Abu-al-'Abbas -- and  distributed in Nabulus said that the ALF will deal with any  institution that will be established through the new political  reality if it becomes clear that this institution serves the  interest of Palestinian society and is committed to the  Palestinian people's causes, be that the Palestinian police  force or other institutions whose positive role in improving the  social situation becomes evident.</p>

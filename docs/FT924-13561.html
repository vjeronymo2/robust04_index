			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Anxiety over weak sales rise WEAK retail sales statistics and climbing producer prices yesterday did nothing to dispel anxiety about the US economy. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.3 per cent in September to Dollars 161.1bn. But much of the increase came from sales of building materials and home furnishings. Economists suggested this was temporary because of rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew had hit southern Florida. The producer price index, meanwhile, rose in September by 0.3 per cent from the previous month, the Labour Department announced, to show year-on-year wholesale price inflation of 1.6 per cent. Energy prices rose by 0.8 per cent during September, after small declines in July and August. Consumer food prices continued to rise, though at a slower pace than in August. Consumer goods, without the volatile food and energy components, rose by 0.2 per cent, helped by dearer tobacco. Prices of intermediate supplies and components rose by 0.2 per cent in September, to show slower year-on-year inflation of 0.9 per cent.</p>

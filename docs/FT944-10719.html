			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Equitable climbs 25% on higher investment spreads Equitable, the US financial services group, continued to benefit from an improvement in insurance earnings during the third quarter, which more than made up for a deterioration in profits from investment banking. The 25 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 89.3m, or 42 cents a share, was driven mainly by higher investment spreads in the insurance and annuities business. Mr Joseph Malone, chairman of the group's US life insurance arm, added that an improvement in mortality experience and lower unit costs also helped. After-tax earnings from insurance and annuities rose to Dollars 63m from Dollars 37.4m a year ago. Both figures are before capital gains and one-off restructuring charges, which resulted in net charges of Dollars 3.4m in the latest period and Dollars 7.6bn a year ago. Net income from fund management and investment banking slipped to Dollars 31.6m from Dollars 56.9m. This was before a Dollars 28.5m after-tax gain from the sale of part of the group's interest in Alliance Capital Management. While Alliance's earnings rose 15 per cent from a year ago, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Equitable's investment banking subsidiary, saw after-tax earnings fall by 48 per cent, to Dollars 25.5m.</p>

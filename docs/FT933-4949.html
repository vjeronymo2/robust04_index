			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / British Gas demands curbs on regulator: Sir James McKinnon accused of high-handedness and manipulating media BRITISH GAS has called for radical measures to curb the powers of Sir James McKinnon, the industry's regulator. It accused him of deliberately stoking up acrimony between the two organisations by being high-handed and manipulating the media. In a wide-ranging attack on Ofgas and its director-general, British Gas complained in strong, often bitter terms, about its treatment at the hands of Ofgas and Sir James when giving evidence to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's recent investigation of the gas market. The MMC's full report was published yesterday following the release of its main recommendations last month. These called for the break-up of British Gas by 1997, followed by the abolition of the monopoly in the tariff market for small customers. The comments about Ofgas and Sir James, in which British Gas seemed to be venting its frustrations, went much further than earlier clashes in the long battle between company and regulator. Last night, Sir James declined to comment on the criticisms and proposals. British Gas portrayed Ofgas as an organisation out to manipulate the media, and intent on personalising the conflict so that it could be portrayed as 'David versus Goliath'. In particular, it said that Ofgas: started from a position that any proposal from British Gas would be unsatisfactory; exploited the media, putting out press releases that were inaccurate and emotional in tone; was reluctant to acknowledge any good performance; distorted the results of face-to-face meetings in correspondence, placing the worst possible interpretation on any position taken by British Gas. The submission to the MMC included an attack on Sir James who, it said, 'frequently threatened the unnecessary use' of his powers in order to achieve his objectives. Altogether, Ofgas's behaviour made the relationship far worse than it need have been, British Gas said, and this affected the attitudes of investors and lenders to the company. British Gas said that the role of Ofgas should be limited to regulating monopoly activities, and that wider questions of competition in the gas business should be removed from its aegis. It proposed measures for utilities regulators similar to the Cadbury Committee proposals on corporate governance. These included that Ofgas should publish, with its reasons, the basis for any proposed enforcement decision; that there should be an adequate appeals process to deal with disputes between the regulator and utility; and that regulatory power should be vested in a gas commission rather than the director-general, who had 'excessive discretion'. In its report, the MMC said it believed that the regulatory system was fundamentally sound. The 1,000-page report also revealed that the Department of Trade and Industry, which must decide the future of British Gas, is wary of proceeding too fast with radical changes. In a submission to the MMC, officials in the DTI's oil and gas division said that breaking up British Gas and abolishing the monopoly in the tariff market for small customers were 'complex' exercises for which there were no precedents in other countries. The DTI said last night that no decisions had been taken about the report. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is seeking comments by the end of next month.

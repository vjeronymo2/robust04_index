The concrete reason is Volker  Ruehe's intention to refrain from using partly brand-new combat  and transport helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8) of the GDR [German  Democratic Reublic] National People's Army (NVA). In the  opinion of the Audit Office, the use of the equipment might save  up to 1.5 billion German marks [DM] from 1994 to 2002, while,  "however, the transport and operational opportunities of the  Bundeswehr helicopters would be improved." At the same time,  the Cabinet committed Ruehe to saving an additional DM1.25  billion in his budget in 1994 alone.    The helicopters are the only armored ones owned by the  Bundeswehr and they could thus effectively support dangerous  humanitarian missions (Somalia) or such of the new  "crisis-reaction forces." It is assumed that the reason for  Ruehe's resistance is that he either does not want to correct a  former decision of his house or fears that the plans for new  helicopter models would then be stopped for the time being. The  budget committee of the Bundestag will deal with the topic at  the end of February, since an agreement between the Audit Office  and the ministry was not achieved last week.    According to the Audit Office, the limited use of the NVA  helicopters would permit the earlier replacement of outdated or  unfit helicopters and accelerate the planned transition to more  powerful machines. Moreover, the planning of new construction  programs by the Bundeswehr and industry is ensured.    The Audit Office also criticized the delayed and incomplete  delivery of documents. In May 1993, the Audit Committee of the  Bundestag (a body in the Budget Committee) called on Ruehe "to  check the further use of the total stock of all available  helicopters by means of cost-benefit analyses and analyses of  demand and to reconsider, above all, his decision to refrain  from using the Mi-24 combat helicopters and the Mi-8 transport  helicopters."    The Defense Ministry stated that all necessary examinations  had already been carried out earlier. The Audit Office said:  "Nevertheless, a new examination, which was internally checked  by the Defense Ministry until January 1994, was going on until  September 1993. The present report contains a survey of the  'Bundeswehr's helicopter planning'; however, it neither contains  the requested analyses of demand nor cost-benefit analyses, but  it only recompiles already known information."    According to the Audit Office, the Defense Ministry's  assumptions in its cost accounting for the use of the two NVA  helicopters are "incomplete or incorrect," which disadvantages  the NVA material. The Defense Ministry's statement that there  are no documents that show the costs of use by the NVA are not  available is "wrong."</p>

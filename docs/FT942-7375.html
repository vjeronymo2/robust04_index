			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / EU power deadlock continues EU energy ministers failed yesterday to break the deadlock on plans to deregulate electricity markets. Lack of agreement on new proposals for opening electricity suppliers to competition dimmed hopes for a decision on liberalisation later this year in spite of Germany's insistence that energy will be a priority when it takes over the EU presidency in July. The main obstacle yesterday in Brussels remained third party access - allowing customers to buy electricity directly from any supplier able to provide it. The Commission is backing a system of 'negotiated access' whereby electricity users have to negotiate the use of national networks, rather than having automatic access. However, with frustration at the lack of progress mounting steadily, it also said it was willing to 'consider' a French proposal for a so-called single purchaser system, under which one body independent of the generator would be responsible for selling electricity.</p>

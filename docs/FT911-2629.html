			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Air Canada Seeks To Cancel Boeing Orders AIR CANADA, caught by the international slump in air travel, has asked Boeing to cancel orders and options on a long list of aircraft, writes Robert Gibbens. The airline, privatised two years ago before the onset of recession and the Gulf war, is asking Boeing to cancel orders on three 747-400s for first delivery in 1993 and is expected to seek cancellation of orders for six 767-300s and options on another 12. Air Canada has been losing money for several successive quarters and has to cut back on its fleet renewal and expansion programme.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Finnish message for devaluation pundits For all the volatility on individual markets, what with the Finnish devaluation, the Swedish response, privatisation hopes in Italy and depressed sen-timent in Spain, the FT-Actuaries Europe index ended flat on the week last Friday, ahead of Sunday's stirring events. While the US managed a slightly positive performance, the prime mover, within the 1.0 per cent decline in the World Index, was a 4.1 per cent drop in Japan. Nearly all of this was seen last Friday, when the Nikkei average fell 4 per cent after publication of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly economic survey, which showed business confidence at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. Finland, meanwhile, is getting into the habit of producing gains more apparent than real. Equities rose in markka terms after the devaluation of November 1991; but that devaluation did not work. Last week, a repeat process produced a rise of 6.7 per cent in local currency terms; but in terms of the dollar Finland was 7.6 per cent down. Perhaps there is a message there for politicians and pundits of other nationalities. Among the worst performing markets, in local currency terms, were Sweden and South Africa. On Wednesday, after an initial fall on the Finnish devaluation, the Swedish central bank raised its marginal lending rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent, to reverse the capital outflow from the country and to relieve pressure on the krona caused by Finland's currency crisis. In addition, there was more disturbing news from the financial sector, anticipating losses from Svenska Kredit and Gota. South Africa dropped from Monday on news that Ciskei soldiers had opened fire on ANC supporters. Fears of continued violence were sustained until last Friday, when the market recovered on news that the ANC would hold talks with the government.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in               % change in local currency**       sterling** US Dollars**             1 Week    4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                          1992       1992        1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +2.33      +5.93   -29.84   -13.09     -11.04      -8.52 Belgium      +0.57      -1.08    -7.30    -6.36      -4.83      -2.13 Denmark      -0.06      -9.69   -29.95   -26.08     -24.20     -22.05 Finland      +6.67     -11.48   -38.35   -24.62     -32.63     -30.72 France       +0.72      +1.96    -1.28    +1.91      +4.08      +7.03 Germany      -0.56      -1.89   -11.02    -6.52      -4.89      -2.20 Ireland      -2.33      -4.73   -19.43   -14.47     -12.50     -10.02 Italy        -0.96      -7.45   -30.32   -26.66     -26.18     -24.09 Netherlands  +0.23      -1.31    -1.89    +1.54      +3.24      +6.16 Norway       -0.40      -9.28   -38.94   -23.65     -22.27     -20.07 Spain        -3.19      +1.18   -20.89   -15.19     -15.29     -12.89 Sweden       -4.72      -9.08   -26.80   -11.50     -10.08      -7.54 Switzerland  +1.73      +0.77    +4.67    +8.23     +10.76     +13.90 UK           +0.17      -0.03   -11.57    -5.78      -5.78      -3.11 EUROPE       -0.04      -0.77   -10.95    -5.85      -4.91      -2.21 Australia    -1.64      -3.49    -6.88   -11.15     -17.52     -15.18 Hong Kong    -2.71      -5.37   +37.67   +28.52     +25.78     +29.35 Japan        -4.07     +21.78   -20.54   -19.27     -21.02     -18.77 Malaysia     +0.60      +2.62    +5.56    +2.19      +8.24     +11.31 New Zealand  -2.39      -1.15    -3.51   -10.55     -12.38      -9.90 Singapore    -0.14      +3.20    -9.09   -13.95     -15.07     -12.66 Canada       -0.55      +1.75    -2.12    -3.36     -11.06      -8.55 USA          +0.65      -0.04    +9.48    +0.70      -2.08      +0.70 Mexico       -6.76     -11.92    +2.27   -11.61     -15.19     -12.78 South Africa -4.71      -3.85   -12.32   -13.45     -29.95     -27.96 WORLD INDEX  -1.02      +4.45    -5.84    -7.30      -9.13      -6.55  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 11th 1992.

Long Beach didn't allow a touchdown to  Fullerton in a controlled scrimmage last Saturday.  </P> <P> "I just hope we can gain a yard or two," OCC Coach Bill Workman said jokingly.  "From what we saw, they are very good on defense and it should be a real  challenge for us."  </P> <P> Fullerton, Golden West, Rancho Santiago and Saddleback open their seasons Sept.  15.

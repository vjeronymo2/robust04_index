			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Securities Institute launched A PROFESSIONAL body for the securities industry, modelled on institutes in the accountancy and legal professions, has been launched. The Securities Institute aims to attract members of the London Stock Exchange as well as people working in related fields such as investment analysis, corporate finance and investment management. The creation of the body is in part a reaction to the Big Bang reforms of six years ago, when control of the exchange passed from individual stockbrokers to securities firms. Since then, many brokers have bemoaned the passing of the old 'club' spirit with the demise of the trading floor. Mr Graham Ross Russell, chairman of the institute and a former deputy chairman of the exchange, said he hoped that membership of the body would be 'useful for members' career prospects' and would give clients added confidence in their advisers. Unlike other professional bodies, the institute will not play a large role in regulating its members. Statutory regulation passed under the Financial Services Act from the exchange to the Securities and Futures Authority (formerly The Securities Association), and this will remain the main regulator for the industry.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: No one's interests are served in undermining prices index Sir, Leaving aside its wholly unfounded, and indeed insulting, premise, your attack on the advisory committee on the Retail Prices Index (Leading article, 'RPI RIP', May 21) as an anachronism 'representing vested interests determined to get as much out of cost-of-living compensation as possible' is hard to reconcile with the decision of your distinguished columnist Samuel Brittan to join the committee, a decision which we would all welcome. Let me explain why the present arrangement is still generally supported. You say the job of determining the index should be left to the Central Statistical Office. As CSO officials will testify, many of the points in the handling of the RPI have benefited from non-governmental expertise. Statistics users have confidence in the RPI: this is not unconnected with the fact that it is seen to be free of government manipulation, unlike the unemployment figures, to take one notable example. Many billions of pounds of public expenditure are determined by the figure. No one's interests are served by undermining it. So far as the TUC is concerned, we have loyally supported all the recommendations of the advisory committee even when we may have a preferred different result. If we are to move towards a Euro formula in the context of European Monetary Union it will be equally vital that the future has public support. I look forward to hearing Samuel Brittan's advocacy of a new approach to housing. If he has something constructive to say he will find an eqully constructive response by members of the committee. D E Lea, assistant general secretary (member of the RPI advisory committee), Trades Union Congress, Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS</p>

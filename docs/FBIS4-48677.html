			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 24 May (AFP) -- A UN envoy arrived in  Kigali on Tuesday [24 May] and held talks with Rwandan Army  commanders to pave the way for a new UN peacekeeping mission in  blood-drenched Rwanda despite rebel objections, a spokesman said.    The envoy, Iqbal Riza, met rebel leaders in their northern  stronghold of Mulindi on Monday but was unable to reach  agreement with them on the size of a planned UN force, spokesman  Abdul Kabia said. The rebels object to the UN's plan to send  5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and maintain that 2,500 soldiers  will be enough to escort relief convoys.    The blue helmets have not been mandated to intervene in  fighting between the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front and government  forces. But they are supposed to stem the wholesale slaughter  of civilians by bloodthirsty militiamen. Up to half a million  Rwandans have been butchered in six weeks of ethnic carnage.    Diplomats and military analysts, however, said it was  unclear  how they could do so, whether they numbered 5,500 or 2,500. The  rebels objected to Riza's plan to hold talks with the  self-proclaimed interim government on Wednesday, saying such a  meeting would be tantamount to recognising the government's  legitimacy. But Kabia said the planned meeting "does not  constitute recognition of the government." "The special envoy  will see the government as the de facto authority because he was  mandated to talk to all parties," Kabia told AFP by telephone  from Kigali.    Rebels and government soldiers held fire as Riza's plane  arrived from the Ugandan capital Kampala late Tuesday morning.  Riza cancelled his plan to drive to Kigali from rebel  headquarters in Mulindi, near the Ugandan border, on Monday,  saying neither side could guarantee his security.</p>

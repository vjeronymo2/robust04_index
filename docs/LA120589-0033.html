			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERIOR JUDGES BACK ESCONDIDO COURT PACKAGE  </P> <P> San Diego County's Superior Court judges voted Monday to recommend that a new  courts complex be built as quickly as possible in Escondido -- and eventually  in Vista as well -- despite a county staff recommendation that new courts in  North County be built only in Vista.  </P> <P> The judges' recommendation will be forwarded to the county Board of Supervisors  today, although board debate is expected to be delayed a week at the request of  Supervisor John MacDonald.  </P> <P> Vista city officials have pledged to help build a seven-story courthouse  alongside the existing courts complex in their city, to accommodate 31 more  courtrooms to serve North County. Part of Vista's offer includes the donation  of 6 acres next to the existing courthouse site.  </P> <P> The county staff recommended the Vista expansion partly because of the  logistics problems, and additional costs, of operating two courts complexes in  North County.  </P> <P> But the caveat to the Vista proposal is that the complex would be funded  primarily by revenue to be generated by last year's passage of Proposition A, a  half-cent increase in the county's sales tax to help pay for courts and jails  expansion. That measure, however, has been challenged in court as unlawful, and  county officials don't know when -- or if -- proceeds from the measure will  become available.  </P> <P> For that reason, most of San Diego County's 61 Superior Court judges voted to  endorse Escondido's proposal for a 22-courtroom complex that would essentially  split North County's courts into two centers, Greer said Monday.  </P> <P> Escondido had promised $10 million in a combination of cash, land donations and  property trades toward construction of its courthouse. The rest of the  construction cost would be financed by the county's share of Escondido's  redevelopment agency profits. Because of that, Escondido officials have boasted  that the 22-courtroom complex could be built without any reliance on the  now-frozen Proposition A funds.  </P> <P> Greer said 51 of the 61 judges voted to support the construction of new courts  in both Escondido and Vista; six voted to support new courts in Escondido and  four voted for new courts only in Vista.  </P> <P> In contrast, Vista Municipal Court judges voted last week unanimously to  support the expansion of the Vista courts complex.  </P> <P> Greer said the majority of the Superior Court judges favor new courts in both  cities because, by the time money is available to build courts in Vista to  supplement those in Escondido, both complexes will be needed.  </P> <P> "In order to meet both the long-term needs and the short-term needs of the  Superior Court in North County, we recommend approval and implementation of  each of the two proposals," Greer said.  </P> <P> "We need all of them," he said. "This is not a North County problem. This is a  countywide problem. Our criminal case load in Vista is tremendous, and a recent  decision by the California Supreme Court allows persons to be tried any place  in the county.  </P> <P> "That means that, when we're filled up in Vista, we'll be trying North County's  criminal cases in San Diego. In two years, we'll be at a civil (lawsuit)  shutdown as a result of hearing nothing but criminal cases in this county.  </P> <P> "Unless we find a solution as fast as possible to build courtrooms in North  County, the result will be that the whole county will be disadvantaged," Greer  said.  </P> <P> "Escondido has a way to build the courts, and that's our good fortune because  there's no money elsewhere to build them," he said.  </P> <P> Greer said he wasn't sure what influence the Superior Court judges will have on  the decision by the supervisors.  </P> <P> "But I hope they'll pay attention to the fact that they are lighting a fuse  that will blow up in all of our faces in three years, and that Escondido is  offering a solution. I don't care where the courts are built, but they've got  to be built now."  </P> <P> MacDonald said he will ask fellow supervisors for a week's delay in discussing  the courthouse issue in order to provide Escondido officials time to rebut the  county staff recommendation favoring Vista.  </P></p>

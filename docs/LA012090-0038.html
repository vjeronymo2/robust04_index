			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DRUG WARS': MEXICO, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE NEWS MEDIA  </P> <P> "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," the NBC miniseries about the murder of U.S.  agent Enrique Camarena by Mexican drug dealers, demonstrated not only the  complicity of the Mexican government -- and of the Reagan/Bush Administration  in the subsequent cover-up -- but also that corruption thrives when the media  cooperate.  </P> <P> After the final episode, news anchor Tom Brokaw interviewed drug czar William  Bennett, who, perhaps to justify our invasion of tiny Panama, attempted to  downplay Mexico's role regarding drugs.  </P> <P> Then, he offered the incredible argument that drug lords operate abundantly in  Mexico because the Bush Administration has been so successful in chasing them  out of Miami and elsewhere. His attempt to obscure Reagan/Bush's collaboration  with a government reportedly involved in the drug trade went unchallenged by  Brokaw.  </P> <P> STEVEN ZAK, North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source has stated the following: Acting  treacherously and cowardly, the gang of apostasy and secession  in the Socialist Party leadership yesterday evening perpetrated  a new heinous crime against the innocent citizens and civilians  in Sanaa and other cities. At 2040 [1740 GMT], the spiteful,  secessionist gang fired a missile at a densely-populated  residential area in Sanaa, inflicting large losses on the  citizens and their houses and property. These losses have not  yet been counted.    This cowardly and treacherous action reveals the black,  hidden grudge this criminal gang harbors against the sons of our  people, who, along with the heroes of our brave Armed Forces,  the forces of unity and legitimacy, are valiantly and firmly  confronting and foiling their criminal secessionist scheme  against the homeland and its unity and democratic march. The  source stressed that the cowardly criminals will not escape  punishment and both the people and the Armed Forces will inflict  just punishment on them.</p>

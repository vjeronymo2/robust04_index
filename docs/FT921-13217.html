			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sasol plans R1bn rights SASOL, the large South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer, has announced it will be raising about R1bn (Dollars 360m) through a rights issue. Mr Paul Kruger, managing director, said the funds would be used to 'meet cash-flow requirements in an environment of lucrative expansion possibilities within the self-imposed borrowing constraint'. Sasol has decided that the ratio of interest bearing debt to equity - 45 per cent at the end of the last financial year - should not be allowed to exceed 50 per cent. The funds will be raised through the issue of unsecured automatically convertible subordinated debentures.</p>

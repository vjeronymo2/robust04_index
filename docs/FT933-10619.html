			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bid talks give fillip to Spring Ram shares Shares in Spring Ram rose 15p to 69p yesterday after it confirmed that talks had taken place with several parties 'which may or may not lead to an offer' for the bathrooms and kitchens group. The Yorkshire-based company named one of the parties, Masco Corporation, a large US building products group, but said the approaches were of a preliminary nature, and it was unlikely that any decision would be made for some time. Mr Roger Regan, who last week took over as chairman of Spring Ram, said he was concentrating on the company's interim results announcement on September 22.</p>

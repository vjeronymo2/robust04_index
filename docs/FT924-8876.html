			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: London's heritage in danger - Architecture In all the rumpus about English Heritage engendered by its chairman Mr Jocelyn Stevens's recent pronouncements about it's future, there is a whole area that seems to deserve much closer attention, analysis and comment. That area is London. London's heritage of historic buildings is now supervised by English Heritage. English Heritage was set up by Mr Michael Heseltine in 1984 as a quango divorced from its natural home in the Department of the Environment. In the world of conservation and the heritage, as in so many other areas, the nation now suffers greatly from the impulsiveness of Mr Michael Heseltine. He has never been a minister to think very thoroughly about the consequences of his impulses. English Heritage, with its logo and management teams, may have looked good, but it has never functioned well because of its hybrid status: neither independent nor government; responsible to two ministers - Environment and National Heritage; and run by civil servants struggling to be 'independent.' London's heritage had, until 1986, been increasingly well looked after by the Historic Buildings Division of the Greater London Council. When the GLC was abolished by the Conservative government under Mrs Thatcher, this division found itself transported to the confused realm of English Heritage. The abolition of the GLC left London as probably the only capital city in the world with no form of metropolitan government. Mercifully the one anomaly was in the area of historic buildings, where London continued to receive special treatment by the transfer of the GLC's powers to English Heritage. From 1986 English Heritage has had the residual local authority powers to 'direct' the decisions of the London Boroughs in relation to listed building consent applications; in other parts of the country English Heritage only advise. In London English Heritage is concerned with applications for all listed buildings; elsewhere English Heritage only deals with the top two grades of listed buildings. This may seem technical and irrelevant, but what it means is that London's historic buildings and conservation areas receive the best possible protection and 'heritage advice.' But in the recently issued 'Background paper 5' that accompanied the strategy document 'Managing England's Heritage - Setting Our Priorities for the 1990s', English Heritage announces that it intends to 'withdraw from what are essentially local authorities' responsibilities, in relation to Grade II buildings' - which in effect means the end of any special status for London, and the end of the once superb London Division. How curious that Mr Stevens, who has publicly stated that all his officials' proposed changes are about 'raising our standards not dropping them', should deliver the fate of the majority of London's listed buildings into the hands of the London Boroughs who will be reluctant to find funds to protect them adequately. It would be agreeable to think that back in 1986 the reason the GLC's Historic Buildings Division was moved lock, stock and barrel to English Heritage was because it was so good at its job. No one could possibly doubt the quality of the staff and their work. The London Division should be the exemplar for the rest of the country. Instead it is to be broken up to meet the wishes of bureaucratic levellers who dislike exceptions to the rule. In the recent report of the National Audit Office on English Heritage, while the organisation as a whole was criticised for inefficiency and lethargy, the London Division was said to be doing its job too well - and was criticised for the quality of its work being too high] Of course, it has to be abolished . . . Mr Stevens is a man who wants quick results. He has not thought through the question of London's heritage. Only a few of the London boroughs have effective conservation officers and there is little likelihood of any more government funds. Why is it that what was accepted for London in parliament by the minister at the time in 1985, Mr Kenneth Baker, is suddenly seen as too good to be workable. The advantages of the London Division of English Heritage are clear - the chief one being its independence. How can any London Borough, when its own interests are at stake, act independently when it comes to the demolition of listed buildings? Mr Stevens will no doubt point to other areas of the country, but the pressures on the capital are different and need special treatment. London's historic areas are endangered by another Government measure which was debated in Parliament last week. The leasehold reforms proposed in the Housing and Urban Development Bill, are, if they are carried through, bound to have very mixed consequences for London's architectural heritage. Much of central London still belongs to the great estates that developed their London properties in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the most beautiful and well maintained squares and crescents are managed by the estates to a remarkably high standard. Bedford, Grosvenor, Cadogan, Thurloe, Howard de Walden, Portman - an historic litany of names that have created the character of many of the best parts of the capital. No landlord is perfect but it is hard to see any hint of intelligent alternative management proposals in the current legislation. Compare Belgravia with Pimlico and the environmental differences are striking. Look at the parts of the Portman estate that are retained in Marylebone and compare them with the condition of the streets to the north that were sold after the war. Covenants seldom work effectively and neighbourhood associations depend on volunteers or committees that seldom agree. It has been said that Paris and Edinburgh show that cities can retain architectural quality without a leasehold system. But in both those cities there is a great deal of rented accommodation at the centre and the buildings are simple maintained by landlords who own the buildings. London's great estates are unique and valuable and have retained mixed residential communities in the city centre. A freehold free for all is not the solution. A fairer leasehold system perhaps with real safeguards for architectural management and conservation is what is needed. The present Bill, if passed in its present form, looks as though it will sweep away the good landlords with the bad and, like the English Heritage proposals, weaken the protection afforded to the delicate architectural fabric of the capital.</p>

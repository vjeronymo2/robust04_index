			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINT COVERAGE FAILED, BUT RADIO WENT DISTANCE  </P> <P> Jim Babbitt of Manhattan Beach writes (March 11) to complain, "all that  marathon coverage and not one word about wheelchairs."  </P> <P> While he may be unhappy with print coverage, he should know that during the  course of six hours of coverage, KNX Newsradio provided: a live interview with  the defending wheelchair division champion; live coverage of the start of the  wheelchair race, coverage of the winner crossing the line, and minutes later, a  live interview with the winner.  </P> <P> To paraphrase Mr. Babbitt, "All that critiquing and not one word about radio."  </P> <P> ROGER NADEL,  </P> <P> KNX Executive New Producer, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BANKS SELL DOLLARS AGAIN; RATES FALL  </P> <P> Leading central banks intervened to sell dollars for the third consecutive day  today in a concerted drive to push the U.S. currency lower.  </P> <P> The dollar responded by dipping to 1.8815 West German marks and 140.55 Japanese  yen, and currency dealers said speculation over interest rate rises soon in  West Germany and Japan was helping the central banks in their campaign.  </P> <P> The central banks "smashed the market successfully," said Walter Simon, a  trader for Bank Julius Baer in New York. "The central banks want to regain  respect. . . . It seems to be working," he said.  </P></p>

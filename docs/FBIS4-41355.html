			<p>BFN     [Text] Of all of Ukraine's presidential candidates Leonid  Kravchuk continues to receive the best rating, which has  remained unchanged over the past week. Thirty percent of voters  in 24 regions of Ukraine and in Crimea intend to vote for him.    An opinion poll by Kiev's International Sociology Institute  and the Sociology Chair of the Kievo-Mogilyanskaya Akademiya  University has found Kravchuk has 1 percent more support than in  the previous poll of 6-10 June.    Leonid Kuchma lost 1 percent of the votes since that time --  he still has the support of 22 percent of the electorate.    Eleven percent intend to vote for A. Moroz (against 9  percent  in the previous poll). The electorate's support for the other  candidates is distributed as follows: V. Lanovoi -- 8 percent  (earlier 6 percent), I. Plushch -- 3 percent (earlier 4  percent), V. Babich -- 1.2 percent (earlier 1 percent), and P.  Talanchuk -- 0.5 percent (earlier 1 percent).    Ten percent of those polled are against all candidates and  15  percent are undecided yet.</p>

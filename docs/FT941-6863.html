			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Shrinkage in the textile industry The European clothing and textile sector still employs nearly 3m people in high-cost Europe, testimony to the fact that wage costs are not decisive in determining competitiveness, writes David Goodhart. True, some employment has been protected by the Multi Fibre Arrangement quota system - and the phasing out of the agreement under the GATT agreement will accentuate job shedding. Estimates of the employment level by the year 2000 range from 1.5m to 700,000, with most jobs lost in low-wage countries, such as Portugal. But many companies will keep some employment in Europe by developing production systems to fit retailers' needs or moving up-market. One is the German-based Steilmann Gruppe, which employs about 5,200 people in Europe, 60 per cent of them production workers. That figure will fall as more work is exported to eastern Europe, but Mr Klaus Steilmann, the owner, believes employment in Germany will hold up as more people are hired for management and related functions. The company now indirectly employs about 25,000 people in the far east and eastern Europe. That is partly because of laxer environmental regulations and lower labour costs: women in Ukraine working for Steilmann partners earn less than one sixtieth of the pay of women working in German plants. Mr Steilmann's big competitiveness headache is currency instability. He believes Europe will retain strong advantages at the fashion and 'high-tech' end of the market.</p>

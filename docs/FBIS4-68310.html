			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Gennadiy Zaytsev, Alpha </F> antiterrorist unit chief, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent  Vladimir Berezko; place and date not given; under the rubric  "Combating Terrorism": "Major General Gennadiy Zaytsev: Alpha Is  Manned Only by Intellectuals"]    [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file:    Gennadiy Nikolayevich Zaytsev, born 1934. Graduated from the  USSR KGB Higher School. From 1977 to 1988, and 1992 to the  present--chief of the special group "A" [Alpha]. For courage and  bravery in neutralizing especially dangerous criminals, awarded  the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Major general.    Married. Son is a captain in the Federal Counterintelligence  Service.    [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, this is a special year for  Alpha--it will celebrate its first "adult" jubilee. How did it  all start back then, 20 years ago?    [Zaytsev] In the early 1970's terrorism in its most  dangerous  forms--hostage-taking, aircraft hijacking--began to occur in our  country, too. For instance, in 1973 at Vnukovo Airport four  armed criminals seized a Yak-40 aircraft with passengers on  board. KGB and MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel in a  combined effort freed the hostages and neutralized the  criminals. Despite a successful final outcome, the operation was  tense because nobody had any special training in localizing such  situations.    Taking this and other circumstances into account, a decision  was made to set up within the KGB system a special antiterrorist  unit. By the way, a little later an analogous unit was also set  up in the GDR, also called "A."    ...At the time the unit had no more than 30 members. Within  two months the unit was completely manned and training began.  The first chief of the special unit was Hero of the Soviet Union  Major Vitaliy Bubenin, who was the commander of this group until  April 1977.    [Berezko] How many years did it take before the first  operation? And how many of them has the unit conducted  altogether?    [Zaytsev] It is my deep conviction, based on practical  experience, that at least five years of intensive training is  needed for the unit to exist not merely on paper but to get its  personnel to the point of being able to act professionally and  competently in any situation. Over this period people must  become not just professionals in antiterrorism but also "adjust"  psychologically.    The group conducted its first combat operation on 28 March  1979 at the U.S. Embassy. What happened is that the embassy's  second secretary Pringle met and brought into the embassy's  consular section a stranger, who then threatened to activate an  explosive device if the Americans did not take him in a  diplomatic car to Sheremetyevo airport and arrange for him to  fly abroad. And although overall the operation was  successful--the terrorist, Yuriy Vlasenko, was neutralized and  there were no casualties--I must say that even then not  everything went smoothly...    Altogether, the group has conducted several dozen  operations.    [Berezko] Which one is the most memorable for you?    [Zaytsev] The one I remember most was the operation in  Mineralnyye Vody in 1988, since the lives and well-being of  children were at stake. As you may recall, Yakshiyants' gang  took 31 schoolchildren and a teacher hostage. This was already  the second such instance in our practice. The first time,  children were taken hostage in December 1981 in the city of  Sarapula in the Udmurt ASSR [Autonomous Soviet Socialist  Republic]. In that case, however, the hostages were  tenth-graders, while in Mineralnyye Vody the children were 10-12  years old.    All through the night and the first half of the day I had to  conduct intensive negotiations with the bandits over the radio,  trying to reduce their aggressiveness and in the end get them to  release the hostages. After the negotiations, only the Il-76  crew remained in the hands of the bandits...    I want to take this opportunity to mention the exceptional  bravery and courage of military helicopter pilots Colonel  Valentin Padalkin and Major Vladimir Stepanov, and the Air Force  commander in chief, Lieutenant General (Aviation) Vladimir  Mikhaylov, who just recently helped to free children taken  hostage in Rostov.    [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, as I gather, a certain  "diplomacy" in bulletproof vests is practically inevitable in  combat operation, is it not so?    [Zaytsev] The main purpose of such "diplomacy" is to reduce  terrorists' aggressiveness, to avert violence against hostages.  There are special tactics for conducting such negotiations, and  the operative who "converses" with the criminals must possess  extensive operational and life experience, "feel" the criminal,  and be a psychologist to a certain extent, in order to "massage"  the situation into the overall design.    [Berezko] But the special unit does not always limit itself  to persuasion...    [Zaytsev] We have a very broad and quite effective range of  means that allow us to take control of the situation. For  instance, special grenades. There are also special weapons that  have been designed to our specifications and are used only by  the special unit. Frankly, however, I would prefer not to be too  open in these matters. The point is that when we talk about  this, we unwittingly arm potential terrorists with information  that can be used against us. By the way, at the time Yakshiyants  said straight out that before taking the hostages they had  studied attentively all the literature on special unit  operations in our country and abroad and even reviewed all  available documentary footage.    [Berezko] Is there division by combat specialization within  the group?    [Zaytsev] Each member of the special unit must be completely  proficient in using standard-issue weapons: the Makarov handgun  and submachine gun... There also is specialization: snipers,  combat swimmers, explosives experts who can remove any obstacle  with a jeweler's precision, radio specialists, and many others.    For instance, combat swimmers were utilized in 1978 in Cuba  during the World Youth and Students festival. The Cubans  officially requested help in protecting the ships Gruziya and  Leonid Sobinov, where the Soviet delegation lived. Our personnel  went on "underwater duty" together with members of the Navy's  special team. Combat swimmers also are used in the protection of  highest officials.    [Berezko] How do you "forge" the operatives' skills?    [Zaytsev] Through training, which is conducted daily. All  the  methodology we use is our own, but we also take into account the  useful experience of others.    "Our" hand-to-hand combat includes the most effective  elements of all known one-on-one combat and pursues one single  goal--to enable the operative to fight an armed criminal in a  situation of limited space. The methodology of marksmanship  training also has been made to "fit" the unit's tasks. Our  operatives go through mandatory training in tanks and paratroop  training. In the final analysis, the entire program of  professional training is aimed at developing in the operative  the preparedness to take mortal risks for the sake of saving  other people's lives.    Once every quarter the group undergoes testing by a  specially  developed system, which provides an objective picture of the  operative's abilities.    [Berezko] Have there been instances of people failing the  tests?    [Zaytsev] If a group member demonstrates a substantially  lower performance level, especially in tactical and special  disciplines, and does not draw the appropriate conclusion,  dismissal is inevitable. But I want to emphasize that this is an  extremely rare case. The main principle of combat training in  the unit is "self-education," in which the operative on his own  keeps himself in the shape needed to carry out the tasks.    [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, it is impossible to foresee  where and when the next hostage situation may occur. Is this  circumstance taken into account in training?    [Zaytsev] We try to "play out" during training all possible  hostage scenarios: in an aircraft, building, bus, open space,  and so on. As to unexpectedness, we are in constant readiness  for it. Each of our operatives has a personal call  receiver--multitone--through which he can be reached. The time  frame between receiving the call and the point where the  operatives are fully equipped and on the way to the airport is  no more than 1.5-two hours. One unit in the group is constantly  on combat-ready duty, which in almost 20 years has never been  suspended even for a minute.    [Berezko] The selection criteria for Alpha must be very  tough.    [Zaytsev] Yes, the selection process is indeed strict. Only  a  military serviceman fit to serve in the Airborne Troops, between  25 and 28 years old--an adult mind with the strength of  youth--may be accepted into the antiterrorist unit. Our main  "suppliers" are the Ryazan Higher Paratroop Command School, the  Moscow Higher General Troops Command School, and two Border  Troops military institutes.    First a candidate is checked with respect to physical  fitness. Handgun marksmanship is a mandatory test. In some  aspects, the requirements for the candidate exceed the norms of  category III in sports, and in marksmanship--category II. At the  same time, I want to say that it is much more preferable for the  unit to have a candidate with a range of category II  achievements in different sports than a distinguished master of  sports in, for instance, classic wrestling.    And the most important part. More than 70 percent of our  people have a higher education. A special unit operative should  be not a mere fighting machine, but an intellectual capable of  independent thinking, forecasting, and making decisions on the  basis of analysis. The candidate's intellectual abilities are  tested through in-depth study of his personality, tests,  meetings, and conversations with the mandatory participation of  a psychologist. If a candidate has a quarrelsome personality,  there is no place for him in the unit. Each operative must be  100-percent confident in his colleagues. More than his own life  will depend on it.    [Berezko] You said that the maximum age for serving in the  special unit is 40. By civilian standards, these are young  people...    [Zaytsev] Our former members get offers to work for various  state and commercial structures. In addition, the Association of  Antiterrorist Unit Veterans has been set up and is functioning;  it is headed by Sergey Goncharov, who is a now a member of the  Moscow City Duma. The association's main task is to help the  operative find his place in society after discharge.    [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, unlike our economy,  terrorism is currently on the rise. How do you see the prospects  of combating this "plague of the twentieth century"?    [Zaytsev] These days we can only fight runaway terrorism if  the state sets up a well-designed system for combating this  evil, with the command of antiterrorist activities being  concentrated in a single National Center. Also, we have to  remember that terrorism does not recognize borders and we need  to set up coordination and interaction with foreign special  services, including those in the near abroad.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A commission of Chilean experts will travel to  Belgium this week to participate in negotiations for the  possible purchase of Mirage bar's (Mirsip) [Mirage Safety  Improvement Program]. This information was released by Under  Secretary of Aviation Mario Fernandez after attending an  academic briefing on the subject held at the Political Science  Institute of the University of Chile.    [Begin Fernandez recording] As far as I know, a commission  will be traveling within the next few days. It is part of the  decisionmaking process. I responsibly said here -- just as  ex-Defense Minister Patricio Rojas put it before leaving his  post -- that substantial progress has been made toward making a  decision on the Belgian Mirages. This does not mean a final  decision has already been made. Several steps are still to be  taken, and they are the steps that the Air Force and the Defense  Ministry are responsibly taking. [end recording]    Mario Fernandez added that the purchase of these planes was  announced at the end of the previous administration by then  Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, and that this was a gesture of  political responsibility.    [Begin Fernandez recording, in progress] ...because the  entire process of the examination of various alternatives for  replacement of the Hunters, which the Chilean Air Force has  implemented, to some extent reached a conclusion during the  previous administration.    Upon conclusion of the process, it is obvious that the  government had to make a decision to support this technical  decision. Before leaving his post, ex-Minister Rojas made the  decision and announced it. In this regard I believe that the  proper conclusion of all the proposals or initiatives of an  administration is a gesture of political responsibility. [end  recording]    If the deal is finally made, the Belgian planes will replace  the obsolete Hawker Hunters which the Air Force has used since  the end of the 1960's. Experts have noted the importance of the  possible purchase of the Mirages, which will give our Air Force  top offensive power in this part of the world.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MOTHER TO GET PASSPORT BACK SO SHE CAN FIGHT N.Z. CUSTODY SUIT  </P> <P> Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, involved in an international custody battle over her  daughter Hilary, can have her passport back so she can go to New Zealand to  fight a lawsuit filed by her former husband, a judge ruled today.  </P> <P> However, the passport is in the possession of the city's Court of Appeals and  Judge Herbert Dixon of District of Columbia Superior Court said he could not  order that court to return the document.  </P> <P> Officials at the appeals court said they expect motions on the case later  today.  </P> <P> Elaine Mittleman, an attorney for Dr. Eric Foretich, Morgan's former husband  and Hilary's father, said she will oppose release of the passport.  </P> <P> Dixon said he was satisfied that the return of the passport was "in the best  interests" of 7-year-old Hilary. The girl, who has been living with her  maternal grandparents in Christchurch, New Zealand, was the subject of a 2  1/2-year search by her father. Her whereabouts became known Friday.  </P></p>

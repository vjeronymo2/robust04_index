			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems split over Maastricht strategy A DIVISION among Liberal Democrat MPs last night over tactics for Thursday's Maastricht debate offered the government a possible lifeline in its efforts to avoid a defeat at the hands of Euro-sceptic Tories. Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal Democrats' Europe spokesman, suggested his party's MPs might vote with the government to save the Maastricht treaty if Labour failed in its attempt to force Britain to accept the social chapter. A final decision by the 21 Liberal Democrat MPs will not be taken before tomorrow or possibly pending fresh legal advice on the implications of defeating the government. Sir Russell said, however: 'If the Labour amendment is defeated I think that the likelihood is that we will vote with the government - but it's not 100 per cent.' His comments were at odds with aides to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who said the party would vote against the government on both of Thursday's votes: the first on Labour's amendment backing the social chapter and the second on the government motion noting its opposition to the social chapter. The importance of the apparent rift is that Liberal Democrat support for the government on the second vote would force Tory Euro-sceptic MPs to concentrate on the first vote if they want to inflict a defeat on the government. They would have to vote for the social chapter rather than just against the government. The clash came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, again urged Unionist MPs to back the government, saying the province needed the social chapter 'like a hole in the head'. He is expected to meet Unionists on Thursday and appeared unwilling to rule out attempting to strike a deal. The three Democratic Unionist party MPs led by the Rev Ian Paisley announced they would vote against the government - except possibly if the government made a complete U-turn and abandoned the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But the nine Ulster Unionist MPs will not decide how to vote until Thursday. They have not agreed tactics and although some want to back the Tory Euro-sceptics, others want to use the chance to force government concessions on Northern Ireland policy. Liberal Democrats want to put maximum pressure on the government to reverse Britain's social chapter opt-out but also do not want to wreck the treaty. Thus the party would be in a quandary if Labour's amendment were defeated. To then vote against the unamended government motion could mean no resolution being passed - possibly preventing ratification. Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday saying Liberal Democrats 'would use our votes in whatever way we felt would give Britain the best chance of being inside the social chapter'. He said that was the only way that Britain would be able to influence the development of the European social and employment policies.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Recession fears put pressure on pound STERLING came under selling pressure early yesterday as investors took profits in case the currency should succumb to the strong dollar and domestic worries. A big sell order from the Middle East and growing concern that the UK recession is lengthening conspired to push the pound briefly from third to ninth place in the European exchange rate mechanism grid. Up to yesterday, the pound had been resilient in the face of the dollar's surge on the foreign exchanges. The pronounced weakness of the D-Mark enabled sterling to hold its position in the ERM. In the latest session in London, however, the pound was driven to a low of DM2.9488 - against its previous close of DM2.9725 - before finishing 1.25 pfennigs off on the day at DM2.96, back in its place as third strongest currency in the ERM. It closed almost unchanged against the dollar at Dollars 1.694. Later in New York, it closed at Dollars 1.691 and DM2.9575. Rumours that the Bank of England had stepped in to support the pound were treated with scepticism by traders. Mr Paul Chertkow, currency strategist at Citibank, the US bank, said the pound had mainly suffered as a result of technical profit-taking yesterday. But growing evidence that the UK economic recovery would not come as soon or be as strong as forecast also undermined the pound. This week's claim by the director general of the Confederation of British Industry that some parts of UK manufacturing were in 'slump' came after the government had announced record rises in unemployment and large falls in industrial output. The news prompted renewed calls for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. However, the government has said there must be a 'pause' in its efforts to lower borrowing costs to allow sterling to settle down after the bank base rate had been cut to 12 per cent from 14 per cent in mid-February. A political risk has also attached to sterling ahead of the May 2 local elections. Should the Conservative Party do badly, traders expect sterling to fall below its DM2.95 central ERM rate.

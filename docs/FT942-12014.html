			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Twenty years of Capricorn - Concerts The Capricorn ensemble has celebrated the end of its second decade with three concerts in the Purcell Room and in St. Giles, Cripplegate, pardonably recalling some of its most successful commissions. This excellent team has been assiduous in seeking out new, seriously original music, placing fresh commissions in promising hands, and meanwhile cultivating older styles well enough to fill historical gaps in the CD repertoire with distinction and profit. In short, it is a Good Thing with a solid track-record, though the live audiences last week were keen but small. The label 'Capricorn' names a fluid personnel. Some of the performers we heard on Tuesday and Saturday were too young to have been in at the start. For its adventurous repertoire, anyhow, Capricorn has to field such variously constituted little bands that it has only a few 'core' members to fix its identity. Perhaps the longest-serving souls, and certainly the dominant musicians, are the clarinet, cello and piano (Anthony Lamb, Timothy Mason, Catherine Edwards) - three-quarters of what Messiaen required for his Quatuor pour la fin du temps, which prompted the formation of Capricorn in the first place. Among the Capricorn commissions here, going back to 1985, were Edison Denisov's winds-and-strings Sextet, coolly and intricately contrapuntal in strictly equal voices, none standing out; and James Ellis's quizzical, picturesque Mountain Steps, of which we heard just three-fifths - it has been 'fundamentally recomposed' but not finished yet. For The Nervous Saurian, inspired by a Danish science-fiction novel about wise lizards, Anders Nordentoft made imaginative use of the same trio - the 'core' players  -as Nigel Osborne's new Sarajevo, a heartfelt letter of condolence which sticks to time-honoured modes of registering grave feeling. Neither of those had the kick of Gerald Barry's rumbustious Piano Quartet, which Capricorn premiered in 1992. 'Wholly concerned with melody,' Barry claims; in fact it is a furious confection of slightly out-of-synch folk music echoes, presumably Irish, insistently lively, with a forceful surge. By comparison, Birtwistle's Clarinet Quintet sounded scrupulously worked out but staid. Magnus Lindberg's recent Quintet charged the same ensemble with continuous palpable energy, brilliantly engineered and calculated as is his wont. The unabashed star is the clarinet, manically fluent in generating fresh ideas, leaving the strings to pick up the pieces and reassemble them elegantly. Each Capricorn concert set itself a high standard by starting with one of Elliott Carter's recent hommages to friends and colleagues. I heard the 1984 Riconoscenza for violin (Rebecca Hirsch) and the 1990 Con leggerezza pensosa for the 'core' trio here, and marvelled again at the lucid density Carter achieves for every passing event. Within a few minutes we get a whole, cogent epic, each laconic episode stamped with speaking character such as only a past-master can contrive.</p>

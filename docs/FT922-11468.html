			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Headington pensions suspended PENSION payments to 240 former employees of Mr Robert Maxwell's Headington Holdings due to be sent next week, were yesterday suspended by the pension fund trustees because all funds may have already been spent. Mr Geoffrey Booth of Headington's current trustees, Clay and Partners, said that last week liquidators for the common fund manager of all the Maxwell company pension funds had determined that Headington might have already paid pensioners up to Pounds 655,000 more than the scheme's assets. Last week Robson Rhodes, the liquidators, wrote to trustees of all the Maxwell schemes detailing their share of the so-called Common Investment Fund. Headington, which had all its funds in the CIF, may owe the fund money or may have assets of up to Pounds 1.2m. Its liabilities are Pounds 2.5m. Because of Headington's potential debts, Robson Rhodes has refused to release any more funds to pay pensioners. Meanwhile, solicitors for another Maxwell pension fund, MCP Trustees, said its members would also have their payments suspended in June, unless the Court ordered Robson Rhodes to free assets. It also might owe the CIF money and Robson Rhodes has said it could not release any more funds. Mirror Group Newspapers, which once employed the pensioners involved, will contribute to the pension fund until the end of June to cover payments.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Touche Ross plays down Treasury ban on employees TOUCHE ROSS, one of the 'big six' accountancy firms, yesterday played down the impact of government advice blacklisting some of its senior employees from working on contracts obtained from the public sector. The Treasury is understood to have circulated the advice in letters to senior civil servants earlier this year, after its decision in November 1992 to sue the firm over its audit of Barlow Clowes, the fund management company closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988. Among the 13 employees affected by the letters are Mr John Connolly, the managing partner of the firm's London office. Five of Touche's 370 partners are affected. All are either tax or audit specialists. Many worked on audits of James Ferguson, the financial company which acquired Barlow Clowes in 1987. Touche Ross yesterday said it hoped to continue to build up its public sector practice. 'We are proud to be a major supplier of consulting and other advisory services to government. We have every expectation that we will continue to be selected on our merits to serve a wide variety of government departments,' said Mr John Roques, senior partner. The firm earned Pounds 58.3m from its consultancy services in the last financial year, with possibly more than half generated from public sector contracts. Among the firm's existing government contracts is work for the BBC reviewing the licence fee. Partners at other firms, however, believe that Touche's business could be adversely affected. The 'big six' earn possibly as much as Pounds 60m a year from public sector audit work, mainly for local and health authorities. Work on privatisation and consultancy more generally brings in at least Pounds 200m a year. Professionals point to the experience of Arthur Andersen, another of the 'big six', which was the subject of a similar 'health warning' nearly a decade ago. Andersen was auditor of the collapsed De Lorean car company and is being sued by the government for alleged negligence. Andersen has a vibrant consultancy practice, but has received no public sector audit work in recent years. Touche Ross has claimed it alerted the authorities to the fraud at Barlow Clowes and has acted professionally. It said last November that the major responsibility lay with the DTI. Mr Alistair Darling, city spokesman for the Labour party, said he would raise the issue in the House of Commons next week.</p>

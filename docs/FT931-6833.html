			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Another 3,900 US aircraft jobs to go GE Aircraft Engines, an arm of the General Electric Company and a major supplier to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers, said yesterday it was cutting its workforce by more than 10 per cent. The move, another symptom of the poor health of the US aircraft industry, follows heavy job cuts by Boeing last week. GE Aircraft, which sells engines for air, marine, and industrial use, said it would cut 3,900 from its workforce of 33,000. The cuts are planned across operations, with about 2,500 at its headquarters in Evendale, Ohio; 700 at its plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, and 700 at smaller facilities around the US. In addition to an airline slump, GE Aircraft is also feeling the effects of recent US military budget cuts. 'Our commercial customers have suffered unprecedented losses in the last three years, and engine and spare parts orders are down,' said Mr Brian Rowe, president. 'Those difficulties and continually changing customer needs require these cost actions,' he said. The company said the reductions would be made as much as possible through attrition and voluntary job elimination programmes. GE Aircraft Engines had revenues of Dollars 7.368bn (Pounds 5.18bn) in 1992, compared with General Electric's overall sales of Dollars 62.2bn. A General Electric spokesman said GE Aircraft had operating earnings of Dollars 7.7m in 1992.</p>

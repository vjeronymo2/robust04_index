			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sun Micro turns in 80% surge for quarter Sun Microsystems, the US market leader in computer workstations, reported an 80 per cent rise in second-quarter net income. The company made Dollars 43.8m, or 46 cents a share, up from Dollars 24.1m, or 23 cents, a year before, on revenues up 8 per cent at Dollars 1.13bn. The earnings were broadly in line with market expectations. Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer, said: 'Sun's successful new product offerings and the resulting strength in the high-end product mix, as well as our continued focus on cost management, helped increase gross margins from last year's level.' Bookings had grown to a new record. For the six months, net income jumped to Dollars 60.4m, or 62 cents a share, up from Dollars 28.9m, or 28 cents, on revenues 10 per cent higher at Dollars 2.09bn. The California-based company also announced Mr Melia was to step down as chief financial officer and move to the east coast of the US for 'personal reasons'. He will be replaced by Mr Michael Lehman, corporate controller.</p>

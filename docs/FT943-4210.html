			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany seeks modification of EU agricultural policy reforms The German government is pushing for changes to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms to make them more acceptable to farmers and reduce administrative costs. A German memorandum, circulated to other EU member states, insists the proposed changes do not question 'the principles and aims' of the 1992 reforms. But it says experience of the first full year of the reforms shows many rules need to be simplified. It argues that the reforms do not take enough account of the principle of subsidiarity - that decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate tier of government. Among the proposed measures, it says cereal farmers with plots in different regions should be able to set aside 15 per cent of their arable land in one area rather than having to do so on each plot. Many farmers in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate have had compensation payments cut because they did not obey the set-aside rule on small areas of land, which 'makes them impossibley difficult to farm.' The memorandum calls on the Commission to allow cereal farmers to submit applications for aid up to the middle of May rather than by March 31 each year to allow them more time to decide what crops to grow. In the livestock sector, the Germans want removal of the rule limiting support payments to 90 male beef cattle per holding because it 'makes it difficult for efficient holdings with growth prospects to accept CAP reform.' Germany, which holds the EU presidency, hopes the Commission will adopt some of its demands as proposals for agriculture ministers to vote on. Pressure on the Commission may increase if other member states put forward similar proposals. The British government has responded with its own memorandum, which renews its call for arable land to be eligible for set-aside payments if it is taken out of production for woodland or other environmental schemes.</p>

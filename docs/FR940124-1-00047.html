			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section602.15&blank;Requests for Reconsideration of the Secretary's Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide in regulation the procedures to be followed by an accrediting agency for the appeal of the Secretary's decision regarding its application for recognition. Accordingly, in &sect;602.15 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary permits an agency to request reconsideration of a final decision of the Secretary regarding either the agency's application for recognition or the limitation, suspension, or termination of the agency's recognition. However, &sect;602.15(a)(2) proposes that a request for reconsideration may be made only under limited conditions. Under these limited conditions, the agency may request reconsideration only if it demonstrates that it has new information that could not have been presented previously and that the information is likely to result in reversal of the Secretary's decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While, as noted by the non-Federal negotiators at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the grounds for reconsideration are narrow, the Secretary believes the narrow grounds are appropriate. Adverse decisions regarding an agency's application for recognition are made by the Advisory Committee and forwarded to the Secretary. Under &sect;602.13, the agency may appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary. Similarly, under &sect;602.14, the agency may appeal an adverse Advisory Committee or subcommittee recommendation to the Secretary under a limitation, suspension or termination proceeding. Therefore, the Secretary believes that reconsideration requests should be narrowly circumscribed. The Secretary notes that non-Federal negotiators requested opportunities for agencies to request reconsideration in cases where the Secretary had not established appeal procedures. Given the provisions for appeal that are now in the proposed regulations, the Secretary requests public comment on whether reconsideration procedures are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary wishes to make clear that any agency that fails to notify the Secretary of its intent to file a written request for reconsideration within the 10-day time frame specified in the regulations forfeits its right to reconsideration. Additionally, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that, in general, any failure to meet a required deadline date in any appeal to the Secretary results in a forfeiture of that appeal right.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While consensus was reached during the negotiated rulemaking sessions that an agency should have 45 days to submit its written request for reconsideration, the Secretary questions whether a shorter period_30 days_is sufficient for the agency to prepare an adequate request, given the fact that 30 days is the usual time frame specified by the Department for other types of appeals to the Secretary. The Secretary requests comments on the shorter period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because requests for reconsideration are restricted to instances where the Secretary's decision involves denial, limitation, suspension, or termination of an agency's recognition, it is anticipated that, due to the extensive material that must be reviewed, the Secretary will require more than 30 days to reach a final decision on an agency's request for reconsideration. Non-Federal negotiators were concerned that there be some time limit imposed to bring the issue to closure. Accordingly, the Secretary is proposing a 60-day time frame for reaching a final decision on an agency's request for reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.16.&blank;Appeals Procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned in &sect;602.15, section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide for the appeal of the Secretary's decision regarding an accrediting agency's application for recognition. In &sect;602.16 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary provides for an appeal to the Federal courts of all final decisions of the Secretary regarding an agency's application for recognition. During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators urged an appeals procedure other than through the courts, as, for example, through an administrative law judge. However, the Secretary believes that there can be no administrative appeal within the Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary, as head of the Department of Education, makes all final decisions on behalf of the Department. It should be noted, however, that in response to the non-Federal negotiators' concerns, the Secretary has modified the proposed recognition procedures to include an opportunity for an agency to appeal an Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary before the Secretary reaches a final decision on the agency's application. The proposed limitation, suspension, and termination procedures also have been modified to provide for an appeal to the Secretary of an Advisory Committee or subcommittee recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Fresh sales effort for British food A NEW drive to boost food exports to Britain's EC partners was announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister of agriculture. She said leading retailers would be co-operating with the government soon after Christmas to highlight the most effective ways of ensuring that goods were displayed in continental supermarkets. Mrs Shephard underlined the importance of securing greater export penetration as well as improving domestic market share when joining with rank and file speakers in questioning the need for the Pounds 6bn deficit in trade in foodstuffs incurred by Britain in 1992. The 'food from Britain' organisation had been given a new remit to expand its work on export promotion. Warning that the home market should not be taken for granted, she said: 'No one has to buy British. The invaders are not just waiting over the channel - they are already there on the supermarket shelves'. Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, had been assigned the catering sector, and Mr Michael Jack, minister of state, would seek to improve the performance of the horticultural industry. Horticulture accounted for the most substantial part of the food trade deficit. Mrs Shephard said Mr Jack had assured her that 'anything the Dutch can do we can do better - since half of all Dutch exports are agricultural, that is quite a target.' She was unable to dispel fears expressed during the debate that the promised reform of land tenure to provide more tenancies for new entrants to farming might be subject to further delay. Mrs Shephard admitted that the effects of the delaying tactics by Tory Euro-sceptics against the Maastricht bill could lead to new landlord and tenant legislation being crowded out of the programme for the parliamentary session due to open later this month. In that event, she said, a new round of pre-legislative consultations, including draft clauses of the proposed bill, would be undertaken with all the interests concerned.</p>

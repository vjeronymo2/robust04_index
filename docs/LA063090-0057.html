			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL PUTS S. AFRICA QUESTION ON BALLOT AS A 'GIFT' TO MANDELA  </P> <P> In a gesture of support for Nelson Mandela, the Los Angeles City Council came  to work early Friday and decided to place before voters a proposal that would  toughen the city's anti-apartheid measures by banning nearly all city contracts  with firms that do business with South Africa.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously for the proposed change at a special 8:30 a.m.  meeting, ordering the city attorney's office to draft a ballot measure that is  expected to go before the voters in November.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for an amendment to the City Charter that would disqualify  companies and individuals from bidding on city contracts if they have business  ties with South Africa.  </P> <P> "This city has always stood for individual freedom and human rights," said  Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who sponsored the proposal with Councilman  Robert Farrell. Flores called the proposal "a gift . . . we can give to Mr.  Mandela to take back with him to the people of South Africa."  </P> <P> An ordinance approved in 1986 imposed a partial South African ban that applied  largely to contracts of $25,000 or less -- about 10% of the contracts granted  by the city. The city awards about $296 million in contracts each year, but  only $27 million worth fall under the current ordinance.  </P> <P> The new proposal, first made last September, languished in a City Council  committee for nine months, but was revived last Monday and quickly sent to the  full council in time for it to be passed just hours before Mandela arrived at  City Hall.  </P> <P> If the voters approve the Charter amendment, it would affect some of the  country's largest businesses, including IBM Corp., General Motors Corp., Xerox  Corp. and General Electric Co., all of which bid on and hold contracts with the  city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Bill Ott, a Los Angeles spokesman for General Motors, said that the company and  its chairman, Roger Smith, have long had a "major commitment" to the use of  economic sanctions against the South African government. He said that GM had no  comment Friday on the action taken by the City Council.  </P> <P> A spokesman for IBM said the company could not comment until it had a chance to  study the language of the proposed charter change.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach spokesmen for the other companies were unsuccessful Friday.  </P> <P> No company representatives spoke against the proposed ballot measure during the  brief council debate.  </P> <P> The four companies have sold off their South African subsidiaries, but all  still have distribution or licensing agreements in South Africa, which would  make them ineligible to bid on contracts under the proposed measure.  </P> <P> Although the vote was unanimous Friday, there was a brief period of controversy  as Councilman Nate Holden complained that too many exemptions had been granted  over the last four years. The 1986 ordinance has been amended twice to cut down  on exemptions, but some are still necessary, city officials said.  </P> <P> The council has approved 13 exemptions since 1986 and city departments have  granted 1,200, according to George Wolfberg, who works in the city  administrative office.  </P> <P> Wolfberg told the council that the most recent exemptions have gone to the  Salvation Army for a homeless project, to two banks that would have been  disqualified under a "technicality" because they had old, outstanding loans to  South African ventures, and to the owners of some property where the Fire  Department needed to place signal relaying equipment.  </P></p>

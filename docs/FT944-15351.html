			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Tory corruption probe stays private Labour MPs yesterday admitted defeat in a campaign to force the Commons privileges committee to hear corruption allegations against two Conservatives in public. The committee's Conservative majority voted to meet in private to hear evidence that Mr Graham Riddick (Colne Valley) and Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 to table Commons questions. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, who was one of the prime movers behind the establishment of the committee, but is not a member, said the decision was 'an outrage'. Labour members of the committee refused to comment on the debate because of parliamentary rules requiring the proceedings of the committee to be kept secret. They appeared deeply unhappy with the decision to sit in private, however. Some are thought to be considering whether to resign from the committee in protest. Labour MPs believe that quitting the committee before it starts its formal investigation would undermine its authority and raise questions about the relevance of its findings. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons and chairman of the committee, said the decision to sit in private was in line with long-standing conventions. He said the committee would publish the evidence when its hearings were concluded, and would decide later whether to consider the wider issues of parliamentary privilege in public. Other Conservative members of the committee refused to comment, but one said privately that the best interests of both MPs - who have strenuously denied any wrongdoing - would be served by hearing evidence in private. He said: 'It should not be held in public because we do not think we could get to the root of the matter, and it would not be beneficial to the two people under investigation. 'There would be all sorts of press comment on the rights and wrongs of it before we came out with our own findings.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 12 April, the Japanese Government decided to  support the idea of concluding a "multilateral accord on banning  the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for military  purposes" (the so-called cut-off pact on military-purpose  nuclear materials) proposed by U.S. President Clinton last  September and to allow countries that are not members of the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to keep military-purpose  nuclear materials such as high-enriched uranium and plutonium  which they already possess if they join the cut-off pact.    Previously the government, while working on non-NPT member  nations such as India, Pakistan, and Israel to join the NPT,  said that it would not allow them to possess military-use  nuclear materials.    However, the government has concluded that the cut-off pact  will serve as "supplement" to the NPT (according to a Foreign  Ministry source) and that in order to strengthen the  international system to check nuclear proliferation, it is  better to conclude the cut-off pact with non-NPT member nations  than asking those nations to abandon nuclear materials which  they currently possess.    This cut-off pact was proposed by President Clinton in his  speech to the United Nations last September.    Outline of the proposal is: 1) a multilateral pact should be  concluded to ban the production of such military-use nuclear  materials as highly enriched uranium and plutonium; 2) the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] should inspect member  nations to check whether nuclear materials are used for military  purposes; and 3) military-use nuclear materials which the member  nations already possess are exempted from the IAEA inspections.    The possible conclusion of the cut-off pact will lead to the  creation of the third nuclear control system composed of  countries which possesses nuclear materials but not armed with  nuclear weapons, in addition to the NPT, in which nuclear  control group is divided into two: one composed of nations which  possess nuclear weapons; the other composed of non-nuclear  nations. Nuclear inspections will also be carried out of the  third group.    The major controversial point of the proposal is that there  is the possibility that nations which are suspected of storing  military-purpose nuclear materials will be allowed to keep those  nuclear materials. However, India recently indicated an  interest in the proposal, and among the non-NPT member nations,  there is a positive move toward concluding the cut-off pact.  Therefore, it is likely that debates on merits and demerits of  the proposal will be brisk on a world-wide scale.</p>

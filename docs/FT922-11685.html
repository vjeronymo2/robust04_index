			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Lex Column: BAe Mr John Cahill's appointment at British Aerospace comes as something of a relief. BAe is a sprawling organisation with a proliferation of plants and shaky financial controls. Mr Cahill, who comes from a company with legendary financial controls and 800 operating units, plainly has much to offer. It is slightly odd that he has no background in the political aspects of the job, which in a curious reversal of roles will be attended to by the chief executive. But if he and the shortly-to-be announced finance director can improve BAe's operating efficiency, that will do to be getting on with. The longer-term shape of the business remains more problematical. Mr Cahill asserts that his first priority is to increase market share in BAe's defence business, which will otherwise carry on dwindling as the peace dividend rises. The motor and property businesses are best left alone until their markets improve, but their place in the portfolio must surely be under review. And while Airbus may be best allowed to come right in its own time, there is a pressing need to deal with the regional aircraft business. It is Mr Cahill's job to disprove the familiar aphorism of Mr Warren Buffet: that when a manager with a high reputation takes on a company with a low one, it is the company's reputation which emerges intact.</p>

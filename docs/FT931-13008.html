			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / China to boost infrastructure CHINA will open up more construction projects to foreign participation as part of its overall drive to build up the infrastructure of the country, according to the official Xinhua news agency, Reuter reports from Beijing. Foreign businessmen, the news agency said, would be allowed to invest solely or jointly with Chinese partners in the construction of motorways, bridges and tunnels and to invest solely in the construction of private docks and waterways for cargo shipping. Sino-foreign co-operation is now encouraged in managing berths on public docks and also in loading, unloading, storage, packaging and leasing docks and land for development. China's inefficient transport system, according to officials and economists, is a serious drag on economic development.</p>

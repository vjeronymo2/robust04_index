			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC MOVES CLOSER TO PLAN TO END GLUT;  </P> <P> ENERGY: KEY MEMBERS OF THE OIL CARTEL REPORT PROGRESS IN STRATEGY TALKS AIMED  AT CURBING PRODUCTION TO BOOST PRICES.  </P> <P> OPEC appears to be edging toward a price and production accord that may begin  to erase a glut that has slashed world oil prices by a third this year.  </P> <P> Key ministers report progress in strategy sessions ahead of a conference of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva on July 25.  </P> <P> They say the goal is a pact to restore average spot prices to OPEC's declared  target of $18 per barrel.  </P> <P> Benchmark prices in Europe are around $14, down from $21 at the start of the  year. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, which normally sells at a  premium, is trading at $16 a barrel, down from around $22 at the beginning of  the year.  </P> <P> "I think we have a better chance now," Indonesian minister Ginandjar  Kartasasmita said after talks in Algiers last week with OPEC President Sadek  Boussena of Algeria and Kuwait's Rasheed Salem al Ameeri.  </P> <P> More preparatory talks, this time among Persian Gulf producers, are scheduled  this week.  </P> <P> The 13-nation cartel's internal crisis arises from the ambitions of three big  gulf producers -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- to sell  more of their oil. Their demands for bigger production quotas have stymied  several recent OPEC conferences.  </P> <P> The gulf trio's quota-busting earlier this year was the chief cause of the glut  in the market.  </P> <P> Although the Saudis, the biggest exporters, cut their excess production under a  stopgap agreement negotiated May 3, Kuwait and the UAE were slow to follow  suit, and prices have stayed weak.  </P> <P> OPEC sources say a compromise that ministers are examining would extend the  stopgap accord to the end of September. After that, the gulf states would get  new, bigger quotas -- provided that in the interim they curb excess output and  prices climb back to $18 per barrel.  </P> <P> Demand usually picks up in the winter, so, in theory, it would be possible to  set a higher ceiling on total OPEC volume and raise individual quotas from  October onward.  </P></p>

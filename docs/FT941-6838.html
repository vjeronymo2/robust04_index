			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Swiss ban not so remarkable Sir, Thank God the Swiss people ignored their government's advice on the trans-Alpine truck referendum. Freight belongs on the rails. Anyone who has struggled up the third lane of the M1, and then driven on the relatively truck-free Swiss roads knows this. It would be more appropriate if the EU adapted to the Swiss. When the French eliminate their nasty peage, the Germans understand the sanity of speed limits, and the Italians introduce 'road manners' into their dictionaries, maybe then they can talk about unity. By putting the trucks on the rails, the Swiss are following the example set by the whitest of white EuroElephants: the Chunnel. Michael B. West, Hameau Villageois, 1266b Duillier, Switzerland</p>

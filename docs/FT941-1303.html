			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest jumps 32% to Pounds 1.8m Abbeycrest, the designer and manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery, yesterday announced pre-tax profits 32 per cent ahead to Pounds 1.78m for the year ended December 31 on turnover which rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 51.9m. At this level the profit is still way below the record of Pounds 6.8m achieved in 1989. The shares closed at 109p, down 6p. Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said that progress was encouraging during the year and despite flat conditions the group had increased its market share, with maintained operating margins. He added that he was cautious about projecting current levels of business forward, but reported that turnover and order books were ahead of 1993 and that he expected further progress in the current year. The chairman said that sales to the catalogue shops and home shopping sector increased significantly. The group now exports to 20 countries, and turnover in overseas markets grew to Pounds 5.1m. Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent from 3.8p to 5.2p while the dividend is maintained at 3.2p with a final of 2p. Year end gearing went up from 7 per cent to 40 per cent. This reflected higher levels of activity in November and December and increased projections for the early part of 1994. The group's year end is to be changed to February and the next accounting period will be for 14 months.</p>

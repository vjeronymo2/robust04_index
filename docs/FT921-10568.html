			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: That was the era that was . . . - Television If you want to know how the world is changing watch the opening edition of TV Heaven on Channel 4 and, in particular, be certain to see not only the actual programmes - the drama which launched Callan, the famous edition of The Frost Programme with Emil Savundra, and so on - but the 'filler' material too. This coming weekend (on the first of 13 Saturday evenings to be devoted to archive material from the 1950s, '60s and '70s) between At Last The 1948 Show and Elsie Tanner's wedding in Coronation Street, there are several contemporary clips, including one of Joan Bakewell whispering winsomely into the microphone while covering some live event for Late Night Line Up in 1967, the year from which all this week's material is selected. Her come-hither glance at the camera is wonderful, but the significant point is that Frank Muir, who is presenting these archive collections, does not say 'There you go, the thinking man's crumpet' even though he was the one who coined that phrase to describe Bakewell in the 1960s. And why does he not quote his own epigram? Presumably because of the way things have changed in 25 years: today the women's lobby, not best known for its sense of humour, would be outraged at a line which, at its birth, was seen as affectionate and admiring. What, after all was it saying? That the woman had looks as well as brains. But one of the most powerful messages to emerge, albeit tacitly, from this opening edition of a series which may prove compelling to a remarkably large number of people, is that in a quarter of a century attitudes towards women have altered out of all recognition. It is perfectly acceptable these days to screen a drama such as The Cloning Of Joanna May, shown by ITV over the past two Sunday evenings in 90-minute slabs, in which the general message is the one we have learned to expect from Fay Weldon: 'Oh God, aren't men disgusting'. There is surely no good reason why she should be prevented from delivering such a message. But anyone on television who tried making generalisations about women - over emotional, frightened of mice, whatever - would be in deep trouble. It is quite okay today for a woman on television to exploit the brains that nature endowed her with, but any attempt to exploit the body, endowed by the same power, will attract howls of execration. Hence the disappearance of beauty contests from television. The contrast with 1967 could hardly be more vivid. Happily John Wyver and Linda Zuck, whose company Illuminations has put this huge package together, have managed to come up with material from At Last The 1948 Show, a series long mourned among the cognoscenti as completely lost, and tragically so since it was such a direct forerunner of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Produced under David Frost it starred John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Tim Brooke-Taylor, and Marty Feldman. Now it seems that five compilation tapes have been discovered in the vaults of Swedish television and, although the picture looks as though it was shot through a flour sack, Saturday's episode proves that this was, indeed, a decidedly seminal show. Not only does it pre-figure Python in its general craziness, there are also particular moments which look astonishingly recognisable: Cleese as a goose-stepping gauleiter, Tim Brooke-Taylor asking 'What are the nurses like then, eh?' (nudge) 'eh?' (nudge, leer, nudge) and Cleese, Chapman and Feldman as three macho policemen in drag, but for the size 13 boots. The contrast with today emerges from the use of women on the show. Aimi MacDonald, wearing a succession of revealing leotards and not much else, flutters her eyelashes while serving as a punctuation mark between sketches. At the end she does a little gag about blackmailing the director into letting her dance and we see her doing some high kicks. Dutiful feminists will close their eyes in pain and declare how much healthier it is to have Victoria Wood or French and Saunders winning kudos as comedians on television today. Those who suspect that really funny women have been welcome in show business since the days of music hall and before, and who cannot see that the pleasure given by the physical nature of Aimi MacDonald's performance is any different from the pleasure given by those hulking great men in the 'Strongest Man' series, and who reckon that it takes all sorts to make a world, may feel that the world has been impoverished by doctrinaire feminism in the past 25 years. Whatever your feelings, these compilations serve as the most powerful mnemonics imaginable, bringing back the period with a vividness which few other cultural phenomena could equal. From the little hippy dance performed by Twiggy at the start to the commercial with Bing Crosby singing 'I'm going well, I'm going Shell', from Patrick McGoohan in that most typical of all 1960s symbols, the Lotus sports car, with the voice-over declaring 'I am not a number I am a free man]' to Vanessa Redgrave posing sexily for Norman Parkinson, it could only possibly come from the mid sixties. Coronation Street still featured Ena Sharples and Minnie Caldwell, not to mention Elsie Tanner's son in a Union Jack waistcoat, and Granada were willing to tolerate major fluffs rather than re-shoot a scene for the sake of one line. Above all there is A Magnum For Schneider, the 'Armchair Theatre' drama which introduced us to Edward Woodward's Callan, who was 'licensed to kill' but in all other respects the deliberate antithesis of James Bond: a sad and bitter loner who fraternised in gloomy pubs with the lowest of the low, notably Russell Hunter's malodorous Lonely, and who contemptuously rejected the values of the establishment which Bond so enthusiastically embraced. To watch this again now is to recognise immediately Callan's antecedents: not only Bond but the loner gumshoes of the Hollywood film noir in the 1940s, and Alfred Burke's scruffy detective Frank Marker in Public Eye which appeared on ITV in 1965. It also makes you realise how ominously dominant the glamorous surface detail has become in today's series - Inspector Morse's Jaguar - and brings out the near total triumph of film in television drama. There are splendid treats to come: an early episode of The Avengers with Honor Blackman; Regan, the pilot for The Sweeney; the opening episode of Do Not Adjust Your Set which starred all the Pythons who were not in At Last The 1948 Show (Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) plus David Jason and The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band; the opening episode of Rumpole (unseen since 1979) and Upstairs Downstairs; and Granada's Woody Allen Show from 1965, all with clips and commercials from the period. It seems a pity that the only linking comment is Frank Muir's comfy line in saloon bar gossip. As a pay-off to the notorious Savundra programme it scarcely seems sufficient to say 'Many people were rightly appalled by this dangerous move towards trial by television, but it did make riveting television'. The most striking fact to emerge is one that has been emphasised in this column since 1972 when it was relinquished by its creator, TC Worsley. His articles from the mid-sixties, bringing such insight to many of the programmes now to be shown in this Channel 4 season, were published in book form under the title Television: The Ephemeral Art and at the time that title seemed a fair description. Today, with video recorders in 80 per cent of British households, a far greater awareness of the importance of television archives, and even budget-conscious producers no longer needing to re-cycle videotape and thus destroy irreplaceable programmes (much of the early Dixon Of Dock Green, Dr Who, and Till Death Us Do Part and most of David Mercer's early plays) television is simply not an ephemeral art any more.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HILLSIDE HOUSES ON POLES;  </P> <P> BUILDING BAN SOUGHT TO PROTECT 'STILT STREET'  </P> <P> A fragile neighborhood of stilt houses in Sherman Oaks that rode out  Wednesday's earthquake received support Friday against a different upheaval:  intense land development around it.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called for a moratorium on  construction of large houses on Oakfield Drive near a world-famous row of  houses that are perched on poles above a steep canyon.  </P> <P> Council members said they will decide next week whether to ask city planners to  slap strict controls on the hilly site, which is visible to thousands of  motorists who travel daily on Beverly Glen Boulevard between the San Fernando  Valley and Westwood.  </P> <P> Residents of the 20 stilt houses and others who consider the eye-catching row a  Los Angeles architectural landmark have sought such protection since a  developer began building large, conventional houses on small, empty Oakfield  Drive lots eight months ago.  </P> <P> They contend that huge homes on 20 leftover lots would overwhelm the  neighborhood and destroy the architectural integrity of the area, known to  outsiders as "Stilt Street."  </P> <P> "I hope this helps save this mountainside," stilt-house owner Virginia Hadfield  said Friday. "I hope the moratorium will do what it sounds like it will do."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky asked that the city prohibit new houses taller than 30 feet and  require side-yard and front-yard setbacks of at least five feet. He also asked  for a ban on new houses that cover more than half of their lots.  </P> <P> Building rules, Yaroslavsky said, "have resulted in the development of homes  out of scale for the hillside community in which they are built."  </P> <P> Michelle Krotinger, an aide to Yaroslavsky, said the moratorium proposal will  undergo four public hearings during the next several months before it comes up  for a final City Council vote. She said a one-year moratorium would give city  planners time to decide if permanent controls are needed to preserve the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The one-of-a-kind neighborhood was designed by architect Richard J. Neutra and  was built in 1965.  </P> <P> Since then the stilt houses have been featured in movies and television shows,  usually as examples of the ultimate in wacky Los Angeles architecture.  </P> <P> But Neutra's pole design is viewed as anything but frivolous by architectural  experts, conservationists and those who live in the 40-by-50-foot, one-level  homes that are suspended 30 feet above a hillside.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimum of Grading  </P> <P> The stilt houses were built with a minimum of grading and designed to blend  into the oak-studded canyon that extends more than a mile south of the Ventura  Freeway, they said.  </P> <P> "They are integrated into the hillside and into nature," stilt-house owner  Steve Sadd said Friday. "This is a geologically unstable area. We're very  pleased with what happened today. We think it will ultimately benefit everybody  by preserving a scenic area."  </P> <P> Sadd said the small lots on the hillside are left over from a 1930s-era  subdivision. A housing tract begun today in the area would have far fewer lots  on the same acreage, he said.  </P> <P> Neighbor Ralph Lewis said he was disappointed that the city did not act sooner  to protect the area. He said vibrations from recent excavation work and  construction trucks have already damaged some of the homes.  </P> <P> "I had just finished patching cracks in my walls caused by the trucks on  Wednesday, the day of the earthquake," Lewis said. "Afterward I checked and  none of the cracks had reopened."  </P> <P> That's proof, Lewis said, that man is a bigger threat to Stilt Street than  Mother Nature.  </P></p>

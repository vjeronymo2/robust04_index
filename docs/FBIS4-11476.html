			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Minister Secretary General of the Presidency  Genaro Arriagada on 16 April said it would be unfortunate for  the country if a climate of inflexibility and confrontation was  to prevail, and admitted that the government is facing its  greatest difficulties in the political field.    In assessing the executive branch's performance a little  more  than a month after President Eduardo Frei assumed the  presidency, Arriagada said: "Either there is a spirit of  constructive and loyal relationship between the government and  opposition or a climate of inflexibility and confrontation will  prevail in the country."    The government has thus intervened for the first time in the  controversy between the Coalition of Parties for Democracy and  the opposition regarding the right's role. The government  parties accuse the right of abandoning the policy of agreement  due to the imposition of the UDI's [Independent Democratic  Union] rigid viewpoints within this sector, which are not in  harmony with the National Renewal Party members who uphold a  more moderate stance.    On 16 April, as he assessed the first 35 days of Frei's  government, Arriagada said the government has shown great  initiative and is leading the country toward a constructive  debate that takes the country's true problems into account. He  said: "We might have some style problems but that is only  natural for such a complex task and for a team that has just  been sworn in."    He commented that three days ago the government quietly  defined "an interesting privatization proposal that is pragmatic  and not ideological. The upcoming sale of 12 percent of Edelnor  [Northern Electricity Company] strictly complies with our  electric power policy that believes that competition and  separating generating activities from the transmission  activities is the best policy. The state's participation in LAN  [Chilean Airline] has become unnecessary, as well as limiting  the private sector's participation to 35 percent of the capital  of Empremar [State Maritime Enterprise], which was justified in  the past. The same goes for Transcontainer."    Arriagada also stated that the measures announced on 15  April  by the finance minister are also in keeping with a state that  promotes a greater opening of the exchange markets, the  strengthening of the export sectors, and the opening of capital  accounts.    Arriagada also upheld the executive branch's attitude  regarding [Carabinero Director General Rodolfo] Stange's case,  asserting that it was the only solution compatible with the  principle of probity and justice the government firmly upholds.    In this regard he said that the "right focuses its  criticisms  on irrelevant matters, but every day fewer Chileans believe that  the chief of police of a responsible state can be both guarantor  of the citizenry's safety and involved in a court case. The  issue was handled with respect for Stange and the Carabineros,  and the government exercised restraining leadership on its  political supporters, thus preventing the conflict from turning  into an escalation of scandalous accusations and even the  untimely discussion of constitutional matters that, although  related -- such as the fact that the government does not have  the authority to remove the [Carabineros] director general,  could have caused uncertainty."    In Arriagada's opinion, "the fact that the so-called `Stange  crisis' by no means affected the unprecedented working and  cooperative climate with the Armed Forces speaks well of the  government."    As for the constitutional reforms, "a matter that has  existed  since the first day of the transition," Arriagada asserted:  "The government has made a positive proposal, rejecting the  idea of sponsoring reforms that involve a partial viewpoint, and  has chosen to invite the political parties to discuss them from  a nationwide viewpoint such as deciding what sort of municipal  system modernization is the best, what sort of modernization of  Congress do Chileans aspire to."    In this regard, Arriagada said, the government has asked the  political parties to untangle a debate that was gradually  reduced to "inflexible" and "weak" attitudes and mentioned that  discussions regarding the electoral system's reform started on  15 April.

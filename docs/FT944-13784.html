			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley Wolseley's profits weathered the recession much better than the rest of the building materials sector so it was only to be expected that its recovery would be less dramatic. Only to be expected, but wrong. While few other companies are anywhere near matching their previous peak profits Wolseley's earnings per share have now topped the 1990 record by more than a third. The achievement is all the more impressive given that two-thirds of Wolseley's UK distribution sales go into the still depressed repair and maintenance market. In the US it has been been boosted by a building boom in the Carolinas. But the success of Brossette in the difficult French market proves once again what a successful and highly exportable formula Wolseley has developed. Fooled too often by the management's cautious statements, the City is looking for healthy growth for the next couple of years. Apart from France, it would be optimistic to look for significant further improvements in its main markets. The US may have a little way to go and Wolseley could hope for some upturn in the UK, but margins are already near the peak achieved in easier inflationary times. However, Wolseley has shown it can thrive in low growth conditions and there is no reason to suppose the flow of acquisitions will dry up. Given its muscular balance sheet and buoyant cash flow, the group may step up the pace and scale of its deals. But it would be wrong to expect anything spectacular. That would not be Wolseley's style.</p>

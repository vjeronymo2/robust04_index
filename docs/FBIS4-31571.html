			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] condemns the  bombing carried out at the parliament building at dawn today.  The MDF believes that there is no significant political force  in Hungary today that would have an interest in creating  confusion or disturbing the country's peace and order, the party  communique stresses. The attempt could only have been carried  out by an extremist individual or group, who or which cannot  accept that the Hungarian nation, in free elections that were  held for a second time, has decided in favor of multiparty  parliamentary democracy.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPE WILL PLACE A QUOTA ON U.S. TV SHOWS, MAXWELL TELLS CONGRESS  </P> <P> British movie mogul Robert Maxwell, rebuffing U.S. calls for unrestricted sales  of American television shows to Europe, told a House panel Wednesday that there  will eventually be a quota on Hollywood's productions and that the industry  must come to terms with the inevitable instead of engaging in a bruising trade  fight.  </P> <P> Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications, called U.S. threats of trade  retaliation over television and movies "hollow" and said: "Europe will have a  directive (quota). You can have a hard directive or a soft directive. . . . You  need the competition. You've conquered the world, now it's our turn. You cannot  drive us into the ground."  </P> <P> The declaration followed a rousing free-trade speech by Jack Valenti, president  of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, and warnings from U.S. officials who  said any quota would violate international trade agreements.  </P> <P> "We don't want any more than the same freedom of access that European  businessmen find (in the United States). Nothing more, nothing less," Valenti  said. "They don't need any quota crutch."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seeking to Preserve Heritage'  </P> <P> The hearing, before the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on  telecommunications, was an attempt to find common ground between the European  Community and Hollywood but only seemed to underscore their philosophical  chasm.  </P> <P> The Europeans, in drafting rules for their 1992 economic union, say they are  just seeking to preserve their cultural heritage and fledgling movie industry  in the face of overwhelming competition from the United States. But Hollywood  charges that "Europe without walls" is only a veil for a "Europe without  American television," and that the proposed quota could be a prelude to  escalating protectionism.  </P> <P> A law to ensure that more than 50% of air time is filled by shows produced by  the 12 EC nations is at the center of the dispute. According to EC figures,  only about 5,000 hours of Europe's annual 105,000 hours of TV and movies are  produced on the Continent, the majority being American-made, earning Hollywood  $800 million last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Could Backfire  </P> <P> Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz agreed, saying the idea of a quota  is not acceptable and would violate international trade agreements.  </P> <P> But Maxwell warned that U.S. efforts to stave off any limits might succeed in  blocking a uniform European policy but could backfire by leaving individual  nations free to pass more rigorous limitations.  </P> <P> "The American entertainment industry stands to lose a greater portion of the  European broadcast market if the Council of Ministers cannot reach an agreement  and the decision is relegated to the judgments and controls of the European  states," he said.  </P> <P> He said countries such as France, which is pushing the hardest for greater  European restrictions, is the "greater menace." Working together, the United  States and the EC could both profit by maximizing a potential market of 335  million viewers, he said.  </P> <P> "We can do for software and television what NATO did for European defense," he  said.  </P> <P> David Webster, a former director of the BBC, said the directive would be a  "minimum regulatory framework" and the "best deal available" to Hollywood.  </P> <P> "America is going to make much more money in the expanding market," he said.  </P> <P> Although the testimony was lively and often in direct contradiction, the tone  remained amiable and both sides stressed that talks should prevail over  confrontation.  </P> <P> "We can avert all that," Valenti said. "Each side knows that the stakes are too  high to be unreasonable."  </P></p>

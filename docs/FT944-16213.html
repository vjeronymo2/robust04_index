			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: A keyboard athlete - Music in London At the end of his comparatively short recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday evening, Andrei Gavrilov gave a friendly wave and said 'I'd love to play more, but really the piano is very tired'. He had just given a blistering account of the hectic finale of Prokofiev's Eighth Sonata. How else can you play it? Yet Gavrilov is not the beefy tyro he once was, and some his discs lately have shown a more thoughtful, mellow side of his musical make-up; his recording of Schubert's Impromptus, for instance. Three from the later set opened this recital, beginning with the Theme and Variations in B flat, which were warm and relaxed, with almost casual, though fleet, articulation in the last variation. In the second Impromptu in A flat, Gavrilov seemed to have slight trouble keeping dynamics on an intimate level, though it sounded as if he was holding down the left pedal the whole way through. In the last, dance-like piece, with its sudden, wild swirls, he actually ignored some of Schubert's quiet dynamics, not that the effect was anything but entirely natura1. Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit is a macabre triptych with a reputation for some of the most horrendous technical difficulties in the entire piano literature. Yet it is full of delicate, crepuscular halflights and shadows; the whole of the second piece, Le gibet, is quiet and so is much of the first, Ondine. The player's problems were mainly to do with intricate textures and balance, and while Gavrilov was strong on colour and atmosphere, the mind-boggling details of Ondine sounded a bit approximate. He took Le gibet quite fluently, allowing the pulse a bit of elasticity. Scarbo, the spookiest and most violent piece, was swept forwards with compelling brutality and if the outlines of its grotesque and jagged forms were a bit smudged, at least the spirit was right. After the interval, the wild toccata-like sections of Prokofiev's Eighth Sonata seemed mere child's play to this natural keyboard athlete. But the first movement alternates brilliant, propulsive music with oddly sour-flavoured slower sections, whose air of unease Gavrilov rather underplayed, so that the effect was almost offhand, or absent-minded. The sleepy middle movement lulled us effectively before the onslaught of the finale, which ended with something not far short of a punch to the bottom of the keyboard, as almost at once, Gavrilov leapt to his feet to show us he had well and truly won that battle.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / White House starts to ponder price of victory: With his budget bill narrowly passed at last, the president can sigh with relief and look to the future NO ISSUE was more central to Bill Clinton's campaign to become president of the US than the management of the economy, and nothing contributed more to the defeat of George Bush last November. It is against that background that Thursday night's cliff-hanging vote in the House of Representatives on President Clinton's deficit-reduction budget bill, and the scarcely less dramatic vote in the Senate the following day, have to be seen. To have lost those votes, despite a Democrat majority in both houses, would not just have struck at the core of Mr Clinton's legislative programme, but would have also raised the most serious doubts about his ability to work successfully with Congress. The wave of relief that swept through the White House shortly after 10pm on Friday, when the Senate finally gave Mr Clinton his bill after a week of frantic lobbying, was therefore all too understandable. A victory was all that mattered, even though in the event it was by just two votes in the House of Representatives and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Al Gore in the Senate. How large a political price Mr Clinton had to pay for that victory, both in the country at large and on Capitol Hill in particular, and the lessons he had gleaned from it, are likely to have a decisive bearing on the remainder of his presidency. The learning curve for the relatively young Mr Clinton and his staff at the White House was always likely to be a sharp one, and at the weekend the debate was already well under way about how the presentation and compromises struck on the budget legislation could have been better handled. Somewhere in the course of the past five months, it is clear that the White House lost its ability to define the budget as offering a stimulus which would create jobs, and allowed the Republicans to present it instead as essentially a tax-raising exercise which would hit the living standards of middle-income Americans. In part that was because Mr Clinton had to sacrifice important parts of the original bill. It did become essentially a budget-deficit reduction exercise, something that was not easy to sell politically, not least because the impact of the revenue-raising measures was felt immediately  - even retroactively in the case of some income-tax increases - while the bulk of the cost-cutting will not occur until later in Mr Clinton's term. But he also failed fully to get across the message that the tax changes, apart from the increase in gasoline tax, fell predominantly on the wealthiest and that there were positive benefits for many Americans on lower incomes. The repeated if unfair assertion by Republicans led by Mr Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, that this was the biggest tax increase in US history, hit home. As public opinion polls demonstrated last week, Mr Clinton was never able to undo the damage. Neither was the president able to demonstrate that he enjoyed the full support of the party he leads. Long-time observers of Congress assert that rarely before has there been such a collection of individualists on Capitol Hill who so readily put personal and local interests ahead of those of country and party. Add to that the loss of ability that modern presidents are said to suffer in enforcing party discipline, and Mr Clinton's problems last week become clearer. Faced by unanimous Republican opposition in both houses, all his lobbying time was consumed in attempting to whip recalcitrant Democrats into line. For the optimists, the worst is now over. They argued yesterday that the budget bill was always likely to be the hardest piece of legislation to force through Congress, simply because it broke new ground by reversing the trend of the past 12 years. Even if its effect on the economy will be much less beneficial that its proponents would have the public believe, a start has been made. This in turn opens the door for the other key parts of the Clinton programme, such as the overhaul of the health care, changes to the welfare system, the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement and Mr Gore's proposals for 're-inventing government', all of which are capable of attracting greater bipartisan support than was achieved during the budget debate. Mr Dole has already stressed that Republicans want to be 'part of the action'. Democrats are cheered by indications that a number of Republicans are attracted by aspects of the work being done by the team headed by Ms Hillary Rodham Clinton on health care, although once again the critical issue will be on how the reforms are to be paid for. Republican leaders said yesterday they hoped that the administration had learned its lesson during the budget battle and now understood that the public would not tolerate any further tax increases. Certainly, Mr Clinton once again has everything to play for. His political standing in the country may not have been much enhanced by his budget victory, but neither has it been seriously tarnished. One thing has assuredly not changed. He will continue to be judged fundamentally on the performance of the economy. Mr Clinton was elected to turn it around, and will sink politically if he fails.</p>

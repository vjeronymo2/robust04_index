			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "Talks about </F> the Speaker End Around the Kremlin Christmas Tree. LDPR Leader  Is Russia's Choice's Sole Hope for a Breakup of the `Big  Coalition'"]    [Text] Today another round of talks is due to be held  between the four potentially largest factions in the State Duma  about the candidacy of its future chairman. The previous round,  which took place on the morning of 31 December, ended  inconclusively. Russia's Choice, as has always been the case  recently, has again found itself in isolation but this time its  partners-opponents (the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian  Federation Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR]) were not quite so unanimous either. According to  some sources, some turmoil among their hitherto apparently  uniform ranks was introduced by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who has  just returned from his foreign tour which concluded so  unexpectedly. He replaced Viktor Kobelev, chief of his own  party apparatus, at the negotiating table, and therefore some of  the details agreed upon earlier had to be repeated to him.    According to Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party,  today's meeting will apparently be decisive. If there are no  results -- that is to say, if there is no consensus on the  nomination of a mutually satisfactory candidacy for the Duma  speaker -- then votes would have to be counted. It can be  stated with certainty that this is precisely what the leadership  of each of the four large factions will have to do. With  respect to Russia's Choice this procedure will apparently be the  most upsetting, since its own votes will obviously not be enough  to outweigh the votes of the agrarians, the communists, and the  Zhirinovskiy followers. Incidentally, according to some reports,  Russia's Choice was prepared for a failure at the talks on the  speaker back when they were just beginning, while their results,  by general consent, were reported to the press in upbeat, i.e.,  quite ambiguous phrases. It was at that moment that a member of  the Russia's Choice faction who enjoyed substantial influence  within it told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that their  candidate would be Sergey Kovalev, provided the speaker is  selected from among the major factions. If the Duma chairman is  sought within a number of small factions, Russia's Choice would  support any constructive candidacy.    Now it is appropriate to go back to Russia's Choice's  problems over the counting of its own votes. They (these  problems) will become especially serious after the "democratic"  factions possibly refuse to team up with Russia's Choice on the  speaker issue. This mainly concerns the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord [PRES], whose leader Sergey Shakhray reminded  Russia's Choice about the pledges by its numerous  representatives that they would never sit down next to the  fascists. True, the refusal to form a bloc with Russia's Choice  will not bring PRES any success and, having no chances to get  through its own candidate as chairman, it will have to vote  against everyone, which somewhat contradicts its basic  principles: unity and accord. Russia's Choice itself will  undoubtedly explain away its participation in the talks by  pragmatic considerations, at the same time renouncing its  earlier pledges, citing pre-election rhetoric and the bitterness  of defeat, widely publicized by pro-presidential TV. Therefore  a bloc of smaller factions and a group of "independents" with  Russia's Choice is evolving objectively: Only then will they  possibly have a majority. It is another question whether such a  number of partners, where each partner has his own interests and  is determined to satisfy them to the fullest possible extent,  will be able to come to a definite agreement. If not, defectors  are bound to appear again: first, single individuals and then  whole factions which will tip the scale. It appears that  Russia's Choice has only one hope: Mr. Zhirinovskiy's  unpredictable behavior.</p>

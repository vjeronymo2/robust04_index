			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from Lusaka, where the peace talks are being  held, say that the atmosphere is already better than it was  before UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's recent  visits to the cities of Huambo and Luanda. The National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and Luanda teams  have not had any direct meeting yet but they are scheduled to  hold one today. Meanwhile, Angola's real opposition has  expressed satisfaction with UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro  Savimbi's call for a greater participation in the country's  political life.    Moreover, the UN Security Council met on 16 March and  decided  to extend the UN Angola Verification Mission's mandate until 31  May. Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party ambassador to the United  Nations, made some rather contradictory remarks on that  occasion, this at a time when the two sides are working to  restore peace to Angola as soon as possible. Dr. Marcos  Samondo, UNITA ambassador to the United Nations, had this to say  about Mbinda's remarks.    [Begin recording] [Samondo] The way he spoke, Mbinda was  using again the language of (?cold war), thereby giving people  the wrong idea. What is happening is that the two sides really  want to wind up the Lusaka peace talks as soon as possible so  that we can enter a new stage of national reconciliation and  unity.    [Unidentified correspondent] Through Dr. Jonas Savimbi, its  leader, UNITA had said last week that peace and national  reconciliation would happen and that the Lusaka peace talks  would be fruitful. Such a statement surely takes into account  the government's position, too. However, the position conveyed  by the government in New York yesterday seems to suggest that  the government may be following a different path.    [Samondo] On one hand, there is the hope that something is  going to happen. On the other hand, what you see is that some  official makes a statement, like the one made by Mbinda at the  United Nations yesterday [words indistinct] and then there is  the military question: at this stage, there are major movements  under way by the government forces in northern Angola in  general, and in Bengo Province in particular. Government forces  have also been moving in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul Provinces, in  northeastern Angola, as well as in the center and south of the  country. In view of that, what message are we giving the  international community now?    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Marcos Samondo:  neither side appears to be really interested in bringing peace  to Angola in the near future. Each side appears to continue to  believe in military victory (?even though) they affirm no  military victory is possible.    [Samondo] I disagree. With all respect, I would like to  convey my disagreement because [words indistinct] UNITA [words  indistinct] it is UNITA that is making the greater concessions.  We have made concessions in the military sphere, we have made  concessions concerning the police force, and now [words  indistinct] discussing issues pertaining to central and  provincial government [words indistinct] (? to give us two)  ministries, but it did not (?accept) [words indistinct] at the  hotel. When we talk about the provinces [words indistinct] the  government is not even willing to give us those provinces [words  indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

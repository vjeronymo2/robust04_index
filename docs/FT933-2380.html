			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The fruits of Rioja - Common Markets LOGRONO is the urban hub of the Rioja region of Spain, best known for its wines. Apart from a few streets which radiate from the central square by the cathedral, Logrono is not a very attractive place: much has been rebuilt in the post-Franco years and now the impression one gets is of mile-upon-mile of shabby flats. The market is no longer in the square. It was long ago transferred to a covered building a few streets away. At the back of this runs the Calle del Laurel, the city's most lively street after dark, where all the tapas bars appear to be. Rioja is near enough to the coast to be interesting for fish and close enough to the cool mountains to be regularly supplied with pork (the pig is naturally the king of the domestic beasts in the limited space given to a mountain farm) and cheese. The plains of Rioja Baja also provide vegetables: not just the famous white asparagus of Rioja and Navarre, but all those vegetables which are constituent parts of the local menestra de verduras: artichokes, potatoes, cardoons, peas and green beans. In August Logrono market had few vegetable rarities to offer, but one thing did catch my eye: borraja or borage, in England used only as a dressing for summer Pimms, but in Spain the tender young shoots are cooked with potatoes as a first course. The rest was more predictable: white beans, green chillies, Swiss chard and heaps of oyster mushrooms. The strangest fruits were the tiny pears and miniature flat-ended peaches called paraguayos. There was no absence of fish from the market stalls. As one might expect there was a lot of hake (the national fish), sea bass, sea bream, bonito and monkfish. Perhaps more interesting was the grading accorded to dried cod in the market: the best bacalao came from the Faroe Islands, those from Iceland and Norway were markedly cheaper. These piscine offerings notwithstanding, from all the evidence of the market, the people of Logrono must be tremendous meat eaters. In a restaurant the previous night there had been a great many jokes about vegetarians. I asked if there were any vegetarians in Spain. My hosts became thoughtful. Finally, they suggested, but were not certain, that the Queen was a vegetarian, and left it at that. There were no vegetarians in the place I visited first that morning: the chorizo factory just outside Logrono which belongs to the Palacios family. Here they produce chiefly chorizos of the thin, horseshoe-shaped variety; fairly mild sausages without the hefty dose of pimenton one might expect in the south of Spain. Palacios told me that many chorizos were getting milder because children did not like hot foods. Palacios also makes salchichon, which are mild and made without pimenton; and papadas: pigs' cheeks seasoned with pimenton, salt and garlic. Pigs' bits were also one of the market's major themes: black puddings from Burgos or Rioja; butifara sausages from Catalonia; fresh chorizos for frying or adding to bean or chick pea stews; chitterlings; cracked up pieces of roasted pigs' heads; pigs' snouts; slightly ropey bits of highly priced Jabugo ham, but these were not from here - they had been airlifted from Seville. It was not all pork, however, embuchados de cabrito seemed to be little balls of kids' guts. Smiling suckling pigs were arranged alongside sheeps' heads, tiny lamb trotters and calves' ears. The earthy quality of the food available from the market strongly contrasts with that offered by the best restaurants in the region. Meson Chuchi in Fuenmayor specialises in meat cooked in a baker's oven: suckling pig, milk fed lamb and kid. It looks a bit like a medieval torture chamber with its pseudo-gothic vaults and iron grilles, but quality is good. The best restaurant in Rioja is in Logrono itself at La Merced, in the old heart of the city. Here you will eat the best food of the region: gamba croquettes on the finest tomato sauce; lobster salad; braised oxtails pimientos rellenos, or stuffed pimentos; or squid cooked in its own ink. All these dishes will be moistened with good Rioja wine. Information: Meson Chuchi, Carretera Vitoria, 18 Fuenmayor. Tel: 45 04 22. La Merced, Marques de S. Nicolas III.

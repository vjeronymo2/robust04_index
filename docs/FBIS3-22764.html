The Rs. 235-crore contract signed by the Indian Space  Research Organisation with Glavkosmos of Russia in January 1991  had been for the supply of two cryogenic stages and transfer of  technology. The United States objected to the deal, insisting  that it violated the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR),  and in May 1992 imposed a two-year embargo on the ISRO and  Glavkosmos. Under the U.S. pressure, Russia invoked the force  majeure clause and informed the Government of India in July last  year that Glavkosmos would not transfer cryogenic technology or  production equipment.    In a press interview at the time, the ISRO Chairman, Prof  U.R. Rao, had asserted that India was not interested in mere  engines. The sale of engines without the accompanying transfer  of technology was meaningless, he said. When a Glavkosmos team,  led by its head, Mr. Alexander Dunayev, was in Bangalore last  month to renegotiate the deal, there were reports doing the  rounds in ISRO circles that India would get additional cryogenic  engines, but not the technology. Official ISRO sources had  refused to confirm or deny these reports.    But a recent agency report from Moscow, quoting Mr. Yuri  Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said cryogenic  technology would not be transferred and India could get two  additional cryogenic stages instead. This report has since been  confirmed by highly reliable ISRO sources.    Russian interests: If these new terms are agreed  to -- the renegotiated deal is reportedly yet to be finalised --  Russia would have effectively safeguarded its interests. Russia  has completed a considerable part of the development of the  cryogenic engine and stage, and is said to have received Rs. 102  crores from India. Had India decided to cancel the deal, this  development effort would have been wasted and Russia might have  had to pay compensation as well. The new deal would allow Russia  to salvage the contract in return for two additional stages.    The ISRO's acceptance of additional cryogenic stages, in  lieu  of technology appears motivated by a desire to avoid delays in  developing cryogenic technology indigenously. The initial GSLVs  would be launched with Russian cryogenic stages and indigenous  development pursued alongside. The indigenous cryogenic stage  could be ready in five years if there were no hitches, said one  senior ISRO expert. But he also agreed that such hitches were  common in cryogenic engine development and that other countries  had taken twice as long. There is also said to be a provision  for India to buy more cryogenic stages from Russia if indigenous  development was not completed in time.    Cost factor: An important issue that will have to  be considered is the cost. Under the earlier contract, the  Rs.235 crores would have got India two stages as well as the  technology to make the cryogenic engines and stages. The same  money would now get India four stages. That works out to nearly  Rs. 60 crores for each stage, the cost of an entire Polar  Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). If more stages have to be  bought, as they very well might be, that would push up the bill  still further. There is no information available as yet on how  much these cryogenic stages would cost. In addition, the ISRO  will have to find the money to fund its own indigenous effort,  which could cost Rs. 500 crores or more.    A crucial assumption appears to be that the GSLV can be  launched, as earlier planned, in 1995-96. But with last year's  failure of the PSLV as well as delays in the GSLV development  programme, it is more likely that the GSLV will fly only by  1998, according to ISRO experts themselves. If the indigenous  cryogenic engine can be developed in five years as the ISRO  claims, it should be possible to wait one more year and launch  an entirely indigenous GSLV. The Russian cryogenic stages would  then not be needed at all.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: A woman of account - Cavendish Financial Management, 9th in a series on fee-based advisers Julie Lord, the managing director of Cardiff-based Cavendish Financial Management, is the only Associate of the Institute of Financial Planning in Wales, but the distinction has not encouraged her to rest on her professional laurels. She is now working for some tax qualifications and says: 'I believe you have to keep studying to keep your brain alive in this business. There are IFAs (independent financial advisers) who are doing the same sort of product-based business they were doing 20 years ago. Their approach is positively Jurassic.' Lord claims that Cavendish is one of the few companies in south Wales that is pioneering the idea of fee-based advice, and she argues that its success shows people will pay for quality advice and service if they can see they are getting value for money. 'It is the Marks and Spencer principle,' she says. 'We consider that we give an extremely good service that is not necessarily unique but is unusual.' Lord founded Cavendish with her husband Andrew in 1991 after six years' experience with a commission-only IFA firm. 'I saw things were changing and that the sophisticated clients wanted more than a commission organisation could give them,' she says. 'I began to think that we could offer something more professional.' While there is now a small branch office in Blackpool, Lord says there is unlikely to be any further expansion. 'We have made a policy decision that we don't want to build up another financial services empire based on sand.' She insists that all clients make a will (she retains a local solicitor to help, if necessary) and the firm's terms of business stipulate that clients must inform it if their circumstances change. 'We can't possibly give proper advice if clients don't tell us what is going on,' she argues. Most of Cavendish's clients live in south Wales, over the English border in Bristol, or along the M4 corridor. Half are business owners and company directors, and many approach the firm after attending one of its regular investment seminars. 'We thought these seemed a very sensible way to attract people who were serious about their financial future,' Lord explains. 'Our clients all have one thing in common: they recognise the value of structured financial planning to help them achieve their goals.' The seminar audiences invariably include a number of single, divorced and widowed women. Lord thinks women are 'notoriously bad at organising their financial affairs,' adding: 'They prefer to rely on their partners or on large institutions. I try to persuade them they must do their own planning, because no one else will.' In her experience, however, financial incompetence is by no means confined to women. 'There is a surprising number of totally naive professional people,' she says. 'Some accountants are in a terrible mess with their finances and some of our medical clients are hopeless.' 'Then there are people who say they want to retire at 55 and they haven't started making pension contributions. It is almost like not being on the right planet.' The four advisers at Cavendish aim to provide comprehensive financial and investment planning for private clients but the services are not confined to the asset-rich. Lord says: 'Providing clients have income, they can have absolutely no money whatsoever. We have clients who are literally just starting off, while our wealthiest client probably has something like Pounds 2.8m.' Fees are time-based. 'We have a time sheet and it is all logged into the computer,' says Lord. 'The client has a notional account and we debit this with the time we spend on them.' Hourly rates range from Pounds 20 to Pounds 125, and annual retainer fees for financial planning and investment clients are Pounds 100 to Pounds 500. Clients choose how to deal with any commission that arises. It can be rebated to them, added to their investment, or offset against fees. Lord describes most of the investment clients as loss-averse rather than risk-averse; thus, any portfolio recommendations tend to err on the side of caution. But while many clients like a modest flutter, she stresses: 'I will invest their money in riskier things only if I have done it myself. If we feel we have made a mistake, I would rather cut out than expose clients to further loss.' The firm is equally robust in its dealings with financial institutions that fail to deliver a proper service. 'Since we started, we have sacked two insurance companies because of their atrocious administration,' she says. Cavendish does not undertake discretionary management. 'Clients have to agree to absolutely everything we do,' Lord says. 'It is far better for them; then, they can keep control of things.' Clients are seen at least once a year and the firm likes to meet their accountants and other professional advisers, too. Lord expects the disclosure of commission and new solvency requirements will do much to change the face of the IFA market. 'I can't think of anything more bizarre than an IFA who can't stay in business because of solvency,' she adds. 'It is quite alarming; the requirement is only Pounds 10,000. 'I do think the IFA sector is going to get smaller. Unfortunately, this will give clients less choice. But at least those advisers who are left will be the genuine article - qualified, client-orientated, professional financial planners.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INDEPENDENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name:                       Cavendish Financial Management Ltd Address of head office:     Summit House, Windsor Place, Cardiff CF1 3BX Date firm was established:  May 1991 Regulator:                  Fimbra Funds under management:     Pounds 4.5m Number of clients:          650, plus 250 execution only Number of branch offices:   Two Minimum investment:         None Financial services offered: Comprehensive financial planning and                             investment advice Fees:                       Pounds 20 to Pounds 125 an hour  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Limits set on competition rules - European Court The European Court of Justice last week gave three important rulings which limit the application of Rome Treaty competition rules in the context of national laws restricting competition. Two cases concerned national rules prohibiting the use of rebates and other discounts or means of promotion by insurers and insurance intermediaries, in particular in the form of passing on insurance agents' commissions. The third concerned government price fixing for road transport. The Court said it was well established that member countries were precluded by the Treaty from adopting or maintaining measures capable of eliminating the useful effect of the competition rules. It confirmed that this would be infringed if a member country required or encouraged the conclusion of agreements restricting competition, reinforced the effects of such agreements, or removed the state character of any regulation by delegating enforcement to private parties. But the Court said the rule would not be infringed in the absence of any connection between the national regulation and any business behaviour otherwise caught by the cartel prohibition. The issues arose in criminal proceedings before a Dutch court and two German courts. In the Dutch case the Dutch insurer Ohra was prosecuted for breach of a national insurance intermediaries' regulation prohibiting insurance companies from granting commissions, rebates and other benefits in kind to anyone other than an intermediary. Ohra had advertised and granted to their insureds various financial benefits, including the waiving of insurance contract fees and free or reduced price credit cards. The ECJ ruled the Dutch law neither required nor encouraged the conclusion of an unlawful agreement by insurance intermediaries. Nor did it reinforce any existing agreement since no agreement existed in the civil liability, sickness, pension and life insurance classes covered by Ohra. Since the regulation itself contained the prohibition, enforcement could not be said to be delegated to private parties. In the German insurance case a fine had been imposed on a Mr Meng, an intermediary who infringed German law by passing on to his clients commission paid to him by insurers. The ECJ gave the same interpretative ruling as in the Ohra case. In the second German case, dealing with road transport rate fixing, the ECJ upheld the German system of rate fixing as a purely national regulation outside the scope of European competition rules. The Court said although the rates decided by the public authority were recommended by industry representatives, those representatives acted as independent experts acting on considerations of the public interest neither as parties to an agreement nor in place of the state. In spite of detailed arguments put before the Court by the European Commission and by all 12 member states, the ECJ left undecided a number of issues. One concerned the reasons for its narrow interpretation of previous case law on member country obligations in the context of European competition law given its approach to regulation of the public sector and businesses granted special rights. Cases C-2/91, Meng; C-185/91, Reiff; and C-245/91, Ohra, ECJ FC, 17 November 1993. Vat on advertising services The ECJ has clarified the VAT rules applicable to advertising services in three cases brought successfully by the Commission against France, Spain and Luxembourg. The Court ruled the exception enjoyed by advertising to the general rule that services should be taxed in the country where the provider of services was based applied to all forms of promotional activities connected with advertising. Thus all such promotional activities should be taxed in the country of the recipient of the service. Cases C-68/92, C-69/92 and C-73/92, Commission v France, Luxembourg and Spain, ECJ FC, 17 November 1993.</p>

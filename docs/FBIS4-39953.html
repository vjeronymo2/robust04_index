			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stanislav Tyshchenko: "Border Oblasts"] </F>   [Text] Although the border between Ukraine and the Russian  Federation exists de jure and de facto, it somehow defies  comprehension. It is too bizarre a fact, especially for elderly  people. This is why it will not be taken seriously yet for a  long time. But still, this is a fact. The division of the two  sovereign states has been made and cannot be undone. It dealt a  hard blow primarily to the economy of the former Soviet Union.  Enterprises tightly linked with each other started to lose  their ground. The absence of a single center with its almighty  State Planning Committee, the disruption of links to the quick,  and chaos in settlements of accounts led to the present  condition. What next?    In eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and the border-adjacent  regions, attempts are being undertaken to somehow resuscitate  economic relations based on the current situation in both  countries. The press has already reported that border area  leaders met in Belgorod and Kharkov to lay the groundwork for  closer financial and economic cooperation. A similar meeting  took place last week in Donetsk. It was held behind closed  doors, and at a press conference held on 27 May, its  participants were not too talkative, asking the journalists for  questions without making any introduction. This is only natural  -- everything is still in a "suspended condition" of  preparations, initial work, etc. Besides, an unclear political  situation at either side of the border offers no strong grounds  to hope for success of the planned undertaking.    However, there is a movement forward. A council of border  area leaders was organized, and an agreement is in the works  between Ukrainian and Russian Governments on cooperation among  border areas. The status of those oblasts and specific routing  of capital circulation is being determined.    The gist of the responses from the press conference  participants is that the main purpose of this unconventional  bilateral body is to reduce, if not eliminate, border and  customs barriers and to make cooperation on the border more  profitable, efficient, and to improve the living standards of  Russian and Ukrainian people.    Of course, the intentions are good. But will they become a  reality? This will depend on decisions made on the government  level. Incidentally, the meeting was attended by  representatives of Russian and Ukrainian presidents and  governments. The following oblasts were represented: Donetsk,  Lugansk, Sumy, and Kharkov (the delegation from Chernigov Oblast  did not arrive). The Russian side was represented by Belgorod,  Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov, and Kursk Oblasts.    At the press conference, it was particularly stressed that  the entire work of the border oblast leaders' council is  intended to solve purely economic and humanitarian issues, but  not political ones. For example, the association for economic  cooperation "Russian-Ukrainian Union" is being established.  Work is being conducted on the implementation of Leonid  Kravchuk's edict on free education for Ukrainian and Russian  students at colleges and universities located in the border  areas.    In other words, the process has gotten off to a good start.  The most important thing is that it is peaceful, based on  mutual understanding, and that it pursues good intentions.    The next meeting, or to be more precise, the meeting of the  council, is scheduled for September in Rostov-on-Don.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in </F> Northhampton by Jon Snow in London on 28 February -- recorded;  from the "Channel 4 News" program]    [Text] [Snow] Are the airstrikes a one-off or a watershed?    [Rifkind] Well, we hope it will be a one-off, because for  the  last few months the Bosnian-Serbs have not violated the no-fly  zone; they have done so for the first time with fixed wing  aircraft, and they have paid the penalty. I hope they now  realize this must not be repeated.    [Snow] There has been a catalogue of movements that have not  been entirely satisfactory, but there was something very  different about this particular incident?    [Rifkind] Yes very different, the previous violations have  been helicopters and it has always been very difficult to tell  whether helicopters are being used for a civilian or a military  purpose. What happened today was unique -- [this was] the first  time fixed wing aircraft [were] being used, actually attacking  positions on the ground, [with] no room for doubt, no room for  confusion -- a quite clear violation of the Security Council  resolution.    [Snow] Do you have any intelligence on what may have been  going on?    [Rifkind] We don't have detailed information at this stage.  It would appear that there was an attack on a ammunition  factory, and the reports I have heard suggest that that  ammunition factory might in any event have been within range of  Serb artillery, so it's not clear what they might have been up  to.    [Snow] Clearly the danger must be that with the heat that's  being put on the Sarajevo end of things, the Serbs are now  trying it on elsewhere, and literally trying to test NATO wills  and UN wills?    [Rifkind] Well if that is their motive, then they have  tested  and they have found that that resolve was pretty strong, because  what NATO said would happen has happened.    [Snow] Clearly there is a worry though that this will lead  to  reprisals against our people on the ground, and indeed the  necessity for more action in the air?    [Rifkind] I think it would be have been more worrying if  having tested NATO's resolve -- if NATO had been found wanting  -- that would have simply encouraged not only the Bosnian Serbs,  but also the other factions in this war to flout the various  agreements that have been reached. I think that what has been  most impressive particularly in recent weeks is how the UN and  NATO have been able to demonstrate that the resolve is indeed  substantial, and that if the Security Council resolutions are  ignored, then indeed action follows.    [Snow] The chain of command seems to have worked very  efficiently, I mean, did NATO in fact have to refer to the top  of the line before doing this?    [Rifkind] Well, I am not familiar with the precise details,  this was a matter for the UN commander, but there is a  recognized procedure that if there is a violation, then the UN  commander on the ground is able to ask for action to be taken,  the NATO commander was able to respond and that is what has  happened.    [Snow] Now as attention switches away from Sarajevo, I mean  the Tuzla area in particular has been under very heavy pressure  today, and that involves much more likelihood of British  activity?    [Rifkind] You say more likelihood of British activity -- the  British area is not in the Tuzla pocket, that is mostly a Nordic  battalion of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians who have the primary  responsibility in Tuzla.    [Snow] But on the other hand, we may yet be drawn in from  Vitez or anywhere else in support, I mean what do we do?    [Rifkind] Well you say in support, if there is any attempt  to  attack any UN forces, whether they be British or other forces  then the UN has very powerful military assets at its disposal,  including of course, as we have seen aircraft, we would not  hesitate either at the UN level and certainly not at the British  level in expecting all these military assets including air power  to be used if it was necessary in the opinion of the local  commanders to protect the physical safety of their men.    [Snow] But given that the prime minister said in the Commons  last week -- that he hoped to see Tuzla airport open within two  to three weeks -- this not looking too good, is it?    [Rifkind] Well, I think we must wait and see, clearly the  position today is somewhat confused. I think it should be  clearer over the 24 hours what is actually happening in the  Tuzla area. I think what will have been important is that it  will have been seen very clearly -- not just by the Serbs, but  also by the Croats, and by the Bosnian-Muslim authorities that  if the Security Council resolutions are flouted in such a  substantial way, then that is not something which is treated  with equanimity, and I think it is quite important that that  point will now be clearly understood.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Yet another group in Nigeria has come out in  support of Chief Abiola, the self-proclaimed president who was  detained on Thursday [23 June] by the military government. This  is the oil workers union, Nupeng [National Union of Petroleum  and Natural Gas Workers], who are demanding Abiola's release,  and are threatening to go on strike. But the ruling council,  led by General Sani Abacha, is refusing to recognize Abiola's  claims to the presidency, based on the abortive election held  last June. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked Nupeng's secretary  general, Frank Ovie Kokori, how much support there is for the  strike:    [Begin recording] [Kokori] We have been able to go round the  whole country and got the mandate of all the zonal councils of  Nupeng saying that if Abiola is not released -- not only just  being released -- that he should actualize his mandate, and that  the present head of state, who is the leader the junta, should  work out a program for handing over peacefully to Abiola within  the next seven days.    [Isaacs] So are you and the union threatening to do if the  government does not accede to these demands within the seven  days you talk about?    [Kokori, laughing] Normally, as a trade union we only have  one option: the last option, which is the historical role of  trade unions all over the world, and that is resorting to  industrial action. I mean, an industrial action that will be  sustained by all means until the people on the other side will  see reason with us in the country.    [Isaacs] Why do you think the government should take your  action seriously? After all, you have taken industrial action  in the past and been forced to backtrack and give up.    [Kokori] No, we never gave up. Nupeng never gave up, you  know that, and what happened was that the present head of state  called Nupeng at that time and assured Nupeng that the issue of  June 12 would be revisited, but the whole thing became a fraud.  The government deceived every person....    [Isaacs, interrupting] But in reality, you know that  industrial action like this will (?last) a little while, and in  the end the government will win because it has the power.    [Kokori] Well, that is your own view as a pressman. I am  laborist [as heard] and I have been in labor struggles for  years. (?It is only) an industrial union that could paralyze the  soul of the Nigerian economy.    [Isaacs] So (?your main intention) is to bring the Nigerian  economy to its knees?    [Kokori] I don't know. You predict that, but we say the  people themselves are not happy with....[pauses] A man who is  given the mandate, he is now being used and he is now being  tortured as the underdog, whereas people who never had the  mandate are now enjoying or ruling the country under the barrel  of the gun. It is unfair. I think you will agree with me.    [Isaacs] And your industrial action will continue until the  government says it will honor the June 12, or until it [words  indistinct] the June 12 presidential election of last year?    [Kokori] If the way you are going [words indistinct], and  those of us who are speaking to you now, we don't even know what  will happen to us tomorrow. So we are on a struggle, on a  historic political struggle. So it is not a [word indistinct],  you will agree with me. It is a serious struggle we are all in  (?for). [end recording]</p>

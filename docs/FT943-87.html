			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP report sends tremors through Brussels - Lionel Barber examines a controversial proposal for wholesale farm policy reform A minor earthquake erupted in Brussels yesterday. The European Commission released an independent study which recommends wholesale reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, including scrapping farm production quotas and set-aside payments to farmers. The commission's decision to publish and be damned breaks a Brussels taboo on talking about further CAP reform. Not everyone, it seems, is satisfied with the present step-by-step changes in the policy, which consumes half of the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) annual budget. The question is whether the 200-page report - called EC Agricultural Policy for the 21st Century and drawn up by a group of independent agricultural experts from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the UK - is destined to gather dust on an academic shelf; or whether it signals the start of a fresh debate about the future of the CAP, which many believe is inevitable if the EU is serious about enlargement to the farm-intensive economies of central Europe. This week, the commission made clear that it does not endorse the report's conclusions. Mr Bruno Dethomas, chief spokesmen, noted that the EU was still digesting the 1992 McSharry reforms, which moved the CAP away from price support to direct income support for farmers as an incentive to reduce rampant overproduction. To embark on reforms every 18 months would 'masochistic', he said. This echoes the standard line from DG6, the agriculture directorate, which has held an iron grip on the CAP since its inception. What is now clear is that officials in DG2 - the economics and financial directorate - used the device of commissioning an independent study as a means of breaking this grip and stimulating debate. The report's authors - who include Mr Arne Larson, a former chef de cabinet to Mr Finn Gundelach, a celebrated Danish vice president of the European Commission in the 1970s - are careful to avoid repeating the familiar Anglo-Saxon criticism of the CAP as an expensive racket designed to coddle Europe's farmers, coupled with ritual calls for EU prices to fall to world levels. Though the report is merciless in exposing the inefficiencies of the present system, its new element turns on the application of 'subsidiarity' - the principle of devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate national and regional level, which is enshrined in the Maastricht treaty - to agricultural policy. Thus, the authors recommend that EU farm subsidies should be phased into national budgets over seven to ten years. Member states - not Brussels - would assume responsibility for direct income supports, a move that the authors argue is a logical extension of the McSharry reforms. Second, those countries suffering heavy penalties through loss of EU financial aid could be compensated through increased contributions from the regional, social and 'cohesion' funds, which are set up to assist poorer areas. The most serious objection is that 'renationalisation' of agriculture would encourage even more cheating by member states and ultimately destroy the single market. But the authors' have an answer: a reinforced competition policy to monitor state aids. Their idea is to create a new 'common organisation' that would involve member states producing multi-annual plans for direct income support to farmers, to be discussed and approved in the Council of Ministers - a little like the present arrangements for monitoring the use of structural funds or regional aid. The time-bomb ticking here, of course, is that the new mechanism would signal a further diminution of the European Commission as supra-national authority. But again the authors propose a sweetener: 'For a CAP reform proposal to be adopted, it is important that the distribution of costs and benefits between member states does not dramatically change as a result of its implementation, and that it is perceived in each member state not to do so.' Second, member states would 'in general' be free to provide compensation based on historical levels of production because such payments do not provide an incentive to increased production, according to the report. Third, the report acknowledges that certain rural communities are still highly dependent and vulnerable, and therefore should receive aid on the same basis as other sectors in remote areas or countryside. Despite these reassurances, the report can expect rough handling from Europe's farm lobby, particularly in France. Moreover, member states could expect to contribute hefty amounts of money from their national budgets in the initial phase of the reforms because of the need to support market prices. However, the report predicts that price developments over the next few years will lead to cereal prices approaching world prices quite closely, so that no set-aside may be needed to comply with the Gatt Uruguay Round - a prediction widely voiced by CAP reformers in 1992. Perhaps the most telling message in the report is the need for the EU to prepare for the next round of enlargement to central and eastern Europe. 'The CAP in its present form is not only a complication to the development of free trade with eastern Europe, it would also be a source of great difficulty to any eventual attempt by the EU to honour its commitment to take the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland into membership.' So far, the commission has approached the relation between the CAP and enlargement with great care. Earlier this year, another independent study chaired by Mr Henri Nallet, a former French farm minister, and Mr Adrian van Stolk, a Dutch authority on trade and agriculture, proposed setting up a new system to help support stable farm prices in eastern Europe at near world price levels. It warned that falling prices would lead to a dangerous lack of investment and access to credit. Some officials and diplomats in Brussels believe that the approach of the CAP's extension eastwards is merely postponing the hard decisions and storing up political trouble. Hence the need for what one eastern European diplomat calls a 'Copernican revolution' - a radical rethink of the principles and operation of the policy. This week's report will appear in the next issue of European Economy, the commission's economics journal. Whatever its future, it has at least started the ball rolling.</p>

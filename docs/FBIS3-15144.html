			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tartu, Estonia, Mar 02, BNS -- The relations  between Estonia and Russia are likely to become even more  strained, since nothing good can be expected from the present  make-up of the Russian parliament, Vello Saatpalu, head of the  parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission, said at a press  conference in Tartu today.    Saatpalu said he would have been surprised if Russia had  stuck to its earlier promise to withdraw the troops from Estonia  by Aug. 31.    "I'm aware that nobody can come up with solutions to the  problems of the troop withdrawal," he said.    Commenting on the debates about the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty,  Saatpalu said he doesn't know any force "that would make Russia  recognize the validity of the treaty."    "Estonia has two options to get back five percent of its  territory: it can either declare war on Russia or seek out  political forces that would make clear to Russia the advantages  of returning Estonian lands it currently holds," Saatpalu said.    The commission chairman sees two possible solutions also to  the problem of Russian military pensioners: they can be either  deported or convinced of the profitability of returning to  Russia. Saatpalu considers it unlikely, however, that any of  the non-Estonians will voluntarily leave Estonia.    "It may be different if they get paid for it," he said.    Saatpalu voiced his conviction that Russia will not achieve  its objectives in issues related to the pensioned military.    "Since Estonian laws stipulate that they must leave, any  compromises on this issue are ruled out," he maintained.    Saatpalu announced that members of the foreign affairs  commissions of the Russian State Duma and the Estonian  parliament will get together in the first half of the year.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLS HIMSELF AFTER SHOOTING HIS EX-WIFE IN QUARREL  </P> <P> A 61-year-old man shot and killed himself after wounding his ex-wife wife  during what police said was a domestic quarrel.  </P> <P> Reza Rostami was found dead in a back entryway of his home in the 4700 block of  Winvale Avenue on Saturday afternoon with a single gunshot wound to the head.  </P> <P> His ex-wife, Tina Rostami, 40, was listed in good condition at Western Medical  Center-Santa Ana with a gunshot wound to the lower abdomen.  </P> <P> Police, who were called to the home about 12:20 p.m. Saturday, said the ex-wife  had dropped by Reza Rostami's home, and shortly after her arrival the quarrel  began.  </P> <P> Police investigator Pete Linton said Reza Rostami then pulled a handgun and  shot Tina Rostami while she was in the kitchen. He said the man retreated to  the rear of the house where he turned the gun on himself.  </P> <P> "She (the ex-wife) came over, and they got cranked up over something," Linton  said. "The matter just boiled over. It's very unfortunate. It's something that  could happen to a lot of people at any time."  </P> <P> Linton said police were still trying to determine what started the quarrel.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gillian Tett article: "CBI President Pours Scorn on </F> Brussels"]    [Text] The out-going president of the Confederation of the  British Industry [CBI] yesterday delivered a blistering attack  on the European Commission, claiming that Brussels was hampering  UK business interests by excessive regulation and out-dated  "50's-style" policies.    In a clarion call to the UK Eurosceptics, Sir Michael Angus,  who is chairman of Whitbread, accused the Commission of ignoring  the views of European businessmen, and called on the UK  government to "take up the cudgels" of industry.    "Doubts have once again begun to set in as to whether the  Community is capable of adopting an agenda that makes a positive  contribution to the ability of businesses to face intense global  pressures," he said.    If European legislators introduced any more anticompetitive  initiatives they should simply "go into a dark room, lie down,  and keep taking the tablets," he said at the CBI's annual dinner.    The unusually provocative speech, which marks the swan-song  of Sir Michael's two-year term as CBI president, cited five main  areas where the Commission had apparently failed to listen to  business views.    The first was the white paper on competitiveness and growth,  drawn up by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. This had  been given a "disappointingly thin" follow-up. But when he had  raised these criticisms with Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs  commissioner, he had been shocked by Mr Flynn's "outdated" focus  on industrial relations.    The second target was the green paper on social policy,  which  was accused of paying too little attention on the need to get  Europe's 20 million unemployed back to work.    The Commission's attempts to introduce the directive on  employee information and consultation provided another bone of  contention. The directive would erode the competitiveness of  European companies and leave U.S. businessmen "chortling."    Fourth, the proliferation of anticompetitive state aids was  undermining the European industry, Sir Michael said. He accused  the Commission of undermining competitive policy in areas where  the UK was strongest -- civil aviation, steel,  telecommunications and energy.    Finally, Sir Michael concluded, the Commission was failing  to  get to grips with its own spending policy, producing a "dismal  catalogue of fraud and waste."</p>

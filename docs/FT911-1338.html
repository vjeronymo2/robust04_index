			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Power surge on the Parana river - The uncertain economics of the huge Itaipu hydro-electric project, which has just been completed on the Brazil-Paraguay border The stone that sings' is the English translation of the romantic Indian name for the world's largest hydro-electric dam. Itaipu, a joint project between Brazil and Paraguay on the rushing Parana river which borders the two countries, was completed yesterday, reaching its full potential of 12.6m kW. Begun in 1974, Itaipu, more than any other single project, symbolises the grandiose designs of Latin America's military dictators of the 1970s and the far-off days when Brazil's economy grew 10 per cent a year and foreign banks fell over themselves to provide finance regardless of ecological concerns. Its name notwithstanding, Itaipu does not sing but roar as 32,000 cubic metres of water a second crash through the spillway, raising clouds of mist. Inside the power house, each of the 18 turbines is large enough to house a small symphony orchestra, and between them they will provide up to 35 per cent of Brazil's electricity. 'This is the work of the century,' says Mr Fernando Ferreira, president of Itaipu Binacional, the company set up in 1973 to build it. According to Mr Ferreira, 12.6m cu m of concrete went into Itaipu's construction - 15 times more than in the Channel tunnel - and enough to construct all the buildings for a city of 600,000. Just as staggering are the costs. Instead of the projected Dollars 2bn, 17 years on Itaipu has so far cost Dollars 18.3bn, making it the world's most expensive dam. 'These figures are misleading,' says Mr Ferreira. 'Of this total only Dollars 9.5bn was direct investment, the rest is financial costs. Investment costs rose because of an overvalued cruzeiro and having to provide local infrastructure for employees which at the peak of construction numbered 40,000.' Of Itaipu's Dollars 16.9bn debt, Dollars 7.4bn is with foreign commercial banks and a further Dollars 1.1bn with Brazilian banks. The remaining Dollars 8.4bn is with Eletrobras, Brazil's state electricity company, the country's largest foreign debtor. Herein lies the real story. Remarkably, for a long-term project of such scale with only Dollars 100m capital, much of the financing came from commercial banks in the form of high-interest loans with short-term maturities of six or seven years. There was no financing from international institutions in the construction phase and only more recently in the transmission phase did the Inter-American Development Bank offer two loans. 'We were never approached,' says Mr David Atkinson, Brazilian representative of the Inter-American Development Bank. 'Ten years ago Brazil preferred to go with commercial institutions; it was a matter of national pride.' Nor was there any shortage of banks offering money. Citibank, Deutschebank, Bank of Tokyo, Bank of Paris and J P Morgan all came forward. Mr Joel Korn, president of the Bank of America in Brazil which led a consortium of foreign banks, says: 'Given its long-term nature this project should have been financed through co-financing with multilateral institutions. But the banks never treated this as a development project. It was seen as a sovereign risk transaction, decision-making driven by the republic's guarantee rather than the project's revenue-generating possibilities. Seen in this context it becomes a lot easier to understand Brazil's Dollars 63bn commercial bank debt - the developing world's largest. In the debt-led growth days of the 1970s Itaipu was one in a series of often wasteful giant infrastructure projects. Brazilian officials argue that at least they have something to show for their debt burden, unlike neighbouring Argentina where much of the borrowings found their way into the pockets of generals. Mr Marcos Azambuja, director-general of Brazil's Foreign Office, explains: 'We don't have the guilt of other debtor countries. Most of the money went to projects people can see.' That is not to say that money did not go astray in the building of Itaipu. 'Itaipu became a byword of easy pickings,' says one energy consultant, adding: 'Brazil's energy sector has long been run as a source of political patronage rather than as a business.' Ironically, as Itaipu's completion was celebrated yesterday in a ceremony attended by the Brazilian and Paraguayan presidents, the company was facing financial crisis. Hit by Brazil's austerity programme, its customers, including the electricity distributors Eletrosul and Furnas, have not been paying their bills, and, according to Mr Ferreira, the company is now owed Dollars 700m. Mr Ferreira admits that one problem is Brazil's low energy tariffs which the World Bank has been criticising for years. Even though recent rises pushed the tariffs to Dollars 45 or Dollars 50 per MWh, these numbers are below the bank's recommended Dollars 70. The tariffs are also unfairly weighted towards the distributor (Itaipu, for example, gets only Dollars 18.75). As a result, Itaipu cannot pay its bills. Of the Dollars 2.4bn revenue it should earn this year, 80 per cent is marked for debt servicing, 10 per cent for operating costs and 10 per cent for royalties to the two governments for use of the river. The Itaipu treaty signed between Brazil and Paraguay in 1973 entitles each to 50 per cent of the energy. Any not used must be offered to the other at preferential rates. Paraguay uses only 1.8 per cent of the electricity generated, or less than half the output of one turbine. It sells the rest to Brazil. Absurdly, however, it insisted that its nine turbines produce electricity compatible with the Paraguayan grid which operates on a 50Hz frequency. This then is converted at extra cost for the Brazilian market to 60Hz frequency. But owed Dollars 84m by Itaipu, Paraguayan demands are mounting for a revision of the treaty to allow it to sell its share to a third party, such as Argentina, which uses 50Hz. Negotiations with Argentina were one of the project's big initial difficulties. Argentina lies downstream and claimed the dam would slow the river's flow. 'Itaipu was a feat of diplomatic engineering,' said Mr Fernando Reis, head of the Americas department in Brazil's Foreign Office. Some Brazilian officials favour an integrated energy system between the three countries as part of the Southern Cone Common Market, formed in March with the aim of establishing a free-trade zone between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. According to Mr Alan Poole, an independent energy adviser, linking up with Argentina's thermal power system would provide a safeguard in dry years for Brazil, whose energy is 96 per cent hydro. He says that relying so much on one source in the form of Itaipu is risky. But Mr Ferreira protests: 'Just as all Britain's energy resources happen to be in the North Sea, ours happen to be in the Parana river.' Yet since Itaipu was built Brazil's rate of economic growth decreased rapidly, reducing the need for such a large project. In October 1984, when the first two turbines started functioning, energy consumption had grown by 11 per cent in the first nine months. Last year, by contrast, the economy contracted by 4.6 per cent. But Mr Ferreira insists: 'Without Itaipu today we would be facing blackouts.' He claims that despite the explosion of costs the dam is still a viable proposition. 'The energy produced is cheap - only Dollars 700 per installed kilowatt. Even including debt servicing it comes to Dollars 1,500 which is a competitive price.' He adds: 'When its debts are paid in 2023 we will have a dam generating Dollars 1bn a year for each partner.' He admits, however, that to build a dam that size today would be impossible both for financial and ecological reasons such as the high cost of resettling the 40,000 people whose lands were flooded. Facing his desk in the company's directorate in Curitiba, some 350km south-west of Sao Paulo, is an oil painting of Sete Quedas, one of the world's highest waterfalls which was destroyed during Itaipu's construction. Ecologists only realised the danger in 1982 when it was too late and the falls were lost. As for the banks, these days they are only too aware of the financial dangers.</p>

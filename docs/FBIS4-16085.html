			<p>BFN     [Text] "The government concluded a treaty on the  unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems in  violation of the Constitution," stated People's Deputy  Alyaksandr Lukashenka during a news conference on 13 April.  "They will soon raise a question about the Supreme Soviet  changing the basic law. However, they should be dismissed from  their posts for violating the Constitution."    A. Lukashenka is sure that the amendments to the  Constitution, stemming from the just-signed treaty, will not be  adopted by the Supreme Soviet. This will give ground for the  government to blame parliament for being unwilling to cooperate  in the process of integration between Russia and Belarus. In  his opinion, the document signed on 12 April is (?worse) than  that signed in September 1993. First of all, this document does  not resolve the primary issue -- common prices for energy  resources in both countries. "Such a ruble zone is devoid of  all sense, because Belarusian goods on the Russian market will  not be competitive due to their much higher prices," Lukashenka  noted. In his opinion, the signing of the treaty on the  unification of the monetary systems will somewhat add to  Kebich's chances of winning the presidential elections, but  there is still enough time for people "to sober up and see who  is who."    Touching upon the upcoming presidential elections,  Lukashenka  stated that recently "a pressure on those supporting Lukashenka  has begun." This pressure is exerted "primarily by the  government and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb."  Alyaksandr Lukashenka reported that the group supporting him  today numbers some 1,000 people; the majority of them are young  people, veterans of the Afghan war, and representatives of  working collectives.</p>

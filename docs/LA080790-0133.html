			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STORMS LIGHT SUMMER SKY AND A RASH OF BRUSH FIRES  </P> <P> The electrical storms that crackled through parts of California over the  weekend staged pre-dawn and evening return engagements Monday, with more  predicted, and left dozens of brush fires in their wake.  </P> <P> Officials said lightning caused more than 100 brush fires to hopscotch through  eight national forests in the state. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management  recorded almost 9,000 separate lightning strikes between Bishop and the Mexican  border.  </P> <P> Rainfall from the storms ranged from 0.11 of an inch at San Juan Capistrano to  only a trace at most other locations.  </P> <P> More thunder and lightning storms formed in the coastal mountains Monday  evening, following winds from the east and southeast, said Steve Burback,  meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> "There will be a repeat pattern day after day, until drier air comes in from  southwestern winds," he added. "It will probably stay that way for the next  three to five days."  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Mountains and foothill communities were the scene of most of  the action Monday night, with spectacular lightning displays, numerous small  related brush fires and brief power outages.  </P> <P> And thunder reverberated eerily through the high-rises in downtown Los Angeles  late into the night as the storms moved to the west.  </P> <P> Most of the fires reported during the day were small, including five in Angeles  National Forest. They were either quickly controlled or not considered  threatening, fire officials said.  </P> <P> A San Bernardino National Forest spokeswoman described fires there as "spot  fires, a bush here, a tree there, or a little snag of grass."  </P> <P> The various small blazes included four in San Bernardino National Forest, 40 in  Stanislaus National Forest east of Sonora and 35 in Sierra National Forest east  of Fresno.  </P> <P> But two fires in Kern County's Sequoia National Forest were still out of  control late Monday and had consumed a combined 1,620 acres. Six bulldozers,  three helicopters and 600 firefighters were battling the flames.  </P> <P> The blazes were burning in separate areas northwest of Kernville but were  expected to merge into one large fire, forest information officer Lindsay  Maierhofer said. Flames advanced slowly on the small community of Wofford  Heights, located between Kernville and Lake Isabella, Monday evening, bringing  a call for a voluntary evacuation of residents as a precaution, but a fire  spokesman said, "There is no immediate threat to the town."  </P> <P> A third lightning-caused fire had consumed 10 acres by late Monday, Maierhofer  added.  </P> <P> In Stanislaus National Forest, Assistant Fire Management Officer Gary Biehl  said none of the fires had burned more than three acres and most had fire crews  on the scene.  </P> <P> "We're bringing additional resources in in case the storms recur," he added,  "and as of now we are guardedly optimistic."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, two fires started in Cleveland National Forest. One burned  about two acres and was put out Monday. Another on the Viejas Indian  Reservation was still going Monday night after scorching more than 150 acres.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Land Management reported three fires, none exceeding six acres  and all listed as controlled Monday, said Dick Franklin, district fire  management officer. One was near Mojave in the Tehachapis and two in Yucca  Valley.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles Basin, a lightning-caused brush fire consumed about seven  acres in Rancho Palos Verdes. The pre-dawn storm that caused it also created an  unscheduled sound and light show for many in the area.  </P> <P> Dorothy Howlett of the Palos Verdes Peninsula said she and her husband were  awakened by the storm shortly after 4 a.m.  </P> <P> They walked onto their balcony to watch the lighting streak back and forth  across the sky above the ocean. "It was very exciting, and so bright I felt I  had to put sunglasses on," she said.  </P> <P> The couple saw the small brush fire start "as a circle that got bigger and  bigger," Howlett said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Fire Department said the blaze at Palos Verdes Drive  South and Peppertree Drive in Rancho Palos Verdes was quickly extinguished and  no homes or other structures were threatened.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, lightning strikes ignited four small brush fires in the northern  part of Los Angeles County, but no serious damage resulted.  </P> <P> Lightning set off two small brush fires in a mountainous area north of Granada  Hills, burning about two acres of brush just north of the Sunshine Canyon  Landfill on San Fernando Road shortly before 6 p.m., Los Angeles city fire  officials said. Four water-dropping helicopters and 18 engine companies  extinguished them.  </P> <P> In Newhall, lightning started two fires west of the Golden State Freeway near  Weldon Summit shortly before 6 p.m. They burned about an acre of brush, county  fire officials said. Two water-dropping helicopters and 150 firefighters  extinguished the blazes within two hours.  </P> <P> Lightning strikes also triggered power outages in communities throughout the  San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San Gabriel valleys Monday night.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison said more than 1,000 customers were affected from  Newhall to Glendale and Pasadena, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The Department of Water and Power estimated that 800 customers were in the dark  for a time in Mission Hills and Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Orange County was spared any major storm damage. County fire officials reported  no lightning-related brush fires.  </P> <P> The unexpected storm, however, put on quite a show for some residents.  </P> <P> "It was a very long, enduring storm," said Jeff Miller, a resident of San Juan  Capistrano who has his own weather station at home. "(The lightning) was very  frequent, maybe 30 seconds apart."  </P> <P> Hot, muggy weather continued throughout the region.  </P> <P> The mercury peaked at 89 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center, Anaheim and  Long Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / UK fund managers optimistic about gilts UK fund managers are much more optimistic about gilts following last month's base rate increase according to the latest Smith New Court/Gallup survey of institutional investors. The balance of fund managers looking to increase gilts holdings has jumped to 47 per cent from 4 per cent in September. Smith New Court believes this may reflect the impact of the base rate rise on inflation, although the survey shows little change in expectations. The survey shows Japanese equities returning to favour with the balance of institutions looking to increase their weighting from 21 per cent to 44 per cent. The October balance is similar to that seen in the first half of the year. But fund managers are cautious about the prospects for US and continental European equities. The balance of fund managers looking to reduce exposure has risen to 26 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. UK equities have fallen out of favour slightly, with the balance of those planning to add to holdings slipping from 15 per cent to 7 per cent. Fund managers are slightly less optimistic about the outlook for the UK economy and corporate earnings but still bullish about share prices. Earnings per share are predicted to rise by 15.9 per cent this year but earnings forecasts for 1995 have been cut by almost one percentage point to 12.5 per cent. Among individual sectors, institutions are most positive about pharmaceuticals, engineering and diversified industrials. Among the least favoured are construction, general retailers and - following last week's profits warnings from SG Warburg and Hambros - merchant banks. The net balance looking to increase their cash holdings has fallen to 7 per cent, against 29 per cent in September and 42 per cent in July. Following last month's interest rate rise, fund managers are predicting UK base rates of 6.8 per cent in a year, compared with a 6.4 per cent forecast in the previous survey. But their expectations for gilts yields and inflation are unchanged. They predict inflation of 2.9 per cent at the end of 1994 rising to 3.7 per cent by the end of next year. Average earnings are expected to rise by 4.3 per cent during the next 12 months.</p>

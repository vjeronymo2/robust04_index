			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Guillermo Perry: "Pastrana's Shifts"] </F>   [Text] This week's edition of PORTFOLIO carries an  interview with Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana titled  "`No' to Revaluation." It is surprising, to say the least, that  less than three weeks after launching his program, Dr. Pastrana  has decided to change his position on such a central issue as  how Colombian economic policy should be handled. Indeed, on page  5 of his announcement speech, one reads: "The recent evolution  in the rate of exchange is largely the result of having a more  open economy that has at the same time won the trust of national  and foreign investors." In other words, 20 days ago, Pastrana  defended the revaluation process as something inevitable and  almost appropriate, given the recent influx of capital.    On Monday, for reasons I ignore, he decided to support  Ernesto Samper's position. For more than eight months now, the  Liberal candidate has been explaining that "revaluation is not  the path" for an open economy because it hurts exports and all  activities that compete with foreign products and services. He  has therefore pledged to support a macroeconomic policy that  will keep the real rate of exchange stable. What fate would  await the country on such a delicate issue as exchange policy in  the hands of Andres Pastrana if he changes his mind on the  matter every 20 days?    Nor is this the first time this has happened in the past two  weeks. It is a well-known fact that Ernesto Samper has focused  his program on the generation of an adequate number of  productive jobs. At the international seminar on Liberalization  and Employment sponsored by his campaign and held in Medellin on  28 January, he laid out his employment policy in detail, giving  out the figures on how many jobs would be generated by its  different components: the export plan, agricultural conversion  plan, investment and physical infrastructure programs,  low-income housing and human resources, a program to support  mini- and small businesses, programs to recruit and train  vulnerable groups. According to the numbers, Samper's program  would create 1.5 million new and better jobs over the next four  years, exceeding the goal of 3.5 million new jobs set for the  decade.    In contrast, the jobs issue is not among the seven  priorities  contained in Pastrana's program, priorities publicized profusely  in paid advertisements carried by all the daily newspapers and  the topic of his announcement speech. His platform, which, as  President Gaviria would say, is more of a telephone directory  than a true platform, devotes only two of its 200+ pages to the  problem of employment, contains no overall strategy for handling  it, and offers absolutely no figures whatsoever on the matter.    Bombarded with criticism as the result of such a notorious  omission on an issue so critical to all Colombians, candidate  Pastrana next tried to dispatch the matter by saying that if 1.5  million jobs were created under the Gaviria Administration, he  thinks more could be created over the next four years. In  addition to being superficial, the argument contains one tiny  flaw: Even the most optimistic calculations estimate that fewer  than a million jobs have been generated over the past four  years. Pastrana's lack of seriousness about and commitment to  the issue of employment is more than obvious.    The third example of the same approach is the agricultural  sector. In his announcement speech, candidate Pastrana goes  after the subsidies and protection for the agricultural sector  that are part of Samper's Agricultural Conversion Plan. Pastrana  said textually on the day he announced that "we shall remove the  barriers preventing the agricultural sector from joining the  commercial world." "I am telling you that the solution to the  crisis does not lie in trying to compete by granting equal  subsidies" (equal to those extended by other countries) and that  "our only path is to achieve greater efficiency" (in order to  overcome the agricultural crisis). In recent days, he has  changed that position in public speeches, offering all manner of  support to the rural world. Pastrana's position on agriculture  apparently depends on whether he is speaking at the Bogota  Convention Center or in a town square!    The last and most incredible change in position is on the  Bogota Metro [subway]. After saying "No" to the Metro in two  speeches and opposing Samper's proposal, on the television  program "Panorama" broadcast on 28 February, he said with  particular cheekiness that he would build the Metro in Bogota.  He added that he proposed to do so when he was mayor, even  though all Bogota residents recall that he killed the Metro when  the Barco Administration and Mayor Sanchez had practically  awarded the contracts. By the same standard that you judge, you  shall be judged!    When the Samper campaign urged candidate Pastrana to take  the  high road during the campaign and engage in a debate based on  ideas, no one ever imagined facing a chameleon-like strategy  that changes color to blend with the background: Prussian blue  when speaking to the Conservative Convention and when writing to  Alvaro Gomez on their many points of ideological agreement;  pinkish when sensing a sprinkling of Liberals in the audience.    Whether it be on the revaluation, employment, agricultural  policy, or the Metro, the country at least knows what to expect  from Andres Pastrana: "In all likelihood, who knows?" as he  himself said in answer to a question on a different issue put to  him by the periodical CAMBIO 16 two weeks ago.</p>

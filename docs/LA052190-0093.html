			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> TEACHERS RATIFY NEW PACT; BITTERNESS TOLD  </P> <P> Settling more than a year of strife-ridden negotiations, unionized teachers in  the Capistrano Unified School District have ratified a new contract but vowed  to increase pressure on the district for better terms next year.  </P> <P> The new one-year contract, ratified by 63% of 908 members of the Capistrano  Unified Educators Assn. who voted last week, will give teachers a retroactive  pay increase of 7% for the first four months of the current school year and an  additional 0.5% for the remainder of the school year.  </P> <P> Union president Ric Stephenson said that although the contract was approved,  bitterness remains with most teachers, who have demonstrated several times in  past months.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say that it was an overwhelming endorsement," Stephenson said of  the ratification vote. He said the votes against ratification " . . .  represented the highest disapproved vote in our history and does demonstrate a  significant degree of disaffection."  </P> <P> Stephenson said a majority of union members remained dissatisfied with the pay  increase, a discipline clause and health benefits.  </P> <P> With less than two months before the new contract expires, Stephenson said a  union contract committee will meet on Monday to discuss strategy for the next  round of talks.  </P> <P> Noting the length of time it took to reach an agreement, Stephenson said: "We  will not engage in the same process again next year. It was way too drawn out  and too draining on the emotional and physical resources of the teachers."  </P> <P> The school board is scheduled to vote on the ratified contract at its June 4  meeting, and retroactive checks should be ready for mailing by June 29,  Stephenson said.

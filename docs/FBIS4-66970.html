			<p>Drug   Seizures   <F P=102> PA2804235894 Paris AFP in Spanish 1136 GMT 26 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> PA2804235894 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lidia Hunter] </F>   [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Although political violence  decreased after the war ended four years ago, Nicaragua has  registered an increase in common crimes to the point that even  policemen are assaulted by criminals, National Police Chief  Fernando Caldera admitted today. "Violent crimes" are what  worry the police most because although there has been a decrease  in the political violence generated by the war, the crime rate  is swelling, Caldera stressed to AFP.    According to the officer, the growing crime rate is a result  of "political violence, economic crisis, and the culture of  violence" so entrenched in this country, which was at war  throughout the entire past decade. The war between the contras  and Sandinists left more than 50,000 victims, including dead,  injured, crippled, as well as material losses amounting to the  millions across the entire country.    According to a study carried out by the National Police, the  public order situation changed "substantially" in 1990, both in  magnitude and type, to include takeover of lands and  institutions and public demonstrations and protests over  government policies.    In 1990, when Violeta de Chamorro assumed control of the  government, replacing the Sandinists and ending the war, there  were 28,005 crimes. That number increased to 30,896 in 1991,  35,924 in 1992, and 42,394 in 1993. In 1990, the police  dismantled 125 criminal bands. However, in 1991 they dismantled  189; in 1992, 288; and in 1993, 363. In addition to the  criminals in the cities, there are 500 armed men in the  mountains who ravage the peasant population. In the first three  months of 1994, the police have reported dismantling 98 bands; a  rate 31 percent higher than last year. During those four years,  authorities solved 3,320 crimes and arrested a total of 3,946  criminals, many who are repeat offenders.    Furthermore, in 1990, among other reasons because controls  were reduced, drug crimes increased a substantial 120 percent,  according to the National Police. In 1991, authorities seized  730 kg of cocaine, 155 kg in 1992, 97 kg in 1993, and up to now  in 1994, 1,100 kg of the drug have been seized.    Murders have also increased since 1990 when 202 people were  slain. In 1991, the number was 259; in 1992, 325; and in 1993,  331.</p>

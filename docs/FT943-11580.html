			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / The FT Interview: Old title, modern job - Eugene Ludwig On the face of it, Mr Eugene Ludwig does not have too much to worry about. As a leading US bank supervisor - he oversees the health of 3,700 banks with 60 per cent of total US banking assets as Comptroller of the Currency - Mr Ludwig has to protect an industry in remarkably fine fettle. After recovering from reckless lending and over-expansion in the 1980s, the country's 13,000 banks have more capital than in decades. This gives them a cushion in case they should repeat such mistakes. But it has not stopped Mr Ludwig warning of the new array of dangers they face. Mr Ludwig was among the first to talk of risks facing banks such as JP Morgan and Bankers Trust that dominate trading in derivatives - complex instruments whose value is based in part on that of an underlying financial market. It has brought him an unusually high profile for a Comptroller of the Currency, an influential but traditionally low-profile and little-understood job. He was appointed by the president in April last year partly because of his experience as a lawyer dealing in bank regulatory issues, and partly for a more obvious reason: having met Bill Clinton as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford in the late 1960s, he took a law degree at Yale with both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr Ludwig's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has to fight for recognition partly because there are three other bodies involved in US bank supervision - the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Treasury wants to replace this supervisory web with a single Federal Banking Commission. It has run into opposition from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who wants to preserve separate powers for the Fed. The US debate is unfolding as the future of banking supervision is being called into question. As banks switch towards securities trading and underwriting rather than lending, some question whether supervisors can keep up. Mr Greenspan has talked of banks having to self-regulate trading activities because of the growing complexity of financial markets. This issue has particular force in the US. Teams of examiners from the Office of the Comptroller work full-time in the largest banks, and their approach has been criticised as bureaucratic and over-prescriptive. Mr Ludwig disagrees. 'In the early 1980s, we saw the view that off-site and minimalist supervision was the best way to ensure growth, and the pendulum swung in that direction. I would not say it caused the problems of banking in the late 1980s, but it certainly exacerbated them,' he says. Nonetheless, his office has been trying to devise separate approaches for small community banks, and the large banks that operate sophisticated trading operations. The examiners will remain on-site at the latter, but will examine management controls and technology, not individual loans. He supports the idea mooted by the Basle Committee of banking supervisors from the Group of Ten leading industrial nations, that banks should use their computer models to allocate capital to cover the risks of trading securities and foreign exchange. 'We are recognising the modern world, and taking advantage of a private sector capability.' But he is sensitive to the criticism that supervisors may be letting banks off lightly: 'This can be misunderstood, as if banks are inventing their own capital regime.' Instead, he says that banking supervisors worldwide will be 'serious' about the criteria for approving the computer models. As for US banks, Mr Ludwig is not entirely sanguine despite their strong capital and the likelihood that they will record large earnings this year. One reason is the danger that banks will - as he puts it - 'take bigger and bigger risks' to maintain their returns on ever-increasing levels of capital. A second concern is the long-term decline in the banking industry - in terms of financial assets - as companies have turned to bond and equity markets for capital rather than bank loans, while individuals have saved through mutual funds. Between 1980 and 1990, banks' share of financial assets dropped from 37 to 32 per cent. Mr Ludwig says it is not his job to worry about the banks' falling share of assets. 'We are not cheerleaders for the industry. We are responsible for maintaining its soundness,' he says. But he argues that  - provided they do not take excessive risks - banks should be allowed to diversify into selling other financial products. Further, Mr Ludwig says the fall in assets presents a false picture, because banks have concentrated on activities such as trading securities, which do not expand balance sheets. 'Banks have very successfully generated fees. The jury is out on whether banking is really in decline,' he says. A more pressing question is the supervision of derivatives, an activity which has expanded to the point where it forms a substantial part of the business of some large OCC-supervised banks. This growth in itself is a warning signal, according to Mr Ludwig. 'Like any financial activity in its infancy, or childhood, or maybe young adolescence, it must be subject to a large degree of serious supervision,' he says. But in practice, he says he has been 'rather impressed by the risk management systems' of the large dealers of derivatives. Nor is he worried that his staff will be baffled by the complexity of pricing derivatives portfolios. The OCC has recruited a number of derivatives specialists from banks - Mr Douglas Harris, the senior deputy comptroller for capital markets, is a former employee of JP Morgan. 'We have the supervisory talent to understand what banks are doing,' he says. The talent could be stretched if the dozen banks and securities firms which dominate derivatives lost market share to other banks. In the short term, he believes the high costs of entry are likely to prevent this. A second pressing question for the OCC - founded by Abraham Lincoln to accompany the formation of nationally chartered banks - is whether it will continue to exist. Mr Ludwig is a firm believer that the time for a single banking supervisor - such as a Federal Banking Commission - is long over-due. 'Britain gets along quite well with one bank supervisor, so what is the reason to have four?' he asks. Mr Ludwig argues that the system creates uncertainty and excessive costs for the banks. 'Banks deal in real time, but it can take them years to get answers from supervisors,' he says. In one case, a compromise deal between supervisors led to the doubling of reporting requirements on banks. If Mr Ludwig has his way in reforming the structure of US bank regulation, the antiquated title of Comptroller of the Currency may soon be consigned to history. It will happen in an era of immense change for banking supervision, not only within the US, but across global financial markets.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: GIFTED CLASSES NOT FOR SNOBS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Our 8-year-old daughter is an exceptionally gifted child and  the authorities at her school suggest that she be transferred to a different  class for especially bright youngsters. They feel that she'd do better and,  eventually, be happier in this class designed for the gifted. She resents this  suggestion and says she doesn't like having to be away from her friends. My  wife isn't really in favor of the move either because she's afraid it will turn  our child into a snob. -- P.R.  </P> <P> DEAR P.R.: This is a decision that obviously needs thought. However, I suspect  that your daughter would adjust and make new friends quickly. Research shows  that children in gifted classes are usually well-rounded in social skills and  don't become "snobs" if their parents don't contribute to the feeling that  their children are special and better than other children. In other words, if a  child becomes a snob, it's the fault of the parents, rather than the school.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Barbara Kerr, the associate director of the Belin National  Center for Gifted Education at the University of Iowa, very bright children who  are forced to remain in a regular classroom throughout their education are more  likely to become contemptuous of people of average intelligence than those in  special schools or special classes. They tend to become impatient and think  that other kids really aren't trying.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband threatens to disown our 19-year-old son because  he wants to drop out of college to travel and "see the world." My husband wants  him to follow his career in medicine, and our son says he'd rather "die than be  a doctor." What can I do to heal these wounds between father and son? I don't  think it's right to cut the boy off with nothing. -- J.V.T.  </P> <P> Dear J.V.T.: Your husband is being unfair in demanding that this boy follow in  his profession. Your son has a right to make his own choices and he should be  encouraged to develop his own potential. Parents who view their youngsters only  as an extension of themselves and who try to relive their lives through them  are doing their offspring a great injustice. This kind of parental selfishness  produces rebellion or complacency and, later, resentment in the child.  </P> <P> College isn't right for every youngster. Your son might profit from taking a  year off from studies. It might help him to go to work. This might teach him  how the real world functions and after a while, he might begin to realize the  benefits of studying and furthering his education.  </P> <P> I believe it would be helpful if you could talk with your husband about his  expectations for his son and stress that the boy needs to be respected and  loved as a separate individual. Also, it would be beneficial if you could  encourage your son to talk with faculty members or advisers at his school.  </P></p>

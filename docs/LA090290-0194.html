			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: RESEARCH GRANTS US ALL FAVORS  </P> <P> The record $78 million in research grants and contracts brought home by UC  Irvine scientists in the last year is a hefty sum. With it, researchers are  studying everything from quarks and gluons to the behavior of aged rats to  carbon compounds distributed in the troposphere.  </P> <P> Some might question the value of such esoteric inquiries in the face of myriad  budget crises threatening Orange County schools and programs for the indigent,  sick and homeless. UCI physics professor emeritus Frederick Reines doesn't even  wait to be asked.  </P> <P> "What's in it for us? I submit that basic research is the linchpin on which all  of modern society is built," said the 72-year-old professor, whose co-discovery  of neutrinos in the 1950s is frequently mentioned by fellow scientists as  deserving of a Nobel prize.  </P> <P> "Every time we make use of technology, where did it come from? It came from  fundamental research," Reines said.  </P> <P> And for vote-counting politicians who would waffle on the need for megabucks  research on super colliders or peering into distant galaxies, he recalls  Michael Faraday's remark to a government minister who asked the practical use  of the British scientist's latest discovery: "Oh that? Why, someday you may tax  it."  </P> <P> Spending dollars at home instead of on pie-in-the-sky research is a perennial  argument that gains steam in tough times.  </P> <P> Friends of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have produced  public service announcements to counter such notions. The television spots  remind the public that the nation's multibillion-dollar space program has led  to beneficial offshoots such as miniature computers, heat-resistant materials,  even the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) being uh, enjoyed, by the U.S. soldiers now  hunkered in the Saudi Arabian dunes.  </P> <P> For Paul Sypherd, UCI's vice chancellor for research, basic research is a "pool  of knowledge" about the human species and the universe around it. And it is  from that pool that information is taken and developed into technologies that  have transformed society.  </P> <P> "Take Newton's laws of thermodynamics, also called Newton's law of gravity,"  Sypherd said. "These are very basic physical observations about how the  universe works and the relationships between bodies in that universe.  </P> <P> "There was no application of these thoughts in Newton's time; it was basic  research," he said. "But just imagine trying to put together the American space  program without Newton's law that for every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction -- which is the basis of jet propulsion and rocketry."  </P> <P> The most important biological discovery of the century has been cracking the  mystery of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic code within living things.  </P> <P> "Virtually all of modern biology is founded on that discovery," Sypherd said.  Everything from understanding how the (AIDS) virus produces AIDS to the  development of better drugs, the treatment of diabetes, even understanding  Alzheimer's disease."  </P> <P> All of it sprang from the most fundamental research by British biophysicist  Francis H.C. Crick and American biologist James Watson at Cambridge  University's Strangeways Research Laboratory in the early 1950s.  </P> <P> "These people were doing it because it was their job as natural scientists,"  Sypherd said.  </P> <P> Another example is the laser, for which Albert Einstein wrote the first  equation early this century. It would be decades before practical uses emerged.  </P> <P> "You can hardly turn two degrees today without seeing lasers and their  applications," Reines said. "Now, it's a several-billion-dollar-a-year  industry."  </P> <P> Basic research, as far as Reines is concerned, is "one of the best investments  society can make. . . ."  </P> <P> "It gives us choices which are beyond our wildest expectations. It does not  necessarily make problems simpler. But it gives one a range of possibilities. .  . . It's the sure way to expand the horizon of the country and the world. It's  what's for tomorrow."  </P> <P> Beyond it all, there is a deep drive within human beings when they look up at  the stars to want to understand their universe, the physicist said.  </P> <P> "That's what makes life worth living."  </P></p>

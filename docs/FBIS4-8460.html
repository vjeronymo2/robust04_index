			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- North Atlantic  Assembly (NAA) Chairman Loic Bouvard told journalists today that  the West considered Slovakia a fully-qualified part of a  democratic Europe and saw no reason to prevent Slovakia from  joining NATO.    Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier who  arrived  in Bratislava today at the invitation of Slovak Parliament  Chairman Ivan Gasparovic met with Slovak President Michal Kovac  and Premier Jozef Moravcik to discuss the security situation in  Europe.    Bouvard said that the Partnership for Peace initiative was  not a universal solution but a practical and pragmatic model  which provides Central and East European countries with the  possibility of joining NATO in the long-term.    Cortier said that World War Two had showed that a security  vacuum in Central Europe was a weak link in European security.    Bouvard said that Russia's relationship towards NATO should  be special given its position in Europe. It was not, however,  acceptable for the entry of individual countries into NATO be  decided in Moscow, he added.    Tomorrow NAA representatives will take part in a seminar on  security in Central Europe in Tatranska Lomnica, east Slovakia.  Gasparovic and Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis are to  deliver speeches at the seminar.</p>

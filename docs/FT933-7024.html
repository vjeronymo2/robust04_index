			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: F&amp;C to launch India fund for mid-sized companies FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Management, one of the first fund management groups to give investors access to the emerging markets in Latin America in the late 1980s, is about to launch an open-ended fund investing in medium-sized Indian companies. India is widely regarded as the emerging market of the 1990s, following the country's introduction of free market reforms. Some Dollars 1bn is already invested in Indian equities through existing closed-end funds. F&amp;C hopes that its fund, Indian Investment Company Sicav, will attract between Dollars 50m and Dollars 100m during its launch period, which runs from September 6 to October 1. Mr Sanjit Talukdar, Indico's fund manager, said the fund provided an opportunity to invest in India's medium-sized companies which, he believed, were greatly undervalued. Trading in the shares of medium-sized companies has become much more liquid in the past three years when turnover in the so-called 'B' shares has risen from 15 per cent to 27 per cent of daily turnover which is now Dollars 100m. Mr Talukdar said Indico was the first fund to be managed offshore and to employ an adviser from the private sector. 'This gives us freedom of activity from local advisers,' Mr Talukdar said. Until the introduction of new legislation last September, the Indian ministry of finance only gave approval for open-ended funds which were administered by India's public-sector banks.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as Merck issues profits warning Wall Street US EQUITIES gave up slim early gains to move lower yesterday afternoon following a renewed sell-off in drug stocks on news that Merck, the pharmaceuticals group, planned to cut jobs because of a slowdown in earnings growth, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Market volatility was reflected by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 3,445.38, down 16.48. It rose more than 10 points in morning trading before program-selling had its affect, sending the index down more than 31 points in afternoon trading. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was down 0.62 at 448.14, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.68 at 674.36. Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 274m shares and declines had a slight edge on rises, by 997 to 884. On Tuesday, the Dow had slipped 3.62 to 3,461.86. Merck plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 34 3/4 in very heavy trading, but recovered from its low of the day. The company's announcement that its profits growth would start slowing in the first quarter of this year was released after the market had closed on Tuesday. The news prompted analysts to reduce earnings forecasts for a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Schering-Plough, which lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 and Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 respectively. Other actively-traded drugs stocks included Glaxo Holdings, down Dollars 3/8 at a year-low of Dollars 17 5/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 57 7/8 and Abbott Laboratories, Dollars 7/8 lower at Dollars 23 7/8 . Some cyclical and oil stocks held their own in morning trading, helping to limit the impact of the drug sector selling. International Paper held steady at Dollars 65 1/2 and Exxon firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 1/8 . In the motor industry sector, Ford Motor eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 , General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 7/8 and Chrysler slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 . Ford reported improved mid-March sales for US cars and trucks, but General Motors saw US car sales slide in the same period, although its truck sales showed strong gains. Carnival Cruise Lines plummeted Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 33 1/4 after posting disappointing first quarter net income. Although earnings in the three months rose to 36 cents a share from 33 cents, analysts had expected a stronger performance. IBM tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 51 1/8 amid intensifying concern abut the mainframe computer industry after Amdahl forecast a bleak first quarter reflecting erratic product demand and intense price competition. Pessimism about the outlook for healthcare companies leached into the Nasdaq market, where shares in biotechnology companies lost ground including Amgen, down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 and Chiron, off Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 47 5/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks ended little changed in active trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index rose 4.97 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at 3,603.70. Advancing issues led declines 366 to 319. Volume of 61.55m included two blocks in Royal Bank of Canada totalling almost 3 m shares, and a block of about 1.3m Canadian Imperial Bank shares.</p>

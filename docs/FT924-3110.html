			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian sugar output to fall INDIAN sugar production is expected to fall to 11.5m tonnes in the 1992-93 season, compared to last year's record 13.4m tonnes, following a 20 per cent shortfall in the cane crop, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA). Delayed monsoons in all cane-growing states and the failure of sugar factories to clear cane bills of nearly Rs5bn (Dollars 176m) forced growers to cut the area under the crop from last year's 3.85m hectares. Since the current season has opened with stocks of 4.9m tonnes, total supplies will remain comfortable. The federal government has already sanctioned export of 375,000 tonnes of sugar, but has not yet agreed to create a buffer stock of up to 1m tonnes.</p>

There is a wave of resentment across the Police officials  who  feel not only a threat to their basic functions but also that  they will lose many of their cadre posts. This has already  started creating bad blood and the police sources openly  question the army's ability to deal with an issue as complex as  narcotics.    The government had taken a decision in principle a few  months  back that the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board (PNCB) and  Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) would be merged into one `elite  force.' The new organisation would be given under the army's  command and a Major General would head it. A few days back the  government ordered the implementation of that idea according to  which the PNCB would be merged with the ANTF and a new  department, probably with a new name would be established  through a notification.    The new force will be led by ANTF's Director General Major  General Salahuddin Tirmizi. The PNCB's Chairman Dyas Mohasin  was to be transferred and posted as Additional Secretary,  Interior Division. The ANTF has been given six months to sort  out the complete modalities of the merger. That would deal with  the issue of how to adjust about 700 odd personnel of the PNCB.  The new force would mostly comprise officers from the armed  forces but would also have civilians who have had years of  experience in the fight against drugs.    The decision to let the army take over the operation has not  gone well with the police service. They feel that their basic  functions are now being encroached upon. From the look of it,  it appears that the army and police are in for a tense  relationship as soon as the new force gets underway.    As one senior police official said: "The government has not  done any service to the cause against drugs by minimizing the  role of the police and giving everything under the army's  control which may not be able to perform any better. The police  officials will obviously obey the orders but one thing is sure  that there would be problems as their response would be lukewarm  and that of disdain."    The reasons for this resentment are many. The Police feel  that the functions has been taken away from it when it had  started performing exceptionally well during the past few years.  One police source said that although the drug problem is not  eliminated, but it was not just due to the department's fault.  [sentence as published] It was the indifferent attitude of  governments during the last 15 years, which despite knowing that  this problem is growing into a social cancer, never allocated  enough funds and extended the appropriate legal support to catch  the culprits.    "The police was the only force which remained on top year in  and year out in terms of drug seizures of all kinds. The spread  of the menace was because successive governments lacked the  political will to deal with the problem and that there were  never enough resources to counter those who run a parallel black  economy," said a top police source.

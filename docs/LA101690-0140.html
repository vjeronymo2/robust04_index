			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROOMS WITH A PREP VIEW;  </P> <P> APARTMENT-DWELLERS IN ANAHEIM WATCH GAMES FROM THEIR WINDOWS  </P> <P> It's 6:30 on a Thursday night, and Western High School's Handel Stadium is  slowly coming alive. Cheerleaders giggle and chatter. A marching band honks,  booms and toots. Coaches bark last-minute instructions. The smell of hot,  buttered popcorn wafts through the air.  </P> <P> Although the game won't start for another hour, high school football fan Jim  Hughes is already hyped, scouting the action from his favorite vantage point:  </P> <P> His bedroom window.  </P> <P> Hughes, a 1984 graduate of Western High, lives with his wife in a small,  one-bedroom unit of Westchester Square Apartments, a 424-unit complex bordered  on one side by Handel Stadium's football field.  </P> <P> From their bedroom, parallel to the west end zone, Hughes could almost fall out  of his window and find himself in a goal-line stand.  </P> <P> For some, living a pompon's throw away from a high school football stadium  equals a headache of Super Bowl proportions. The crowds, the lights, the loud  bursts from the band. . . . At Handel Stadium, home field to not one but four  high school teams, game night comes two, sometimes even three nights a week.  </P> <P> Westchester Square manager Jollene Dillanwater says prospective tenants are not  forewarned about the possible noise from the stadium. She said most just make  do.  </P> <P> "Actually, if you can't watch the game (from your window), you go to the game,  because you can't sleep," she said.  </P> <P> Others think it's terrific. Heck, for $525 a month, you're not only getting a  place to live, you're getting a stadium luxury box.  </P> <P> "When we first decided to get married, I said, OK, but only if we get an  apartment up here so I can watch the games," said Hughes, a 25-year-old driver  for an Anaheim courier service.  </P> <P> To this, Dolores Hughes rolls her eyes.  </P> <P> "Jim, we rented the apartment, not the football field," she said dryly.  </P> <P> Hughes doesn't hear her.  </P> <P> "It's really neat," he said excitedly. "You can see everything. You can hear  everything. When they score a touchdown, it's so great, all the cheerleaders  run down jumping for joy, the band plays louder, people are screaming, the  announcers yelling, everyone's going nuts . . . I mean, it's really intense."  </P> <P> Hughes, who on game nights stocks the apartment with pizza and diet soda and  invites over friends, points to his white cat, Snowball, sitting on a  custom-made blue furry window perch designed so she, too, can watch the action  below.  </P> <P> "See, even Snowball gets into it," Hughes said.  </P> <P> There was a time, in fact, when even Western football Coach Jim Howell enjoyed  the view. After he and his wife married in 1965, they rented a first-floor  apartment in the complex and watched the games over their fence. Howell, then a  junior high football coach, had yet to coach a high school game.  </P> <P> Of course, not everyone at Westchester Square is so captivated by the football  games. For instance . . .  </P> <P> In Apartment 21, an upstairs corner unit, John and Susan Harris can see and  hear the goings-on, but they'd rather not. John, a 32-year-old production  manager for a Fullerton electronics firm, is a jazz saxophonist who played in  the marching band while at El Rancho High in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> "As a musician, hearing the bands makes me reminisce," John said. "But it also  makes me remember, as a purist musician, how much I hated marching band. Fight  songs are so boring to me."  </P> <P> True, the theme song from "Bonanza" can wear on you after a while.  </P> <P> In Apartment 18, Terry Hansen, a 36-year-old mechanic, has one of the better  views of the field, but it's hard for him to watch because he's on crutches.  </P> <P> Hansen broke his left leg a few weeks ago playing croquet. Now, while the bands  play on, Hansen plays Nintendo.  </P> <P> Apartment 15 is the home of Laura Espinoza, mother of Anthony Espinoza, 2 1/2.  Anthony loves football, his mother doesn't. Still, she supplies him with a  large spoon and a frying pan so he can play along with the Western band.  </P> <P> Anthony likes the football even better.  </P> <P> "He's hung out that window to watch them play ever since he was 1 1/2 years  old," Laura Espinoza said. "He'd rather watch that football than cartoons."  </P> <P> Said Anthony: "Football! Football! . . . Ka-poom! Ka-poooom!"  </P> <P> Apartment 14 is the home of South Korean natives Tea and Mija Yun.  </P> <P> "My husband likes to watch," Mija said. "I'll watch, but only if I'm bored."  </P> <P> Downstairs, in Apartment 3, Judy Fox and her 16-year-old daughter, Anitra, live  in the shadow of the bleachers where you can hear teen-agers chat all sorts of  chit-chat. The Foxes don't mind.  </P> <P> "I love it," Judy said. "The only thing I don't like is when they clean the  stands at 11:30 at night and make a bunch of noise. That drives me nuts."  </P> <P> The close proximity of their apartment is a big help, though. Anitra is a  member of Western's color guard, and Judy is the team mom.  </P> <P> "Whenever someone's uniform rips or a button pops off, all we have to do is  rush over and have my mom sew it," Anitra said.  </P> <P> Next door, Vera Judge, one of many senior citizens in the complex, said the  noise doesn't bother her too much as long as she keeps herself busy. During a  Magnolia-Western game last Thursday, she and two friends played pinochle.  </P> <P> In the adjacent building, 70-year-old Roger Anderson has a good view of the  field from Apartment 7, but he hasn't been watching the football games lately.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "Because Western hasn't been doing a diddly-damn," he said.  </P></p>

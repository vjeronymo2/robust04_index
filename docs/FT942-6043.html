			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cyclicals top Dax performers despite correction A number of bourses staged intraday recoveries as selling pressure ran out of steam, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was weak again at the outset after a sharp drop in bond prices, but short-covering left the Dax index with a 9.55 gain at 2,127.70; by the end of the post-bourse it had risen another 10 points to an Ibis-indicated 2,137.74. Turnover increased from DM5.1bn to DM6.7bn. The Dax lost 5.3 per cent in May, precisely what it had gained in April, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. It suffered most of all, he said, from weakness in US bonds and the correction in cyclicals from mid-month following a double top in low volume. However, extended weakness in carmakers did not prevent them leading the Dax top performers for the first five months of 1994: BMW, ex- rights, down a net DM7 yesterday at DM820, was up 13.6 per cent this year; and Volkswagen, DM1.50 lower at DM484.50, still 10.1 per cent to the good. The two leaders were ahead by 24.8 and 19.5 per cent respectively after the first four months. The mid-May corollary, a switch into defensive stocks, was ruined for banks by bond market weakness. Bayerische Vereinsbank, Dresdner and Bayernhypo all showed the strain, leading the Dax losers with falls of 21.2 per cent, 19.1 per cent and 18.2 per cent in the five months to May. PARIS remained uneasy, with the CAC-40 index at one point falling to an inter-session low of 2,013.61, before finding fresh support on the opening of Wall Street. The CAC-40 index ended the day down 22.61, or 1 per cent, at 2,029.90, with equities continuing to be pressured by futures. The expiry of the May futures contract yesterday also added an extra dimension to the day's volatility. Turnover improved to FFr4.5bn from Monday's FFr1.6bn. According to Nikko Europe, US investors have been seen recently switching out of cyclicals and into the financial sector. Schneider, off FFr9.40 at FFr390.50, remained beset by uncertainty among investors following the arrest in Belgium last week of its chairman. After the shares had been suspended briefly, the group issued a statement denying any allegations of financial wrongdoing. ZURICH adopted the recent German attitude towards cyclicals, taking profits as pressure on the domestic bond market and from weakness in equities abroad left the SMI index down 20.0 at 2,722.9. Among cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri lost SFr20 at SFr1,260, Georg Fischer SFr30 at SFr1,480 and Sulzer registered SFr28 at SFr928; Alussuise, the metals company which forecast substantial recovery this year after hours, fell with the pack, shedding SFr9 to SFr658. Here, too, the financial sector offered little relief. Among insurers, Winterthur fell SFr22 to SFr690 although it produced a first quarter rise of 9 per cent in premium income, and was bullish about 1994. MILAN recovered from an early fall with the Comit index hovering close to the 720 support level before picking up again on technical buying. The Comit index finished down 4.19 at 731.31. The day's main feature was Mediobanca, up L225 at L15,950 following confirmation that a number of leading executives, including the honorary president Mr Enrico Cuccia, were under investigation in relation to the bank's role in the structuring of Ferruzzi. Observers said that the news had been in the market for some days, which explained the upward movement in the shares. AMSTERDAM also recovered later in the day, having earlier fallen through the 400 level for the first time since December 1993 as the equity market came under renewed pressure from bonds. The AEX index ended off 1.65 at 400.77, having seen a session low of 397.26. One of the day's main features was a Fl 2.30 drop in DSM, the chemicals group, to Fl 134.00 on news that it was buying for an undisclosed figure the outstanding 40 per cent share in Curver Rubbermaid from Rubbermaid of the US that it did not own. Elsewhere KLM retreated a further 90 cents to Fl 51.30 ahead of tomorrow's fourth quarter results. MADRID, yet again, spiced a desolate platter of blue chips with big rises in speculative stocks, Amper and Prima Inmobiliaria, the property company, each rising about 15 per cent - by Pta71 to Pta546, and by Pta30 to Pta232. The general index closed down 3.81 at 327.00 in moderate turnover of Pta25bn. Some brokers were beginning to see danger in the speculators' attachment to secondary issues. STOCKHOLM led the way down in a mostly weak Nordic sector, the Affarsvarlden General index losing 27.10, or 1.8 per cent at 1,479.00. However, COPENHAGEN recovered dramatically after an equally severe intraday decline with the KFX index a token 0.02 higher at 100.95, buyers coming back and an almost euphoric mood in evidence. ATHENS stayed in volatile form, the general index rising 14.77, or 1.75 to 860.10 on buying in the recently embattled construction sector. WARSAW eased in mixed trade, the Wig index falling 182.9, or 1.5 per cent to 12,036.7. Elektrim, the trading company, fell 10 per cent after yesterday's 20 per cent cut in its rights issue price. TEL AVIV dropped again after the central bank indicated a small decline in economic activity, the Mishtanim index closing 7.21, or 3.7 per cent lower at 187.61.

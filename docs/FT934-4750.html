			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Government admits to errors in documents on IRA contacts The British government admitted last night that mistakes were contained in secret documents released on Monday detailing exchanges with Provisional IRA leaders. The admission followed confirmation that Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds will tomorrow make a concerted attempt to bridge differences between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for the province. The meeting will come amid signs of mounting strain in relations. Conceding the errors last night, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, emphasised they were the result of transcription and typing errors and did not alter the sense of the messages. In particular, he said the corrections cast 'no doubt whatsoever' on the authenticity of the original message received from the IRA leadership in February saying the conflict was over. Republican leaders deny such a message was sent. However, the effect of 11 corrections to a document in which the government set out its conditions for beginning talks with Provisional leaders - a version of which was released by the government and Sinn Fein this week - is that the Sinn Fein account is now accepted as essentially correct. The admission, which may further tarnish the government's credibility over Northern Ireland, comes less than a week after it admitted it had been in prolonged contact with the IRA, despite previous denials. Unionist MPs are expected to be pounced on the government's admission in the Commons today. The IRA last night made the claim, denied by Downing Street, that the government had proposed secret talks in March in Scotland or Scandinavia. It said: 'We wish to confirm that . . . the British government made a definitive proposal for full-blown delegate meetings between their representatives and Sinn Fein.' It claimed the government asked for an unannounced suspension of activity to help accommodate the meetings. Last night both London and Dublin were playing down expectations of what the 'working' summit between the two prime ministers would achieve. At least one additional meeting between the two leaders - at next week's European Council in Brussels - might well be needed before a joint communique could be agreed. The two prime ministers will be accompanied tomorrow by senior ministers. The main sticking point is understood to concern Dublin's insistence on including acceptance of the principle of self-determination for the people of all of Ireland in a joint communique. According to officials in Dublin this would imply an all-Ireland referendum on any changes to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, although these would also need majority consent in Ulster. London is understood to be worried that Unionists would find a formulation involving an all-Ireland referendum unacceptable. At Westminster the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee moved a step closer after a group of MPs published recommendations on which parties should be represented.

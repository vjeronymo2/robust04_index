			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: IBM to realign storage arm International Business Machines announced a further realignment of its Dollars 5bn data storage systems division which makes disk drives and other computer storage devices. The company will shift high-volume disk drive assembly and test operations from the US and Germany to lower cost sites in Asia and eastern Europe. The future of a manufacturing operation at Havant, in southern England, is also under review. The moves follow a broad consolidation of data storage operations last year. IBM has been struggling to improve the profitability of its data storage business in the face of a steep decline in revenues. The division's sales were Dollars 5.1bn last year, down from Dollars 6.3bn in 1992 and Dollars 7.2bn in 1991. Analysts estimate that the storage division was only marginally profitable last year. More than 1,100 jobs will be cut in the US during the next 18 months and additional cuts in Germany appear likely. The UK plant, formerly operated by the storage systems division, was last year transformed into an IBM-operated contract manufacturing operation. IBM will establish new assembly operations in Asia, possibly in Thailand where it has an existing disk drive plant. Similarly, in Europe the company is looking for a site in eastern Europe. 'The decision to relocate portions of our disk drive assembly and test manufacturing operations from San Jose (the US headquarters of the storage products division) to overseas locations is vital to our future as a producer of information storage products,' said Mr Ed Zschau, general manager of the division. IBM also announced a new technology strategy for the storage division based on leveraging component designs across a range of products. This is in line with similar efforts under way in IBM's computer systems operations.</p>

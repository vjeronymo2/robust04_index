			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Touche will shed about 20 partners TOUCHE ROSS, the sixth largest UK accountancy firm, is to shed about 20 partners at the end of its financial year in mid-April. The action is believed to have been prompted partly by the recession, which has hit most accountancy firms. Mr John Roques, senior partner, confirmed yesterday that about 20 partners would be leaving 'by mutual agreement', and about 10 new professionals would be elected to partnership. In line with normal practice, several partners will leave because they have reached the firm's mandatory retirement age, which varies between 60 and 65, depending on individual contracts. But about half of those leaving are younger, and will take early retirement following discussions with the firm's management board.</p>

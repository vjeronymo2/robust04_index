			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yelena Yugina] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 14 TASS -- The only way of  easing tension over the Black Sea Fleet is through patient  negotiations and sensible compromise solutions, Admiral Igor  Kasatonov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy said at  a press conference in St. Petersburg today.    The admiral noted that "the incident in Odessa can be  regarded as an anti-Russian action". One has to recognise that  Ukrainian commandos forcibly took over Division 318 of the Black  Sea Fleet, disbanded it and are now forcing Russian sailors at  gunpoint to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine.    The general noted that a similar scenario can be used again.  Ukraine has already appointed its own commanders for the fleet  units stationed in Ismail, Nikolayev and Ochakov.    But the situation in the Crimea as a whole is not in favour  of Ukraine's nationalist forces, Kasatonov said. The  inhabitants have already made their choice by voting for dual  citizenship. The Black Sea Fleet remains Russia's and it is  extremely illogical to try and divide it. The command of the  Russian Navy cannot agree to such division, Admiral Kasatonov  declared.</p>

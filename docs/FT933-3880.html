			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Israelis asked to trust their former enemy FOR ALMOST 30 years, since its foundation in 1964, millions of Israelis have been brought up to regard the Palestine Liberation Organisation with revulsion - as a terrorist organisation single-mindedly committed to Israel's destruction. And their greatest disdain has been reserved for a man they see as the arch-terrorist himself, the sly, unshaven, pistol-packing demon at its helm, Yassir Arafat. One Israeli newspaper said yesterday Mr Arafat's PLO had, directly and indirectly, been responsible for the deaths of 1,311 Israelis in the course of three decades of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the wounding of more than 14,000. Soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories, schoolchildren inside Israel, Israeli and Jewish passengers on foreign airlines and ships in distant continents, even Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games have been targets for the PLO. Almost overnight, the Israeli public is being asked to undergo a profound and fundamental shift: not just to embrace the enemy, but to trust him as well. Until recently it was illegal for Israelis to have any contact with PLO officials, let alone Mr Arafat. Mr Menachem Begin, the late Likud prime minister, would refer to Mr Arafat as 'that two-legged animal' and, during the Israeli siege of Beirut in the summer of 1982, approved an assassination attempt on him. Yet by early next year, provided Palestinian self-government is implemented on schedule, Mr Arafat and his nominated deputees will assume responsibility for law and order in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. He will control a large police force and confer with the very same Israeli security services that once plotted his downfall. The Israeli right-wing and its supporters are simply unwilling to concede the possibility that Mr Arafat and his organisation have changed. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud, claims Mr Arafat is as determined as ever to destroy Israel, but has merely adopted a 'phased programme' - taking Gaza and Jericho first, but keeping his sights set firmly on taking over all Israeli territory, and especially Jerusalem, the capital city claimed by both sides. Mr Ariel Sharon, the former defence minister who led the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, is even less complimentary. 'Arafat is a war criminal by any standards. There is not a man in the world today with so much Jewish blood on his hands. There's no place for peace with Arafat.' Not so, says Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, the man who spearheaded the 14 months of secret talks with the PLO that brought the breakthrough. 'The PLO was a terrorist organisation. But the PLO has today stopped being the PLO. It has torn its charter to pieces.' Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin stands uneasily in the centre, dismayed by Likud's flat rejection, but still not entirely persuaded by Mr Peres's enthusiasm. There was a clear element of embarrassment and discomfit in the way he grinningly welcomed Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister, to his office yesterday, blushingly remarking: 'I believe you've brought a certain letter.' It was only last May, after all, that Mr Rabin was calling on Israel 'not to trust Palestinians any more, even those with good intentions.' And even over the last couple of days, briefing his party colleagues, he has stressed that he still regards the PLO as a 'most unpleasant' enemy. If the concept of making peace with Mr Arafat is still troubling Mr Rabin, it is hardly surprising that most Israelis are troubled too. But Mr Arafat seems to be doing his best to win them over. For the past week, the PLO has been hosting an Israel Television crew at its Tunis headquarters. 'Peace is on its way,' he said with the broadest of smiles, 'there is no turning back. The first steps to peace have begun,' he said. 'With Allah's help, we'll meet again in Jericho,' he promised the Israeli correspondent, rising to shake his hand. But behind the chairman, as the camera panned back, was a photograph of the Dome of the Rock, on the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem.</p>

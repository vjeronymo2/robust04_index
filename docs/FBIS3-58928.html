			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, Jan 24 (CNA)--Britain's Foreign Office  described as "rumours" late Monday [24 January] a front page  article by a British daily, suggesting that the Turkish-occupied  areas in Cyprus were used as negotiating ground for the supply  of military aid to Azerbaijan.    "THE INDEPENDENT" wrote Monday that the British Government  had given "tacit support to an illegal scheme to supply  Azerbaijan with military backing in its war with Armenia."    The military backing, according to the newspaper, included  both the supply of arms and "a large number of mercenaries."    Moreover, "THE INDEPENDENT" wrote that the negotiating  sides'  representatives were based in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas  "where it is not illegal to trade in arms to Azerbaijan."    The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in  1983. The illegal entity is recognised only by Turkey, which  occupies 37 percent of the island's territory since 1974.    The transactions were confirmed by Lord Erskine of Rerrick,  68, who, according to the daily, lives in these areas but is to  return to the U.K. within a month.    Lord Erskine confirmed to the daily that the negotiations  had  taken place between Azeri authorities and a consortium for which  he is acting as consultant.</p>

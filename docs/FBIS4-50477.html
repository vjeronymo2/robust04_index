			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] The Shenzhen leadership has met unexpected  resistance to its plans to rid all enterprises in the special  economic zone [SEZ] of government control. The bold policy,  originally scheduled to come into effect in July, meant that  business units in the zone, including state-owned concerns,  would no longer be the sub-ordinate adjuncts of government  departments.    The reform was designed by the State Commission for the  Reform of the Economic Structure as a way to help Shenzhen  reclaim its status as the pace-setter for market reforms. After  having been taken out of the control of government departments,  the enterprises would become autonomous entities in keeping with  international norms.    The Special Economic Zone leadership, however, has faced  intense opposition from bureaucrats from both local and central  government units. During recent meetings called by the  municipal party and government leadership, the bureaucrats  claimed that severing their links with the enterprises would  lead to chaos and "misguided decisions". Municipal officials  said privately, however, they expected the new measure to go  through later this year.    Under the proposal, the "liberalised" enterprises would only  be subjected to a "social supervision regime" that includes  regular inspections by tax and auditing departments. "The  original schedule is for the measure to be enacted into law by  the Shenzhen legislature in the summer," a Shenzhen source said.  "Bureaucrats who oppose the reform say their power and even  rice bowl will be threatened if they can no longer exercise  control over the enterprises."    Analysts said Mayor Li Youwei, who favours the reform, was  up  against a national wave of fiscal conservatism, which manifested  itself in new calls for boosting Beijing's macro-level control  over the economy. Under the existing system, state-owned  enterprises and collectives are assigned as subordinate units to  different ministries and bureaus, whose permission is necessary  for activities ranging from production to sales.    If approved, the new system will also see a much lower level  of authority and activities for Communist Party units in  enterprises. It is understood Shenzhen has been lobbying Beijing  for other autonomous powers, including the conversion of the  entire zone into a bonded area and the limited circulation of  Hong Kong and other currencies.    Shenzhen sources said its leaders hoped the local economy  would be rendered "totally market-oriented" in 10 years in order  to facilitate the economic integration between the SEZ and Hong  Kong. The leaders told Beijing recently that Shenzhen was best  equipped to lead the nation in experimenting with reforms.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Wandsworth set to axe comprehensives TORY-controlled Wandsworth council in south-west London last night voted to abandon comprehensive education and make its secondary schools selective. The council endorsed a decision by its education committee which will allow three of the borough's schools to organise their own admissions, with 11-plus-style entry tests, possibly by September 1993. Under the controversial plan, drawn up by director of education Mr Donald Naismith, Wandsworth hopes its schools will become 'centres of excellence' specialising in subjects such as languages or design. Mr Naismith denied, however, that the change represented a return to secondary-modern and grammar schools. The proposals will allow schools to select pupils on the grounds of aptitude and compatibility with the school. Parents whose children are unsuccessful in obtaining a place at their chosen school would be able to appeal to the council, which will keep a register of unfilled places. But the Department of Education and Science has advised against the council being able to nominate pupils for 10 per cent of the places at each school. Mr Edward Lister, chairman of the council education committee, said Wandsworth was 'turning its back on 30 years of centralised planning because it doesn't work'. The National Union of Teachers said the plan failed to recognise that comprehensive schools brought wider opportunities for all children  - not just expanded opportunities for the selected few.

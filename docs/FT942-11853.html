			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Planning at Westminster council to be probed Westminster City Council is launching an independent review of whether its proposed Unitary Development Plan could have been drawn up as part of a gerrymandering exercise related to controversial sales of council houses. The launch of the inquiry is the nearest the Conservative-controlled council has come to admitting that the alleged gerrymandering exercise - supposedly planned to boost Tory votes in eight marginal wards - may have extended beyond council house sales to other activities, including the planning process. It puts a question mark over Westminster's policies on the eve of the local elections. Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday said that the Westminster Conservatives, who have a slim majority, deserve to be re-elected. Mr John Magill, the district auditor, this year made a preliminary ruling that the 'designated sales' of council houses in the late 1980s were unlawful and recommended that 10 councillors and officers, including the then leader, Dame Shirley Porter, should be surcharged Pounds 21.5m. According to draft terms of reference of the inquiry, the review will be carried out by an unspecified independent person because 'it has been suggested that the director of planning and environment (Mr Syd Sporle) may have been involved in the alleged improper regard to electoral advantage (sic)'. The review of the development plan follows assessments of its legality by three QCs, two working for the council and one employed by the opposition Labour group. The review will focus on allegations by Labour's deputy leader in Westminster, Mr Peter Bradley, that the development plan was 'decisively influenced' by the Conservative party strategy called Building Stable Communities. The strategy's alleged aim was to focus council resources between 1987 and 1990 on boosting the Conservative vote. The auditor has made a provisional ruling that the policy of removing 500 council properties a year from public ownership was designed with the aim of increasing owner-occupancy in the eight marginal wards for political purposes and at the price of failing to fulfil obligations to the homeless and other priority housing groups. Mr Bradley has alleged that the Unitary Development Plan, based on 1988 revisions to the district plan, was drawn up with the same intention. The draft terms of reference say the inquiry will look at three aspects of the development plan: The alleged deletion of any reference to the provision of council housing or low-rent housing association accommodation, because any such reference could have undermined the policy of selling council houses. The inclusion of a clause that 'planning permission will normally be granted for the change of use of hostels to residential use where the hostel is surplus to the requirements of the institution or body which uses it'. Mr Bradley alleges that this has already been used to justify planning consent granted in connection with the eviction of residents from a hostel by Westminster Cathedral. An allegation that the policy on redevelopment of industrial mews is intended to allow consent to be granted for high-cost residential conversions for private-sector sale.</p>

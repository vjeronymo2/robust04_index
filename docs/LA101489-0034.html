			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RELENTLESS GRANADA HILLS OVERPOWERS TAFT, 34-7  </P> <P> Great Scots! Isn't it about time somebody came up with a nickname for the  Granada Hills High defensive unit?  </P> <P> How does the Fearsome Elevensome grab you?  </P> <P> The Mean Green Wrecking Machine?  </P> <P> Tartan Curtain?  </P> <P> "Just call us relentless for now," Highlander linebacker Kirk Langer said.  </P> <P> That'll do.  </P> <P> Granada Hills, the Valley area's top-ranked team, was relentless and then some  in defeating Taft, 34-7, Friday night in a Northwest Valley Conference game at  Taft.  </P> <P> The hard-charging Highlanders (5-0, 2-0 in conference play), who have allowed  just 34 points in five games, did not give up an offensive touchdown for the  second consecutive week.  </P> <P> Taft (2-2, 1-1) scored when Highlander quarterback Bryan Martin ran into  running back Leon Glasgow on a broken play, fumbled and Bernard Gregory  recovered the ball in the end zone.  </P> <P> By then, however, Granada Hills had already scored 27 points and was  comfortably ahead in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The Highlanders picked off three passes, returning one for a touchdown, and  forced a fourth turnover on a fumble.  </P> <P> Fullback-linebacker Brett Washington led Granada Hills on both sides of the  line, scoring touchdowns on runs of 59 and seven yards, and making key  defensive stops. He finished with 172 yards in 13 carries.  </P> <P> Martin completed eight of 12 for 141 yards and two touchdowns to William  Moringlane.  </P></p>

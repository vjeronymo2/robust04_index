			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: US retail sales weak OCTOBER sales figures reported by some of the larger US retailers yesterday were reinforced by a warning from Kmart, the discount store and specialty retailing group, that its third-quarter results would show a decline in net income. Although Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, reported relatively good growth, with same-store sales 8 per cent higher than in the same month last year, figures from several other large retailers were weak. Kmart said the first half of October had gone well, but unseasonably warm weather in the second half interrupted the improvement in clothing sales experienced since early September. Overall, same-store sales were only 1.4 per cent ahead of last year's figure. Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale's and other chains, reported a 1.5 per cent decline in same-store sales. Woolworth, which last month announced the closure of 970 stores in North America, said total same-store sales were only 0.9 per cent up. Better figures came from Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department store group, which reported a 12.7 increase in same-store sales. There was modest growth from the JC Penney stores group.</p>

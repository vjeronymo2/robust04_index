			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters indicate that the installation of the damper had merit and should reduce the PCU's vulnerability to wear. However, the commenters believe that the inspection interval should not be extended to 1,500 hours TIS for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first commenter states that the root cause or single reason for the ballscrew internal spline wear has not been identified. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) bench test of the modified ballscrew internal spline quill installation does not demonstrate a test that duplicates actual operation; e.g., there is retaining wire wear due to axial preload from the damper. Also, currently there is inadequate scientific basis for reliance on the test data as there is insufficient field experience data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second commenter also states that the specific cause of wear has not been positively identified. The proposed modification does not correct the negative failure modes in the PCU should a wear induced failure occur. Finally, this commenter expresses concern that the field data used to justify the increased inspection interval is being collected only from a small percentage of units in operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with these comments. The FAA has researched these issues and reviewed the data from numerous tests and investigations that have been conducted to determine the cause of extreme wear when it occurs on a very small number of splines in service. The FAA has determined that by these tests and investigations a number of factors contribute to how or if the spline joint will wear. These factors include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Magnitude and direction of vibratory environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How well the spline joint is lubricated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motion of elements within the joint due to stack up of clearances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thickness of chrome plating on spline teeth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has therefore determined that there is no single factor for wear of this complex joint. However, the major contributors of the listed factors have been found to be lubrication and axial motion. Laboratory tests and controlled field service data has proven the damper reduces the wear factor by well over 20 times the rate before its installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The retaining wire wear is not a phenomenon associated with the damper introduction. The retaining wires generally show some degree of marking (mainly dents in the wire) from the flat end of the ballscrew spline teeth bearing on the round wire. This marking occurs on retaining wires on PCU's with and without dampers installed. After an initial ``Seating'' of the parts, the retaining wire continues to operate without distress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the FAA has reported data from high time controlled field service units in multiple model installations to have accumulated over 2,138 hours TIS with the same damper installed. In addition, the damper modification has been available to operators since January 1, 1994. The manufacturer has shipped over 2,800 modification kits and has conservatively estimated that over 300,000 hours of field time has been logged by operators with the modification installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the investigative reports, satisfactory field inspection data, and improved wear factors resulting from the installed damper modification, the FAA has determined that a negative failure mode should not occur within the new inspection interval of 1,500 hours TIS. The FAA has therefore adopted the inspection interval stated in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

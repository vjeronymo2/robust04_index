			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate June 28 SAPA -- South Africa should  concentrate on its own problems rather than send troops to  strife-torn Rwanda, minister of defence Mr Joe Modise said on  Tuesday [28 June]. Replying in question time he said it was not  the government's intention to send combat troops or support  personnel to the Central African nation.    It was however committed to supporting all mediation and  other efforts by the international community to ensure a  peaceful and lasting solution there.    It would donate emergency supplies specified by the United  Nations, was negotiating with the UN on the possible lease of  troop carriers for use by UN personnel, and was considering  airlifting material collected in South Africa by the Rhema  church.    Asked by Senator E K Moorcroft (DP) [Democratic Party]  whether he would be prepared to reconsider the issue if the  genocide continued in Rwanda, Mr Modise said South Africa should  concentrate on its own problems at home. "We think the Rwandan  situation is taken care of by forces coming from the United  Nations and at present there are French forces there....We have  to address the problems at home first."</p>

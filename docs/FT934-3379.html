			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Japanese ambassador in plea on British managers Mr Hiroshi Kitamura, Japan's ambassador to Britain, yesterday dropped some of the diplomatic reserve which would normally be expected of him to offer some highly personal thoughts on British managers and Britain's role in Europe. During two assignments spanning six years in the UK, Mr Kitamura said he had noticed that although top managers in manufacturing industry were of high calibre, many were by training lawyers, financiers and accountants. In his opinion, the views of engineers and scientists should carry proper weight when companies decided on long-term strategies and development of new products. 'In order to combine science with technology, and technology with innovation, it is important to promote people to top management with a thorough understanding of technology.' Mr Kitamura, speaking at the heart of British management, the Institute of Directors in London, did not confine himself to top managers. He had detected 'something of a shortfall in middle management'. This was of concern because this level was responsible for ensuring production line efficiency and product quality. 'The development of human resources in this stratum of management is surely of critical importance in boosting corporate competitiveness,' the ambassador said. On a more positive note, he said Britain was the 'trail blazer' for an open trading Europe, leading its European partners in the direction of a united Europe along pragmatic lines. This had benefited all countries, including Japan. Britain's continued central role in Europe would heighten the attractiveness of Britain for Japanese companies already operating in the UK.</p>

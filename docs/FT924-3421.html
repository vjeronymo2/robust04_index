			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Barclays to review top management roles MR ANDREW BUXTON, chief executive of Barclays Bank, promised yesterday that the bank would respond to shareholder pressure to split the roles of chairman and chief executive by devising a new senior management structure. Mr Buxton said the bank would alter its corporate governance 'in the long term'. This might mean appointing a new chief executive after Mr Buxton becomes chairman in January, or giving the power to dismiss the chairman to a committee of non-executive directors. 'In the long term, we will take notice of what shareholders are saying, and we will take steps to split the job,' Mr Buxton said in an interview. He said institutional investors had signalled acceptance of this in meetings with the bank. He said he could not specify when a decision would be made. Controversy over the dual role had only emerged in the past two months. A company of the size and complexity of Barclays could not alter its management structure 'without thinking through the ramifications'. The controversy over the combined role has grown with speculation that the bank could be forced to cut its final dividend because of poor results. It has also been fuelled by Sir Adrian Cadbury's report on British corporate governance. He favours dividing the roles of chairman and chief executive. Mr Buxton said he was 'unlikely' to become chief executive under a new chairman. But the bank would consider a suggestion from investors that he might become executive chairman reporting to a committee of non-executives. 'I think that kind of thing might be quite possible,' he said. The bank had to consider the best way of altering its proposed structure under which four heads of divisions - three of them titled 'chief executive'  - will report to him. Mr Buxton said the bank had started to put in place new strategies to restore its profitability over the next five years. Mr Buxton believed that it would take two years before it achieved his planned changes. Imry refinancing, Page 22</p>

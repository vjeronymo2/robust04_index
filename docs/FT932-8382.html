			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Outlook for UK inflation improves BRITAIN'S short-term inflation outlook has improved in spite of stronger than expected economic recovery in the past three months, the Bank of England said yesterday. In its latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank said it expected underlying inflation to stay below its target ceiling of 4 per cent this year and next. The government measure of underlying inflation is the retail price index minus mortgage interest payments. The Bank's report avoided giving any policy advice to the government and made no mention of its views on future interest rates. But it made clear that any weakening of sterling after the 5 per cent rise in its trade weighted value since February would increase the risk of the target's upper limit being breached. The Bank said short-term inflation had risen slightly since February: underlying inflation, when seasonally adjusted and expressed at an annualised rate, was 4.1 per cent in March compared with December last year, it said. But the report said sterling's recent strength had 'lowered slightly' the underlying inflation rate expected for this year and the chances of the year-on-year increase exceeding the 4 per cent limit. However, the government's decision to apply value added tax to domestic fuel and power from April next year would probably add 0.4 percentage points to the retail price index at that time and slightly increase the risk of inflation topping 4 per cent in 1994. Earlier, the Central Statistical Office reported that manufacturing output recorded its largest quarterly rise for more than four years. Although manufacturing production in March fell by 0.3 per cent against February, the CSO said this was largely in reaction to February's sharp rise in sugar production. Production between January and March was up by a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent against the previous quarter, and 2.1 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. A sharp rise in consumer confidence, reported yesterday by Gallup, the opinion poll company, provided further evidence that recovery was gathering strength. In its latest survey of consumer confidence, Gallup recorded its most positive results for a year with 43 per cent of respondents expecting the general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months and only 22 per cent forecasting a deterioration.

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A SOBERING LOOK AT THE ROUGH LIFE OF ONE CHILD  </P> <P> No one will mistake "Children of the Night," a "Frontline" report airing  tonight (9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 10 p.m. on Channel 50) for Valentine's  Day fluff. This documentary on teen-age runaways is sobering, hard material --  life in the raw, brutal to watch.  </P> <P> "Children" focuses on the rough life of Iain Brown, a suicide at 19, a  child/man fleeing the comfortable world of his middle-class family in Walnut  Creek, a suburb of San Francisco. For five years, Brown lived as a street  hustler in San Francisco and Los Angeles, returning to his family every so  often and then disappearing again for months at a stretch.  </P> <P> At 13, Iain, while working as a camp counselor, was caught experimenting with  drugs. Unable to face his parents, he and a friend ran away to Los Angeles,  where they were initiated into homosexual prostitution. Once he was in the  life, Iain seemed drawn to it, eventually becoming the leader of his own  "family" of street kids.  </P> <P> Iain left quite a record of his short, troubled life. Producer-reporter Ray  Telles interviewed and filmed him on the streets while doing an earlier show  about runaways; a neighbor, Bill McIntosh, had taped hours of interviews with  Iain, Iain's story in his own words. Telles skillfully uses the film and  audiotape, mixing it with interviews of Iain's mother, friends, social workers  and street kids to provide a glimpse of the runaways' world of prostitution and  drugs through the focus of Iain's life.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Iain remains a puzzle. Nobody knows exactly why this intelligent  youth could not surmount the trauma of his life, what it was that made him  repeatedly return to the cruel life of the street over the comfort of home and  family.

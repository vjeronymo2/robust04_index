			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES REQUEST BY RAIL ADVOCATES TO CANCEL JUNE TRANSPORTATION MEASURE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Monday denied a request by San Fernando  Valley rail advocates to cancel a transportation measure on the June 5 ballot.  </P> <P> Judge John Zebrowski denied the request by the Campaign for Valley Rail  Transit, which charged that the measure violated the state Election Code.  </P> <P> The campaign complained that the advisory measure intended to gauge voters'  opinions on proposed rail options "asks voters to make one choice among three  rail route alternatives or to select a fourth 'no project' alternative." The  complaint contended that the Elections Code does not allow the use of multiple  choice questions on the ballot.  </P> <P> The judge said the Election Code did not specifically prohibit the use of  multiple choice questions.  </P> <P> Roger L. Stanard, a Warner Center attorney who is chairman of the Campaign for  Valley Rail Transit, said his group went to court after learning that it would  not be allowed to write a ballot argument supporting the option they support --  a 5.6-mile extension of Metro Rail across the San Fernando Valley to the San  Diego Freeway. Until the extension was approved last week by county  transportation officials, plans called for the subway from downtown to end at  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Stanard said the only arguments that will be on the ballot will be one written  by county Supervisor Mike Antonovich favoring construction of a monorail from  Universal City to Warner Center, and an argument against all rail projects by  Encino homeowner activist Gerald A. Silver.  </P> <P> Stanard said his group could not present its case on the ballot because  Antonovich and Silver had already taken the two available places.  </P> <P> The third option on the ballot is a ground-level rail line from North Hollywood  to Warner Center.  </P> <P> The referendum was placed on the ballot by Antonovich in the hope of boosting  his monorail proposal, which was passed over by the County Transportation  Commission in favor of the Metro Rail extension.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of the new pressure-temperature operating limits and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new low temperature overpressure protection curve does not change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any postulated accident scenarios. The new curves do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent any appreciable change in the current methodologies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they merely provide assurance that the Reactor Coolant System is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected from brittle fracture. No new accident or malfunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism is introduced by the amendment and no physical plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes will result from this amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision of the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Withdrawal Schedule does not introduce a new accident or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunction mechanism. Capsule lead times are revised, and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than changing the order of specimen removal, consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ASME 185&hyph;82, no physical plant changes will result from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new pressure-temperature operating limits low temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overpressure protection curves were generated with the currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted conservative methodology using capsule surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. The new pressure-temperature curves were developed using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry standards and regulations (ASME Code Section III, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2) which are recognized as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being inherently conservative. The use of the new pressure-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature operating limits and low temperature overpressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection limits would not change postulated accident scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Withdrawal Schedule would not change postulated accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios. Capsule lead times are revised, and, other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing the order of specimen removal, consistent with ASTM 185-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 82, no physical plant changes will result from this revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Wilmington Township Public Library,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201 S.

Proposed changes to allow 8 hours for master relay and logic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, 12 hours for slave relay testing and 6 hours to restore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an inoperable ESFAS Automatic Actuation Channel prior to entering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shutdown action clock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The determination that these changes are within all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable criteria was established in the NRC's SER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for WCAP&hyph;10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification changes proposed by this license  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment request conform to NRC guidance contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SER. The NRC found that implementation of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes is expected to result in a small and acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in ESFAS unavailability. This increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability results in a small increase in calculated core  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage frequency and public risk. The calculated increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in core damage frequency was judged to be acceptable since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increase was small and well within the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty associated with the analysis. The values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented in WCAP&hyph;10271 Supplement 2 Revision 1 for increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in core damage frequency were verified by Brookhaven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Laboratory as part of an audit and sensitivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses performed for the NRC Staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the small increase in core damage frequency as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared with the range of uncertainty in the analysis, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC agreed that the calculated increase is acceptable. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion was documented in the NRC's SER dated February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22, 1989. The applicability of these conclusions has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified through a plant specific review of the generic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in WCAP&hyph;10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The ESFAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times included in this license amendment request are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the generic analysis. In addition, the NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the majority of the increase in unavailability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was due to the decrease in frequency of surveillance testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vice the changes in allowed outage and restoration times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, considering the above information, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed outage and restoration time changes do not involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability of occurrence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed changes do not involve the physical alteration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any plant system and do not result in a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner in which the ESFAS system performs its function. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in allowed outage and restoration times only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affects the probability of the ESFAS Automatic Actuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Channel functioning properly as described above. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the allowed outage and restoration time changes proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this license amendment request do not create a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different type of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed allowed outage time and restoration time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting safety system setpoints or limiting conditions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation are determined. The impact of the revised ESFAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times is addressed above. Implementation of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety by allowing adequate time for required ESFAS testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quality repairs leading to improved equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliability due to a more appropriate restoration time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outage and restoration time changes do not involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant reduction in margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Proposed change to the minimum required degree of redundancy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the High-High Containment Pressure channels in Table 3.4&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Changing the minimum required degree of redundancy in Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.4&hyph;1 for the High-High Containment Pressure Channels (Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.4&hyph;1 items II.3, III.B.3, and IV.3) provides consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Technical Specification 3.4.2.c which allows an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inoperable High-High Containment Pressure channel to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in bypass. Placement of an inoperable High-High  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containment Pressure Channel in bypass is preferred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the probability of an inadvertent containment spray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event. Also, these channels are designed with a two out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four logic so that the failed channel may be bypassed rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than tripped. With the failed channel bypassed, single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure criterion is still met because the logic is now a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two out of three. Furthermore, with the one channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bypassed, a single channel failure will not inadvertently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiate a containment spray. Therefore, this change can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered an administrative change to correct Table 3.4&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to agree with the Action requirements of Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification 3.4.2.c. As such this proposed change does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not involve an increase in the probability of occurrence or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 3.4&hyph;1 for the High-High Containment Pressure channels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is an administrative change which does not involve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical alteration of any plant system and does not result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a change in the manner in which the ESFAS system performs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its function. Therefore, the proposed correction to Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.4&hyph;1 does not create the possibility of a new or different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 3.4&hyph;1 to be consistent with the Actions of Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification 3.4.2.c is an administrative change and as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such does not involve any reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Proposed change to the delete footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1 removes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistency between it and Technical Specification 3.4.2.c  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which states that channels other than the High-High  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containment Pressure channels shall be placed in trip during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing. The change does not affect the manner in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ESFAS provides plant protection. In addition the change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not affect the functioning of ESFAS or the way Zion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Station conducts channel testing. Instrument channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing will continue to be conducted in the tripped mode  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the exception of the High-High Containment Pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channels, which can be tested in bypass because of the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a spurious Containment Spray event. Automatic Actuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Channel testing will be performed in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed outage times of new Specification 3.4.2.d. As such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed change does not involve any significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

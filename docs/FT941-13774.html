			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK caught between two systems Sir, In response to Joe Rogaly's excellent piece ('It is a moral issue', January 18) I would like to add the following points. If we now lack national self confidence and self-belief it is because, as a society, we are fragmented and caught between two conflicting value systems: modern capitalism and the monarchical state. What we have ended up with after 14 years of single-party rule is the worst of all worlds: capitalism's downside - low wages, poor skills, a crumbling infrastructure and vast extremities of wealth - operating within a constitutional settlement that serves the interests of an elite, is open to political interference and inappropriate to the needs of a late-20th century democracy. The national malaise is therefore more than simply a disenchantment with politicians. If our institutions are deficient then the need for far-reaching reform is long overdue. A new constitutional settlement would not solve all our ills at a stroke but it would begin to create a culture of citizenship and give us some sense of common purpose and shared identity. Sarah Atkin, 11 Avenell Road, London N5 1DP</p>

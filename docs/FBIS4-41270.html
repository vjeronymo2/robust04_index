			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By GIA correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 22 Jun -- Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of  the Georgian state, has received Vladimir Zemskoy, Russia's  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Georgia, at the  latter's request.    The Russian ambassador handed the head of state a letter  from  the Russian Federation president in which Boris Yeltsin  expresses profound confidence that friendship and cooperation  between Russia and Georgia will continue for the benefit of our  states.    Eduard Shevardnadze and Ambassador Zemskoy discussed the  decision to introduce Russian peacekeeping forces into the  Abkhazian conflict zone. This decision was adopted by the  Russian Federation Council. The head of state noted that he  attaches particular significance to this decision. In his  opinion, this international move by Russia is of historic  significance, not only for Georgia. The success of this move  may serve to guarantee stability in Transcaucasia. In that  event, Russia's prestige in the world will grow considerably,  because the responsibility taken by an individual country in  cooperation with an international organization for such a  serious move acquires the power of positive example for other  countries.</p>

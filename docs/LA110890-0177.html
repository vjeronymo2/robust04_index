			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Fujitsu to Unveil Smallest Pocket Phone: The world's smallest pocket cellular  phone -- a 10.2-ounce package slightly larger than a box of deluxe cigarettes  -- is expected to be unveiled today in Los Angeles by Fujitsu America Inc.  Although it is only slightly smaller than Mitsubishi and Motorola models, its  aggressive $1,195 price is sure to bring new competition to the pocket phone  market, already the fastest growing segment of the cellular equipment industry.  </P></p>

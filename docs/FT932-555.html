			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hershey Foods warns of second-quarter setback SHARES in Hershey Foods, best known for its chocolate and confectionery products, fell Dollars 1 3/4 on Friday to Dollars 47 3/4 , after the Pennsylvania-based company warned that second- quarter earnings would not match last time's 39 cents a share. Hershey pointed out that the earnings figure for the second quarter of 1992 had included a five cents a share gain from the sale of a business in Brazil. The 1992 second quarter had also been particularly strong in terms of sales volume. Mr Richard Zimmerman, Hershey's chairman, added that the group's core Hershey Chocolate USA division achieved unit volume growth of 12 per cent in the first quarter of the current year. 'These higher than expected first-quarter sales may be affecting the timing of second-quarter sales,' he said. Mr Zimmerman admitted that the expected results were 'disappointing', but noted that initial sales orders for the third and fourth quarters - seasonally much larger - appeared to be good. 'We currently expect 1993 to be another record year for Hershey Foods,' he said. Hershey estimated that, after adjusting for the one-off gain in the 1992 earnings per share figure, the comparable 1993 result could be between five and 10 cents lower. Hershey saw an earnings per share figure of Dollars 2.69 in its last full year, to end-December, and reported earnings per share (excluding accounting-related charges and another one-off asset sale gain) of 71 cents in the first quarter of 1993, up from 65 cents a year earlier. Data General, the US computer group, said preliminary indications were that revenues and financial results for its third quarter, ending June 26, would be lower than analysts' expectations, AP-DJ reports. The company blamed weaker than expected order rates from the European marketplace. Nine analysts have estimated that Data General will post a loss of 13 cents a share for the third quarter. Estimates ranged from break-even to a loss of 21 cents. For the third quarter last year Data General posted a loss of Dollars 11.7m, or 35 cents a share.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (3): Pioneering efficiency - Energy Conservation MILTON KEYNES is mercifully free of energy-related eyesores such as coal mines, power stations or large gas-holders. But the city has steadily acquired a reputation as the place where buildings - homes, offices and light industry - use energy more efficiently and cleanly than anywhere else in Britain. It has also pioneered a system for measuring and comparing the energy efficiency of buildings which is being adopted in many other parts of Britain and is being recommended by central government. The city's energy reputation will take another step forward this year when work starts on the construction of a National Energy Centre alongside the A5 main road. The 60-acre centre, to be called Odyssey, will contain exhibition halls, conference facilities and a theme park which is expected to draw at least 500,000 visitors a year, many of them schoolchildren. It will explain energy with some of the techniques associated with the much bigger Epcot centre, the scientific Disneyland, at Orlando, Florida. The Energy Experience will have a strong environmental theme, showing the link between energy use and global warming. Mr Richard Tinson, director of the Milton Keynes-based National Energy Foundation, which is in charge of the project, says work on the Pounds 25m complex will start this summer. Support is being canvassed from national and regional power utilities and collaboration is being explored with the Science Museum in London. The conference and business facilities will be completed in 55 weeks - Wimpey is the main contractor - and the theme park is due to open in 1994. It will also become the permanent address of the National Energy Foundation, a non-governmental charitable foundation which has assisted the energy work of the Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Mr Tinson joined the foundation in January from Shell UK where he had been chairman and managing director of Emstar, one of the country's biggest energy management contractors, recently sold to Associated Heat Services. The foundation's chairman is Mrs Mary Archer, the Cambridge university solar energy authority and wife of novelist Jeffery Archer. The site is part of the Energy Park, a 300-acre area, where most of Milton Keyens's pioneering buildings have been established. The Park contains 1,200 energy-efficient homes and several commercial and light industrial buildings. The Odyssey project will set the seal on Milton Keynes's emergence as a centre of excellence for energy-efficient housing. The city's prestige stems not only from its buildings but from the system developed there for rating their performance. Now officially known as the National Home Energy Rating (NHER), it was based on a computer program developed for the Development Corporation by the National Energy Foundation. The foundation claims that if every home in the UK was improved by just one point on the NHER scale, it would not only drastically cut the nation's energy bill but reduce the output of harmful power station carbon dioxide emissions by 4 per cent a year. The system predicts the annual fuel costs per square metre of floor area, including space and water heating, cooking and lighting. It measures a house's efficiency on an index of 0 to 10. The higher the number the more efficient the design. The NHER is now subscribed to by 100 members, including a wide range of organisations such as the National House Building Confederation, housebuilders, local authorities and housing associations, as well as architects, surveyors and energy consultants. There are 10 facilities throughout the country to train people in its use and about 300 people have qualified as assessors. In Leicester, it is being used as part of a city-wide environmental improvement programme and in Bristol it is being used to operate a 'green' mortgage scheme which favours energy-efficient houses. According to the National Energy Foundation, five big housing agencies are modelling all their stock using one of the NHER computer programs. By this month, more than 200,000 public sector homes should have been rated in this way. This year alone, says the foundation, the NHER is likely to be used to certify the energy rating of some 10,000 private new homes throughout Britain and a further 50,000 run by local authorities. Last month, the NHER, together with an alternative system devised by a software company, was incorporated into a new government yardstick for energy efficiency labelling. Two years ago, in its amended Building Regulations, the government required that new homes meet the equivalent of 6.5 to 7 on the Milton Keynes energy scale. The latest homes in the Milton Keynes Energy Park are intended to achieve a 9-point rating which is comparable with the best Scandinavian efficiency levels. Several thousand new homes in other parts of Milton Keynes are also expected to perform well above the proposed national level. The NHER could have an even wider impact under a European Community draft directive on the energy certification of buildings. It proposes that half the new homes on the market in any year should comply with a nationally-accepted energy rating label. In Britain, says Mr Tinson, that could mean that 1.5m homes a year would have to face a rating test similar to that devised at Milton Keynes. Significant improvements are being made too in the 60-acre section of the Energy Park earmarked for commercial buildings. The first two privately-funded energy-efficient commercial developments were the 40,000 sq ft Spectrum 7 building occupied by Leica, the German camera company, and the 66,500 sq ft Solaris Court, now used as the national headquarters of Parcelforce, the Royal Mail parcel delivery company. Both buildings are said to achieve an energy standard some 40 per cent better than the current national average. Even more eye-catching is the purpose-built UK headquarters of Kabi Pharmacia, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, which supplies materials to British hospitals, and which was opened in January 1991. It was designed by Hobbs, a Milton Keynes firm of architects, on the lines of Kabi Pharmacia's head offices at Uppsala in Sweden. Despite large expanses of glass, the fan-shaped building enjoys low energy costs thanks largely to the way warm air is controlled and recirculated with Swedish ventilation equipment.</p>

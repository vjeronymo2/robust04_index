			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: BT The regulator's preliminary decision on access charges for BT's competitors looks consistent with Oftel's intention to mimic competition rather than stimulate it by tilting the market in favour of new entrants. But one wishes Oftel and BT would provide a more convincing justification for the charge; hard facts, for example. The fact that Sir Bryan Carsberg may yet change his mind is unsatisfactory. The overhang of uncertainty following the Duopoly Review continues to sit uneasily with the impending sale of the government's remaining BT stake.</p>

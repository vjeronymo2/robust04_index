			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Mellor blocks house rescue MR DAVID MELLOR, the heritage secretary, yesterday blocked plans to save one of the country's historic timber-framed houses for the nation. The decision means that Pitchford Hall, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and its contents - together valued at Pounds 4m - will be auctioned. Mr Mellor said a plan drawn up by English Heritage, the monuments watchdog, and the National Heritage Memorial Fund to bring the house into public ownership was too expensive. Mr Jocelyn Stevens, English Heritage chairman, said Mr Mellor's decision would almost certainly signal the break-up of a collection dating from Tudor times.</p>

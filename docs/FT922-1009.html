			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (18): Cars reflect austerity and recession - User Profiles / The US IF extravagance and ostentation were the catchwords of the booming 1980s, the 1990s have been heralded in by recession and austerity which is reflected in the cars many executives now drive. With companies shoring up their balance sheets by cutting back on many perks, the days when almost every US executive had a company car already seem like a distant age. Indeed, many US executives are loathe to admit that they even drive luxury cars, even when they have purchased their cars themselves. According to a partner at a global investment bank who did not wish to be named, 'Executives are as interested in being comfortable as ever, but they want to be less obtrusive about it. This is an age of subtlety; there are fewer turbo-charged cars and fewer Bentleys.' His sentiments were echoed by Mr Mark Spiegel, a principal at Major Development, a commercial real estate brokerage company. 'In the 1990s, ostentation is allegedly out and people are buying cars like the Lexus because they don't want to be seen driving a Mercedes.' The bank executive, a self-described car buff, owns several collectors' cars and high performance cars but drives a 1991 Lexus LS400 as his basic transportation car. 'When I bought it, I comparison shopped between BMWs, Mercedes, Lexus and Infiniti. The Lexus was far and away, in my judgment, the best combination of aesthetics, performance and value for the money.' In spite of the recent resurgence of more nationalistic sentiments in the US and a concerted push by unions and the auto industry to get more Americans to buy American products, most executives tend to pay more attention to the car itself than to the maker's nationality when spending money on a luxury car. American cars have improved immensely in the past few years and cars such as the Taurus have become competitive on the world scene. 'But the quality of Japanese cars is up even more,' according to Mr Spiegel. The value associated with the relatively new Japanese cars has made them increasingly appealing to US executives looking for a new luxury car. 'The Lexus and Infiniti offer 90 per cent of what Mercedes offers for about 60 per cent of the money,' says Mr Spiegel. The after-purchase maintenance programme is another attractive feature of the Lexus. 'I have almost 30,000 miles on my Lexus and it has cost me nothing in terms of maintenance,' the bank executive said. 'And when it has a scheduled maintenance, they pick it up, service it, wash it and return it to my garage. And in the interim they leave me a loan car while mine is being serviced.' 'It's been free, it's been 100 per cent reliable and 100 per cent convenient; and it was probably 50 per cent cheaper than the comparable Mercedes. It's extraordinarily good and has no down-side as a basic form of transportation.' Mr Spiegel, who drives a Porsche 911 and a Taurus SHO, the high performance version of the Ford Taurus, was less willing to give up performance for comfort. 'I look at performance, totally,' he said. 'Acceleration, steering feel, handling and braking ability are all important. But I'd say 90 per cent of the people who get in my Porsche would choose a more comfortable car for the money.' The average 55mph speed limit in the US makes high speeds less of a factor when choosing a performance car than it would be in many European countries. 'Top speed is pretty impractical, at least in the US,' says Mr Spiegel. 'You can get short bursts on some stretches of open highway, but that's about all, otherwise you can say goodbye to your licence.' According to Mr Spiegel, who races his Porsche, one the car's main advantages is that it is one of the very few cars in the world you can drive to work every day but can also drive on the race track. 'The brakes don't fade and the steering is phenomenal on the track.' One of Mr Spiegel's main concerns is that his car should not look too expensive. 'Anti-theft systems have become so good in cars that the only way for someone to steal some of these cars is at gunpoint. 'There is nothing about the Porsche I'd avoid, but if I could change anything I would try to make it less conspicuous so I could park it in the street instead of a garage.' On his 1989 Taurus, Mr Spiegel would make the brakes larger. 'But when you look at the money, it's a phenomenal car in terms of what it does.' Later models of the car are even more attractive, with better transmissions, anti-lock brakes and air-bags. Indeed, executives looking at buying new luxury cars now demand a number of high-tech features which were unheard of only a few years ago including air-bags, anti-lock braking, emission control with acceptable fuel economy and up-to-date tyre technology. The Lexus driver also appreciates the less essential features - namely a 16-speaker stereo, leather seats and the telephone - which come with the car. 'It has all the toys built in,' he said. Mileage still seems to be one of the less important concerns when choosing a car in the US, in part because drivers are still comparing the miles-per-gallon in modern cars to the leviathans of only a few years ago which averaged about 10mpg.</p>

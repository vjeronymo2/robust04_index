			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / IMF gives go-ahead for Dollars 1.5bn loan to Russia: Last minute reprieve will boost economic reform The International Monetary Fund has approved a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan to help shore up Russia's economic reform after hurried talks between Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, in Moscow last night. The last minute reprieve for the beleaguered Russian government came just before Mr Camdessus was due to leave Moscow after five days tense negotiations which had threatened to fail. Agreement on the vital loan also helped restore some confidence in the government as it tried for most of the day to fend off persistent allegations that a coup plot against President Boris Yeltsin had been uncovered over the weekend. 'Everything's been agreed,' Mr Chernomyrdin said on leaving a meeting with Mr Camdessus. He did not say what, if any, conditions the IMF would attach to the loan but said a memorandum would be signed later last night. Mr Camdessus had voiced concern about rising Russian inflation that totalled about 950 per cent for 1993. The IMF had already lent Russia Dollars 2.5bn, but held off extending the country more credit until Moscow showed it was serious about reforming and stabilising its shaky economy. IMF officials had questioned whether 1994 budget projections were realistic and still worry that Moscow could could deliver the tough spending curbs it promised. The Russians are understood to have told the Fund they will be able to wrestle inflation down to 7 per cent a month by the end of the year. News of the loan agreement came as allegations of a coup plot against Mr Yeltsin and of his own failing health were being denied across the country's political spectrum. Mr Chernomyrdin said speculation on Mr Yeltsin's health was 'insulting'. According to Mr Yeltsin's press service, the Russian president has been officially sick for more than four weeks this year, and is still recuperating. Mr Chernomyrdin missed a meeting with Mr Camdessus on Monday to fly to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for unscheduled talks with Mr Yeltsin in the midst of a furore of allegations that a group of highly placed officials had prepared to strip Mr Yeltsin of power and name Mr Chernomyrdin as leader of the country. The alleged ringleader of the plot, Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, has called in the state prosecutor to investigate the basis of the report, published over the weekend in the liberal Obshchaya Gazeta daily. According to the official news agency Tass, Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin spent their time together discussing the Russian budget, relations with Georgia and 'other economic and political issues'. As he left Sochi yesterday morning, Mr Chernomyrdin said: 'somebody is interested in destabilising the situation.'</p>

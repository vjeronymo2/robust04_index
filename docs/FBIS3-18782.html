			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Research: 4th Framework Programme </F> Decision in Hands of Conciliation Committee"; as released by  Brussels Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] During the March 4 Research Council, the Greek  Minister chairing the sitting is likely to invoke the new  co-decision procedure and convene the Conciliation Committee  made up of the 12 EU Research Ministers, their representatives  and just as many Euro-MPs, and it will be the Committee's job to  try to reach an agreement on the Council of Ministers' common  position on the 4th Framework Programme of research and  technological development (1994-98). Qualified majority support  from the two sides is needed for the common position to be  adopted and if this is not forthcoming, the Programme could be  caught up in an inter-institutional game of ping-pong that could  would put a serious question mark over the possibility of it  starting up within the prescribed period of time. This, the  first application of the co-decision procedure that was ushered  in by the Maastricht Treaty, poses several basic questions about  inter-institutional symmetry.  <H5>  Ten Parliamentary Amendments </H5>   It was last February 9 that the European Parliament returned  its Opinion on its second reading of the programme and adopted  10 amendments to the Council of Ministers' common position. The  changes mainly affect the overall budget and its spread among  the various activities, its annual schedule and the role of the  Joint Research Centre.  <H5>  Budget Amendments </H5>   The Parliament has asked for the overall Framework Programme  budget to be plumped up by ECU400 million so as raise the total  agreed upon by Ministers from ECU10.746 billion to ECU11.146  billion. Ministers also decided that the sum could be increased  to as much as ECU11.441 billion in 1996, in the light of the  Programme's progress, the general economic circumstances and the  Union's budgetary situation at the time. The Parliament  contests these criteria and reckons that the total should be  raised to at least ECU12.041 billion in the light of an  assessment of the cost/benefit ratio and the application of the  programme, not in accordance with the economic or budgetary  situation. The Parliament also takes exception to the way the  money is being shared out among the two periods -- ECU5.283  billion for 1994-1996 and ECU5.463 billion for 1997-1998 - and  proposes the following annual formula:    - 1994: ECU10 million    - 1995: ECU3.013 billion    - 1996: ECU3.252 billion    - 1997: ECU3.199 billion    - 1998: ECU2.926 billion    - Total updated: ECU12.4 billion    The Parliament also has its ideas about how to spread the  overall resources among the different research activities. It  proposes another ECU140 million for the first Activity (research  programmes), including an additional ECU20 million for  electronic data transmission, ECU70 [million] for industrial  technologies and materials, ECU16 [million] for non-nuclear  energy and 34 for targeted social and economic research. It  proposes to add ECU180 million for the second set of activities  (international cooperation), including ECU50 [million] for  initiatives to combat environmental and health problems in the  countries of the former Soviet Union. It is asking for an  additional ECU80 million for the third action on  disseminating/exploiting research findings.  <H5>  Exposing the JRC to More Limited Competition </H5>   The European Parliament takes the view that the competition  that the Council wants to expose the Joint Research Centre [JRC]  to is too much. It proposes to boost the JRC budget for its  specific programme activities (ECU619 million, against ECU575  [million] in the common position) and to reduce the amount  earmarked for activities opened up to competition (ECU66  million, against ECU91 million).    According to the Parliament, JRC activities should be opened  up to competition by no more than 15 to 20 percent in the case  of the Framework Programme (against 24 percent in the common  position) and 7 to 10 percent in the case of the nuclear energy  research component (against 10 percent).  <H5>  Committee Procedures, Scientific Control and Aims </H5>   The Parliament also sees advantage in gradually integrating  the research activities in the coal and steel sector, now  covered by the ECSC Treaty, into the Framework Programme. For  example, MEPs want technological and social research operations  that have a bearing on the coal and steel sector to be included  in the appropriate specific research programme.    As for the specific programme on targeted social and  economic research, the Parliament wants to include a new  research strand aimed at promoting security and health at work  and achieving harmonisation in this realm.    Several parliamentary amendments seek to ensure that the  Programme is monitored by independent outside experts. When it  comes to committee procedures, the Parliament suggests adding to  the Framework Programme decision an annex providing for the  adoption (in the context of the implementation of specific  programmes) of joint implementation procedures to be established  by means of an inter-institutional agreement.  <H5>  Convening the Conciliation Committee </H5>   In the early stages of its March 4 sitting, the Research  Council will more likely than announce that it is impossible to  take on board all the amendments and will then convene the  Conciliation Committee as is provided for by the co-decision  procedure.  <H5>  First Test for New Co-decision Procedure </H5>   The long-drawn-out passage of the 4th Framework Programme  has  provided the first opportunity for the first purposeful  application of the new co-decision procedure established under  the Maastricht Treaty. The procedure can be avoided only if the  Council nods through all the Parliamentary amendments and this  is extremely unlikely in the present case.    Some of the amendments, such as those to do with the JRC's  nuclear research activities, are disapproved of quite strongly  by Ministers. The co-decision procedure applies only to the EU  Treaty not the Euratom one and some Member States want the  amendments proposed for nuclear energy to be rejected.    The Greek Presidency's agenda therefore includes a meeting  of  the Conciliation Committee in the afternoon of 4 March, at the  end of the Council sitting. There are two possible  outcomes:     -  either the Council members or their  representatives and European Parliament representatives, that go  to make up the Committee, agree, each by a qualified majority,  on a common project. They have six weeks to do so, after which  the two institutions have a further six weeks to approve (by a  qualified majority in the case of the Council and an absolute  majority in the case of the Parliament) the inter-institutional  agreement. Should this come to pass, the Framework Programme  may be adopted fairly soon,    -  or the Committee fails to reach an  agreement on a common project.    The Council thus has six weeks within which to confirm, by a  qualified position, its common position, possibly combined with  one or another Parliamentary amendment. If the latter is not  pleased with the situation, it may act by an absolute majority  to reject the common position.    These time limits may be extended, if need be, by several  months, so the Framework Programme could be delayed quite  seriously if the second possibility were to become true.  <H5>  Inter-institutional Symmetry </H5>   Theoretically, the Council should be able to adopt the  Euratom part of the Framework Programme by means of a  consultation pure and simple with the Parliament and without  taking account of the latter's amendments.    The risk there, however, would be that the Parliament would  dig its wheels in over the non-Euratom component and apply the  co-decision procedure right to the bitter end. In order to stop  this from happening, the Council has agreed to make a linkage  between the two decisions and not to adopt the Euratom part as  long as the other part of the Framework Programme has not been  adopted as well.    This first application of a decision covered by the  co-decision procedure provides the Member States with clear  evidence of to what extent the Parliament's powers have been  increased under the Maastricht Treaty and this is not entirely  to their liking. During preliminary talks within Council working  groups, several Member States expressed concern about what  effect the co-decision procedure is having on the  inter-institutional balance. If the Council wants to avoid the  conciliation procedure, it has to say "aye" to all the  parliamentary amendments. The UK takes the view that in general  the Council cannot always cave in to the Parliament's demands so  as to avoid getting ensnared in a lengthy and convoluted process.  <H5>  White Paper and Cooperation with EEA Countries </H5>   After mooting whether to take on board all the parliamentary  amendments, and, if need be, convene the Conciliation Committee  at the end of the Council sitting, Ministers are expected to  discuss what contribution research policy is making to the White  Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment and the debate  is likely to use as its starting point a report by Antonio  Ruberti, the European Commissioner for Research.    Next an informal gathering is scheduled to take place  between  Research Ministers from the five EFTA countries that have signed  the European Economic Area Agreement (Austria, Finland, Sweden,  Norway and Iceland) so as to consider the opportunities for  cooperation between the EU and the EFTA countries in the EEA.</p>

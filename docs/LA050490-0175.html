SUBURBS LEAD IN PERSONAL INCOME  </P> <P> Residents of the Connecticut suburbs of New York City had a per capita personal  income in 1988 nearly four times higher than those of a South Texas  metropolitan area at the bottom of a new government list.  </P> <P> The Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, Conn., area retained its top ranking  with per capita personal income of $29,084, compared with $7,302 for the  McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Tex., area, the Commerce Department said.  </P> <P> The Connecticut suburbs also were at the top of the 1987 list of 319  metropolitan areas surveyed by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.

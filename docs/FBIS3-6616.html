Touching on Japan's prolonged economic recession, Chinese  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli expressed his hope for an early  economic recovery of Japan, saying: "Recovery of the Japanese  economy is important for the Asia-Pacific region. I hope the  Japanese Government is successful in implementing its economic  policies." Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis also showed  deep interest in Japanese economic trends.    Liu stressed: "Japan has achieved constant economic growth,  even overcoming the 1973 and 1979 oil crises and the Black  Monday stock market plunge. I am very confident about Japan's  economic policies." He noted that the Japanese economy had  great influence on economic trends in the Asian-Pacific region,  saying: "Japan's large-scale economy has great influence even  when the growth rate is only 2 percent."    In reply, Fujii said "we hammered out a pump-priming package  of more than 15 trillion yen in February, and we hope for an  economic upturn in fiscal year 1994."    In his meeting with Taiwanese Finance Minister Lin, Fujii  said: "It is important to deepen dialogue among finance  ministers in the region. I would like to promote the spirit of  harmony and cooperation, informally discussing each other's  experiences of economic growth and current problems." The  meeting was the first contact between the finance ministers of  Japan and Taiwan as the two nations do not currently share  diplomatic relations; however, their trade ministers have met  three times at the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Ministers'  conference (APEC).    As far as Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir's  boycotting of APEC summit in November 1993 is concerned, Deputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwal stressed "we  support APEC, as you know, from the fact that we came here." He  then asked for Japanese yen-based loans for the New Kuala Lumpur  International Airport project.</p>

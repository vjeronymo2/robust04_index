			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego County district attorney's office made its recommendation  Thursday to the county Probation Department on the 12-year-old Mira Mesa boy  who was playing with Barbara Pacheco when she was fatally shot in October.  </P> <P> The Probation Department should reach a decision in two to three weeks on how  to prosecute the boy, said Carlos Armour of the district attorney's office.  Armour said the boy will either be put in a probation program to avoid standing  trial, or he will be criminally prosecuted by the district attorney's office.  Armour declined to say what action his office had recommended.  </P> <P> "We have ruled out that it was an accident, but that doesn't mean it was  intentional," Armour said.  </P> <P> Pacheco, a 13-year-old Challenger Junior High School girl, was found in the  home of the classmate she was visiting, with a gunshot wound in her face.  </P></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip on UK inflation worries and European falls Concerns about the UK government's ability to keep the lid on inflation and declines in some European bond markets pushed UK gilts lower yesterday, with the long end falling by more than one point. Gilts fell initially on a higher-than-expected rise in the Retail Price Index of 2.4 per cent for August. Analysts said the fall then gathered pace on worries over the government's anti-inflation policy. Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said the decision by UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke to raise the base rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent on Monday had been presented as a move to pre-empt inflation. However, some dealers now believed the move was in response to the RPI figures which they suspected the chancellor knew about on Monday. 'People had been led to believe that the authorities made this (interest rate) decision without knowing the RPI numbers,' he said. 'There is now uncertainty about policy and that has made the market nervous today.' Mr Andrew Roberts, at UBS, said gilts were unlikely to rally as long as the market felt Mr Clarke was increasing interest rates in response to inflation, instead of moving to stifle it. But Mr Nigel Richardson, at Yamaichi, said: 'Really there is no significant inflation problem in the UK, so Monday's rate rise is still pre-emptive.' The yield spread between gilts and bunds widened from around 138 basis points on Tuesday to around 150 yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future traded at 98 25/32 in late trading, a fall of 1 5/16 point on the day. Comments by the Bundesbank's vice-president, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, which suggested that further interest rate cuts were unlikely and stronger-than-expected wholesale data for August weighed on German government bonds yesterday. Mr Gaddum's view that Germany's rapid money supply growth did not allow him to justify a reduction in the fixed-rate repo rate from the current 4.85 per cent dashed lingering hopes that the Bundesbank would ease the repo rate this week. The market now expects no changes from the Bundesbank after its meeting today. Although Mr Gaddum is regarded as one of the Bundesbank's more hawkish members, analysts said his remarks were the first clear indication that the Bundesbank was moving away from the policy of cutting interest rates further. Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said Mr Gaddum's views also suggested that the Bundesbank was now giving a higher priority to dampening down inflation rather than to tackling unemployment. A 0.2 per cent rise in west German wholesale prices in August from July, up 2.2 per cent from a year earlier, and an unexpected drain of DM1.3bn by the Bundesbank during its weekly repo operations were seen as two further reasons why the Bundesbank would not be easing rates further. On Liffe, the December bund future fell 0.5 point to 88.70 while in the cash market, yields on 10-year bunds rose by 8 basis points to 7.60 per cent. The weakness in bunds prompted the spread between German and French bonds to go below 50 basis points at one point during the day. However, dealers said the narrowing spread did not necessarily reflect greater investor confidence in the French market. US Treasury bonds edged higher in light trading yesterday afternoon as traders shrugged off a mixed reading on retail sales. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better at 97 31/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.667 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 29/32 , to yield 6.30 per cent. The day's economic news, while not entirely negative, could not dislodge the gloomy mood which has gripped the market over the past week. Bonds finished a little higher after drifting aimlessly for most of the session. As trading began, the Commerce Department announced that retail sales last month were up 0.8 per cent, against forecasts of 1 per cent. But any enthusiasm over the favourable headline figure was dampened by evidence that much of the growth had come from outside the motor vehicle sector. Excluding automobiles, August sales climbed 0.7 per cent, much higher than the 0.4 per cent increase which had been expected. At midday the Federal Reserve released its Beige Book, which indicated that the economy continued to expand this summer. The report served to reinforce the fears of mounting inflationary pressures. In the end, however, there was no forward-looking evidence to push prices in either direction.</p>

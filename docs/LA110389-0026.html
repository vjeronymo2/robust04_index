			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWIN ON ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> The problem with Goodwin's views of the environment is their theological and  dogmatic character. He does not write of environmental policies that may ensure  that, on balance, living conditions can continue to improve for most people.  Instead, he sets forth what can only be described as the tenets of a religion  of nature worship.  </P> <P> It is all too obvious that he has intense dislike for our technical and  industrial civilization; that he regards it as an affront to nature, and that  he regards nature as a vengeful god who will exact a horrible price. Certainly  he is welcome to share these views with his friends. But why should the rest of  us believe him? Once again, we have a liberal of the gloom-and-doom school who  says: Disaster lies ahead; but if you give me full power, I will help things to  get worse a little more slowly. Who needs that?  </P> <P> T.A. HEPPENHEIMER, Fountain Valley  </P></p>

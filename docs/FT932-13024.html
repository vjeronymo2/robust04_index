			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Talks over Hong Kong will resume this week BRITAIN and China have agreed to resume talks this week on the vexed Hong Kong issue, having concluded a first round at the weekend. Both sides are maintaining a virtual news black-out on any progress, with spokesmen non-committal on details since the first round resumed on Thursday in Beijing. Britain's chief negotiator, Sir Robin McLaren, ambassador to China, said after negotiations had concluded on Saturday: 'We're working hard and there's hard work ahead of us, too.' The talks - over plans by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, to broaden the scope for popular participation in elections leading to China's takeover of Hong Kong in 1997 - could last for weeks or months. Beijing has repeatedly denounced Mr Patten's plan, demanding his recall and referring to him in its official press as a prostitute and a petty thief. China claims that Mr Patten's plan for elections in 1995 runs counter to an agreement reached with London over arrangements for transition to Chinese rule. Beijing officials have charged Britain with a breach of faith. In Hong Kong, Mr Patten commented: 'Both sides know there are very difficult issues we've got to resolve, but there has been a constructive approach. Both sides must be glad that the talks have started in such a sensible and balanced and businesslike way. I hope that we will be able to see progress over the next days and weeks.' In Beijing, a Chinese official was quoted by the official New China news agency as saying that China hoped Britain would 'return to the correct path' over Hong Kong.</p>

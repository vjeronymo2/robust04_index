			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Fletcher arm trims deficit FLETCHER Challenge Canada, 63 per cent owned by Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand conglomerate, reports a sharp reduction in third-quarter losses to CDollars 6.7m (USDollars 5.3m) compared with CDollars 24.3m for the same period last year, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Sales rose 39 per cent to CDollars 318.6m. Mr Doug Whitehead, president, said the result reflected substantially improved market conditions for solid wood products, better prices for lightweight paper and higher sales volumes for newsprint. The improvement in results would have been even better but for a deterioration in pulp prices. For the nine months ended March 1993, net losses were CDollars 30.3m, up from CDollars 23.4m. The 1992 results included a non-recurring after-tax gain of CDollars 35.3m.</p>

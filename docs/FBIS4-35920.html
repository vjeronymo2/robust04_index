			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome -- The United States has reaffirmed its  determination to continue its efforts to reactivate the Middle  East peace process, particularly on the Syrian-Israeli track.    In an exclusive statement to a SANA correspondent in Rome  yesterday, in answer to a question on Syrian-Israeli talks  following Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent  statements, Christopher said: I think that we are now  discussing the forthcoming negotiations and when they may start.  We are exerting efforts to facilitate these talks between Syria  and Israel.    Christopher added: I think we are facing a new phase in  these negotiations. I also think that the problem is whether we  can fulfill that mission and how quickly we can do it. The  beginning is always difficult.    SANA correspondent in Rome also asked U.S. White House  Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers a question about the Middle East  issue. She said: Naturally, we support moves for peace in the  Middle East. Some progress has been achieved in this regard, but  there is still a long way to go and we are doing all we can to  facilitate progress on all tracks. We hope we will continue to  achieve further progress. The process is long and hard.    The U.S. spokeswoman noted Christopher's repeated tours of  the Middle East. She said: The U.S. secretary of state has  spent a great deal of time in the Middle East and has made  several tours over a period of 16 months. We hope these tours  have helped to achieve progress in the peace process during the  past year.    The spokeswoman added: Early this year, President Bill  Clinton said that he hoped there would be fresh momentum given  to the peace process through any means available. But there are  several obstacles and we are cautiously optimistic. However, no  one should feel despair in face of this difficult process.    It is worth mentioning that Christopher and Dee Dee Myers  are  accompanying the U.S. President on his current visit to Italy.</p>

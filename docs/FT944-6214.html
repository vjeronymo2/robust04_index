			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Individuals can offset trading expenditure - Post-cessation tax relief There is to be a new tax relief for individuals' expenditure, such as professional indemnity insurance premiums, incurred after a trade or profession has ceased. The intention is to relieve genuine 'trading' expenses which do not at present qualify for tax relief. The change will take effect for expenditure which qualifies on or after today. The Inland Revenue explained: 'At present, no relief is available under the tax system for expenditure incurred after a trade or profession has ceased, unless the expenditure is provided for in the final accounts or there are post-cessation receipts against which the post-cessation expenditure can be set. 'From today, certain post-cessation expenditure, closely related to the trading or professional activities while they were carried on, can be set against income and capital gains to the extent that relief is not available under the present rules. 'The new relief will be restricted to individuals, and limited to particular types of loss or expenses which can be seen to relate directly to the trading or professional activities. These are: the costs of remedying defective work done, goods supplied, or services rendered while the trade or profession was continuing and damages paid by the taxpayer in respect of such defective work, goods or services whether awarded by a Court or agreed during negotiations on a claim; insurance premiums paid to insure against the costs above; legal and other professional expenses incurred in connection with the costs above; debts owed to the business which have been taken into account in computing the profits or gains of the trade or profession before discontinuance but which have subsequently become bad; the costs of collecting debts which have been taken into account in computing the profits of the trade before discontinuance. 'If in the final accounting period of the trade a deduction was given for expenses unpaid at cessation, and those expenses remain unpaid at the end of the year of assessment in which the new relief is given, the amount of the new relief will be reduced by the amount of the unpaid expense. (If the unpaid expense is subsequently paid it will be eligible for new relief in the year of assessment in which it is paid.) 'The new relief will be set against income and capital gains of the year of assessment in which the expense is paid. 'Where there is insufficient income or capital gains to cover the expenditure, the unrelieved expenditure of that year will not be able to be carried forward under the new relief arrangements against future income or capital gains. (However the unrelieved expenditure will continue to be able to be carried forward under the present post-cessation relief arrangements to be set against any post-cessation receipts which may arise in the future.) 'The new relief will apply to expenditure which qualifies in a period of seven years after a trade ceases. If an insurance policy is taken out in relation to the expenditure for which relief may be allowed under the new proposal and amounts are received in connection with that policy, these amounts are to be treated as post-cessation receipts under the present post-cessation arrangements. 'The same treatment will be given to recoveries of expenditure from any other person and to recoveries of debts for which relief has been allowed under the new proposal. 'Claims for the new relief must be made within two years after the end of the year of assessment in which the expense is paid. The cost of the new relief will be about Pounds 10m a year.' Changes to tax rules for life insurance companies will allow annuities and some interest to be deducted when it is necessary to measure the trading profits of a life insurance business and prevent a loss being used more than once. The rules also amend the way income and gains are attributed to different classes of business to minimise distortions when a company changes its valuation basis.</p>

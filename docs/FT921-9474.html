			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Vision - and a tale of two cities: Andrew Adonis and William Dawkins assess how London and Paris are tackling the problems of long-term city planning In London, dissatisfaction with the capital's transport, planning and environment is growing and, with it, support for an elected city-wide council. On Thursday, the Labour party will announce its plans for an elected Greater London Authority. Paris acquired just such an authority - the Ile-de-France regional council - six years ago, to add to its already powerful city council, and the region is now debating a new strategic plan for the French capital. London has much to learn from recent Parisian experience. London is larger than Paris - by about 11m to 10m people (taking the comparable metropolitan populations) - and the cities have their own inherited strengths and weaknesses. Last year's report of the London: World City project* rated Paris ahead in transport and planning control, but London better on culture, commercial accommodation and greenness (it has five times more central parkland). Nonetheless, similar concerns pervade both cities: inadequate public transport, urban decay, congested roads, development and fears for the quality of life. Both cities have their urban black spots, and neither has escaped the past decade without serious street riots. That said, Paris is engaging in more serious - and more public - strategic thinking than is London. It has also done more to improve itself, and has far more ambitious plans for the next decade than can be found across the Channel. The contrast is most evident in public transport. Paris has significantly enlarged its Metro and suburban rail networks over the past 15 years: inner-city travellers can now find a Metro stop on average every 560 metres, with a train passing every 90 seconds at peak hours, rising to two minutes on the main suburban line. (The best London's prestige Victoria line can manage in the rush hour is a train every three minutes.) The new Paris regional plan envisages construction of two city Metro lines, a suburban line and rail links between the five new towns encircling Paris. The French capital has underinvested in motorways over the past decade - the peripherique ring road is no M25, and the average time a city dweller spends in traffic jams has risen fourfold. The regional plan addresses this by proposing a fourth ring road and a series of underground motorways, some to charge tolls. It might sound like a pipe dream, but it isn't. The region's planners stress that the transport schemes - FFr260bn (Pounds 26.6bn) over 25 years - would only lift infrastructure spending as a percentage of regional gross domestic product to less than half the level achieved in the 1960s. In London, by contrast, the past decade has seen only one important public transport extension - the notorious Docklands Light Railway, which is being virtually rebuilt to meet capacity. The Heathrow airport-Paddington express, Crossrail (from Paddington to Liverpool Street mainline stations) and the Jubilee Underground line extension (to Docklands) are due to open in the next decade, but that is the extent of projected expansion. Since London Regional Transport and British Rail project capital spending separately, and only three years ahead, there is no 'public transport plan' for the next decade. As for roads, London's prospectus of new links to Docklands, an upgrading of the M25 and North Circular, and a shelving of road pricing (for three years at least) is a poor match for the Paris plans. There is no statutory body to consider the pan-city transport interests of London's councils. The London Boroughs Transport Committee has concerned itself mainly with the Greater London lorry ban, and not all boroughs participate in that scheme or the committee. Ile-de-France region and the French government are putting the final touches to a comprehensive 25-year planning document, which sets development guidelines for a range of subjects from the environment, through property development, to public transport. This will replace the first plan of its type, agreed in 1966, which laid down a timetable for the completion of the five new cities, the construction of the La Defense business district and the peripherique. 'We recognise that you need 25 years minimum to change the face of a city,' says Mr Pierre Pommellet, director-general of Iaurif, the body responsible for drawing up the regional plan. The two cities approached their prestige edge-of-city-centre developments - Docklands and La Defense - in a similar way, with a special public corporation working to a government brief in each case. But Docklands excepted, the London-Paris contrast is stark. Within Greater London, each of the 32 constituent boroughs has - or will soon have - a separate unitary development plan (UDP). Each plan must have regard to 'strategic guidance' from the environment secretary. The London Planning Advisory Committee, an inter-borough body, is charged with advising ministers on matters of common interest. But the committee has proved relatively weak, and central influence on the content of UDPs has been patchy. Large-scale proposals, like the 'east London corridor', have depended crucially on initiatives by environment secretary Mr Michael Heseltine, who is responsible for everything from poll tax to pollution. Development control is a matter for the boroughs acting within the broad remit of their UDPs. Boroughs have the advantage of proximity to those affected by developments; but they are in a poor position to gauge city-wide interests. Their decisions can be overriden by the environment secretary, but the appeal process is cumbersome. The project to redevelop nearly 50 hectares of derelict land at King's Cross, for instance, has now been before Camden's planning committee for nearly three years, with a hard core of councillors opposed to the very principle of development. It is typical of what Dr Michael Hebbert, of the London School of Economics, calls 'the borough effect - an absurdity, a perfect recipe for delay and inefficiency'. The contrasting transport and planning regimes are a product of the two capitals' radically different structures of city government (see graphic). Most of the Ile-de-France region has four elected tiers of government: state, region, department and commune. Most French commentators agree there is one executive tier too many: 'We have too many criss-crossed responsibilities and areas of financing. It's hell,' says Mr Jean Chevance, head of staff at the regional Conseil Regionale. But even if one of the lower three were axed, Ile-de-France would still have a layer more than Greater London. Ile-de-France, one of the 22 elected regions set up by the first Mitterrand government in 1986, embraces 10.7m people, and extends beyond the built-up metropolis by about 60km south and east, 40km west and 30km north of the city centre. The City of Paris, the largest of the departmental councils beneath it, covers 2m city-centre residents - those living, roughly, within the limits of the Metro/Underground system. The comparable area of London is covered by 12 London boroughs, with the City of London by far the smallest. It would be wrong to view the authorities as a strict hierarchy. With a 1992 budget of FFr18.7bn, the City of Paris spends twice as much as the regional council. The City has had but one mayor since it was created in its present form in 1976: Mr Jacques Chirac, national leader of the RPR neo-Gaullist opposition party and twice prime minister. The president of the regional council, Mr Pierre-Charles Krieg, is one of Mr Chirac's senior followers. Moreover, the Ile-de-France region is both more and less than a strategic authority. More, because it has a direct service-providing role. The provision and upkeep of lycees, for instance, lies with the region, and Mr Krieg is keen to branch out into universities - a central government responsibility - and other services. But also less, since final decisions on most important issues - from the regional plan to Metro fares, which are half London's thanks to state subsidies - lie with the government. The state exercises its authority through a web of state corporations, and through its appointed prefet for the region, Mr Christian Sautter, formerly President Mitterrand's most senior adviser. Mr Sautter's appointment in 1990 was widely seen as a bid to re-assert central authority in the capital which, like most of the French regions, is under the political control of the opposition. Says Mr Krieg: 'We are in an ambiguous position. Broadly, the decisions belong to the state and our powers are financial.' But discard memories of the bitter battles between Mrs Margaret Thatcher and the former Greater London Council, led by Mr Ken Livingstone, in the 1980s. Controversy there is: the region objects to financing a large share of the city's public transport investment budget, while Mr Chirac is battling against a significant cut in his government grant caused by the Socialist government's policy of favouring more 'deprived' councils. Mr Krieg has recently challenged central authority by withholding cash for environmentally unpopular road schemes, and by building private Catholic lycees. Yet these are mere skirmishes. Daily relations between state, region and city are businesslike. Mr Sautter's office is in the same building as Mr Krieg's and the right-wing regional president maintains friendly relations with his Socialist colleague. The Socialists look set to get a thrashing in the March 22 regional and local elections, so Mr Krieg, who holds minority control in the regional assembly, can expect a second term. But whatever the political complexion of the Ile-de-France, it is unlikely to suffer the violent policy changes to which London has been subjected. On policy, inter-party differences are paper thin. 'The Socialists might want to spend more, but we always end up agreeing on the main investment issues,' says Mr Henri Paul, the region's finance director. The consensus derives partly from the exigencies of inter-party co-operation, but at least as much from the city's administrative culture. Senior officials of both the region and the city are seconded high-flying national civil servants (something inconceivable in Britain), enjoying close professional and social relations with colleagues in central government. Typically, they will have been to the same elite civil service colleges and share similar views on the government's responsibility for providing services and infrastructure. Ile-de-France is privileged in that respect, and the concentration of resources and skills there is a perennial sore point with provincial regions. The state, in other words, has its own regional dimension in the Ile-de-France, and had it long before elected regions were introduced in 1986. Voyons loin, vivons mieux (look far, live better), is the Ile-de-France slogan. Paris has its problems, but if London had a government - national or regional - with the capacity to look farther, Londoners might at least be sure of catching a train on time. * London: World City, HMSO, Pounds 24.95. This is the first of three articles comparing planning and public services in Paris and London.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PARIS Has four main tiers of government  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Central Government:  has the final say in most strategic matters affecting city, and  controls public transport through appointed boards. Directly  represented in the Ile-de-France region and each of its departments by  a prefet with advisory and supervisory powers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Region:  The Ile-de-France region embraces all the continuously built-up  metropolis, plus the other suburbs. Advisory power over planning,  direct responsibilities include aspects of education and transport.  Annual budget: FFr 9.5bn (Pounds 970m).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Departments:  8, with broad reponsibility for service provision, of which by far the  largest (with 2.1m citizens) is the City of Paris - which is also the  lowest executive tier in its territory. Budgets: Paris: FFr 18.7bn  (Pounds 1.9bn), others: about FFr6bn (Pounds 614m).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Communes:  1,300 across region, powers over primary schools, police, some roads,  some local services. Within City of Paris, arrondissements have a  mainly advisory role.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONDON has two tiers of government since abolition of Greater London Council in 1986  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Central Government:  Ministers have direct powers over all strategic issues in the capital,  and control public transport through appointed boards. No equivalent to  the prefet for the capital  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Boroughs:  Greater London area divided into 32 boroughs, plus the tiny City of  London. Broad responsibility for local services, planning, council  housing, education and most roads. Typical annual borough budget:  Pounds 200m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

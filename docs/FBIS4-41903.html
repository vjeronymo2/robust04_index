			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian State Duma Committee on Economic Policy  and the administration of the Sakhalin Region have agreed to  draft a law on Sakhalin providing for the establishment of a  special economic zone on a part of the region's territory,  Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy Sergey  Glazyev said in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk when meeting with  representatives of the local executive and legislative bodies.    Glazyev said that the administration could be given the  right  to set quotas for fishing independently immediately without  waiting for the law to be adopted. However, Glazyev stressed  that enlargement of rights must be followed by greater  responsibility of the local authorities for the utilization of  natural resources and for investments into the social  infrastructure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by David Pedatzur: "A Creeping Devaluation on </F> the Golan"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the talks or negotiations  leading to negotiations with Syria, Syria is digging in its  heels while Israel is stripping itself of all its assets,  leaving very little for the U.S. "honest brokerage" and for the  actual negotiations. On the eve of his current Middle East  tour, the U.S. secretary of state made an effort to lower  expectations of "dramatic breakthroughs." Speaking on the U.S.  Information Service's Internet at a news conference attended by  newsmen from Oman, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, and Jerusalem,  Christopher described his visit as "routine." According to him,  he is not carrying any "package," but he hopes to bring the  Syrian president "certain interesting information" from  Jerusalem.    It is doubtful that there is still any "interesting  information" left in Jerusalem that the Syrians do not know  about. Al-Asad is determined not to give up on a single inch of  the Golan, while Israel is crawling its way down from the Golan.  Looking back, one cannot help but wonder at the excessive  Israeli optimism that followed al-Asad's declaration about his  willingness to make peace with Israel. We have been informed of  countless instances of "sensational progress," just plain  "progress," and "breakthroughs" since we began making progress  on the withdrawal.    The prime minister must have had very good reason for his  declaration regarding his willingness to evacuate settlements on  the Golan in return for peace. Yet Israel's lowering of the  concession barrier does not follow any moderation in the Syrian  stands. After all, Rabin himself stated more than once that  "Syria has not made a single gesture to build confidence." Ever  since al-Asad made his forced and stuttering remark after his  meeting with Clinton in Geneva, Rabin has been waiting for the  Syrian president to make another move; he never did. What else  should Israel say that it has not yet openly said to make  al-Asad kindly take the Golan Heights back?    It is very easy to argue with Rabin and quote the  unequivocal  statements he made prior to the elections regarding the future  of the Golan. Nevertheless, ever since he assumed office, there  has been a troubling erosion in the prime minister's statements.  It is true that Rabin never said that the Golan Heights is an  inseparable part of the State of Israel. He relies on the Labor  platform and the willingness to make territorial concessions,  including on the Golan. Territorial compromise could amount to  evacuating settlements, but it should in no way be taken to mean  total withdrawal from the Golan and uprooting all the  settlements. [passage omitted]    Nonetheless, if the prime minister contends that his remarks  about the Golan withdrawal and settlement evacuation were not  made in order to exact a reciprocal Syrian gesture, who needed  them and why were they made? The chilly reactions of the Syrian  media left no room for doubt that Syria is not only demanding  that all the settlements be dismantled but also that Israel  fully withdraw from all of the territories, including Jerusalem  -- which has been the Syrian stand since al-Asad assumed power.  Reacting to Rabin's remarks on the readiness to evacuate  settlements, TISHRIN said he is "throwing sand in our eyes."  The Syrian press believes that what is needed now is U.S.  pressure on Israel.    In practice, the Israeli Government is fulfilling the  commitment undertaken in the Labor platform that "efforts to  bolster the existing settlements on the Golan Heights will  continue." On one hand, it is "business as usual": accelerated  development is taking place and investments are being made in  every field, with the exception of tourism, including the  construction of "the largest cowshed in the Middle East." On  the other hand, every unnecessary Israeli declaration weakens  the settlers' endurance and makes them feel that, sooner or  later, everything will be dismantled or destroyed -- if not in  one blow, then in stages.    In the current Knesset, the government lacks majority  support  for a full withdrawal from the Golan and the evacuation of all  the settlements there, even in exchange for full peace with  Syria. The results of the referendum, the circumstances under  which it will be held, and the contents of the "peace package"  are unknown. Public opinion polls do not fully answer the  question of whether the people are with the Golan or with peace  without the Golan. Either way, even if there were no Israeli  settlements on the Golan, there is doubt about whether a  government decision on a full withdrawal would be widely  accepted. Even in the absence of settlements on the Golan, the  security consideration must lead the government to ensure that  the Golan Heights will never again become a launching pad for  attacks on the Galilee and Jordan Rift Valley settlements. Even  if there were no settlements on the Golan and even if Syria were  willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel, Syrian intentions  would have to be tested over a period of 10-20 years before  executing a full withdrawal from which there is no return.    After all, there is nothing new in the Syrian bazaar: He who  is patient wins; he who is in a rush loses. Even if it was not  about security and dangerously betting on our future, the  Israeli dealer must show the same amount of patience  demonstrated by the Syrian merchant.</p>

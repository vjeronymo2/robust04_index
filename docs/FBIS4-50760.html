			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Zhao Renfang: "China, The Next Great Business </F> Frontier"]    [Text] New York, May 18 (XINHUA) -- New Jersey, the  "Garden State" which is separated from New York City by the  Hudson River, has great advantages in developing its  international trade.    At the 27th conference held by the state's World Trade  Council, participants saw another new horizon, that is, China at  the other side of the Pacific Ocean.    During the past few years more and more American businessmen  are targeting China to expand their business. Seizing the right  time, New Jersey World Trade Council, chose China as its  conference theme and invited some 500 people from business,  trade, government and other parties interested in exploring  U.S.-China business to the meeting on Tuesday [17 May].    The conference, sponsored by the non-profit council,  received  great support not only from the American side, but also from the  Chinese Consulate General in New York and Zhejiang Province of  China, New Jersey's sister state. Robert P. Evans, chairman of  the council noted that he held great honor to organize such a  conference.    At the beautiful conference venue called Birchwood Manor in  Parsippany, New Jersey, governor Christine T. Whitman said the  conference was a special time and event for her state while  expressing welcome to Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United  States and Ambassador Zhang Weichao, consul general to New York.    In a brief interview with XINHUA, she said outreaching was a  major part of the future of her state and China was a potential  market of the future, so China was very important for New  Jersey. "International trade means economic growth," she said.    New Jersey, though small in size, sold products worth 11.5  billion dollars and its export was the 11th last year in the  United States. With 20 of FORTUNE 500 biggest companies and 12  biggest service companies within its territory, the garden state  will greatly develop its export in the future.    In the early years of 1980s, New Jersey has become sister  state with China's Zhejiang Province. To further their  cooperation, Zhang Qimei, deputy governor, led a 50-member  delegation to this special and unique opportunity with some 400  projects seeking partnership. Also at the one-day trade show,  noted American companies such as AT&amp;T, Citibank and KPMG Peat  Marwick introduced their products and services to their Chinese  counterparts.    At the conference with the theme "China, The Next Great  Business Frontier," participants featured presentations focusing  on the business, investment, trade, legal, economic and  social-political climate in China and agreed there existed great  opportunities.    Commenting on the conference, a senior Chinese conferee who  attended lots of symposiums on China said it's rare to see such  a professional conference which attracted so many American  businessmen. The Chinese companies should go deep into American  main stream society to do their business in this way.    Just as Ambassador Zhang Weichao noted that this conference  was very unique and unprecedented in the way that it had chosen  China as the theme country. The large turn-out was also  unprecedented.    "It fully reflects the great enthusiasm and desire among the  both business communities in exploring business opportunities  and in strengthening bilateral cooperation." he added.    Since the conference was convened at the very moment before  the Clinton administration to decide whether to unconditionally  renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status, most of the  people at the meeting called for the separation of the issue  from other unrelated matters. They also expressed their support  for China's MFN status.    Delivering an international luncheon address in the  afternoon, Ambassador Li Daoyu thanked those people who made  their efforts in developing Sino-U.S. trade and business  relations and hoped that they make further efforts to help  settle the issue.    "China, The Next Great Business Frontier" was the theme of  the meeting and also the desire of most participants at the  meeting. While driving back on the Garden State Parkway to New  York, this reporter also hoped that meetings of this kind will  pave another "highway," which can carry more American  businessmen, just like the speeding cars rushing by, to do their  business with China. The desire is there, but more efforts  would help their dreams come true.</p>

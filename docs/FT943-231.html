			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Public sector accounts shift call The leading professional accountancy body for public services yesterday called for the establishment of a new body to set accounting standards in the public sector. Mr Martin Evans, technical director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the new board could bring together public and private practice. He told the Government Accounting Service conference at the University of Surrey that the last decade had seen a shift away from cash-based public-sector accounting towards a more commercial system. Change in the public sector had been prompted by compulsory competitive tendering, the development of the internal market in the National Health Service, the Next Steps programme for the civil service, the growth of housing associations and structural changes in education. He proposed that the new Public Sector Accounting Advisory Board would take over the role fulfilled by the public-sector committee of the Accounting Standards Board and other bodies. He said the government should become involved and nominated 17 contributors to its costs - including the Treasury and regulators such as the Housing Corporation.</p>

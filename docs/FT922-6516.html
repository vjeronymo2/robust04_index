			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Halls Homes &amp; Gardens Pounds 7.2m loss HALLS HOMES &amp; Gardens, USM-quoted garden products and home improvement group, yesterday announced a sharp increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 7.2m for 1991. At the interim stage Mr Jon Moulton, chairman, announced a loss of Pounds 2.46m compared with a profit of Pounds 7,000 and warned shareholders that full year results would be worse than those for 1990. He said the market had ceased to decline but that the group's balance sheet had been seriously eroded by losses. The company continued to have the support of its bank. Proposals were to be put to shareholders before the end of September for a rights issue to put the company's finances into better shape.</p>

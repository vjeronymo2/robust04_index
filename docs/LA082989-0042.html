			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR WANTS EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS;  </P> <P> ARTS FESTIVAL ORGANIZERS FIGHT PRIVATE PROMOTERS  </P> <P> Organizers of the upcoming Soviet Arts Festival are seeking to block two  independent promoters from bringing Russian performers -- a rock group and the  Red Army Choir -- to appear in San Diego at the same time as the festival.  </P> <P> At Monday's board meeting of San Diego Festivals Inc., Mayor Maureen O'Connor,  who is president of the board, discouraged promoter Scott Pederson's plans to  independently present a series of rock concerts during the festival.  </P> <P> "We've raised $6 million for a nonprofit festival," the mayor said. "We can't  present every group that wants to be involved with the festival."  </P> <P> O'Connor also defended the festival's agreement with the Soviet Ministry of  Culture, which, according to festival organizers, gives them exclusive rights  to Soviet presentations in San Diego from Oct. 21 to Nov. 11.  </P> <P> "My point is that it's easy for a profit group to come in after we've spent all  this money on promoting the festival," she said. "I've got to protect the  nonprofit, educational aspect of this festival.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not 'Good Business Sense'  </P> <P> "Why would we put up this kind of money without some kind of protection? That  just wouldn't be good business sense."  </P> <P> The fate of Pederson's efforts may rest with another local, independent  producer, Don Hughes, who has a contract to present the Red Army Choir on Nov.  8-9, also independent of and during the festival. The Red Army Choir is touring  the country in the fall, and last week Hughes received an encouraging message  from Gosconcert, an arm of the Ministry of Culture.  </P> <P> "We received a telex last week from the Gosconcert vice director confirming the  Red Army Choir would appear," said Hughes' attorney, Robert Besser. Ron  Johnson, attorney for the city and legal adviser for the festival, "said he  hadn't received it, so I sent him a copy. My understanding was that the city  was requesting the Soviets to make a determination, and I took this as a  response from Russia. As far as I'm concerned, that should end it. There  shouldn't be any more questions."  </P> <P> After the board meeting, O'Connor said the festival does not consider Hughes'  position to be any more favorable than Pederson's.  </P> <P> "The same thing applies, as far as I'm concerned," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traveled to Russia  </P> <P> Pederson attended Tuesday's board meeting to present his case, saying his  concerts would benefit a number of local nonprofit organizations. Pederson  traveled to Russia in April and signed an agreement with Gosconcert to present  Russian rockers Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik. Before his trip, Pederson met with  festival artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph. According to Pederson, Joseph said  nothing to dissuade him and even provided Pederson with contacts in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Upon his return, Pederson's attempts to contact Joseph were unsuccessful. A  letter to the festival official also went unanswered. In late July, Pederson  received a message from Gosconcert, instructing him to cancel the concerts  because of "contractual obligations with the festival organizing committee."  </P> <P> Pederson told the festival board he simply wants to expand the scope of the  festival's offerings, which focus on the fine arts.  </P> <P> "I'm not a not-for-profit venture, but there isn't a rock promoter in San Diego  who is," Pederson told the board. "I stand to lose money because of the delay."  </P> <P> O'Connor cut Pederson off, saying the portion of the meeting reserved for  public comment "isn't for a debate."  </P> <P> "It's most unfortunate your phone calls were not returned, but me and (festival  Executive Director) Bruce Herring are the official designers of the program."  She referred Pederson to City Manager and board Vice President John Lockwood.  </P> <P> Pederson said that, after the meeting, Lockwood told him "it would take three  of the four people on that board to vote on something, and he saw it highly  unlikely that three members would overrule the mayor."  </P> <P> "I'm not going to give up," Pederson said. "I don't feel I'm the only person in  San Diego who wants to see Russian rock 'n' roll here."  </P></p>

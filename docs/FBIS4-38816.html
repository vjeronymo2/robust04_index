			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- "The time will come when our  two countries will again return to the Euro-Asian union idea,  first suggested by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev,  notwithstanding the fact that some CIS members are not prepared  so far to join such a union, State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said  here on Thursday during a meeting with Kazakhstan Foreign  Minister Kanat Saudabayev.    "However, it may so happen that by that time the  legislations  of our states will become so different from one another that a  good deal of effort would have to be made to bring them closer  together again," Rybkin said.    In view of this, "it is essential to seek cooperation in the  lawmaking process within the CIS framework so that the  legislations of our states would be adequate to one another as  much is possible", pointed out the speaker of the lower house of  the Russian parliament.</p>

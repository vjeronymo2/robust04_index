			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Former French premier dies Mr Antoine Pinay (left), a former French prime minister, finance minister and one of the architects of the country's post-war economic recovery, died yesterday, shortly before his 103rd birthday. Mr Pinay earned a reputation as a skilled economic manager and a champion of anti-inflationary policies. Before leaving government in 1960 he introduced the 'new franc', which knocked two zeros off the currency, and earned him the title of 'the man who saved the franc'. He held a succession of government posts, including minister for economic affairs and finance minister, before being appointed prime minister in 1952. As premier he helped restore public finances, introducing austerity measures and issuing a successful bond, known as the 'emprunt Pinay', which allowed savers to convert cash and gold which had been stashed away in the post-war years into legal, tax-exempt savings. Mr Pinay returned to the cabinet as foreign minister in 1955 and became finance minister when Charles de Gaulle formed the first government of the fifth republic in 1958.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: Back to the future with Ridley Scott - Cinema BLADE RUNNER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT (15) Ridley Scott TETSUO II: BODYHAMMER Shinya Tsukamoto OF MICE AND MEN (PG) Lewis Milestone THE WATERDANCE (15) Neal Jimenez RAPID FIRE (18) Dwight H. Little Hisses humanoid Rutger Hauer to Harrison Ford: 'If you're not alive, you can't play]', explaining why he has spared his life. Shortly before this he has dislocated two of Mr Ford's fingers, thrown him across several rooms and then - just as a show of strength - butted his own head through a solid wall. We are in LA's famous Bradbury Building, circa 2020 AD, and the plot is coming to the boil. Correction: the plot has already come to the boil, scalding all bystanders, and the screen is now thick with steam and precipitation. That the future world depicted in Ridley Scott's ten-year-old Blade Runner is unlike any other in film history we already knew. Rain drizzles; mist drifts; a benighted pall hangs over the streets. And four escaped androids from a distant space colony are making life hell for bounty hunter Rick Deckard (Ford). If you're not alive, you can't play. But you have to be alive to odd things in this movie. One of them is not the plot. Scripted by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples from Philip K. Dick's quirky sci-fi novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep - the screenplay is de-sheeped and largely de-quirked - it is the old tale of the semi-retired gunman called out for one more mission. (For Western baddies read robot humanoids). He falls in love with one female 'replicant' (Sean Young), perforates three others and has a climactic bash-out with the last. No, the plot is futurist cowboys. If you want to play the Blade Runner game, you must be alive to the film's all-transcending images and rhythms. Restoring his movie according to his original vision, Scott has junked the studio-foisted voice-over that made Ford sound like a cybernetics-age Sam Spade. And he has also clipped off the 'happy' ending. This had car-borne hero and heroine snaking into the countryside on an elopement idyll that seemed to come from another film. Indeed it did come from another film: the sequence consisted of out-takes from Kubrick's The Shining. Now we have the harsh, distilled, majestic masterwork. Before 'inner city decay' became a cant-phrase, Scott and designer Lawrence G. Paull invented this dazzling nightmare of rotting, marauder-haunted streets: a place where aerial cop cars float overhead, polluted rain cascades down and pyramidal skyscrapers reach for a non-existent light. It is Fritz Lang's Metropolis made for the age of colour, hi-fi sound and urban paranoia. In the opening long shot of the city, chimneys belch fire like disconsolate dragons. In later low-angle vistas we squint up through the architectural chaos (Hispanic, Egyptian, Hi-Tech) to watch the lighted blimp loudhailing the joys of off-world life and the towering neon sign with a Japanese face smiling inanely into the void. London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles: give these cities 30 years to self-combust and Blade Runner could be the cinema's most prophetic blueprint of urban degeneration. Its images are no less tenebrously majestic when it steps indoors. The giant Theban terrace of the penthouse-dwelling robotics tycoon, lit by amber sunset and guarded by an amber-eyed owl. Deckard's flat, a rancid lemon daylight squeezing into the low-ceilinged interior built as if from Mayan playblocks. Or the toymaker's workshop in the Bradbury Building where the androids hide out. Here walking homunculi bash into doorframes, 'living' dolls nod away in dazed serenity and the replicants find camouflage in a world of chalk-faced almost-humans. Hard to review Blade Runner except as a shopping list of irresistible aesthetic bargains. The dramatic core that might homogenise them is not quite there. Only in the final minutes, as replicant Hauer gives up his fight in a dying epiphany of tender humanity, does the script soar and Scott's direction go with it. Suddenly we are looking at something more than inspired trappings: we are gazing into the souls trapped inside them. Anyone doubting Blade Runner's influence on post-Blade Runner cinema should check out Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo II: Bodyhammer. This unstoppably delinquent Japanese film is all about human beings who turn into guns, nay into entire walking armouries. From forearms transformed into gnarled machine-guns, or chests bristling with bazookas, they pump bullets into likewise metamorphic enemies. But what captivates is the setting. It is the dank, dark, rain-gleamed metropolis of Ridley Scott's film, animated by such Scott specials as whirring ventilation propellers and hissing steam-jets. Modern Gothic at its most delirious, housing an Oriental thriller at its most demented. What a pastoral contrast to wander into Of Mice And Men. Here the sun shines, the stream burbles, the corn is green. And if man is vile, it is not through deliberate evil: only because large physique and small intelligence make an unhappy combination. John Steinbeck's Lenny, for whom gestures of love turn into tragic death-hugs, is here played by John Malkovich. A lisping, pixillated giant with batting eyes and cupid's-bow mouth, he would be slightly camp if not more-than-slightly unnerving. The actor draws us into Lenny's baby intelligence - watch his mind tick s-l-o-w-l-y as he repeats the last words of every interlocutor's sentence - and then makes us emotionally complicit in his deeds. Malkovich is splendid. The rest of the film, alas, consists of actors reciting lines against scenery. Gary Sinise of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre co-stars as George and also directs, turning Steinbeck's story into a bland, up-market Classic Illustrated. The movie misses all the gnarled humanity that director Lewis Milestone brought to the 1939 film and that Burgess Meredith, that sulphur-powered gnome, brought to George. Ray Walston, Casey Sziemasko, Sherilyn Fenn and a rabbit comprise the new film's supporting cast. They all evaporate before Malkovich, and before the audience's awareness of what might have been. A bad film about the maimed or disabled has an unfair advantage. It knows we cannot slam the door in its face quite so readily as we would on a bad film about, say, murder, car chases or sicko cops. The Waterdance is written and co-directed (with Michael Steinberg) by Neal Jimenez, who scripted that teasing fable of small-town guilt and gossip River's Edge. A real-life paraplegic, he has poured his own experiences into this story of life in a rehabilitation centre where a spine-injured novelist (Eric Stoltz) meets up with a crippled biker (William Forsythe) and a chattering black con-man (Wesley Snipes). But oh dear. Sometimes when you pour your experiences into something, they spill over and require much mopping up by non-responsible parties: in this case the audience. The Waterdance, apart from being about 'the unceasing tenacity of the human spirit' (to quote the press notes), is about the difficulty of reconciling realism with Hollywood inspirationalism. Feints are made at frankness, especially about the sexual plight of the crippled. But long before curtain-time the film has withdrawn into a narcotic buddyism, where the brute facts of paralysis are anaesthetised by funny subplot capers in wheelchairs or hi-jacked hospital vans. Rapid Fire at least has the courage of its conventions. Roll up - or possibly roll over - for 95 minutes of foot-kicking, fist-flying frolics with Brandon Lee, son of Bruce. The direction (Dwight H. Little) is basic, the plot more so. But on this showing Lee is the new Nijinsky of the bare-knuckle B-movie.</p>

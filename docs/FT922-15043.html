			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Stalemate before the final frantic lap Next week the British general election may turn into the most exciting race for power since Hubert Humphrey nearly pipped Richard Nixon at the post in 1968. I remember being telephoned from London while the count was on. 'We must plan our edition now,' barked the voice from across the Atlantic. 'Which is it to be - Democrat or Republican?' Sitting on the edge of a chair in Washington, the only possible response was to shut one's eyes and guess. 'Nixon,' came the scared whisper. In the event, he got a fractionally larger vote than Humphrey, and squeaked through in the electoral college. Next Thursday, we could be transfixed, hypnotised by the little screen, staring at swingometers and chequered maps of Britain, while holding drinks in one hand and using the other to tick off individual seats. Several TV pundits will be required to explain Scotland to the rest of the nation. In Northern Ireland the UUU, the utterly unpredictable unionists, will continue to flummox us. A few disgruntled ex-MPs standing as independents may make a difference in certain constituencies. All of this presupposes that the polls will continue to predict a parliament in which no party holds an overall majority. If the outcome is indeed as close as that, we will be counting heads through the night to establish which of the big two commands the largest number of seats - Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour, or Mr John Major's Conservatives. In either circumstance, the precise numbers will be decisive. In the pre-polling chitterchat of the past few weeks one constant assertion has been that if the Conservatives return fewer than 315 MPs (326 being necessary for an overall majority) they will be out, since not even the UUU could save them then. You can read a forecast of a hung parliament into the polls published so far this week. The graphs of the results have told the same story for six months. They register approximately 38-40 per cent Tory, 40-41 per cent Labour, and mid-to-late teens Liberal Democrat. Mori's polls in The Times have shown Labour at 41 per cent in week one of the campaign, 43 per cent in week two and 41 per cent in week three. In the same poll, the Tories have stayed put at 38 per cent. The Lib-Dems have moved up a point, to 17 per cent. Our FT poll of polls, based on a six-point moving average of the half-dozen most recent reports sorted by field date, has also registered virtually no change. The exception is this week's nearly three-point drop in the Conservative score. It is balanced by an equivalent rise for the Liberal Democrats. That is probably significant, but be warned. The whole basinful of numbers, from seven points ahead for Labour to half a point ahead for the Tories, is within the polling methodology's standard margins of error. The picture could change when Sunday's fresh crop of results appears, or again next week as the final snapshot counts are published. This week we had a rehearsal of what could be another roller-coaster ride, with the polls saying hung parliament on Sunday, Labour walkover on Wednesday, and hung parliament yesterday. There is another possibility. The betting at Ladbrokes, on the IG index and elsewhere, suggests that people are beginning to put their money on a Labour victory. The markets are hiding their cash from the very same prospect. But what kind of a Labour victory? Some punters say flatly that Mr Kinnock will win outright. There is a strong argument in favour of this theory. Labour is ahead on most of the issues that voters say are important, including education, health and the welfare state. It has succeeded in narrowing the gap on economic confidence. There is also a powerful feeling, skilfully exploited by Mr Kinnock, that it is time for a change. Against that, it could be that Labour has peaked too soon. Its huge rally in Sheffield on Wednesday night was either an inspirational ode to joy, as the Labour leader would have it, or a triumphal display in less than excellent taste, as it may have struck those who saw it on TV. Mr Kinnock has disciplined himself well during this campaign. At every opportunity he has presented and reinforced the appearance of a prime minister-in-waiting. In truth he has shown a remarkable and hitherto little suspected capacity to control his own reactions and prudently shape his face. That could turn out to be a more telling characteristic than his celebrated changes of policy. This week, however, Mr Kinnock's natural ebullience has begun to press against his neat suit and tie, as it did when he was playing up the crowd in Sheffield. He would not be human if he was not susceptible to the thrill of anticipation of victory, but he constantly needs to remind himself that over-confidence can lead to error, and error to defeat. Such things matter. For this is turning out to be that rare exception - a contest in which the actual details of the campaign could decide the result. I'll come to those details in a moment, but first let me clear away a counter-argument. To say that the campaign is changing people's minds is not to contradict the view that there are deeper forces at work. It is just that recent history is now well accounted for. We know that the Conservatives have been relying on continuing mistrust of Labour; Labour on deep disenchantment with the recession. We are aware that Labour has worked hard to escape from the aura of untrustworthiness in which the electorate has imprisoned it since 1979. That has moved the party to 40 per cent plus and kept it there. It has been established that the Conservatives are riding a push-me-pull-you. They are dragged forward by Mr Major's attention to public services, and backwards by the need to defend the Thatcher decade. Forwards by, shall we say, some of their manifesto commitments to social services, and backwards by the poll-tax demands arriving this very week. That lethal mixture originally got them down to 40 per cent minus, from which they may now have begun to descend. These are all givens. The net result is stalemate. Analyses of the profound changes in British history that lie behind this result can take us no further. What could count at this stage, therefore, is the superficial stuff: the campaign strategies and tactics, the images the parties and leaders present to the public, and the last-ditch arguments produced as time races on. It is for this reason that Conservatives have been drifting over to Mr Paddy Ashdown's party. Mr Major does not suit the part of political tough. Anti-Kinnock invective sounds false coming from his lips. His campaign has been ham-fisted. Too many generals have led a toy-soldier army of headquarters staff. Mr Ashdown's smooth crusade owes much to his willingness to submit himself, and his entire team, to the control of a single manager, the adept Mr Des Wilson. The Lib-Dem leader is the most popular campaigner of the three. If Mr Major can frighten some of Mr Ashdown's supporters away by saying they are letting Labour in, the race could yet be a cliff-hanger for the Tories. If not, we shall awake bleary-eyed at about this time next week to see Mr Kinnock on his way to No 10 Downing Street.</p>

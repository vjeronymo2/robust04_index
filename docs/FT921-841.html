			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Politicians score an own goal AS VOTERS tried to assess the row over Jennifer Bennett's ear yesterday, the main impression was that the reputation of politicians had been damaged and that voters had not been swayed. In the Tory marginals of Bury North and Bury South in the suburbs of Manchester - and in Hartlepool, being defended by Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former communications director - nobody suggested that the Labour broadcast or the ensuing rumpus had helped to determine their voting intentions. In Hartlepool, Mrs Mildred Gray, a widow of 75, believed Labour had picked on one case and had misrepresented it. The affair had strengthened her intention to vote Conservative. Mrs Margaret Ainsley, who looks after her disabled husband, felt the broadcast portrayed the truth. Her five-year-old granddaughter has been waiting three months to have her tonsils removed. 'The broadcast made its mark,' said Mrs Ainsley, who will vote Labour as she did in 1987. Mr John Bolton, 42, an electrical engineer who had already decided to vote Conservative, said: 'There's 55m people. If you look hard enough you can always find a case to support your argument.' Mrs Emilia Pearce, a shop assistant, voiced distaste for the politicians' dog-fight. 'We're all sick of hearing about it,' she said. 'It's all this presidential style of politics.' The view that the row was demeaning to those most closely involved in it struck a chord in Bury. Women in particular argued that it was wrong to use the suffering of children to score political points. It was also a sentiment that crossed political affiliations. Committed Tories were 'disgusted' or 'outraged' while many Labour supporters had reservations about the content of the broadcast. A surprisingly large number of people said they knew worse cases and would gladly have told Labour about them. 'Everyone knows that the health service needs improving,' said one Bury voter. 'So why, instead of bickering, don't that lot work together to help us? I'm sick to death of the lot of them.' Those sentiments were echoed many times. Such feelings were often accompanied among older people by deep cynicism about what they saw as posturing by politicians. In Bury they claim to know all about the haves and have-nots. One retired textile worker said the rich had always enjoyed a better service and always would. Politicians might find a little double-edged solace in another factor encountered yesterday in Bury. That was the small number of people who saw the Labour broadcast and the large number who had no intention of watching Conservative ones.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK too zealous on safety regulations Sir, I see that Mr John Rimington, the director-general of the Health and Safety Executive, is still referring to EC legislation as being 'unnecessarily prescriptive' (Letters, October 13). I did an analysis of the Health and Safety Commission's 'six-pack' regulations and the original six EC directives. I found that the UK was over-zealous in its interpretations of EC directives. For example, the Council directive on the minimum safety and health requirements for work with display screen equipment (90/270/EEC) is only five pages in length, including annexes. However, the UK regulation - Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 - is 33 pages long. Another five regulations put out by the HSC are equally prolix. If Mr Rimington refers to the Department of Trade and Industry scrutiny team report on the 'Review of the Implementation and Enforcement of EC Law in the UK', he will see that health and safety issues are already under review owing to unnecessary over-regulation, especially of small and medium-sized businesses - the life blood of Britain's economy.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpts] Humberto de la Calle Lombana was named today at  the Liberal Party [PL] convention as the vice presidential  candidate, but many surprised viewers wonder today why several  days ago he vehemently said 1,001 times that he would not accept  the vice presidency because he considered it to be a consolation  prize. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [De la Calle Lombana] Many friends told me  that there was a possibility I would not qualify for office in  1998 and that therefore I should fight that possibility by all  means. In the end I reached the conclusion that Colombia and  the PL are above everything. [applause] [passage omitted]    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that your decision now  will take credibility away from you, and if that is the case,  how can you recover it?    [De la Calle] I do not think so, because I was sincere when  I  said I was not aspiring to the vice presidency. That was what I  felt at that time. At this time, I now feel that it is  necessary to set aside personal interests and take action for  the benefit of Colombia and the PL. This is not the time for  being selfish or having personal ambitions. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

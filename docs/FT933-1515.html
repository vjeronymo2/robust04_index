			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Devaluations prompt 7% fall at BSN CURRENCY devaluation in some principal European markets prompted a 7 per cent fall in first-half net profits at BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, the company announced yesterday. The group said that virtually all of the decline in net profits to FFr1.82bn (Dollars 322m) in the first six months of this year, from FFr1.95bn in the first half of 1992, reflected the currency impact of consolidating profits from countries such as the UK, Italy and Spain, which had seen their currencies depreciate during the period. BSN also suffered as a result of reduced demand resulting from the recession in Europe. The biscuit division, which saw operating profits fall from FFr485m to FFr339m, is undergoing a restructuring and is one of the company's principal areas of expansion in central Europe and Asia. With the exception of beer, all of the group's other divisions - fresh produce, pasta, mineral water and packaging - suffered a decline in operating profits.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Meeting of minds behind Smith's strategy: Emma Tucker identifies members of the 'academic panel' that advises MPs on policy WHEN Messrs John Smith and Gordon Brown stand up this week to address the party conference, Labour's hotch-potch of economic advisers will doubtless breathe a sigh of relief that it is not their task to defend the pound's recent upheavals. One of the gurus has been there before. In 1967, when Mr Harold Wilson, the then prime minister, devalued sterling, Mr Andrew Graham was assistant to the cabinet's economic advisers. Long associated with the Labour party, the Oxford economics don now works part-time as the convener of a group of City and academic economists who gather on an irregular basis to exchange views and give advice to Mr Smith and Mr Brown. The approach differs from Mr Smith's predecessor Mr Neil Kinnock, who relied almost solely on the advice of Mr John Eatwell, a Cambridge don, now on his way to the Lords as a Labour peer. 'The objective of the group is to get in different ideas,' says Mr Gerry Holtham, one of the group's City members. 'John is a lawyer and likes to weigh the evidence.' But the name most closely associated with Mr Smith is that of Mr Graham. Sympathisers describe him as a pragmatic, realistic economist in tune with the modern party, while adversaries stick to the label 'old-fashioned Keynesian'. Undergraduates, taught by the 50-year old windsurfing enthusiast at Balliol remember his dismissal of Conservative economic policies as 'all this monetary nonsense'. Mr Chris Allsop of Oxford, another member of Labour's 'academic panel' - as he prefers to call it - says the group is united by pro-European sentiment, even if it represents a range of views. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs in London, who was tutored by Mr Graham at Balliol, is at the end of a phone for instant clarification or explanation of City manoeuvrings. Mr Holtham of Shearson Lehman, the investment bank in London and Mr Neil MacKinnon, who recently moved to Citibank are also included at the meetings. The group also includes a number of rather tight-lipped academics from Oxford, Cambridge and the London School of Economics. These include Mr Allsop, Prof Meghnad Desai, professor of economics at the LSE, and on an even more informal basis, Mr Ian Begg, Mr John Wells and Professor Wynne Godley from the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge. It is early days for Mr Smith as leader and whether he expands his coterie of advisers remains to be seen. Meanwhile, another meeting of the 'panel' has been called for next month, giving Labour, like the government, the opportunity to come up with a brand-new economic strategy.</p>

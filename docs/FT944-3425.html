			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Haitai buys 17.2% of Korean audio group Haitai, the South Korean food group, has taken management control of International Korea Electronics (Inkel), the country's leading audio company, as part of its strategy of diversifying into electronics. Haitai bought 17.2 per cent of Inkel from Mr Cho Dong-sik, its founder and largest shareholder, for an estimated Won20bn (Dollars 25.3m). Inkel has 25 per cent of the domestic audio market. It exports to the US and Europe under the Sherwood brand name following its purchase of the UK audio company. Inkel has come under financial pressure due to rapid production expansion and diversification into telecommunications. Sales have fallen sharply to Won125bn in the first 10 months of this year, against Won233bn for all of 1993, due to increased competition. Operating profits, which were Won2bn last year, have been affected by a price-cutting campaign by rival companies. The takeover of Inkel is meant to improve the performance of Haitai Electronics, which also manufactures audio equipment.</p>

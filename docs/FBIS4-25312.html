			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (CNS) -- Renowned Chinese expert in  the telecommunication and Vice Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications, Mr. Zhu Gaofeng, who was newly elected Vice  President of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences (CAES)  expressed in an interview with this agency at the meeting  attended by academicians of the CAES held here yesterday that  after its establishment, the CAES would begin to do some  practical work including the offering of  engineering-technology-related advisers and suggestions to the  government for its decision-making in drawing up the Ninth  Five-Year Plan.    The CAES is the highest academic body in engineering field  in  the country. On June 9, relevant leaders of the State Council  briefed academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the  CAES on ideas for the Ninth Five-Year Plan and Scientific and  technological development programme within this period in the  country. Academicians of the CAES will discuss and work out  proposals of the strategy for the development of science and  technology and the developmental goals in different stages in  the future. [as received]    As an expert in post and telecommunications, Mr. Zhu has  made  a great contribution in this field and since 1982, he has been  the Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications.    Mr. Zhu said that another work needed to be done by the CAES  was to enlarge its academician ranks. He rebuked the concept  prevailing in the past that the social status of the engineering  technicians should be lower than that of scientists, saying that  from a long-term social and economic point of view, this idea  was harmful. One of the aims for the establishment of the CAES  was to raise the status of engineering technicians, therefore,  those who have become leading academic personnel and made  outstanding contributions in this field would be drawn into the  academician ranks as soon as possible. China now has nearly 10  million engineering technicians.</p>

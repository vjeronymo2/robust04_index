			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / 'Flawless' mission over Seven US space veterans returned home to Cape Canaveral in triumph yesterday, after completing all scheduled repairs to the crippled Hubble Space Telescope. 'Thank you for the flawless flight,' mission control told them as the shuttle Endeavour rolled to a stop. 'We look forward to using (Hubble) to see further into our universe than ever before.' The 11-day mission - which some commentators had called the greatest challenge for the US space agency Nasa since the moon landings more than 20 years ago - was a very public success. In the course of five televised space walks, the crew (average age 46) completed all their scheduled tasks, surpassing Nasa officials' highest hopes. They replaced or repaired 11 defective parts on Hubble, including lenses to correct the telescope's short-sightedness. Astronomers will not know whether the mission has restored Hubble's full sight until Nasa has completed several weeks of tests. The first images from the repaired telescope are expected in February. Nasa was also keen to point out that the repair mission would bolster the agency's credibility in arguing for at least Dollars 10bn from Congress to build a permanent space station in orbit. It showed how well astronauts can work in space, with miniature electronic components and with bus-sized pieces of hardware such as Hubble itself.</p>

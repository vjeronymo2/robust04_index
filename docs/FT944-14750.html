			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Civil service needs improvement, but not by killing it off Sir, Your leader ('Re-engineering the Treasury', October 20) touched on one of the most important, but least highlighted, elements of the Treasury's cuts announcement - the threat to the notion of an independent UK civil service. Regardless of the failings of the Treasury - which are in any event largely failings of government economic policy - the Fundamental Expenditure Review has a much wider purpose than simply improving the Treasury's strategic vision. In part it represents the political equivalent of scuttling the fleet before it is captured by the enemy navy. The Treasury cuts will seriously damage a future government's attempts to use the public sector and public expenditure in a more positive way. It is also part of the broader objective of restructuring the shape of central government in the UK. It signals the acceleration of the long-term rundown in numbers of civil servants which, together with the break-up of departments into saleable executive agencies, privatisation and contracting out, threatens the very existence of a non-political, independent civil service. Importing inappropriate private sector methods into the public service, without regard for the uniqueness of much public service work or the need for transparent accountability, has already done a great deal of damage. Contracting out and privatisation have also created new problems of quality and accountability which are only just beginning to emerge with a spate of scandals over the last year. This is about to be aggravated with back-door attempts to politicise the service through personal contracts at senior level (what price independent advice then?) and half-baked ideas about linking performance pay to policy work. The British civil service needs improvement in many ways, but this government believes that effectively killing it off represents such an improvement. Unless ministers change their views, this will prove a costly mistake. John Sheldon, general secretary, NUCPS, 124/130 Southwark Street, London SE1 0TU</p>

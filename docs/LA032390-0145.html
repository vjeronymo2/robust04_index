			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> 3 LATINOS IN POLL SUIT SUPPORT YUDELSON  </P> <P> When Republican Curt Pringle defeated Democrat Rick Thierbach in a close race  for the 72nd Assembly District seat two years ago, the victory was marred by  the Republican Party's use of security guards at polling places in Latino  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> That incident promises to remain a focal point in this year's race as well.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Garden Grove businessman Jerry Yudelson, one of two candidates for  the Democratic nomination in the 72nd District race, said at a news conference  that he has the support of many of the district's Latino leaders, including  three plaintiffs in a now-settled lawsuit stemming from the poll guards  incident.  </P> <P> The three plaintiffs -- Tom and Helen Canales and Santa Ana Police Officer Jose  Vargas -- appeared with Yudelson, along with Zeke Hernandez, leader of the  local chapter of the League of United Latin-American Citizens, Sam Romero, a  longtime Latino community activist, and Wally Davis, an attorney and lifelong  Santa Ana resident.  </P> <P> "I kind of feel like Jerry is the little guy's candidate," Romero said. "I've  seen him everywhere."  </P> <P> Yudelson said he has met with Latino groups in the 72nd District on about 40  occasions in the past year and has the support of "80% to 90% of the  leadership" of that community.  </P> <P> Yudelson, favored by county Democratic Party Chairman Michael Balmages,  produced a list of about 20 well-known Latinos who are backing him over his  opponent, former Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg. Umberg is supported by many  past Democratic Party leaders and major contributors, who have been at odds  with Balmages over his leadership style.  </P> <P> Umberg's campaign manager, Bob Stiens, said the campaign would release a list  of endorsements in a week or two.  </P> <P> In the first campaign disclosure statements filed since nominations closed  earlier this month, Umberg on Thursday reported $36,000 in contributions, with  $26,000 unspent. Pringle reported contributions of $160,494, while Yudelson  said he met Thursday's postmark deadline but refused to disclose his campaign  figures.  </P> <P> "I just don't want the numbers to get lost in the shuffle," Yudelson said. "We  have our story that we wanted to put out today, which was the endorsement of me  by the Hispanic leaders."  </P> <P> One Latino claimed by Yudelson as a supporter said Thursday that he recently  changed his mind and is now supporting Umberg.  </P> <P> "I haven't even told Jerry," said Emilio de la Cruz, an outreach coordinator at  Coastline College. "It's not that I think anything less of him. But I've known  Tom for some time. . . . We're both military men, and I told (Umberg) that I'd  be glad to support him."  </P> <P> At least two other prominent Santa Ana Latinos also support Umberg -- Santa Ana  City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. and downtown businessman Rueben Martinez,  a former Democratic Party treasurer.  </P> <P> Both Pulido and Martinez were recently voted out of the county Democratic  Party's Central Committee after they missed at least three monthly meetings in  succession.  </P> <P> Balmages said that the expulsions had "absolutely nothing to do" with the  pair's support of Umberg.  </P> <P> Pulido, whose council meetings are held at the same time as the Central  Committee meetings, downplayed the significance of the vote to oust him and  Martinez, but said it probably was related to their support of Umberg.  </P> <P> Martinez said being voted out of the Central Committee was "a burden off my  back," but he also lamented the party infighting.  </P> <P> "It goes on and on and on," Martinez said. "Meantime, Curt Pringle is getting  stronger and stronger."  </P> <P> However, Amin David, one of Yudelson's Latino supporters, said he did not think  the split would hurt the party's chances of unseating Pringle.  </P> <P> "Our hope is that two major guns attack Pringle, and that's the way it's been  lately," David said.

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A BLUEPRINT FOR TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> * WITH MEASURE M, COUNTY VOTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GOING  </P> <P> Transportation Commission Chairman Dana W. Reed quite accurately describes  Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation improvements in  Orange County, as "practically a contract with the voters."  </P> <P> What this means is that voters will get more from Measure M than mere promises  of improvement. They will get a specific blueprint for where their dollars will  go. In these tight budgetary times, that's important. Voters understandably are  wary of issuing blank checks.  </P> <P> With Measure M, they know exactly what their money will buy; indeed, they quite  literally can drive around the county now and see places where their choice to  approve the measure will pay off in the better flow and management of traffic.  Or they can let their fingers do the walking through the Orange County sample  ballot and voter information pamphlet, which has a precise rundown, with maps,  of all the $3.1 billion worth of transportation benefits.  </P> <P> The $1.3 billion in freeway projects will affect the movements of every person  who drives in Orange County at some point in his or her week. There is also  $350 million worth of regional street and road projects, which include a  220-mile network of arterial streets slated for improvement. Under this  program, regional interchanges will be improved, as will intersections and  signal coordination.  </P> <P> Local street and road projects, including projects for maintenance and  improvement, are scheduled to receive $650 million. $775 million is earmarked  for various transit projects. And passage of Measure M will have the secondary  benefit of bringing in state gas tax and rail bond funds to match local  dollars.  </P> <P> Nobody knows for sure what these benefits will cost average residents; it  obviously will depend on what they spend in retail sales. But Reed's estimate  is a modest $60 a year for a family of three that has an annual income of  between $55,000 and $60,000.  </P> <P> That's not too much for unclogging Orange County and getting it moving again.  Vote "Yes" on Measure M.  </P></p>

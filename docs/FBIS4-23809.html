			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Excerpt] Amidst criticism from his own ranks, President  Mandela this week renewed his commitment to negotiations with  the right wing over a white homeland. His idea is to give the  right wing enough time to realize that an independent state for  Afrikaners is unattainable, writes Z.B. du Toit.    Proponents of a separate state for Afrikaners achieved some  measure of success this week when the Volkstaatraad [homeland  council], whose task it is to formulate a plan for such a state  according to the constitution, met for the first time. This  happened amid growing suspicions that right-wingers are the  target of a long and well-planned maneuver by President Mandela  to do away with the idea of a volkstaat as well as to defuse the  threat of right-wing politics.    The essence of this is that President Mandela wants  right-wingers to come to the realization that the establishment  of a white homeland is an impossible task, or at least to show  them that the idea is so unfeasible that they will abandon it.  For a while now, the ANC has apparently carefully been trying  not to show its strong opposition to an ethnic home for  Afrikaners, with the knowledge that the current delicate  constitutional process should not be exposed to the threat of  disruptive action by right-wingers.  <H5>  No Feasible Plan </H5>   What has led to the ANC finally accommodating the right wing  is the absence thus far of any practical plan for a homeland.  All the major right-wing political parties, primarily  established to promote apartheid, were until recently strongly  opposed to an independent state for Afrikaners. With its  strategy of accommodating the right wing the ANC will also be  able to gain the advantage because of the strong differences in  opinion among those in favor of a homeland. Some are emotionally  committed to a homeland somewhere in the Transvaal and the  Orange Free State, while others are dogmatic in their attempts  to establish one in the northwestern Cape.    During negotiations Mr. Mandela and the ANC threw the ball  neatly into the court of the right wing with their invitation:  Draw up a plan, put it on the table and let us take a look at  it. The ANC must realize that any expert investigation into a  homeland in the north will have to bow down to the harsh reality  of an overwhelming majority of blacks in the region, and  Afrikaners totally dependent on an economy dominated by black  labor. An Afrikaans state in the region will lead to either the  large-scale movement of people or disenfranchisement, the two  biggest sins of apartheid. This is of course not practical.  <H5>  Rejected </H5>   If the Volkstaatraad had to approach the Constitutional  Assembly with such a plan, it would immediately be rejected.  The ANC knows it will have world support when it does this.  The only remaining option is that a relatively uninhabited  region of the country be selected in which Afrikaners can  resettle themselves over a long period so that a white majority  can be assured and a new country established.    If President Mandela wants to do something practical about  his accommodation politics then he could even suggest that such  an area, for example Northwestern Cape, be cordoned off  temporarily as a possible future Afrikaner state. This would  present a challenge to the far-right to develop the area,  including setting up basic services which forms part of any new  state; however, will Afrikaners be able to do this?    The impression is created that President Mandela wants to  find out now if Afrikaners really are in favor of a homeland, if  one takes into account his reference to a referendum among  Afrikaners to test support for a white homeland. It is also  possible that he will wait for the first concrete proposals on  the homeland to be presented so that all Afrikaners are aware of  its content, because the ANC apparently reasons that large-scale  uprooting will be necessary and will not exactly be  enthusiastically received among the majority of Afrikaners.

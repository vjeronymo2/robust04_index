			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. COVINA VOTES TO BAN RECREATIONAL FIREWORKS  </P> <P> Legal fireworks displays are a thing of the past in this city.  </P> <P> Voters doused the use and sale of "safe and sane" fireworks by better than a  2-1 margin Tuesday with a vote of 4,468 to 2,011.  </P> <P> The outcome makes West Covina the 16th San Gabriel Valley city to ban  recreational pyrotechnics. Fireworks are also prohibited in unincorporated  areas of the county.  </P> <P> "Now we can go forward and really take steps to protect our homes, our pets and  our children," said Steve Millar, chairman of Citizens to Ban Fireworks. "The  first year is going to be an education process. Even though we had good support  (Tuesday) night, the general populace is going to have to be better informed."  </P> <P> The City Council outlawed fireworks on a 3-2 vote in August, but a coalition of  veterans groups forced the referendum by gathering signatures from 10% of the  city's voters. One fireworks manufacturer has estimated that the five veterans  groups, the only organizations previously allowed to sell fireworks, made  $120,000 from the sale of pyrotechnics for the Fourth of July last year.  </P> <P> Firecrackers, bottle rockets and more potent fireworks are prohibited in  California. Sparklers, cones and other fireworks that emit sparks but do not  shoot or explode have been deemed "safe and sane" by the state fire marshal and  are regulated by local governments.  </P> <P> On Feb. 7, voters in La Verne upheld that city's fireworks ban by a 3-1 margin.  As in West Covina, the ban was opposed by service organizations and fireworks  manufacturers.  </P> <P> In both referendum elections, ban supporters were outspent by large margins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> West Covina  </P> <P> 30 of 30 precincts, 15.3% turnout  </P> <P> BALLOT MEASURE  </P> <P> Shall West Covina city ordinance No. 1790 banning the sale and discharge of all  fireworks in the city be adopted?  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vote  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,468  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 68.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  2,01  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

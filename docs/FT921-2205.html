			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Letter: Unfair gastronomic comparison Sir, Your Observer column ('Indigestion', March 3) is unfair to say that 3-star Michelin restaurants cost 'an arm and a leg'. They are not unreasonably priced relative to two, one or even some unstarred restaurants and certainly not compared with many London restaurants. For the French, eating out is not a luxury. An evening at the opera is now more expensive. Sometimes the wine is overpriced but rarely the food. P Harrison, Residence Les Iris, 1115 Vullierens, Switzerland</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> EVANS RETURNS TO START AT BAJA  </P> <P> Evan Evans had just driven his Jeep Cherokee to four straight victories in the  production sedan class of desert off-road racing when he went motorcycle riding  one night last July near his home in Riverside, hit a hole in the darkness and  wound up paralyzed from the chest down.  </P> <P> Evans, 24, son of well-known truck racer Walker Evans, accumulated enough  points before the accident that going into the final event of the High Desert  Racing Assn./SCORE International season -- the Baja 1000 -- he needs only to  start the race to win the class championship.  </P> <P> Evans, who spent 3 1/2 months in three hospitals before entering the Casa  Colina Rehabilitation Center in Pomona, was released from Casa Colina only last  Friday.  </P> <P> Today, he is in Ensenada, Mexico, to start the Baja 1000 and assure himself  enough points to edge out Swedish-born Arne Gunnarson of Fallbrook for the  Class 6 championship. The Cherokee has been fitted with special hand controls  for the throttle and brake so Evans can drive.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my  life while I was lying in the hospital, and I decided I wanted to stay in  racing," Evans said from Ensenada. "The doctors advised against it, but when I  insisted, they said OK. At least about this race.  </P> <P> "I'll only drive a few miles because I'm still not in very good condition to  take all the bouncing and jostling you get in an off-road race, but it's a  start."  </P> <P> Evans will turn the Cherokee over to Brian Stewart of Lakeside, son of veteran  driver Ivan Stewart. Brian Stewart will share the long ride the length of Baja  California to La Paz with Phil Farieo of Rancho California.  </P> <P> "Brian has done a terrific job with the car," Evans said. "He won the Gold  Coast 300 with it and that kept me out in front in points because it knocked  the other guys back a spot."  </P> <P> Evans won the Mojave 250, the Mint 400, in which he was the only Class 6 driver  to finish the extremely difficult course; the Baja Internacional, which had to  be moved from Ensenada to San Felipe when ranchers protested the route; and the  Fireworks 250.  </P> <P> Evan, who was driven to the Ensenada starting line Wednesday by his mother,  Dolly, has 127 points to 99 for Gunnarsson, a Saab driver who won the sedan  class in 1982.  </P> <P> "I'd been riding down that road where I crashed since I was 8 years old," Evans  said. "But that day, some construction workers had dug a hole and left it  without any blinking lights or anything and when I rode that night, I ran into  it. The next thing I knew I was laying on the ground."  </P> <P> Evan's father, Walker, is entered in the full-size pickup class. He recently  won the Brush Run 101 in Wisconsin.  </P> <P> In the mini-pickup class, Roger Mears of Bakersfield in a Nissan and Manny  Esquerra of Parker, Ariz., in a Ford will battle for the Class 7 championship.  Mears leads by two points over Esquerra, who has won the past four series  titles.  </P> <P> The complaints that led to the Baja Internacional's being moved have caused a  change in the start of today's race. Instead of racing out of Ensenada east  toward San Felipe in the usual manner, the competitors will parade at legal  speeds for 31 miles to Ojos Negros before restarting race-style and head south  through Mike's Sky Rancho to Camalu and on to La Paz.  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLES -- Motocross rider Jeff Ward of Mission Viejo was honored by the  American Motorcyclist Assn. as its athlete of the year. Ward won the national  500cc championship, becoming the first to win all four AMA motocross titles,  and also rode on his sixth world Motocross des Nations championship team. Other  award winners were road racer Randy Mamola, for his work in the "Save the  Children" program, and Supercross champion Jeff Stanton, who received the first  Mickey Thompson Award of Excellence.  </P> <P> The American Road Racing Assn. will hold a series of Formula One Grand Prix  sprint races Sunday at Willow Springs Raceway. It will be Round 11 in a  12-event series. . . . The second round of the Continental Motosport Club's  Dodge Truck fall series will be held Sunday at Sunrise Valley Cycle Park in  Adelanto.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- When Charley Zabinski of Redondo Beach won the California Racing  Assn. main event last week at Ascot Park, he became the 12th driver to win in  what has been one of the most competitive seasons in CRA history. Defending  champion Ron Shuman remains 49 points ahead of Jerry Meyer going into Saturday  night's 30-lap main event at Ascot. One race, the Don Peabody Classic on Nov.  18, remains after this week.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Three riders -- Bobby Ott, Shawn Moran and Lance King -- who  went from Southern California to the British Speedway League will be in Friday  night's U.S. long-track championships at Ascot Park. Moran won the 1983 world  and 1986 U.S. long-track championships. Also entered for their final local  appearances before racing in England next season will be Mike Faria of Colton  and Billy Hamill of Monrovia.  </P> <P> Defending champion Sam Ermolenko of Cypress is out with injuries, but upholding  the family honor will be Charles (Dukey) Ermolenko.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's western regional series battle between  Robby Flock of City of Industry and defending champion Sleepy Tripp of Costa  Mesa will continue Saturday night in a 50-lap main event on Ventura Raceway's  one-fifth mile oval. The race also counts in the national standings and Russ  Gamester of Peru, Ind., could clinch the USAC championship. He is 139 points  ahead of former champion Kevin Olson of Rockford, Ill., who is also entered at  Ventura.  </P> <P> DRAG BOATS -- The International Hot Boat Assn. will hold its Coors Light World  Finals this weekend on Firebird Lake at Chandler, Ariz.

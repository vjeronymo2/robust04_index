			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Upturn can withstand tax rises, Clarke says: Underlying inflation rate at 26-year low of 2.5% The UK economy is recovering strongly enough to withstand tax increases planned over the next two years, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday. He told the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee that recovery, helped by low interest rates and a 'spectacularly good' outlook for inflation, was 'established and strong enough' to survive the planned fiscal tightening. His comments came as official figures showed the Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - falling to its lowest level for 26 years at 2.5 per cent last month, compared with 2.8 per cent in October. The headline rate was unchanged at 1.4 per cent. Although price pressures in the economy seemed 'pretty well under control', he said the government would take no risks with inflation and would not hesitate to raise interest rates should pressures start to pick up. However, Mr Clarke said he was 'pretty confident that we will not get into trouble' with the government's 1 per cent-4 per cent target for underlying inflation 'in the near future'. He said the real test of the government's policy would be keeping inflation down and maintaining competitiveness once people believed economic recovery was established. Mr Clarke acknowledged that the cumulative taxation effect of the two Budgets this year would amount to between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn in three years' time, or the equivalent of 7p on the basic rate of income tax. He described the tax rises as necessary to bring public finances back in order, adding that the way in which the revenue would be raised was politically acceptable. 'The first thing I had to do was to make sure that we had taken the necessary decisions to deal with the level of borrowing and the public finances,' he said. 'I looked for increases in taxation which were best judged to be supported by the general public and best judged to have minimum adverse impact on the economy.' Mr Clarke said he had no target level for sterling in mind as the government set policy based on a range of monetary and asset value factors.

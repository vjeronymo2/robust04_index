			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares falter as buyers fail to appear FUND MANAGERS continued to churn stock holdings in UK equities yesterday as neither the departure speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, nor warnings against interest rate optimism from the chieftains of the Bank of England, shifted views on the investment outlook. Share prices gave back part of the gains of the previous session but closed well above the day's lows. The stock market appeared unsure of the implications of the formal resignation speech by Mr Lamont, although it agreed that it reinforced the note of political uncertainty which has contributed to the lack of direction in the UK stock market over the past two months. The ex-chancellor's call for an independent Bank of England was seen as fairly routine, and equity strategists were more keenly alerted by warnings against interest rate cuts by both the incumbent and designate governors of the Bank. Some suggested that such apparently concerted comments from the City indicated resistance to political pressures to reduce domestic interest rates. The market was also unsettled by disappointing corporate trading results, especially from Pilkington, the glass manufacturer regarded as a classic recovery stock; the board's comments on progress of the German economy were badly received in London. For much of the session, the equity market was driven, once again, by stock index futures, which dipped to a discount against the underlying equity market at one stage. An early gain of 4 points on the Footsie was recorded immediately after the opening of the index futures market, and share prices soon turned off. At worst the market was down by 12.7 but steadied as Wall Street made a calm opening, showing a loss of 3 Dow points in UK trading hours. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a net fall of 6.9 at 2,860. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been strongly outperforming the Footsie, slipped 5.7 to 3,207.7. Seaq volume fell to 620.2m shares, with non-Footsie business good at around 60 per cent of the total. Wednesday's Seaq turnover of 691.2m shares brought retail business worth Pounds 1.46bn. Among the blue chip internationals, pharmaceutical stocks remained virtually friendless, although Zeneca again stood relatively firm against a generally dull background. The strong feature was Glaxo, after favourable comments on its drug portfolio. Oil issues, too, remained steady, although there was no follow-through to the buying from the US and from continental Europe which drove Shell ahead on the previous day. On the domestic side, consumer stocks displayed little support for the continued hopes that domestic base rates may soon be cut. The optimists continued to claim that UK rates are likely to be reduced for political reasons, no matter what trends develop on the international front. Such hopes are focused on next week's important speech in the City by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer. The less convinced optimists continued to point out that Wednesday's gain has left the UK market still corseted within a trading range of around Footsie 2,770 to 2,890.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Druzenko: "Leonid Kravchuk: Every Day </F> I Repeat Like `Our Father': War Between Ukraine and Russia Is  Inconceivable"]    [Text] Kiev -- In what is to put it mildly a disparate  situation -- the exacerbation of the Crimean problem, the hitch  in dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, battles over the impending  presidential election, and continuing economic slump -- Russian  mass media leaders came to meet with the Ukrainian president and  talk with him "about the present moment." Ostankino will  shortly be showing a recording of this conversation but, given  the interest in what is happening in Ukraine today, I would like  to tell you in brief, as a participant in the discussion, about  the main ideas voiced by the Ukrainian president.  <H5>  The Crimea Problem </H5>   When asked by one of my colleagues whether the problem of  the  Crimea should not be resolved, given its complexity, by creating  the institution of joint Russian-Ukrainian possession of the  Crimea, the president countered with another question: What  might such an institution mean, and is it at all feasible?  Kravchuk remarked after giving not entirely clear explanations  that this idea (or proposal) should come from the Crimean  leadership but, in the opinion of the Ukrainian president, it  would be naive to expect that kind of movement on their part.  Today we are rather talking about the opposite: The Crimean  authorities are first trying to obtain recognition for their  state and then to join Russia. The upshot is that the idea of  joint possession could turn into a situation where Russia would  have 95 percent of the Crimea and Ukraine would have the  remaining 5 percent, to which the latter would naturally not  agree. A normal "civilized" solution is only possible within  the framework of the existing Ukrainian Constitution.  <H5>  The Possibility of a Federal System in Ukraine </H5>   L. Kravchuk was cagey on this issue. He cited the example of  the United States and commented that a considerable amount of  time is needed to create a federal state, particularly if it is  born of of a unitary state like Ukraine. It is primarily  necessary to formalize the legal basis for this process and,  even with a highly professional parliament, this would take  several years. Kravchuk thinks that for the formation of a  federal state on German lines the conditions must be ripe. The  danger of haste here is too great; it could jeopardize the  existing Ukrainian state.  <H5>  The Origins of the Economic Crisis </H5>   The president disagreed with the conclusion drawn by one of  the participants in the meeting that the Ukrainian economy is  terminally sick. Although he did not deny that the slump in  production and the decline in the standard of living are  continuing. Certainly, Kravchuk remarked, plenty of mistakes  have been made in the course of reforms, but nevertheless he  sees the main reason for the crisis as being the fact that  Russia was too quick in making Ukraine pay for power sources at  world prices (incidentally, these resources represent over half  of Ukrainian imports). A particularly dramatic situation  developed late last year when prices of oil and gas rose  10,000-fold in a short time (the president repeated this figure  three times and then added that no economy would withstand that  kind of ordeal). Even had we implemented reforms in an ideal  fashion, Kravchuk summed up this part of the conversation, the  "energy factor," that is an outside factor, would have  nonetheless brought about a critical situation.  <H5>  Back to the Crimean Problem </H5>   "The leadership of Ukraine and myself as president will  never  agree to the use of strong-arm methods to resolve the question  of the Crimea," Leonid Kravchuk said firmly, in the spirit of,  one might say, an official statement. "That would be a great  calamity both for Russia and Ukraine, but calamity would above  all befall our Ukrainian home."    We expect the same attitude to the problem, our interlocutor  remarked, from the Russian leadership and particularly from  Crimea, although there is no confidence about this. The  president said that he takes an extremely negative view of the  appearance in the Crimea of Cossacks from Russia, which he sees  as an attempt to lend the conflict the nature of the "Dniester  scenario" and with which the Ukrainian side resolutely disagrees.  <H5>  Three Main Desires </H5>   When asked which objectives he would be satisfied to see  attained as a politician and state leader, Leonid Kravchuk said  that he would consider his mission accomplished if progress  occurs in the following areas. First, in stopping the slump in  production and achieving albeit slight growth. Second, in  consolidating and rendering irreversible friendly partnership  relations between Ukraine and Russia. Every day, the president  remarked, I repeat like "Our Father": War between our countries  is inconceivable and, no matter what extremists on both sides  do, we must not permit a tragedy; our peoples, our children, and  grandchildren will not forgive us, nor will history. And  finally the president's last wish is to reinforce in the  national consciousness the sense of dignity and escape, as he  said, from the "remnants of slave mentality" inculcated over the  centuries by the empire -- first the Russian and then the Soviet  empire.  <H5>  The Coming Presidential Elections </H5>   Our discussion took place a few hours before the Ukrainian  parliament decided that presidential elections will nonetheless  go ahead 26 June. There is every indication that Kravchuk was  prepared for that decision although the day before he asked the  Supreme Rada to postpone the elections until later. Our  interlocutor is prepared to take part in the presidential  election race.    He was diplomatic about the chances of the contenders,  including his own. Nevertheless, he did conjecture that there  will be no victor in the first round and that a second round  will have to be held. A poll of voters conducted recently in a  number of oblasts showed that 27 and 20 percent are willing to  vote for Kravchuk and Kuchma respectively, while the other  candidates are lagging considerably behind. However, Kravchuk  warned that these figures should not be overestimated: The  situation can change in a day. Although, the president summed  up, there is every indication that he and Kuchma will have a  showdown during the second round.    Our interlocutor refrained from predicting the final  presidential election result.</p>

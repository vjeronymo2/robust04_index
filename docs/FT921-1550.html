			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Leaden rules LONG and deep recessions can wreak havoc on the accounts of the most prudent institutions; the government is no exception. An unexpectedly severe fall in UK tax revenues will push public sector borrowing above Pounds 28bn in the coming financial year, whoever wins the election. But the government accounts are financially sound as yet. There is no reason for a shareholder revolt. Yet the air is thick with accusations of profligacy and declarations of prudence. Labour says the Conservatives are borrowing for tax cuts, while it would borrow to build; the Conservatives say Labour is looking for an excuse for excessive public spending; some commentators say the public finances are fast running out of control. It is the economy, not the government's finances, that is currently in a sorry state. The UK has suffered the deepest recession of any European country; but it also has one of the lowest outstanding stocks of government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. Moreover, both parties are committed to seemingly prudent restrictions on public borrowing. The present government intends to balance the budget over the economic cycle, implying a falling ratio of debt to GDP. A Labour government will 'only borrow for investment' and keep to the Maastricht treaty deficit and debt ceilings of 3 per cent and 60 per cent of GDP respectively. 'Golden rule' Whether their manifestos are promising more than the parties can deliver, in tax cuts or spending, will only be apparent once the recovery is under way. There is no economic case for tax increases this year or next, contrary to the claims made in yesterday's Guardian. It argued that the so-called 'golden rule' that public borrowing should not exceed investment will be violated next year for the first time since records began in the early 1960s. If this really were Labour's golden rule, it would make no sense. There is no reason why the government should not borrow for current spending when tax revenues are temporarily depressed. No sensible government would, or should, require the Treasury to cut current spending or raise taxes to cut borrowing this year, in order to satisfy an arbitrary accounting rule. Nor has the UK government ever pursued such a rule. The general government balance, minus the healthy surplus of public corporations, was in deficit for most of the 1980s. The government's privatisation programme has merely shifted the income from their investment to the private sector in return for a reduction in public debt. Public investment Labour's version of the golden rule must, instead, apply on average over the economic cycle. Even then it would make little sense on the standard definition of public investment. The principal justification for financing investment through borrowing is that such spending generates more tax revenue in the future. Yet much so-called investment in buildings and roads generates no return, unlike some of the supposedly current spending on education and health. Both parties' alternative rules make some economic sense; neither has any compelling logic behind it; and both are open to abuse. How long is the economic cycle? What is public investment? Neither question is answered in the manifestos. What really matters is that a sluggish recovery will constrain either party in government. Growth much below 3 per cent a year would rule out Conservative tax cuts; while most of Labour's spending promises would also remain unfulfilled.</p>

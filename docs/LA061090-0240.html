			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S EMERGING AS THE ACE OF HIS PLACE;  </P> <P> IN HIS FOURTH SEASON, ANGEL LEFT-HANDER CHUCK FINLEY HAS THE NUMBER OF AMERICAN  LEAGUE BATTERS  </P> <P> Throughout his career, Dave Winfield wore uniform number 31. Always.  </P> <P> Through Little League, the University of Minnesota, National League, nine years  in the American League. So, when the New York Yankees traded him to the Angels  a few weeks ago, he naturally asked for 31.  </P> <P> Winfield, baseball's active leader in runs batted in and a 12-time all-star,  wanted it. Pitcher Chuck Finley, who has 11 fewer all-star selections to his  credit, had it.  </P> <P> Finley still has it.  </P> <P> That's not because he is a slave to superstition and not because Winfield  didn't try good-naturedly to coax him into giving it up. Finley kept his number  because Winfield came to realize, as have Angel opponents, that the 27-year-old  left-hander deserves that kind of respect for his accomplishments and for the  boundless potential he continues to fulfill in his fourth full major league  season.  </P> <P> "I felt like I had done things to earn the number," Finley said, not boastfully  but with the quiet self-confidence of a sparkling 16-9 season behind him.  </P> <P> "I wore 31 all during college and the minor leagues. It would be different if  this was my first year or I didn't have success. He and I did talk about it and  he understood. He was very professional. If he wanted it bad enough, he could  have said, 'I want this,' but he didn't."  </P> <P> Firmly as he stood on that point of pride, the 6-6, 212-pound Louisiana native  insisted that the numbers that matter more than those on his back are those he  accumulates by the end of the season. In 1989, those numbers were eye opening.  </P> <P> To complement his career-best 16 victories -- a total only three Angel  left-handers had reached before him -- Finley compiled a 2.57 earned-run  average, second only to Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen of Kansas City.  His nine complete games ranked third-best in the American League and he struck  out 156 batters, the eighth-best total.  </P> <P> Boosted by the addition of a forkball to his curveball and a lively fastball  that can reach 92 m.p.h, Finley stymied left-handed hitters. He held them to a  .172 batting average and no home runs in 199 2/3 innings, while limiting  righties to a .243 average.  </P> <P> "The advent of his forkball pushed him over the hump," pitching coach Marcel  Lachemann said. "It gave him a third quality pitch people had to be aware of."  </P> <P> Being aware of it didn't make it easier to hit. Finley's hits-per-innings ratio  of 0.86 placed him behind such luminaries as Nolan Ryan, Saberhagen, Toronto  veteran Dave Stieb, Oakland's Mike Moore and Boston's Roger Clemens.  </P> <P> Angel catcher Lance Parrish boldly grouped him with another left-hander of some  repute.  </P> <P> "It's hard to draw comparisons, but he resembles Steve Carlton in stature and  effectiveness," said Parrish, who became Finley's batterymate last season.  </P> <P> "Both have, or had, a different repertoire. Carlton relied on his slider and  his fastball. Chuck doesn't throw a slider, but he's got that real effective  forkball instead. It's a deceptive pitch because it looks, coming out of his  hand, like a fastball. He throws it with good arm motion and it looks like he's  throwing a fastball and then the bottom falls out. If he takes a little off, it  works as a changeup."  </P> <P> It changed the course of his career.  </P> <P> "Without it, I would have been in the minors two or three more years," he said.  </P> <P> Instead, he had a brilliant year in 1989, highlighted by his one-hitter against  the Boston Red Sox May 26 in Fenway Park. But even then, he didn't immediately  get the recognition he merited.  </P> <P> Said shortstop Jody Reed, whose two-out single in the eighth ended the no-hit  bid, "You've really got to take your hat off to that Steve Finley."  </P> <P> So what if Reed didn't know his name, or that some people might not know that  the Angels' most successful left-hander this season isn't Mark Langston, whose  services cost them $16-million in last winter's free-agent feeding frenzy. The  Angels' big winner so far is Finley, whose 8-3 record and 2.71 ERA reaffirm his  place among the game's top pitchers.  </P> <P> "I don't know if people know who I am, but I don't really care," he said. "I  know who I am, my teammates know and the guys who bat against me know I'm a  pretty capable, pretty complete pitcher.  </P> <P> "If you go out and do the job enough times, people will realize what you can do  without you saying it. If somebody notices and says, 'Nice game,' it's  gratifying to know you're appreciated. But I don't really need to hear it."  </P> <P> There's no way to know whether the outcome of last summer's title race would  have been different if Finley hadn't injured his left foot Aug. 21 while  warming up for a start against the Royals, but it's tempting to speculate. The  day of his misstep, the Angels were tied for the West Division lead. While he  lost four turns, including the game in Kansas City he left after 17 pitches,  they lost 13 of their next 18 games.  </P> <P> "When I did that, I thought it wasn't a big deal because I was still able to  walk," he said. "Then I tried to pitch, and I just couldn't. I try not to think  about what could have happened. We could have done the same thing (faded out of  the race) with me there. It would be easy to say, 'I wasn't there and the team  was in a skid.' "  </P> <P> A hint of wistfulness crept into his voice.  </P> <P> "I was on a roll and we all were throwing well," he said. "We had a real strong  chain as a pitching staff, and me going down takes one link out of that chain.  The guys did the best they could. They picked it up toward the end but there  weren't enough days left."  </P> <P> That Finley would play so pivotal a part in a title race seemed unlikely as  recently as 1988, when he was 9-15 in his first year as a starter.  </P> <P> "I thought I threw the ball pretty well but the team was kind of going in  different directions," he said. "We'd have a good week and then a bad week. It  was a learning process. It was more like a steppingstone for what was to come."  </P> <P> Not that it appeared he would come to much at all early in his career.  </P> <P> Selected by the Angels in the first round of the secondary phase of the  January, 1985, free-agent draft, Finley didn't make the most favorable of  impressions at a camp for drafted players held at Cal State Fullerton. He was  all elbows, legs and kick the first time Joe Coleman watched him, a fury of  motion and raw power begging for refinement.  </P> <P> "I saw somebody that was 6-foot-6, who was pitching like he was 5-foot-10,"  said Coleman, then a minor league pitching instructor for the Angels and now  their bullpen coach.  </P> <P> "When I saw the first couple of fastballs he threw after he loosened up, I  said, 'Geez, it doesn't look like there's much there.' A few fastballs after  that, I almost swallowed my tobacco. I knew he was special."  </P> <P> He required special attention from the Angels before his vast talent could be  mined. His minor league apprenticeship was brief, 29 innings with Class A Salem  in 1985 and 12 with Class A Quad Cities in 1986, all in relief.  </P> <P> But he used his time well, as Coleman and Lachemann taught him to modify his  delivery so he would be at a more upright angle that took advantage of his  imposing height. He also changed his motion so that he no longer threw across  his body, gaining a better angle on the strike zone.  </P> <P> But he got his real education on the job, in a major league uniform.  </P> <P> "He was a short (relief) man for us because at that time we had very few  left-handers in the organization and no left-handed closers," Coleman said. "We  thought we'd start him out as a closer because we weren't really sure if he'd  develop a good enough breaking ball to get him into a starting situation.  </P> <P> "The next year (1986) he started at Quad Cities, and about a quarter of the way  into the season, Marcel gave me a call asking for left-handers. I told him,  'Right now, the only left-hander throwing good enough is Finley.' He chuckled  and said, 'Let me talk to (Manager) Gene Mauch and I'll get back to you,' and  they said they wanted him."  </P> <P> Told that he'd be moving up, Finley thought that meant double A. It meant the  Show, the big leagues, in the biggest city he had ever seen, New York.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to go to New York, and there I was, coming from Waterloo  (Iowa) and the first place I go is New York and the first stadium I go to is  Yankee Stadium," said Finley, whose hometown of Monroe, La., has a population  of 130,000.  </P> <P> "There were more people in one place than I'd seen in my life. It happened to  be hat day or beach-towel day or something like that and I couldn't believe all  those people. Then you see all those (plaques) on the wall and everything. It  was really something.  </P> <P> "I'm a little more comfortable in places like that now, but I still don't get  too cocky in the city. I stay close to the hotel, but I might venture out every  now and then."  </P> <P> Finley didn't make his major league debut until four days later, May 29. It  coincided with the debut of the late, late show back home, where his parents,  Charles and Sue, thrilled from afar via their satellite dish.  </P> <P> "They got it the first year I went to big league camp, because they had trouble  getting Cablevision out to the house," said Finley, who is close to his family.  "They thought it would be neat to watch Angels games whether I was there or  not.  </P> <P> "Two months later, I told them 'Watch, you might see me.' The day they saw me  on TV in an Angel uniform at Yankee Stadium, my dad said it was worth  everything it cost."  </P> <P> Watching their son pitch late innings in late-starting West Coast games cost  his parents a good deal of sleep. They were as delighted as he was when he  became a starter late in 1987, a season he ended with a 2-7 record and 4.67 ERA  after three starts and 32 relief appearances, mostly as a mop-up man.  </P> <P> "I asked them to make the switch so it would be easier on my mom and dad,"  Finley joked.  </P> <P> Being a starter in 1988 was no laugh. Fifteen of the games he started were  decided by two runs or fewer and in nine of his 15 losses, the Angels scored  two runs or fewer.  </P> <P> "That was experience under fire," Coleman said. "He was 9-15 but he pitched  much better than that, and that was without the forkball. It was his rookie  year, so to speak, as a starter. We knew if we could come up with a third  pitch, he'd be able to turn things around."  </P> <P> It took a considerable effort.  </P> <P> "I never thought it would be easy, that the wins would keep clicking and  clicking," Finley said. "I saw when I was in the pen that you could pitch well  and not win.  </P> <P> "For me, it was a matter of being put in situations I'd never been into. You  can feel you're capable and people can tell you and tell you, 'You can do this  and do that,' but until you do it, well, the only way you're going to get  better or worse is by doing it.  </P> <P> "Things clicked midway through the '88 season. I can't put my finger on what it  was. But I remember a couple of games where I felt completely in control. I'd  get into situations and say, 'I know how to get out of this,' instead of  falling to pieces. Plus I added the changeup (last season), which gave me a  little bit different look and another pitch I could get over for strikes."  </P> <P> He struck out nearly twice as many batters as he walked last season -- 82  walks, 156 strikeouts -- a ratio he has improved this season. In 73 innings, he  has walked 22 and struck out 47, better than 2-1, and more impressive because  he has not consistently had the "stuff" he had last season, whether  lockout-related or otherwise.  </P> <P> For Finley to win by pitching and not by blowing hitters away is another  significant milepost.  </P> <P> "That's an indication how well he's learned how to pitch," Lachemann said.  </P> <P> "Talk to any successful starting pitcher and he'll say he has his good stuff  maybe one-quarter of the time. The ones that end up being really good are  capable of winning when they don't have their good stuff. If you can win half  of those games, or over half, and win a great majority of the ones where you do  have your good stuff, you'll be a good one. If you can't win when you don't  have good stuff, you're going to be mediocre.  </P> <P> "Right now he's one of the premier left-handers in the league and that's pretty  good."  </P> <P> Good though he is on the mound, he seems to have problems completing simple  functions such as walking. A slip on a rain-slicked step in Toronto left him  with a sprained right ankle and cost him a start May 18.  </P> <P> In his next start, May 22, he tried to kick a chair in the dugout after he was  removed from the game, and missed. After being routed by the Rangers June 2 at  Texas before more than 30 friends and relatives, he stomped angrily to the  dugout -- and hit his head on the roof.  </P> <P> "Aw, that was a freak deal," he said. "Two months from now, I could stumble on  the carpet or hit my head on a pipe and people are going to remind me about  what I've done and say, 'What else is going to happen to him?' " "Just because  of the position I'm in, it gets a little more hype."  </P> <P> The position he'd most like to be in is starting a World Series game for the  Angels. A taste of the American League playoffs in 1986, when he made three  appearances and pitched two innings, made him hunger for more.  </P> <P> "I didn't have that big a role that year and now I've got a little bigger part  to play," he said. "That's everybody's goal, to play in the World Series the  first time. Once you're here, you work that much harder to get there. I know  I'm working hard for that and everybody else here is striving for the same  thing."  </P></p>

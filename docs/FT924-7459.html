			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Apprehension as season starts - Michael Smith details the dilemma facing electricity companies IN ANY other industry it would be a cause for celebration. Britain's electricity companies, however, view with apprehension the start today of a results season that will see all of them declare healthy profits - most substantially higher than last year. 'Unless we declare no increases in profits and say we are reducing the salaries of our chairmen, we are bound to get flack,' reflects the financial director of one of England and Wales's 12 regional electricity companies. In the two years since privatisation, the sector has weathered attacks over the size of profits seen by critics as the product of feather-bedding introduced by the government to make the companies' shares attractive. The interim results to be declared by the two generators, the two Scottish companies and the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales over the next month will be closely scrutinised because of the government's energy policy review. The RECs are vulnerable to attack because of their role in the so-called 'dash for gas'. This has seen some join ventures that will lessen the need for coal-fired generation, contributing to British Coal's decision, now under review, to close 31 pits and shed 30,000 jobs. Although these results will tell us nothing about the economic viability of gas-fired power stations, the RECs will come under strong pressure at results meetings to justify their claims that customers will not suffer. High profits would increase the suspicion that companies are too heavily biased towards serving the interests of their shareholders rather than customers. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, has launched a long-term review of industry pricing, and the latest results could affect his thinking. The industry can at least comfort itself with the likelihood that pre-tax profits will have risen less steeply than they did for the first post-privatisation full-year results six months ago. The RECs then recorded an average rise of more than 50 per cent. A figure closer to 20 per cent is likely this time, still leaving room for critics' attacks. The profit out-turns, however, will have only limited value. Electricity use is highly seasonal and some companies first-half profits will be less than a tenth of the yearly out-turn. In addition, the post-privatisation restructuring of the industry and the recession leave plenty of scope for companies to make exceptional provisions and thus reduce the headline profit total. Political pressure may also affect some companies' dividend decisions. High increases run the risk of antagonising politicians and the electricity regulator at a time when critical decisions are being made about the industry's future. Dividend cover is high and most companies are likely to reason that abandoning the policy of strong dividend growth, albeit temporarily, would lead to a loss of shareholder loyalty. Most analysts expect National Power, PowerGen and the Scottish companies to increase dividends by 10 per cent or more, and the RECs by an average of about 12 per cent. National Power starts off the season today with expectations of between Pounds 209m and Pounds 236m at the pre-tax level, against Pounds 202m last time. PowerGen will show a less impressive headline growth tomorrow - analysts expect Pounds 100m against last year's Pounds 97m - largely because of accounting procedures leading to a heavier proportion of profits being reported in the second half. With the generators' income and costs relatively easy to predict because of long-term contracts with British Coal and the RECs, the City will focus on what progress the companies are making with cost cutting, in particular staffing reductions. Profit growth is also assured for the RECs. They enjoy inflation-plus pricing formulae, cost reductions through rationalisation and the likely rise in distribution business which provides more than 80 per cent of profits. Volume growth is likely to have continued, perhaps by about 1 per cent. Demand is high despite the recession; householders are reluctant to cut back on heating and ventilation while the cuts in industry have been partially offset by retailers staying open longer. The recession may have taken a higher toll on some non-core activities, including retailing which made profits for only two RECs last year. In the long term, however, these are sideshows for most companies compared with the potential profits or losses that will accrue from the combined cycle gas turbine power stations most of the RECs are building. Should Prof Littlechild find next month that electricity from some of the proposed stations is likely to cost consumers more than their coal-fired equivalents, company shares will take a far bigger hit than anything which is likely to come out of the interim results.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             POWER PROFITS                        poundsm interim pre-tax  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   92-93*        91-92         % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midlands                         27         24.7              9.3 Eastern                               22         15.4             42.8 London                                17         14.5             17.2 Manweb                                34         27.5             23.6 Midlands                              31           27             14.8 National Power                       226          202             11.9 Northern                              35           26             34.6 Norweb                                36         33.4              7.8 PowerGen                              99           97              2.1 Scottish Hydro                        48           27             77.8 Scottish Power                        94         81.9             14.8 Seeboard                              10            6             66.7 South Wales                           25         20.7             20.7 South Western                         16         13.6             17.6 Southern                              14         13.7              2.2 Yorkshire                             43         33.1             29.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast by SG Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

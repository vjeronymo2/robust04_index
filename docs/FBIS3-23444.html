			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is possible that persons connected to a foreign  delegation in Nicosia are behind the murder of Theofilos  Yeoryiadhis, according to the chairman of the Committee for  Solidarity with Kurdistan.    Investigators are examining this possibility as they  evaluate  specific evidence and information. These people previously  stayed in a European capital and were expelled for their  participation in terrorist acts. According to evidence and  information passed on to the Cypriot authorities, these people  acted on the instructions of the Turkish secret service.    As part of the investigation, police today searched houses  of  foreigners in Nicosia. Furthermore, police are examining  yellow, left-hand drive Mercedes cars to see whether one is the  automobile driven by a foreigner who was asking for information  on Thoukidhidhou Street, where Yeoryiadhis' family lives.  According to evidence and eyewitness descriptions, police are  searching for a man between 30 and 35 years old who is  apparently the perpetrator of the cold-blooded murder.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Call for change in societies' regulation Nationwide Building Society, the country's second biggest, yesterday called for a single qualifying period before society members become eligible for rights and benefits of membership. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said in evidence to the Commons Treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that there was a case for a single statutory test of membership - such as having been an investor or a borrower for two years - which would apply for voting and ownership. While such a change would reduce the number of members eligible to vote at a time when there was increased emphasis on societies' accountability, it would remove some of the anomalies of the current arrangements. For example, In the case of the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society only C&amp;G investing members of more than two years' standing could can receive a cash share of the price, although a larger number of members - including borrowers - could can vote on whether to accept the offer.</p>

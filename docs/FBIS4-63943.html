			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 25, BNS -- The Russia-based AL-KODS  newspaper declines to retract an article accusing Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis of collaborating with the former Soviet  security service.    The information that Ulmanis was a secret agent dubbed Hugo  was given to the newspaper by a former Soviet Union KGB  (Committee for National Security) employee, the paper's  publisher Shaaban Hafiz Shaaban told BNS by telephone.    Shaaban, who is a Jordanian citizen, claimed that the  information was "absolutely reliable" because the paper's staff  had an opportunity to look into the respective documents,  testifying Ulmanis' linkage to the notorious structure.    The name of the article's author, Ainars Vagris, is a  pseudonym of a Russian-Latvian, Shaaban said.    As many as 3,000 copies of the AL-KODS newspaper are  circulated in Latvia. The newspaper's title means "The Sacred  City" and it aims, according to its motto, to "combat Zionism  and its impact on the world politics and economy; to liberate  Palestine from Zionist gangs."    The Moscow Chamber of Information Disputes said May 19 that  AL-KODS was an unlawfully registered publication because the  respective Russian laws barred foreign citizens from publishing  activities.    To protest the article, the Latvian prosecutor general sent  his Russian counterpart a letter on May 18 describing the  publication as libel and injury to the honor and dignity of the  Latvian president and the entire Latvian state institution.    Ulmanis himself has assessed the article as unprecedent  provocation against the Latvian president and the Latvian state.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Exports key for Norway NORWAY'S fragile economy is expected to strengthen in 1993 and 1994, helped by increased exports. But improvement depends on revived world commodity markets, enhanced cost-competitiveness and low wage claims, according to the annual report on the country by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD warned that without improved market conditions for commodity prices the expected increase in Norwegian exports would be at risk. Improved export performance 'will only materialise if competitive gains are not offset by higher wage gains. The still fragile domestic financial situation might also hamper the pick-up of activity, as a further deterioration in banks' balance sheets or failure to restore bank profitability could aggravate the difficulties in financing new investments,' the OECD said. Mainland gross domestic product growth, excluding petroleum and shipping, will expand nearly 2 per cent this year and exceed 3 per cent in 1994, the OECD said. Overall GDP growth is forecast to rise 3.8 per cent in 1994, after a 1.3 per cent gain in 1993. Improved business investment prospects should also contribute to an upswing in economic activity with continued expansion of petroleum production helping to maintain a large external surplus. Norway, the world's tenth largest oil producer with current daily crude oil output of 2.3m barrels, will see petroleum production grow at an annual rate of 6 per cent in 1994, the OECD forecast. The organisation said that Norway's oil-adjusted budget deficit appears now much larger than can be covered by net oil revenues on an ongoing basis. On Norway's banking crisis, the OECD said further reform of the financial system is necessary to restore a healthy and competitive domestic banking industry. Following five years of massive losses, Norway's top three banks have become state-owned.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin article: "Thirty-Three Pages of Arguments </F> `In Favor.' It Is Russia which Needs `Partnership for Peace'  Most of All, Scientists Believe"]    [Text] Scientists from the Russian Center for Problems of  National Security and International Relations headed by  Professor, Doctor of Historical Sciences Sergey Rogov have  prepared a 33-page report entitled "Partnership for Peace and  Russia's Interests." In it they analyzed the political,  military-economic, and military-technical aspects of the NATO  program and made recommendations on the possible terms of our  country's affiliation to this document.    The independent scientists' main conclusion is this:  Russia's long-term geopolitical interests demand the country's  immediate entry into talks with the NATO countries for the  purpose of affiliation to that program. In this regard  "Partnership for Peace" must unfailingly take into account  Russia's special status and role in Europe and the world and its  broad potential for influencing the course of political  processes and ensure the strict observance of its national  interests.    What arguments do the authors of the report present? They  assert that the problem of Russia's participation in  "Partnership for Peace" is primarily a question of defining our  state's place in the new system of international relations which  has developed since the end of the Cold War. Its present  position can hardly be called satisfactory. We have no reliable  allies and partners today. Russia has an urgent need for  integration into the world market as a great power and not as a  "poor relation" or a source of cheap raw materials and labor.    Of course, the scientists say, to be on a par with the other  centers of power in the world arena we must fully implement our  reforms and realize the country's vast economic potential. Only  then will people really take notice of us.    Nor can we forget the foreign policy priorities. Russia,  like any other state, has its own legitimate interests. They  have nothing to do with imperial ambitions or superpower  pretensions but the country's security, that is to say, its  survival and development as a prosperous democratic state,  demands that world political questions that affect us should not  be resolved at the Russian Federation's expense.    The logic of passively waiting for things to happen and of  deliberate "nonintervention" must be alien to us, the scientists  say. On the contrary, it is only Russia's active participation  in the "Partnership for Peace" program which will offer it the  opportunity of exerting practical influence on the architecture  of the future system of European security and of playing a major  role worthy of a great country in it on an equal footing. There  is no alternative here, the scientists argue, and ambiguity  cannot be allowed. Either the Russian and Western military and  politicians cooperate or else a flawed system of suspicion and  hostility will sooner or later prevail. We already know what  that leads to.    Undoubtedly if you analyze the documents forming the basis  of  "Partnership for Peace" you can say that it contains ideological  postulates which are of a declarative nature. A precise  mechanism for maintaining pan-European equilibrium has not been  elaborated or approved yet but nevertheless the values which  they proclaim do correspond to our country's long-term  geopolitical interests.    Furthermore, in the scientists' opinion, NATO's new  strategic concept does not conflict with our country's  interests. It is based on the principles of ensuring the  strictly defensive character of that alliance by reducing the  levels of those forces maintained in a high state of combat  readiness and major groupings, and on focusing efforts on the  prevention of war and on the settlement of crises by peaceful  means.    We are also pleased that NATO has embarked on the sharp  reduction of military spending and the numerical strength of its  armed forces. By 1997 their number in Central Europe will be  down by 50 percent and their naval forces will be reduced by 10  percent. In the scientists' opinion, there is no real  foundation to the current opinion that our participation in the  program will place an intolerable burden on the Russian economy  and will destroy its defense industry once and for all as a  result of the "standardization of arms and military hardware"  which is mentioned in the document.    Within NATO itself such attempts have been made a number of  times but have met with extremely modest success. Each state  which has joined it has staunchly defended the interests of its  own military industry. That is why the French are still flying  Mirages, the Americans their F-15s and F-18s, the Italians their  Tornadoes, and the Germans, among other things, the MiG-29. In  addition, everyone understands that it is effectively impossible  to resolve the rearmament problem in the foreseeable future --  it will cost too much money.    But giving the various countries' armed forces the potential  to operate jointly and creating a unified command and control  system for them, including computerized command and control, is  a different matter. At the technical level, this presupposes  first of all the unification of certain radio frequencies and  the upgrading of receiving and transmitting equipment and, at  the level of organization and training, it means the elaboration  of a broad program to teach personnel a common language and a  single understanding of military commands and terms. All these  things are already happening when joint peacemaking operations  are carried out.    The terms of "Partnership for Peace", the scientists  believe,  are in fact just the outer shell which still has to be filled  with actual content. This may also depend on the joint work of  specialists from Russia and the NATO countries. No initiative  should be dismissed out of hand if we do not want to miss the  boat which will leave for the future without us.    What are the conditions and principles of affiliation to the  "Partnership for Peace" program that the scientists of the  Center for Problems of Russia's National Security consider  acceptable for Russia?    The first is that our country's entry into "Partnership for  Peace" will mean the practical embodiment of the long-term  Russian strategy aimed at moving from military-political  confrontation with the West to strategic partnership with it in  the military-political sphere. In this regard Russia must be  guided by its own national interests without claiming any  privileges but without waiving the legitimate right to equal  security either.    Russia's paramount, priority goal in this program is the  prevention of a new split of Europe, the arms race, and military  confrontation, this time on our western borders -- around  Smolensk and Bryansk. It is only by being part of this program  that Russia will be able to influence the creation of an  all-European collective security system and prevent the rapid  expansion of NATO by means of former Warsaw Pact members.    At the same time, it is necessary to clearly determine what  commitments Russia and the NATO countries will undertake toward  one another. There can be no disagreements or ambiguities here.  Our state is ready to accept the same degree of responsibility  which the NATO members accept toward it. In the process it  expects firm guarantees that if there is a threat to its  national interests, Russia can count on the full support of its  partners. "Partnership" will not hinder the development of close  ties between our country and its Asian neighbors, first and  foremost with China.    Russia cannot accept the idea that the crucial questions of  international security are resolved without its participation  and especially at its expense. Consequently, NATO, of which it  is not a member, must not try to assume the role of an arbiter  of other people's destinies. It is absolutely clear that the  present mechanism of decisionmaking in NATO is inadequate here.  Different, more democratic and mutually acceptable forms are  needed, within the CSCE framework, for instance.    It is also necessary to define the specific forms of  peacemaking cooperation within the "Partnership" framework.  Russia is ready to take part in it under the auspices of the  United Nations or the CSCE and also the CIS. But the kind of  solution in which NATO is its initiator and we merely the mute  executant does not befit to our country. Unilateral steps are  unacceptable here. If all the members of the bloc and the other  European states accept such an approach, world peace will be  reliably ensured.    One of the conditions which our scientists envisage for  Russia's affiliation to the new NATO program is the  harmonization of Western and Russian standards in the production  of arms and combat hardware. Not only must access to the  traditional markets of Central and Eastern Europe not be barred  to our weapons makers but access to the internal markets of NATO  and other countries must also be opened up. Only then will  partnership be real and not merely rhetorical.    The political games surrounding our country's affiliation to  the the process of creating the new Europe, the unpredictable  vacillation, and especially the delay in stating its firm  position with regard to the "Partnership" program and the  signing of the necessary documents, the scientists believe,  could leave us in an impasse from which we will not be able to  escape.</p>

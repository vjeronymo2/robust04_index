			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Weaving a subtle web across Latin America - A posthumous novel by Manuel Puig TROPICAL NIGHT FALLING by Manual Puig Faber Pounds 13.99, 188 pages THE Argentinian writer Manuel Puig died aged 58 in Mexico in 1990. His band of British admirers will welcome this posthumous publication of a novel that shows Puig's gifts remaining to the last at full strength. For newcomers Puig offers a convenient point of entry into the exciting world of contemporary Latin American fiction. But be warned. Puig's novels contain as much aggression, abuse of women, blood and tears as you will find in his better-known Latin American colleagues, Marquez, Vargas Llosa and the rest. The difference is that in Puig violence of content is mitigated by conciseness, ironic humour and a strict Aristotelian sense of form. Puig's favourite trick is his use of reported conversation, diary extracts, newspaper clippings and other forms of documentation to turn the reader into an investigator who has to make sense of events never seen directly. As in crime fiction, and science fiction, whose techniques Puig uses for his own purposes of penetrating complex motivation, the full significance of what happens often emerges only when crucial events have been described over and over again. Puig takes Latin America as a whole for his canvas. His characters shuttle freely throughout the region. Many live in the great cities, Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo, Rio, Mexico City; others inhabit the small towns and villages in tightly-knit communities where poverty is rife. His novels embrace all creeds, classes, ethnic strains, Indian, Spanish, Portuguese. The heroine of Pubis Angelical (1986) is an international beauty and film star, the hero of Blood of Requited Love (1982) is an electrical construction worker. Puig's acute ear picks up rhythms and cadences of speech at various levels of society, from the most affluent to the most indigent, and converts them into revelatory patterns of dialogue. The international scope of his fiction was a spin-off from his career. He was born in 1932 in a small town in Argentina. He read philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires and in 1956 he won a scholarship to study film direction in Rome at the Cinecitta. He worked in films in Rome as an assistant director until 1962. Then he emerged as a writer with a string of 'icily brilliant' novels - in the words of one critic  - such as Betrayed by Rita Hayworth, Heartbreak Tango, and The Kiss of the Spider Woman. Most of them are available here in translation in Faber paperback editions and some have been used as the basis for films and for scenarios performed by fringe theatre and dance groups. The posthumous Tropical Night Falling, well translated by Suzanne Jill Levine, shows Puig at his most adroit and entertaining. It is a sharp social comedy of contemporary life with wry, sad undertones. The protagonists are two Argentinian sisters, Nidia and Lici, both in their early 80s. Lici lives in exile in Rio and Nidia is staying with her after the death of her daughter. They are part of a sizeable Argentinian colony in Brazil, many of whose members are refugees from previous regimes back home. Neither sister is yet senile, and they are both avid consumers of gossip. Their great source is Lici's neighbour Silvia, a younger compatriot of theirs and a psychotherapist. 'She left Argentina during the era of Isabelita' says Lici, 'and the Triple A when they had that campaign accusing all psychoanalysts of being left wing'. Silvia has a husband from whom she is divorced and is in the process of acquiring a lover whom she met during a spell in hospital. If the progress of Silvia's extraordinary amour, vigorously enjoyed during a psychoanalytic conference on a small holiday island off the Brazilian coast, appears to be - somewhat in the manner of David Lodge  - the main subject of the novel, this is a typical Puig feint. It is the sisters themselves whose lives come more and more to engage the reader's attention, their remarkable, continuing vitality, although they are very old, immobile and isolated. That vitality becomes even more apparent in Nidia after Puig plays his trump card - the sudden death of Lici on a visit to her son in Lucerne. Nidia hires a teenage girl to look after her at night. Into Nidia's prosperous bourgeois world enters this creature whose life is lived at bare subsistence level. With the girl's appearance a gentle comedy of old age is finally and decisively shattered by the bloodshed and mayhem that is always waiting to break out of the hidden depths of a society that, on its calm surface, so closely resembles our own.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Lib Dems hit back at race claims by Straw The Liberal Democratic party yesterday hit back at claims by a Labour MP that its leadership had been incompetent when handling allegations of racism among its members in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, tried to stem repeated accusations from Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, following publication of an inquiry's findings last week. Mr Straw said the official inquiry, which was conducted by the Liberal Democrats themselves, revealed 'incompetence or worse' on the part of the party leadership. He highlighted a section of the report that accused Mr Graham Elson, the party's general-secretary, of 'failing in his duty' following the distribution of allegedly racist pamphlets at a by-election this year. Yesterday Mr Kennedy did not deny the allegations in the report, but said that the party had investigated the matter thoroughly following the Tower Hamlets by-election, which resulted in the far-right British National Party winning a seat. He told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'We have been accused of circulating racist literature. We set up an inquiry. It reported, we published it in full and we are taking action.' He accused Labour leaders of covering up an inquiry into their own party's conduct in the September council election. 'Jack Straw, who is accusing us of not having dealt with this properly, knows that Labour has had an internal inquiry,' said Mr Kennedy. 'They are not publishing it and we don't know if they are taking any action.' He added: 'We gather that Labour has looked at its own processes. Why doesn't Labour come up-front and say what its findings are?' However, Liberal Democrat leaders were reported to be furious that Mr Straw had also persuaded Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to refer the allegations against Liberal Democrat councillors to the Metropolitan Police on the grounds of incitement to racism. On Friday night Scotland Yard said that the attorney-general had referred the matter to it, but made no further comment. The Liberal Democrat leadership claims that the referral is 'of a standard nature in response to any such approach from an MP'. The Liberal Democrats said Mr Straw's complaint was passed to the police as a courtesy and without Sir Nicholas taking a view. Mr Straw has also sent a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, demanding to know why he has remained 'uncharacteristically silent' over the issue.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Segni steps up challenge to Italian party MR Mario Segni, the popular leader of Italy's referendum movement, is expected to join forces with the cross-party Democratic Alliance movement this week in a union that could form the basis for a new, broad-based party capable of challenging the majority Christian Democrats for the political middle-ground. Mr Segni, who broke away from the Christian Democrats this year, has been a leading advocate of political reform and clean government. The Democratic Alliance is a loose reformist movement set up by politicians who have left their parties in recent months in protest at corruption and obstacles to political reform. Members include Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, the former Socialist environment minister, and Mr Giuseppe Ayala, previously a leading anti-Mafia judge and now a Republican MP. Delegates at the Alliance's national convention in Florence on Saturday were read a message from Mr Segni suggesting the movement should now move towards transforming itself into an official political party. His message came as tensions within the Christian Democrat party, which has been discredited by the corruption scandal, increased. Ms Rosi Bindi, a regional party leader who has spearheaded calls for reform, proposed at the weekend to make the party's Veneto region the test-bed for change. At a conference in the spa town of Abano, Ms Bindi proposed changing the party's name and adopting a reformist programme. Her demands come just a fortnight before a crucial Christian Democrat national convention, which may mark the party's last chance to agree changes. The party could break up if reform does not come quickly. Pressure on the Christian Democrats to distance themselves from the corruption scandal has been reinforced by the strength of the federalist Lombard League. At its annual meeting in Pontida, near Bergamo, Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, yesterday threatened to declare a tax strike if President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro did not call a general election after parliamentary approval of the 1994 budget later this year. Prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi met senior cabinet colleagues yesterday to discuss the government's budget plans for 1994-1996, to be put to parliament later this week. Next year's budget, usually presented in September but brought forward to July this year, is expected to reduce the estimated L180,000bn (Pounds 78bn) budget deficit by between L35,000bn and L40,000bn next year.</p>

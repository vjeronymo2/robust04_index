			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY EXTENSION COST PUT AT $1 BILLION  </P> <P> A new engineering study concludes that extending the Orange Freeway along the  Santa Ana River from Orange to Costa Mesa would cost $1 billion and that time  is short because the Army Corps of Engineers plans to widen the river in 1994.  </P> <P> The latest study also determined that the $1-billion Santa Ana River flood  control project and proposed freeway extension are physically compatible. The  previous studies did not address the compatibility issue and estimated the  freeway extension's cost at $810 million.  </P> <P> "We figured that it doesn't pay to go any further with the freeway extension  concept unless we know that the two projects are feasible together," said Kia  Mortasavi, project development director at the Orange County Transportation  Commission, which funded the $40,000 study.  </P> <P> But the new study also cautions that coordination of the two projects is under  severe time constraints because several years of design and environmental  studies are needed for the freeway widening, and the Army Corps of Engineers  does not want to delay the river widening.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Road Straddling River  </P> <P> Conducted by Newport Beach-based Robert Bein, William Frost &amp; Associates,  the study recommends a design that would depress the freeway extension below  grade in places where that would minimize its effect on nearby residents but  would elevate it in other places. The study also recommends placing the  northbound lanes on the east side of the river and the southbound lanes on the  west. Alternatives such as an arterial highway built on top of a levee, an  elevated, bridgelike expressway and a dry-weather roadway on the river bottom  were also considered.  </P> <P> The study notes that a bikeway and an equestrian trail are on the river levees,  and concludes that, while the freeway extension would not eliminate them, "it  has to be recognized their setting will be affected."  </P> <P> Currently there is no money for the proposed freeway extension, even though  transportation officials say it is essential to relieve north-south traffic  congestion in the county. County officials are planning to ask voters to  approve a half-cent sales tax increase to help fund such projects, although no  election date has been set. They are also hoping that state highway funding  will increase through an increase in the state gasoline tax or other statewide  revenue measures, including bond sales.  </P> <P> Also, freeway planners have not yet worked out how to merge the proposed  extension with the San Diego Freeway without dumping too much new traffic on  that already-congested freeway.  </P></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Lunch with the FT: Banker with a fine line in bonk chat - Lucy Kellaway is left breathless, after meeting the loquacious and outspoken Janet Cohen 'Can I afford the soupe au poisson? Who am I going to breathe on this afternoon?' Well might Janet Cohen wonder. She could be breathing on merchant bankers at Charterhouse, where she is a part-time director. Alternatively, it might be fellow governors at the BBC. Or colleagues from the various companies and educational bodies where she sits on the board. Or her three children. Equally she might be breathing over the word processor at home as she dashes out 1,000 words an hour on her latest novel or thriller. The afternoon ahead turns out to be a quiet one: back to the office at Charterhouse, with the most immediate task deciding who to ask to the BBC Proms. That leaves her free to have the garlicky fish soup, but she continues to study the italic scrawl on Soho Soho's oversized pastel-coloured menu, considering other options. Her interest is professional. In her spare time she has founded various London restaurants, including the Cafe Pelican on St Martin's Lane, selling out just before the recession. She dismisses monkfish as 'a caterers' fish', preferring the 'panache de sole' and inquiring politely whether the FT's budget runs to it. I tell her that the sky's the limit, although privately I note that Pounds 13 is a bit steep for a small piece of fish. The restaurant, which she explains is owned by a good friend, seems to be neither one thing nor another: too trendy to be a routine expense account place, too pricey to appeal to fashionable young people paying for themselves. She is likewise hard to pigeonhole. Parts of her CV are thoroughly establishment - the legal qualifications, the long career at the DTI, the seat on the board at Charterhouse, the job at the BBC. But the books tell a different story. She has written four racy thrillers under the name of Janet Neel, and is now trying to establish herself as a serious novelist. Last month her latest book, Children of a Harsh Winter, was published - an unputdownable blockbuster about illegal arms deals, philandering MPs, borstal, child abuse, nervous breakdown, wife-beating and lots of sex. I tell her how much I enjoyed her earlier book, The Highest Bidder. She looks pleased and says how much she liked it herself. This extraordinary volume, ridiculed by Auberon Waugh for containing some of the worst writing on record, was a cross between a guide to management buy-outs and Joan Collins. One moment it was explaining the finer details of leveraged finance, the next the solicitor was kicking off her high heels and climbing into bed with a silver-haired cabinet minister. I loved every page of it. I ask her whether we are really meant to believe that sort of thing goes on. She tells me - with considerable relish - about a dinner she had with a group of high-flying women. 'One of them raved about the description of the affair, saying it was so well-described, so accurate. She is a few years older than me and frightfully distinguished. She explained that the same thing had happened to 'a friend', but you could see it wasn't a friend at all.' In the book, a private detective is hired to find out what is really going on between the politician and the solicitor - a bit far-fetched, I thought at the time. But Cohen insists that a similar thing happened to her when she was involved in the privatisation of a national industry. Her (perfectly innocent) friendship with a senior official was deemed so fishy that private detectives were set on him. Cohen's women friends may have loved the risque detail, but what did her staid colleagues at Charterhouse make of all that heavy breathing? 'They encouraged me to put more sex in so that it would sell better,' she says. 'They are very unstuffy. It's partly because they are Jewish, and are used to being kicked around by women.' She proceeds to tell me that Victor Blank, the chief executive, secretly believes that women should stay at home, but is so accustomed to being yelled at by his wife, that he does not turn a hair when he gets similar treatment in the office. 'He is used to strong women who speak their minds,' she says. Janet Cohen does not exaggerate about speaking her mind. As we discuss her varied career she says uncomplimentary things about every line of business she has been in. Over the years she has hopped from 'one bastion of male prejudice to another', and has concluded that all men of her generation - she is 54 - are misogynists. The construction industry, where she worked in her 20s, and where her husband works now, is a hotbed of fraud. Merchant bankers she describes as 'a funny, uniform lot of people. Not very deviant'. From her this does not sound like praise. As for ministers and civil servants, she is full of indiscreet tales of men 'making policy on the hoof with their left hand'. She receives her fish without comment and eats it quickly, telling me as she does so, an anecdote (which I do not quite follow) about a meeting between a cabinet minister and the chairman of a big engineering company. 'It was riveting to watch two grown men not speaking the same language,' she says. The point of the story is clear: it was she who brought them together and did the deal. Neither does the BBC get off free. She talks about the amazing professionalism, and likens it to 'a well- run bit of the army'. She professes great respect for John Birt, but cannot resist pointing out that he 'does not have a terribly user-friendly personality. He comes over as slightly autistic. But it's a good mind.' Greatly diverted by my lunchtime companion and amused by her indiscreet stories, I am nevertheless beginning to wonder if she is a bit of an exhibitionist. As the conversation moves on to Children of a Harsh Winter, I see that she not only knows her own need for attention, but has devoted the book to people like her. The premise is that people who have had a bad start in life often become very successful, usually in areas where they get a lot of attention. 'They crowd the expressive professions. They go into politics, acting, writing, certain kinds of business, running a media empire rather than a steel mill.' The BBC, she says, is crawling with them. She comes to know about these deprived children because she was one herself. At the age of four her mother had a prolonged spell in hospital. At 11 her father died, and her mother went away. 'I was left with a housekeeper and two distraught brothers. Nobody had any time to worry about us. You end up thinking: I want everyone's attention after this.' She relates this in the brisk way that she relates everything, and does not change the tone of her voice to say to the waiter that she will not have pudding but would like a large espresso. I protest that the book makes it look as if all children with difficult childhoods do well. She admits real life is not like that and tells me (rather too casually) about the disasters her two younger brothers have made of their lives. Still, she insists that there is a syndrome there (the Russian proverb is: 'children of a harsh winter grow up strong'), and says she can spot them anywhere. 'Am I one?' I ask. She requests details of my job history, which I provide. 'The fact you went for journalism suggests it,' she says. 'But you've had a rather steady career, not too flashy. You do have a column with a photo on it, that is attention-seeking and usually means a difficult childhood somewhere.' My childhood was fine, I tell her, but she does not seem bothered. As the bill arrives we talk about her career as a restaurant proprietor, and she, child of a harsh winter to the last, tells me how much fun it was to be called Madame at the Cafe Pelican and how there is not a member of the cabinet she has not lunched with there. On the way out we go to the lavatory together, having drunk a certain amount of wine, and an even greater amount of water. She keeps up the chat from the next door cubicle, telling me authoritatively that the Evening Standard's early account of that day's cabinet reshuffle was pure gossip. Out in the blazing heat she insists I take the first taxi, and waits for another to bear her back to the bank.</p>

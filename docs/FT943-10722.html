			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart warns on profits Shares of Lionheart fell 1 3/4 p to 7p yesterday after the Cheshire-based manufacturer of paintbrushes and bathroom fittings, announced a boardroom reshuffle and issued a profits warning. The company said that its results for the first half of the current year would be 'materially lower than anticipated' reflecting 'cautious and erratic consumer demand'. A recent review of operating expenses led to annualised savings of some Pounds 2m, the company said, and a reduction of more than Pounds 400,000 in annualised head office costs via a restructured board. Mr David Railton, operations director, Mr David Kay, finance director and Mr Michael Tuttle, a non-executive director, have all left the company; Mr Mark Walker, previously financial controller, has been appointed group finance director. The consequent redundancy and restructuring costs will be charged to the first half results. Albert E Sharp, the company's broker, revised its interim profits estimate down from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 500,000 pre-tax and anticipates a provision of about Pounds 700,000 to cover the costs. In March, Lionheart announced a return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.77m for the 1993 year. Mr Paul Lever, chairman, said at that time that an acquisition was likely 'within months'.</p>

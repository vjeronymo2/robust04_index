Previously, there was a common understanding in society;  that  is, whenever the CPC propagated unity within the party on a  grand scale, it meant that there were problems concerning the  issue of unity.    Today the CPC is behaving more honestly and has refrained  from saying a lot of high-sounding words. In stressing the  necessity of unity, instead of using the tune of propaganda, it  admitted the existence of differences and disputes.    The issue of unity within the party's Central Committee is  very serious as well. Deng Xiaoping recently talked about this  issue, which reflected that organizational crises also exist in  the party and government organs, including the Political Bureau,  the State Council, and so on.  <H3>  Jiang Zemin Relayed Deng's Remarks on Unity Within the Party  to Senior Officials </H3>   The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an  enlarged meeting, the first in 1994, in Zhongnanhai on 20 and 21  January. Present at the meeting were members and alternate  members of the Political Bureau, secretaries of the Central  Secretariat, members of the Central Military Commission, state  councillors, some vice chairmen of the National People's  Congress [NPC] Standing Committee and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and some  persons in charge of central departments and commissions. At  the meeting, Jiang Zemin transmitted to the participants remarks  that Deng Xiaoping recently made on the issue of unity while in  Shanghai. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "At present, both  the domestic and international situations are favorable to us.  The question is how we can further emancipate our minds and  tightly seize and treasure the current rare historical  opportunity to push forward reform, tackle the difficult  problems in the course of reform, and maintain sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic growth with a view to achieving the  second-step strategic objectives of the national economy and  social development. I repeat: The crux now lies in the unity  of the central leading body. It should be a genuine unity aimed  at a common goal. Unity is necessary for the Political Bureau,  the State Council, the NPC Standing Committee, and between the  State Council and the NPC Standing Committee."    Deng also said: "The Communists must always place the party  character and the cause of the party and people in the primary  position. Review and examination on this issue should be  conducted frequently. If the issue of unity is properly  resolved, what difficulties cannot be surmounted? What problems  cannot be tackled? The political intervention and economic  sanction of the hegemonism and the subversion of the  antagonistic forces will be totally defeated by us."    Deng Xiaoping's remarks are clearly aimed at something. He  said in early October last year: "Unity is necessary within the  central leading body. Members of the leading body should not  think that they are always right and therefore refuse to accept  others' merits. Many problems have cropped up because some of  them do not pay serious attention to party character and the  sense of responsibility for our cause so that they have not been  able to forge a solid unity."  <H3>  Contradictions Escalated After the New Body of the State  Council Was Formed </H3>   At the beginning of last December, the Political Bureau made  a decision that Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, with the coordination  of Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Yang Dezhi, and Gu Mu, should have talks and  exchange views with Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing of  the State Council and some vice chairmen of the NPC Standing  Committee, including Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li  Ximing, Chen Muhua, and so on. These people are the leading  stars who have been contending with one another to play their  roles in the farces.    Since the conclusion of the 14th CPC National Congress held  in November 1992, tension has surfaced in the new CPC Political  Bureau and Secretariat. In April 1993, the contradictions  escalated in the wake of the formation of new leading bodies of  the State Council and the NPC Standing Committee. They are  reflected in the relations between Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and  Li Lanqing; between Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Bingqian;  between Tian Jiyun and Zou Jiahua; between Li Lanqing, Wang  Bingqian, and Chen Muhua; between Wang Bingqian and Chen Muhua;  between Ding Guangen and Wei Jianxing; between Li Tieying, Wang  Hanbin, and Ren Jianxin; and between Tian Jiyun and Chen Xitong.  At meetings, they took advantage of discussions on work and  policies to criticize and attack one another. The most  prominent instances were the attack on Tian Jiyun from all sides  and the censure against Zhu Rongji.   <H3>    Zou Jiahua Indirectly Criticized Tian Jiyun for Lacking  Party Character </H3>   At a group meeting during the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, Zou Jiahua said: Quite a few tasks  have not been performed on schedule. In many cases, it is  because the relevant legislation has not been enacted, but in  some there were man-made reasons. Some people have talked about  the legal system more glibly than others, but what did they do  in reality? When the people who are responsible for economic  work in the NPC Standing Committee went to the grass-roots  units, they often made unrealistic comments as well as open and  groundless criticism against other comrades instead of  conducting investigation and study or holding discussions with  the relevant departments of the State Council and the  localities. As members of the Political Bureau, do these kinds  of actions demonstrate their party character? Have they not had  an impact on others? Did they ask the Political Bureau and the  chairman of the NPC Standing Committee for instructions before  making such comments? Here, Zou Jiahua referred to Tian Jiyun's  speech made during his inspection in Hunan Province, which, in  Zou's opinion, "had gone a bit too far."  <H3>  Wang Hanbin and Others Reported Tian Jiyun to the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection </H3>   Last October, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li Ximing, and Ni  Zhifu, among other people, reported to the Central Commission  for Discipline Inspection that Tian Jiyun attacked other  Politburo members by innuendo when talking with some members of  the NPC Standing Committee in the name of Jiang Zemin and Qiao  Shi, that Tian received remuneration for writing inscriptions  four times without reporting the matter to the leadership, that  Tian's family was engaged in speculative stock activities in  Shanghai and Shenzhen, that Tian found an excuse to travel in  Europe with a certain delegation using public funds, and so on.    Later, approximately 20 state councillors, ministers, and  members of the NPC Standing Committee jointly wrote a letter to  Jiang Zemin and Deng Xiaoping, saying that Tian Jiyun spread  rumors among the cadres in various ministries and commissions to  this effect: He is a target to be squeezed out, he has been  assigned the position on a temporary basis, and the rising stars  in the political arena are Zhu Rongji, Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, and  Zhang Wannian.    Deng Xiaoping gave his written instruction to the effect  that, if people had different opinions, it would be better for  them to sit down and exchange their views. Will Jiang Zemin,  Qiao Shi, and Hu Jintao have a talk with Wang (Hanbin), Zou  (Jiahua), and Tian (Jiyun)?    A source said that Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, Tian Jiyun, Wang  Hanbin, and others often wrangled at Politburo meetings, and  many times Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Chen Xitong, Zou Jiahua, Li  Lanqing, and so on left ahead of time during the debates at the  Politburo and State Council meetings.  <H5>  Li Lanqing Attacked Zhu Rongji Without Mentioning Him by Name </H5>   At a group meeting of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, Li Lanqing assaulted Zhu Rongji without  mentioning him by name. Li said: Even though I am a vice  premier, I am not very clear about some of the views that the  State Council maintains. However, there was such a comrade who  issued directives and made decisions the moment he took up his  post, and on what grounds did he act like that? I should like  to ask whether he did so after collective discussions. We still  need principles in giving guidance to the economic work. At  present, central regulation and control at the macro level has  had a certain effect, but the problems have not been  fundamentally resolved. How can we say that the desired result  has been basically produced? The central authorities do not  hold such a view, and no resolution on this has been made. Li  Lanqing's above remarks were directed against what Zhu Rongji  and Guangdong's leaders had said earlier.    The discord within the Political Bureau and State Council  naturally has shocked Deng Xiaoping. Deng asked the general  secretary to act as a mediator, and other CPC elders also made  their positions known one after another upon being informed of  the above situation, hoping that they would turn big problems  into small ones and small ones into nothing. Wan Li and Yang  Shangkun have aired their opinions in this connection.  <H3>  Wan Li and Yang Shangkun Aired Their Opinions on the Discord  Among the Senior CPC Officials </H3>   When talking with some Politburo members, state councillors,  and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee in early  December last year, Wan Li pointed out: In my opinion, the fact  that senior officials within the party are on bad terms owing to  different views primarily originates from individualism, whereby  some people drew over others to attack and criticize a certain  person at meetings, and went on to engage in a cross attack by  writing joint letters after the meetings. By so doing, they  have concentrated their energies on the evil affairs and, as  things go on, they will be engaging in sectarianism. This is  very dangerous and has seriously damaged the authority of the  central leadership.    During his meeting with a group of former members of the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection coming to spend  their holidays in Zhuhai at the Zhuhai Hotel on 22 January, Yang  Shangkun said: The central authorities should resolve the issue  of unity in order to maintain the authority of the central  leadership. Only by so doing can the party's line be  comprehensively and actually put into practice.    According to an informed source, Wan Li's view that the  internal conflicts within the party "will develop into  sectarianism" was not overstated. Conversely, he did not say it  bluntly. As a matter of fact, sectarianism has existed because  there are a number of people in the Political Bureau and State  Council who want to elbow out Tian Jiyun and attack Zhu Rongji.  Of course, this is a comparatively outstanding aspect of the  contradictions and not the whole of them.    It is no wonder that Deng Xiaoping is very anxious about the  issue of unity within the party Central Committee. If a solid  unity cannot be forged or the contradictions further develop  when the old man passes away, can he prevent and stop the  outbreak of "disturbances" or "drastic changes" from the nether  world?</p>

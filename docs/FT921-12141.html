			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aukett Aukett Associates, the architectural and design group, saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 360,000 in the year to September 30. However, Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, pointed out that the fall was exacerbated by a Pounds 700,000 exceptional provision against the investment in Albert Bridge House, a joint development project. He added that turnover decreased to Pounds 16m (Pounds 18m) but that the total work done amounted to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 17.7m), a fall of only 12 per cent. A recent Royal Institute of British Architects survey, he said, showed that workloads were down by an average of 40 per cent. After tax greater than the pre-tax figure at Pounds 403,000 (Pounds 772,000), losses per share emerged at 0.32p (earnings 8.01p). The final dividend is reduced to a recommended 0.5p (2.75p) for a total of 1.75p (4.25p).</p>

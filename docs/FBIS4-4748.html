			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- There is no problem with  the government's procedures for buying grain, the farm minister  said Friday [1 April], commenting on an ASAHI SHIMBUN report  that the Food Agency sets import shares for grain traders who  then collude on bids.    Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries  did not deny, however, the newspaper's report that the agency  informs trading companies of their share ahead of grain  auctions. He said the procedures have been applied to imports  of wheat, but not to the government's recent emergency imports  of rice.    Hata said that allotting shares for trading companies ahead  of grain auctions "prevents excessive competition among trading  firms and therefore puts a stop to excessively high or low  prices." He said, however, that "improvements must be made  where necessary," noting that the general public, unlike  experts, might find it difficult to understand the procedures  and could feel suspicious.    In its Friday morning editions, the ASAHI said that the  Agency gives written notifications to trading companies twice a  year as to the share each will have in upcoming grain auctions.  The daily said it obtained a paper dated October 1, 1993, sent  from the director general of the Agency to one company stating,  "We notify you that we have decided on the following," and  giving the percentage share the company was to have in the wheat  auction in latter half of fiscal 1993.    After receiving the Agency's notifications, the trading  companies routinely confer among themselves so that their bids  would be in line with their allotted shares, the newspaper said.    The ASAHI noted that such government instructions and  "bid-rigging" have gone on for decades, and indicated that the  practice was at the expense of the public.</p>

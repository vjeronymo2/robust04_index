			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Hunt issues fresh warning on pay rises The government yesterday stepped up pressure on companies to exercise wage restraint, after City bonuses and rising overtime helped push earnings significantly higher in March. Average earnings rose by an underlying rate of 4 per cent in March, compared with the previous March, provisional figures from the Department of Employment yesterday showed. This was a quarter of a point higher than February's growth figure, which was yesterday revised up from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. It was also higher than most market expectations, which had predicted a rise of about 3.75 per cent in March. The Department of Employment said the increase was mainly due to rising bonuses and overtime, rather than wage settlements. These had accounted for about three-quarters of the 0.5 per cent difference between the original February figure and the new March figure, the department added, noting that bonuses in banking and finance had played a particularly significant role. But coming after the Bank of England's comments last week indicating that average earnings could be a source of inflationary concern, the figures triggered a round of warnings about rising wage costs. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'We have got to get the message over to business that they have to control their costs, especially their wage costs, if we are to remain competitive.' Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, warned that the rise suggested that 'employers will have to devote more attention to the whole pay package, including bonuses and allowances, not just (wage) settlements'. The concern was echoed by City analysts, who pointed out that in spite of the role played by bonuses, the fastest rise in average earnings in March was in the production sector, where earnings were 5 per cent higher than the previous year. This compares with an underlying increase of 3.75 per cent in the service sector. As a result, unit wage costs had continued to rise, and were 2.5 per cent higher than the previous year - a level last reached in July 1992. Meanwhile, productivity had remained fairly flat in the last three months, some 2.6 per cent higher in March than the previous year. Mr Paul Turnbull, chief economist at broker Smith New Court, said: 'In the context of the Bank of England's remarks last week, these earnings figures will bolster worries that interest rates will have to go up soon.' Figures from Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation show that private-sector earnings in March were rising at twice the rate of inflation while continuing restraint in the public sector has held rises to 0.8 per cent below inflation. Mr Trinder said the government was being far too complacent about the upward movement in private-sector pay.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BSG hit by slowing orders and recession BSG International, the vehicle distribution, childcare products, motor and aviation equipment group, yesterday blamed a 27 per cent decline in 1993 operating profits on falling demand for automotive and aircraft components. The Midlands-based group saw operating profits fall Pounds 5m to Pounds 13.2m as its businesses suffered under the twin impact of recession in continental Europe and slowing orders for new aircraft. Although pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 10.6m from a restated Pounds 7.5m, the group said this increase was due mainly to a Pounds 1.6m profit on the sale of one its Midland plants and reduced interest payments. Mr Richard Marton, chief executive, said pre-tax profits would have been higher had it not been for Pounds 1.1m of redundancy and restructuring costs, mostly at its Rumbold aircraft interiors subsidiary where the workforce was cut by 10 per cent to 750. The company, part of the group's consumer and special products division, suffered from a 20 per cent reduction in new aircraft under construction. The division, which also saw recession hit demand for its childcare products in Europe, reported a 43.6 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 4m. Automotive components, previously the group's largest division, endured an even sharper fall as operating profits slumped 62.2 per cent to Pounds 2.7m. Mr Marton said: 'We're being dragged down by problems in Europe. The car market is in a mess and will remain so for the rest of this year.' The problems were partially offset by an upturn in UK vehicle registrations and used car sales, which helped the vehicle distribution and leasing business increase profits by 62 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.1m). Together the three divisions lifted group turnover to Pounds 573.9m (Pounds 555.1m). Mr Marton, meanwhile, said the group was committed to disposals of peripheral businesses. 'We want to eliminate the problem areas of the group as far as possible,' he said. Earnings per share came out at 2.43p (1.57p) and the final dividend in unchanged at 2.5p, maintaining a 3.2p total. COMMENT Despite BSG's disappointing operating performance, its shares fell just 1 1/2 p yesterday to 77 1/2 p. The market's flat reaction reflects a willingness to believe that BSG will make the right restructuring decisions. Although the company remains tight-lipped about its intentions, it is thought to be reviewing some of its operations in continental Europe and how to extract greater earnings from its core businesses. Forecast pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 16m indicate that BSG is at the bottom of its business cycle and should benefit from new orders, but on a multiple of 18.9p, the shares remain an expensive option.</p>

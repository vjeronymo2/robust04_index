			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEMIRKANOV BRINGS UNIQUE STYLE TO CENTER;  </P> <P> CONDUCTING: MOST ORCHESTRAS REVEAL EITHER ABSOLUTE DISCIPLINE OR A WILLINGNESS  TO TAKE EMOTIONAL CHANCES. LENINGRAD PHILHARMONIC CONDUCTOR YURI TEMIRKANOV  DEMANDS, AND GETS, BOTH.  </P> <P> Music is the art of time. And it usually takes time for any conductor, even an  eccentric one, to establish an interpretation. A downbeat must be given, a  tempo suggested, momentum established, guidelines set, so that the players get  off together. It always takes a few bars.  </P> <P> But Yuri Temirkanov had no use for an upbeat or any other of the preliminary  conductorial niceties as he led off the first of four Leningrad Philharmonic  programs in Carnegie Hall last week -- programs that will be repeated Sunday at  the Orange County Performing Arts Center and later at the Los Angeles Music  Center.  </P> <P> Conducting batonless, he simply lifted his right hand over his head, palm open  and facing toward the ceiling, and like a magician pulling a sound unexpectedly  out of a hat, he brought in the trumpet solo that begins Prokofiev's  "Lieutenant Kije" Suite.  </P> <P> The hand remained raised throughout the solo, undulating slightly to shape the  phrase and seeming to encourage supple expression out of it. But there never  was a beat, a tempo, even a real cue.  </P> <P> When asked about his extraordinary podium technique a day after his Carnegie  appearance, the conductor, relaxing in a borrowed Upper West Side apartment,  put down his cigarette, got up from his sofa and began conducting the  interviewer. First he beat out the "Kije" trumpet solo exactly, demonstrating  how up-tight that can make a player and how it will likely constrict his sound.  Then he showed the advantage of simply encouraging him to play and letting the  music sing forth.  </P> <P> "If you give him an order to play, he tightens up," Temirkanov explained  through his interpreter. "But if you invite him, he is free. We've decided how  it will be in rehearsal. So it is my job in performance to create the right  mood."  </P> <P> Temirkanov admits that he is sometimes accused of theatricality for such  methods. But he defends that accusation by describing the conductor's job  during performance as being akin to an actor's. He must create the atmosphere  for both audience and the players. If there is humor, as there is in "Kije,"  then he finds it not just appropriate but necessary to clown around on the  podium. But in Tchaikovsky's stormy "Manfred" Symphony, Temirkanov becomes the  demented poet, egging the orchestra on to give its most Angst-ridden response.  </P> <P> How the orchestra responds to such a conducting style is another matter. It is  a musical approach that presupposes absolute orchestral discipline along with a  willingness to take emotional chances. And orchestras are generally comfortable  with one or the other of those approaches, but the Leningrad players seem  unusual by excelling in both at the same time.  </P> <P> The 51-year-old conductor from the Caucasus has been the music director of the  Leningrad Philharmonic, the Soviet Union's most celebrated orchestra, for only  two years. Temirkanov, whose irrepressible outspokenness often got him in  trouble during more repressive times in the Soviet Union, claims that the  orchestra was in shoddy condition when he took it over. He says that the  legendary Evgeny Mravinsky, who headed the orchestra for exactly half a century  up to his death in 1988, had, in his last years, become too old to sustain  orchestral discipline but too authoritarian to share any of his control.  </P> <P> So, Temirkanov notes, his first task was to rebuild the ensemble, which has  meant replacing a number of players. Temirkanov has had to fight hard to  improve living conditions for musicians, since his orchestra, like all Soviet  orchestras, must contend with a constant drain of its best players attracted to  the West. But then, Temirkanov, who is known as the bad boy of Russian  conductors, has never accepted conditions he didn't think proper.  </P> <P> He says that he is now free to conduct whatever he wants. "The old system has  collapsed. There is no new system and there is complete freedom." But the old  system never stopped him anyway.  </P> <P> "I am proud to say that I never obeyed when something that I wanted to do was  forbidden," he says, a big, red copy of "KGB: The Inside Story," sitting on his  coffee table. "It was a risk for my career, but I always conducted what I  wanted to.  </P> <P> "For example, once I wanted to conduct Shostakovich's 'Jewish' cycle, and the  performance was to be on the ninth of May, which is the day we celebrate  victory over Germany in the Second World War. I was advised not to do it, and  particularly not on that day. But I still did it and got away with it."  </P> <P> Now, however, Temirkanov's challenge is more for continuing tradition than  breaking with it. He has sought to maintain the famous Leningrad sound,  Leningrad being long noted for the string players its conservatory produced  with their full, rich tone. The conductor complains that international  uniformity is creeping into the Russian musical soil just as it is everywhere  else.  </P> <P> Yet, Temirkanov also says that it doesn't matter nearly as much where the  players come from as what the conductor requires of them. Although the  Leningrad Philharmonic well may be one of the last great orchestras that plays  with real national personality, Temirkanov claims that his performances with it  differ from those with the Western orchestras he regularly guest conducts only  in that he and the players have come to know each other so well.  </P> <P> That may be; Orange County and Los Angeles audiences will have a rare  opportunity to judge for themselves. Not only is Temirkanov dividing four  Leningrad Philharmonic programs, all devoted to Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev, with  the orchestra's associate conductor, Mariss Jansons, but he will return to the  Music Center next month for two programs with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  </P> <P>  The Orange County Philharmonic Society presents Yuri Temirkanov conducting the  Leningrad Philharmonic in a concert of works by Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky  Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center  Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $18 to $50. A free concert preview with Burton  Karson, professor of music at Cal State Fullerton, begins at 1:45 p.m. at the  Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, 666 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa. Information: (714)  556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

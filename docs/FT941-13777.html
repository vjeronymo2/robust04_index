			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rethink building allowance 'defect' Sir, In a press release of January 13, the government announced that it proposes to introduce legislation to 'rectify a defect' in the legislation relating to the allowances attaching to commercial buildings in enterprise zones and industrial buildings elsewhere. The supposed 'defect' is that the owner of such a building who becomes entitled to capital allowances may dispose of a valuable interest in the property, through a long lease, without a clawback of capital allowances. However, to anyone with a modicum of financial awareness, that supposed defect is not a defect at all. Additionally, the fact that investors in such buildings are able to make such a disposal was specifically recognised by legislation enacted in 1978 (Section 37 of the Finance Act 1978). The enterprise-zone allowance is a government subsidy given through tax shelter. It is, perhaps, ironic that such a subsidy is very often useless to a person who may wish to occupy a building constructed in an enterprise zone. They rarely pay full rates of corporation tax. The market, however, provided an answer. A whole industry has grown up around making efficient use of tax allowances but this does not comprise a raid on the Treasury. The arrangements simply ensure that the benefits granted by government are utilised to subsidise the cost of construction of enterprise zone buildings. This has a two-fold effect. First, it means that a building is constructed where otherwise it would not be. In other words, investors may take a risk where the cost is tax subsidised. Second, it means that rents, or premiums on long leases, paid by occupiers are reduced. After all, rents, or premiums, are the method by which investors recoup their investment. Lower investment costs mean lower rents or premiums. Any amendment of the sort announced will not itself stop investments based on enterprise zone or industrial buildings allowances. It will, however, make some form of financing more difficult to structure, meaning that lawyers, accountants and bankers will charge higher fees. The proposed amendment was announced by Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury but I instinctively feel that this is not his 'bright' idea. No matter who thought it up, I would urge the government to think again. David Daws, tax partner, Richards Butler, Beaufort House, 15 St Botolph Street, London EC3A 7EE</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GAP BETWEEN U.S. RICH, POOR RISES SHARPLY  </P> <P> The gap between rich and poor widened so much in the 1980s that the richest 1%  receive nearly as much of Americans' total income after taxes as do the bottom  40%, a liberal research group said today.  </P> <P> The bottom 40% will receive 14.2% of total after-tax income received by all  groups this year, while the top 1% will receive 12.6%, the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities said.  </P> <P> "This marks a sharp change from 1980, when the top 1% received half as much  after-tax income as the bottom 40%," according to the report, which was based  on an analysis of Congressional Budget Office data on income and taxes.  </P> <P> The share of income going to those Americans in the middle of the income scale  is lower than at any time since the end of World War II, the center said.  </P> <P> The report also said the richest 2.5 million people have nearly as much total  income as the 100 million Americans with the lowest incomes.  </P> <P> Robert Greenstein, executive director of the center, said the changes were due  in part to increased income from capital gains received by the wealthy. The  findings, he said, were an argument against President Bush's call for a cut in  the tax on capital gains.  </P> <P> "Since the vast bulk of capital gains income goes to the very wealthy, they  would receive most of the benefits from a reduction in taxes on capital gains,"  Greenstein said.  </P> <P> Bush and other advocates of cutting the capital-gains tax say it would provide  an added incentive for people to invest in job-creating new and expanded  businesses.  </P> <P> The report said the most affluent Americans received large income gains during  the '80s, while middle-income people gained little and the poor fell behind.  </P></p>

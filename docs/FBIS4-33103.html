			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpt from news conference by Daniel Ortega, secretary </F> general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist National Liberation Front,  with unidentified reporters; place and date not given; from the  "Events" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Ortega] We are accepting the democratic process  within the bosom of the Sandinist National Liberation Front  [FSLN]; in other words, we are promoting national democracy.  The most important step was taken during the 1990 elections,  and we are currently taking another giant step, because we are  taking into account the 1991 elections when, during the First  FSLN Congress, we voted for an entire slate of candidates to the  National Directorate instead of voting individually. This  situation sparked dissatisfaction. Now, for the first time, we  have employed individual and secret votes, but we still lack  democratic footing within the FSLN. This is shown by the  articles that have been written since the results were released.    Imagine if those companeros who lost the elections would  have  spoken at the Olof Palme Convention Center and would have  expressed their support for the process after learning the  results of the elections to choose the Sandinist Assembly, the  National Directorate, the Secretariat General, and others.  Would this not have been a superb and beautiful situation? In  other words, they should have done the same thing we did when we  lost the elections. We accepted our loss, because accepting our  loss meant accepting the democratic process. We matched our  words with deeds. We did everything democracy dictated. Should  I have failed to be reelected, or if should things should have  failed to turn out the way I wanted them, then would there be no  democracy? I believe their attitude is merely an antidemocratic  action that questions democratic logic.    [Reporter] Commander, there seems to be leftist sectors that  are pleased with the results of the FSLN Congress. They  maintain that as a possible 1996 presidential candidate, you  have a greater chance of winning than Sergio Ramirez does.  Others, however, say you are more stigmatized than the renewal  current because of your position in the 1980's. Do you have  anything to say about this?    [Ortega] We are not forming candidacies here. First, if we  believe in polls, the fact is that polls fail to show Ramirez  will register a higher preference rating than me. This is a  fact. However, this is not the principle that candidacies are  built on. The fact that I have a higher preference rating than  other companeros such as Sergio Ramirez shows there has been  consistency over the years. Nevertheless, it is false that I  have a higher rating than Sergio Ramirez. [sentence as heard]  One thing is the image we project to the population. There  were occasions when Mrs. Chamorro registered higher. But it is  another thing when it comes down to whom the people intend to  vote for, and here Mrs. Chamorro loses ground. The same thing  happens with Dr. Ramirez: He has a high profile, but he also  loses ground in the number of people who intend to vote for him.    I repeat that these are not parameters that will define the  1996 electoral slate. I believe the parameters will be  determined by a national unity program and platform the FSLN  must present to the Nicaraguan people. At that time, we will  introduce capable people who will head the slate, thereby  guaranteeing compliance with the national unity program. This  is why we are attempting to reach an understanding, an  agreement, and even an alliance with the many socioeconomic  sectors of our nation. In other words, we want to strike an  alliance with producers, businessmen, and workers. Here, we are  talking about COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise],  which is a very powerful sector within Nicaraguan society. We  are willing to broaden our negotiations and exchange of ideas  with COSEP and to reach an agreement to strive for our country's  stabilization to ensure that a future government will indeed  have a national consensus -- a consensus among producers and  workers.    [Reporter] Commander, do you want to fire Carlos Fernando  Chamorro?    [Ortega] Excuse me?    [Reporter] Do you want to fire Carlos Fernando Chamorro?    [Ortega] He has worked for BARRICADA for 14 years. I believe  the main issue at stake here is that no one should cling to a  post. I believe no one should hold any position forever. There  must be a willingness to renew and strengthen FSLN  organizations. However, we are not promoting a policy of firing  anyone, and we are not firing anyone.    [Reporter] Are there any changes planned in the National  Directorate?    [Ortega] This is not a topic we are currently discussing  within the National Directorate.</p>

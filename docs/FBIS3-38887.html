A management umbrella organization will continue the  traditional name, Pieter D. Harmsen, chairman of the board of  directors, announced after an extraordinary meeting of the board  of governors in Fuerth on Friday evening [4 February]. The  restructuring entails a reduction of jobs by 3,300 to 11,400 in  the corporation by mid-1995.    The corporation managers justified the profound  restructuring  by pointing to the development at Grundig, which is practically  an "almost-collapse." The basic reason for this is the decline  on the European market for entertainment electronics. [passage  omitted]    About 2,200 of the jobs will be abolished in Germany, where  currently 8,900 people work for Grundig, company spokesman  Roland Stehle announced on Saturday. [passage omitted]    Nine of the 11 new Grundig companies will remain in Germany,  including the Grundig Bildprodukte GmbH. In 1994 it plans to  produce 2.5 million television sets.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / EU disappoints steel groups Eurofer, the Brussels-based umbrella body for Europe's big steelmakers, said yesterday it was 'astonished and disappointed' by the European Commission's decision on Tuesday to scrap the rescue plan for European Union steelmakers. The association called on EU industry ministers, who will discuss the Commission's decision on November 8, to maintain the plan. It said EU producers had come up with more than 17m tonnes of realised or planned capacity cuts, close to the Commission's target of 19m tonnes. 'These figures show that the results achieved up to now cannot be considered a failure,' it said. It also regretted the loss of the Commission's quarterly guidelines on steel production and deliveries by product line, and criticised the Commission's decision to propose that curbs on steel from the Czech Republic and Slovakia end a year early, at the end of 1994.</p>

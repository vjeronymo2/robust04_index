			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia wins support in Skandia bid battle DANISH institutional investors are confident of winning enough support to stop the takeover by Sweden's Skandia of Denmark's second-largest insurer, Hafnia. Two institutions, the LD Fund and Kommunernes Pensionsforsikring, representing more than 10 per cent of Hafnia Holding's capital, have submitted a request for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to the Hafnia board. LD Fund says it has the support of 35 to 40 per cent of Hafnia's capital. It said between 10 and 20 new shareholders were calling daily to promise support. However, a procedural battle, in which Hafnia's complex voting rules could still prove an obstacle to the rebel shareholders, is expected. The institutions are calling for a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 232.5m) increase in Hafnia's capital through a rights issue. Promises to subscribe some DKr1bn have already been received from local and foreign investors. The equity injection would be designed to give Hafnia time to dispose of its 33.5 per cent shareholding in Baltica, a rival Danish insurer, and 14.8 per cent of Skandia. Among significant foreign shareholders to express dissatisfaction with Skandia's bid are the French bank, Paribas, and UAP, the French insurance group. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, has condemned the move by Paribas. He said Paribas had acted as consultant to Hafnia during alliance negotiations between Skandia, Hafnia and the Norwegian insurer, Uni Storebrand, in the months before the Skandia bid. The Danish institutions say Skandia's DKr2.7bn bid is much too low, valuing Hafnia's goodwill at about DKr600m. The bid is a swap of Hafnia shares for Skandia shares carrying no voting influence.</p>

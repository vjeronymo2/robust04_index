			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Misiak: "Popiwek 1994, a Difficult </F> Leave-Taking"]    [Text] The principal flaw of the popiwek [tax on wage  raises] as a means of price controls is that it discriminates  financially and economically against those it affects.  Enterprises are deprived of funds, which are not refunded to  them, and their earnings are lower than at enterprises that, in  a similar situation, do not have to pay the popiwek. Moreover,  as is being pointed out, the popiwek is a disincentive for  higher labor productivity.    Years of routine application of the popiwek have resulted in  generating additional problems. Many enterprises have ceased to  pay this tax, while others pay it only irregularly. Postponing  the payment of this tax by juggling books is a widespread  practice. According to reports from the Internal Revenue Service  on 10 December 1993, enterprises owed the [state] budget 17.9  trillion zlotys [Z], of which deferred arrears accounted for  Z10.3 trillion; arrears for previous years account for more than  half of the tax indebtedness of enterprises.    The arguments made in favor of retaining the popiwek are as  follows:    --The absence of an authentic owner in the state sector  means  a potential wage explosion.    --The popiwek impedes a decrease in employment--that is, it  protects against an excessive growth of unemployment.    --The popiwek is indispensable to maintaining stability  because it serves to restrict wage increases to a relatively  moderate pace; this is particularly important to adhering to the  principle of indexing the salaries of civil servants and  pensioners as well as welfare payments to wages paid in the  economy as a whole.    These arguments were sharply contested in the Sejm in recent  weeks as well as within the governing coalition itself (the OPZZ  [postcommunist National Trade Union Alliance] was opposed to the  popiwek). Still, the popiwek was extended until the end of  March, and the government pledged itself to think up some  substitute therefor, and it did so.... Last week, the Economic  Committee of the Council of Ministers approved the draft of a  new law, "Wage and Salary Guidelines at Economic Entities" (at  state enterprises and companies in which the State Treasury owns  a share of at least 50 percent). Following its consideration by  the Council of Ministers, this draft law may soon now be on the  agenda of the Sejm.    There are no miracles. The draft law is reworking the  traditional popiwek. This is its principal flaw as seen by many  deputies. Of course, that is a subject that could be discussed,  and I am not sure whether the draft would fare better if the  issues concerned were to be plainly posed in advance.    If we overlook certain embellishments and revisions (some  being debatable) in the language of the proposed solutions, they  basically seem simply new versions of the popiwek:    --One modification is that enterprises are to be fined by  having to pay a tax amounting to double the wage increase in  excess of the norm, rather than a progressive tax as in the  traditional popiwek, which should be satisfactory to some.    --One useful revision seems to be that one-half of the  receipts from popiwek-bis is to be transferred to the Industrial  Development Agency for spending on industrial restructuring.  This will alleviate the discriminatory aspect of that tax.    --On the other hand, the replacement of the traditional norm  [wage norm, which if exceeded results in having to pay the  popiwek], derived from the average wage paid in September 1989,  with the average wage paid in the second half of 1993 or in the  entire year 1993, is a highly debatable revision. It would hurt  the enterprises that, owing to lack of funds or an excessive  emphasis on solidity, maintained their wages at below the  norm--and such enterprises account for about 40 percent of the  total. At the same time, it would benefit those enterprises that  granted wage increases and that often owe huge tax arrears  because they hope for continued extensions and ultimately for a  moratorium on their taxes.... Perhaps a less discriminatory  solution would be a specific increase in the norm.    Of course, other revisions paving the way to a more  consistent parting with the popiwek also could be indicated. For  example, agreements for remuneration between the parent agency  and the administrator--that is, so-called management  contracts--could be made possible. Unfortunately, however, at  most enterprises the appropriate organizational and legal  conditions for this approach are lacking. This would require a  far-reaching alteration of the methods for exercising the  function of the owner, a function exercised by the parent  agencies, including the application of commercial law [to state  enterprises], which would enable the owner [i.e., the State  Treasury] to guide more effectively the operations of the  actually commercialized state enterprises, etc.    Particular questions and problems are raised by: a) the  possibility of choosing an accord with the Internal Revenue  Service, and b) the possibility of adjustment of wages as a  function of actual profits. In the former case, this means an  added burden on the already tightly stretched operations of the  Internal Revenue Service and, in the latter, a so-called growth  formula, with its attendant problems, such as a deterioration in  the situation of the enterprises at which the share of wages in  operating expenses (in relation to profits) is higher.    Moreover, the draft law contains a clause depriving many  enterprises of the possibility of choosing a wage-control  approach other than the popiwek--namely, the requirement that  they must first settle their arrears to the state budget. For an  overwhelming majority of the debtor enterprises, this  requirement is impossible to fulfill.    Thus, in the near future, we can expect another round of  government-parliamentary disputes concerning the popiwek. ZYCIE  GOSPODARCZE has asked members of the Club of 500 [500 leading  Polish enterprises] for specific comments about this draft law  of the Ministry of Finance. It can hardly be denied that, given  its present situation, the Polish economy would find it  difficult to dispense with the popiwek prosthesis. But, in the  long run, this prosthesis will not substitute for advanced  institutional and market solutions, such as, especially, would  afford real possibilities for so-called trilateral wage  agreements among employers, employees, and the government. This  is not just a question of the number of privatized enterprises  but, to an ever-increasing degree, a matter of bringing order  into the activities of the state as an owner [of state  enterprises], genuinely commercializing state enterprises, etc.</p>

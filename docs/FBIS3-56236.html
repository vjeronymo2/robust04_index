It contained recommendations on preparing and  holding the elections.    Viktor Pohorilo, deputy chief of the Central Electoral  Commission, noted that all appropriate documents to be prepared  by district electoral commissions should already be at electoral  districts by 12 March. The tasks of the district electoral  commissions include: compiling a list of voters, planning work  during the preparatory period, holding and summing up the  results of the elections, and ensuring that legality is  maintained during the mentioned period.    The meeting's participants approved a resolution on how  Ukrainian citizens who work in Ukraine's diplomatic  representations and permanent representations attached to  international organizations or who are abroad on training can  participate in the elections of Ukrainian people's deputies on  27 March 1994. In particular, a resolution calls for electoral  districts abroad to be registered with Artemovskiy electoral  district No. 1 of Kiev. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuriy Vilych  said there are about 75,500 voters abroad. He proposed that the  right to form such electoral commissions remain with the  leadership of foreign institutions. The Foreign Ministry will  be given the right to send copies of electoral documents by fax  or diplomatic post.    The meeting examined the state of party registration and of  electoral blocs which have expressed an intention to nominate  candidates for participation in the parliamentary elections.  Speaker Ivan Yemets noted that as of today 23 parties have  received certificates of registration, the first ones being the  Ukrainian Republican Party, the Communist Party, the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists in Ukraine, the Liberal and the Christian  Democratic Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine.  There have been no applications from party blocs to the Central  Electoral Commission.    The meeting heard a speech by Dmytro Tabachnyk, deputy head  of the State Committee for Publications, on measures to ensure  the timely preparation of electoral documents (ballot papers,  posters containing pre-electoral programs, and biographical  information on parliamentary candidates) for district electoral  districts using the printing base of Ukraine's State Committee  for Publications. They discussed the nomination of contenders  for parliamentary posts and their registration and the question  of implementing measures concerning the financing and material  provision of the electoral campaign. It was stated in  particular that the total estimate for the electoral campaign is  more than 1 trillion karbovantsi; however, funds are being given  both according to real need and in accordance with the  possibilities that at present are not big. The meeting  discussed the central electoral commission's plan of work for  1994. [passage indistinct]</p>

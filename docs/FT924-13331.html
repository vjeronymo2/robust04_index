			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Attack sparks Cuba protest Cuba has strongly protested to the US about a machine-gun attack last week on a five-star tourist hotel at the Cuban beach resort of Varadero, Reuter reports from Havana. 'Cuba has protested strongly to the US government about terrorist activities against Cuba carried out from US territory by persons supported by the US government,' a Cuban foreign ministry spokeswoman said. She said the protest was related to an incident on October 7 in which a Spanish-Cuban joint venture hotel, the Melia Varadero, was strafed with machine-gun fire.</p>

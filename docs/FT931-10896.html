			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Lord King set to step down from BA today LORD KING is expected to announce today that he is stepping down immediately as chairman of British Airways at a board meeting which will confirm Sir Colin Marshall as his successor. Lord King, who will become honorary president of the airline he has chaired for the past 12 years, was due to retire in July after the company's annual meeting. But the 75-year-old chairman has decided to leave early to ensure the continuity of the BA top management succession, which has been shaken by the company's involvement in a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic, its smaller rival owned by Mr Richard Branson. Sir Colin, who was recruited by Lord King as chief executive 10 years ago, is expected to take over immediately as the airline's new executive chairman. Mr Robert Ayling, head of marketing and operations, will take up a new post of managing director. Although Sir Colin will be in overall charge, he will not hold the two titles of chairman and chief executive as originally planned. However, the board is not expected to appoint a new chief executive officer, confirming Sir Colin's leadership of the company. To provide checks and balances within the board as recommended by the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance, Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, is expected to see his responsibilities as non-executive deputy chairman strengthened. Mr David Burnside, BA's director of public affairs, is expected to leave the company and Mr Peter Jones, senior press officer, is likely to replace him. After its two public apologies to Mr Branson and a Pounds 610,000 High Court libel settlement, BA has been anxious to restore internal morale and its international reputation. However, Virgin is threatening to take further legal action on anti-trust grounds in the US if it fails to secure satisfactory compensation from BA for what Virgin claims is the commercial damage it suffered from the 'dirty tricks'. Mr Ayling and Mr Syd Pennington, Virgin's managing director, held talks this week but little progress appears to have been made. BA is also facing a growing campaign from the big three US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - which are lobbying the new US administration to block BA's equity partnership in USAir, the sixth-largest US airline. In a letter to Mr Federico Pena, the new US Secretary of Transportation, the chairmen of the big three US carriers yesterday referred to BA's 'recent admissions of anti-competitive behaviour' against Virgin as one of the reasons for holding a public inquiry into the BA-USAir deal.

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Mounting arrears weigh down African bank: Debts from broken countries compel cut in lending for third year and tougher sanctions Mounting arrears from borrowing countries and the need to make greater provisions against loan defaults reduced the African Development Bank's net income by 31 per cent last year to Dollars 112m. The AfDB's financial results, presented yesterday at the bank's annual general meeting in Nairobi, are only marginally healthier than the sickly continent it was set up to help. Arrears owed to the bank and the African Development Fund, its soft loan arm, rose to Dollars 700m in 1993, against disbursed and outstanding loans of Dollars 8.4bn. Most of the arrears are chronic debts from broken countries like Zaire, Liberia and Somalia. Others are from AfDB members who are sinking deeper into poverty. Excluding South Africa, the continent's gross domestic product grew by only 1.4 per cent in 1993, less than half the rise in population. To keep its international credit rating, the AfDB cut lending for the third year running and began to apply tougher sanctions against defaulters. As a result, Gabon and Kenya have brought their interest payments up to date, while the Cameroon, which is Dollars 95m in arrears, is negotiating an assistance package from the IMF and Paris Club which will allow it to clear its outstanding debts with the AfDB. Bank governors say they are concerned with two main issues: how to deal with the mounting arrears and the serious managerial and policy shortcomings which plague the bank. In addition, some governors have begun to question the bank's continued ability to provide long-term development finance when most of its clients can no longer afford its commercial lending terms. 'The arrears have piled up in part because the bank continued to lend on hard terms to countries which had no creditworthiness,' says Mr Eberhard Kurth, Germany's representative on the board of governors. 'We are telling the bank that Germany's future support will depend on better lending policies and increased efficiency.' Africa's growing impoverishment is placing greater demands on the African Development Fund. But its coffers are empty. Industrial countries, which own one third of the AfDB and donate funds every three years to the bank's concessional window, are refusing to replenish the ADF until the bank streamlines its bureaucracy and tightens its lending policies. Governors came to the Nairobi meeting armed with a damaging confidential report of external consultants that depicted the bank as a chaotic, top-heavy institution with little control over its lending projects. 'We have had too many promises of reform in the past,' Mr Kurth says. 'This time we are seeking legal safeguards which will tie the release of concessionary funds to improvements in the bank's governance and lending policies.' US Treasury officials taking part in the replenishment negotiations say it is unlikely that new funds will match the Dollars 3.4bn pledged three years' ago, in spite of Africa's increased need for concessionary finance. With luck, they believe donors might pledge Dollars 2bn by the end of the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------           Total Loan arrears (UA* 401.3m)           (excluding arrears to ADF)  ----------------------------------------------------------                                         UA*m  (per cent)  ---------------------------------------------------------- Up to 3 months                          44.2   (11.0) Over 3, but less than 6 months          67.9   (16.9) Over 6, but less than 12 months         69.1   (17.2) Over 12, but less than 24 months        80.7   (20.1) over 24 months                         139.4   (34.8)  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

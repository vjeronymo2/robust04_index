			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: Shoes that trod the hippy trail - Birkenstocks are both fashionable and comfortable There are some products which have relevance and value regardless of time and fashion. Birkenstock shoes are such a product. Whether you are three years old and not very steady on your feet, or 80 and feeling frail, Birkenstock will make sure you are happily and comfortably shod. In between these two extremes, Voguettes rush around town wearing Birkenstocks and the most laid-back, comfortable-looking guest at a London summer drinks party recently was a chic visitor from Florida's Key West sporting a soft, linen suit, collarless linen shirt and . . . yes . . . Birkenstocks. Birkenstocks were the original hippy shoe bought by free-loving Woodstock fans, earnest ramblers and vegans who delighted in the plastic versions. Now they have suddenly become transformed from merely practical footwear into cult status. In the summer of 1991, The Face magazine showed the then unknown Kate Moss wearing them in photographs by Corinne Day and made all the style cognoscente take notice. Hotshot designers began to take the basic models and customise them for their catwalk shows - Perry Ellis added pink satin and diamante buckles while Kohji Tatsuno showed them in glittery silver. Today much of their charm lies in their universality - they are that elusive product, both widely accessible and infinitely chic. By the footwear standards of today they are modestly priced ranging from Pounds 19.95 to Pounds 69.95. Their fans are legion. Harrison Ford, Whoopi Goldberg, Joan Bakewell, Koo Stark, Victoria Wood, Julie Walters and Maggie Smith all saunter around in them. For those who have never heard the name, Birkenstock is a German shoe company dating back to the 18th century. It rose to modest fame in the 1960s when Karl Birkenstock combined the arched insoles with a footbed and straps, creating the now familiar sandal. This sole (or 'footbed') is the shoe's chief distinguishing characteristic and the source of its particular comfort. It is made from cork (recyclable, of course) and moulds and supports the foot. Those who are new to Birkenstocks say it can take a while to become accustomed to the toe grips and the arch support but, once hooked, you becomes a life-long wearer. In winter Birkenstock aficionados swap the open sandal for the closed-in shoe styles with names such as Boston or London. There are still ranges for vegans, made with no animal products, but the model most favoured by the chic set is the Arizona, in leather and suede at Pounds 49.95. This chimes perfectly with the 1990s feel for natural linens and eco-friendly products. The Natural Shoe Store, which sells them in the UK, prefers customers to come in and be properly fitted but, as there are just three branches (21 Neal Street, London WC2; 325 Kings Road, London SW3; and 22, Princes Square, Buchanan Street, Glasgow) it recognises that not everyone can easily reach them, so it has just launched a mail order catalogue. This catalogue lists all the styles, prices and materials and includes charts to enable you to trace your foot shape precisely. Do not be worried that at first sight the shoe or sandal seems alarmingly large - this is part of the support system. Try them on a soft carpet before rejecting them.

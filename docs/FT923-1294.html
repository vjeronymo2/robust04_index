			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / At least 40 Tory MPs may defy Major on Maastricht nearly twice the previous number - say they are ready to defy the government over Maastricht, adding to Mr John Major's difficulties in his attempts to deliver British ratification of the treaty. With both the prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, facing the toughest tests of their political careers today in a Commons emergency debate, the opposition to Maastricht in Conservative ranks is strengthening. The government is treating today's vote as a confidence motion, calling on the House simply to support its economic policy. Scores of interviews with Conservative MPs, including the most prominent Euro-sceptics, do much to explain Mr Major's attempts to placate the doubters over the treaty in recent days. They show that antipathy to Maastricht on the government benches has grown markedly since May, when the bill implementing the treaty received its second Commons reading. In that vote, the number of Tories voting against the government was pegged at 22. There was relief for the government, however, as Labour's ruling body explicitly ruled out supporting a referendum on Maastricht. An amendment calling for a referendum was widely regarded as the most likely way to bring about a government defeat during the passage of the Maastricht bill, since support for it goes beyond the Euro-sceptic camp. The Tories will be anxious to exploit signs that the Labour party remains divided over its approach to Europe, even though the opposition avoided an open split in approving a new policy statement. Those Tories who voted with the government in May but are threatening to oppose it now include Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 100-strong 92 group of Tory MPs, Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee and Mr John Whittingdale, the MP for Colchester South and Maldon, who is Baroness Thatcher's former political secretary. The figure of 40, representing nearly one in five Tory MPs who are not in government, comprises those who would not support the government if it reintroduced the bill implementing Maastricht to the Commons unamended. Another sizeable group of MPs expressed serious reservations and declined to pledge unconditional support.

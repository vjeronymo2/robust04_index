			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS SPIEGEL WON'T HAVE TO PUT UP $21 MILLION;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE EX-CHIEF OF COLUMBIA SAVINGS WINS A ROUND IN HIS FIGHT AGAINST  CHARGES THAT HE SQUANDERED THE FIRM'S ASSETS.  </P> <P> A federal judge ruled late Friday that former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Chief  Executive Thomas Spiegel does not have to place more than $21 million in escrow  while awaiting a hearing on civil charges that he squandered the thrift's  assets.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles said laws governing  thrifts do not permit regulators to make Spiegel post the money before his  hearing. To allow that, Wilson said, would unconstitutionally deprive Spiegel  of property without due process.  </P> <P> The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans,  alleged on July 5 that Spiegel spent nearly $19 million in Columbia funds on  himself while chief executive of the now-insolvent Beverly Hills-based thrift.  Spiegel, whose family still controls Columbia, resigned Dec. 31 as head of the  thrift.  </P> <P> The charges, part of the largest civil case ever brought against an individual  by thrift regulators, allege personal use of corporate jets, condominiums and  concert tickets, as well as making loans to a friend who provided Spiegel with  luxury cars. Regulators are seeking a $5-million fine.  </P> <P> The OTS wanted Spiegel to deposit into an escrow account the $19 million he  allegedly squandered, plus an additional $2.3 million to cover potential losses  on the sale of three condominiums Columbia now has on the market. They argued  that Spiegel might seek to hide his assets.  </P> <P> An administrative hearing on the charges is scheduled for Sept. 4 in Los  Angeles. Spiegel's lawyers said the former executive will soon face additional  charges. Although they did not say what the charges might be, investigators are  known to have looked at such areas as Spiegel's extensive security measures,  costs associated with Columbia's ornate new $55-million headquarters building,  and use by Spiegel and his family of Columbia's Hyatt Newporter resort in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Dennis M. Perluss, one of Spiegel's lawyers, said Wilson's decision could prove  significant because it narrows the young agency's authority. Officials from the  OTS, formed last year as the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,  said they did not want to comment until they have read the decision.  </P> <P> The decision lifts temporary spending restrictions on transferring and selling  assets that were placed on Spiegel and his wife, Helene. It also returns to  Spiegel a $1-million bond that he posted.  </P></p>

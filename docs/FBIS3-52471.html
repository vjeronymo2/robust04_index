Our region, however, is looking to 1994 with a ray of hope  created by the decision to hold a summit meeting late this month  between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton.  Much has been said about the importance of this meeting to  peace prospects in the region, especially since it will take  place in an atmosphere of foundering unilateral deals -- deals  which are being sought by Israel as an alternative to the  comprehensive peace that Syria and the whole world are calling  for.    Indubitably, U.S. President Bill Clinton would not have  arranged this meeting if he does not have anything new to  justify efforts to push the peace process forward and to revive  the peoples' hopes that the required peace will prevail. Syria  has always been eager to know if the U.S. Administration, which  has opted to play the role of a full and effective partner in  the peace process, has anything new to offer, especially since  Syria has clarified its firm positions, as well as reiterated  its adherence to peace and its refusal to relinquish any right.    This prompts many in the region, and throughout the world,  to  pin great hopes on the results of this summit. Many also fear,  at the same time, that intrigues may be contrived before and  during this summit to hamper efforts to reach such results.  This, in fact, explains the expectations being spread these  days that Israel may fabricate incidents, create tension before  the summit, and prevent the realization of the hopes pinned to  it.    Everyone knows that Israel will not be pleased to see  efforts  to strengthen relations between Syria and the United States or  efforts to activate the U.S. role in achieving what Washington  has committed itself to in accordance with the initiative it  launched in Madrid, namely, the establishment of a just and  comprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions of the  international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle.    Everyone also knows the identity of those who are launching  a  feverish campaign against Syria, as well as the lies that these  sides, which are known for their loyalty to Israel and the  Zionist circles, are spreading against Syria in order to distort  its reputation and affect world public opinion. They are  particularly interested in damaging U.S. public opinion, which  has begun to show more understanding of Syria's positions, its  seriousness about peace, and its eagerness to establish peace on  firm bases that will perpetuate the peace. This cannot be  achieved without the comprehensive and just approach that Syria  has been stressing.    These sides have been spreading their poisons since the  summit was announced. The beginning of the campaign appeared in  the questions journalists posed to U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher when he announced the planned summit during a  news conference in Damascus. The Syrian foreign minister  described the questions at that time as prefabricated, and  Christopher refused to answer them.    In light of the failure of that campaign, which, as we have  said, is backed by Israel and the supporters of its deception  abroad, and amid the confusion and failure of unilateral deals,  we are seeing expectations and fears that Israel and its  supporters may resort to more wicked and effective ways to  fabricate problems and create tension in the region in order to  block the ray of hope emanating from the upcoming  Syrian-American summit.    By this, we do not want to overestimate Israel's capability  and potential. However, paying attention to such possibilities  will certainly help contain them and deprive Israel of any  chance. Israel appears determined to continue its policy, which  has proven to be a total failure, and to abort the great  prospects that the Syrian-American summit will provide by  opening the door for a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.</p>

Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut. As of December 31, 1992, Hartford Life had assets of approximately $20.8 billion and insurance in force of approximately $93.5 billion. Hartford Life is currently rated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.M. Best_A++; Standard &amp; Poor's_AAA; Duff &amp; Phelps_AAA; and Moody's_Aa2. Hartford Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Company, which is in turn a subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Hartford Fire Insurance Company is owned by the ITT Corporation. A significant portion of Hartford Life's business consists of writing insurance and annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts, and other types of funding agreements for numerous pension plans, most of which are subject to title I of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. HIMCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life, is an investment management company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 31, 1993, HIMCO had $3.06 billion in assets under management. HIMCO manages assets in various Hartford Life separate accounts and other portfolios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For many years, Hartford Life has offered various guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) for sale in the qualified plan market. A GIC is a type of contract under which an insurance company, in exchange for a sum of money, guarantees that it will return that sum to the contractholder on a specified maturity date, with interest at the specified rate. In anticipation of its obligation, the insurance company invests the funds received from the contractholder primarily in fixed-income instruments, in order to achieve a return that will enable the company to meet its guarantee at maturity. Typically, these fixed-income investments are held in the company's general asset account, although under some type of GIC products, the investments are held in a separate account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Recently, many pension fund investment managers have expressed interest in achieving an even higher degree of security for plan investments than that afforded by conventional GICs. In response, some insurance companies have begun to offer Synthetic GICs. Under some Synthetic GICs, instead of paying a premium to the insurance company on the effective date of the contract, the plan places assets in a custodial bank account owned by the plan. The assets are held in that account by the bank custodian and are managed exclusively by the insurance company or an affiliate until the contract's maturity. If the market value of the assets in the custodial account at maturity is less than the amount initially placed in the account plus guaranteed interest, the insurer must make the plan whole for the difference. The assets in the account are never owned by the insurance company, however, and the plan's investment is therefore not affected by risks to which the insurer's own assets may be subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Hartford Life now intends to offer a Synthetic GIC product to Plans. Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC will be offered in principal amounts of $50 million or more. Thus, Hartford Life intends to offer its Synthetic GICs only to large Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Essentially, the Synthetic GIC will consist of an investment management agreement under which HIMCO, acting in a fiduciary capacity, will manage assets of a Plan placed in the custody of a bank (the Bank) selected by the Plan (with the approval of Hartford Life). The Synthetic GICs offered by Hartford Life will differ from conventional management agreements, however, in that Hartford Life will guarantee that the amounts placed in the bank custodial account for management by HIMCO will be released to the Plan, with interest at a specified rate, on certain specified dates. The Synthetic GIC will be benefit responsive in that it may be tailored to meet the Plan's predictable benefit obligations by establishing Scheduled Account Distribution Dates (see rep. 10, below) at appropriate times. In addition, unscheduled interim distributions, referred to as Benefit Sensitivity Advances (see rep. 22, below), will also be available under certain circumstances. At all times, the Plan, not Hartford Life, will remain the legal owner of the account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a Plan by a Plan fiduciary who is independent of Hartford Life and HIMCO. The applicants represent that due to the large size of the Plans involved, the independent fiduciaries authorizing Plans to enter into the Synthetic GICs can be expected to be (or to retain) sophisticated professional asset managers with specialized expertise in the area of GICs and similar investments. Prior to the Plan's investment, Hartford Life will furnish the Plan's independent fiduciary full and detailed disclosure of all features of the Synthetic GIC, including all applicable fees (see rep. 24, below) and charges (see reps. 16 and 23, below). There is no additional fee or charge for the guarantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. When a Plan enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life, an account (the Account) will be established for the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contributions made by the Plan to the Account on the ``Account Commencement Date'' and on any subsequent dates specified in the Synthetic GIC will be delivered to the Bank and credited to the Account. The assets in the Account will be held in the Bank's custody and subject to management by HIMCO. Contributions placed into the Account will be invested immediately; there will be no time lag between the time the contributions are put in the Account and the time they are invested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

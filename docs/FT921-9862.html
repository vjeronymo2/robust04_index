			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Le nozze di Figaro - Theatre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels To describe the outgoing artistic director, musical director and matre de danse of Brussels's Theatre Royal de la Monnaie as a team would be euphemistic. Anyhow, that trio recently left the Monnaie together, bowing out by bowing to Mozart. It is strange to think of the Monnaie as it now is: no Gerard Mortier, no Sylvain Cambreling, no Mark Morris. And yet they were already invisible in their new, farewell staging of Figaro. Morris directed and Cambreling conducted, but they were wholly transparent. I have never seen Figaro less 'produced' or more musical. Simply, we saw the singers behaving, in character, to the music with utter spontaneity and consistent detail. We saw a real world onstage, small and intimate, where everyone knows each other. What a rare achievement this is amid an era of style-laden and concept-heavy productions. It is full of life. The setting is thoroughly Spanish (men and women all use fans, as naturally and characterfully as the hands that hold them), the period (rather pre-Beaumarchais) somewhere between Velasquez and Goya, the household far from lavish. The eye is drawn throughout to details of character and drama. Cherubino's eyes briefly blaze when the Count calls him 'picciol serpente'; a quick exchange of looks between Figaro and Susanna summed up their intimacy in a trice. The Countess sings her great accompanied recitative while slowly descending a staircase, lost in thought. The fact that she does not see Cherubino disappearing with Barbarina lends one poignance to the scene; and the way she seems suddenly to fall down a single step while exclaiming 'O cielo]' adds another. Adrienne Lobel's decor is a blight on proceedings. I liked its economy (each act occurs on a separate face of a revolving set) and its lack of glitz; and it placed all the action on a small area at the front of the stage. This tightness lent ideal intensity to the great ensembles. But the set's outlines are Toytown, its Spanish colours Day-Glo. The effect is postmodern-tacky - especially wrong in so modest a staging. However, Martin Pakledinaz's beautifully simple costumes and James Ingalls's atmospheric lighting serve to integrate this place with what occurs within it. What a beautiful house for Mozart the Monnaie is; I have never heard so many of da Ponte's words. And Sylvain Cambreling's conducting was as unobtrusive and as revealing as the production. I noted in particular a terrific drumroll crescendo in the Count's aria and the witty oboes in the Act Four finale as Figaro and Susanna are reconciled, but what mattered more were the pellucid texture and the perfect 'speaking' pace. Only his own, rather laborious, harpsichord accompaniment to the recitatives drew attention to the workings of the machinery. The singers seemed to create both production and score as they went along; I have no higher compliment. (The good-spirited way they coped with doors that either would or wouldn't stay shut heightened this impression.) Jose van Dam  -the Belgian hero at home - was an exceptionally credible Figaro, both stern and buffo, never cute, thunderous in anger or reproof; and Dale Duesing, though too hard-pressed at either extreme of his voice, was a vivid, intense Count  - singing his aria sitting tight in his chair as if bottled up and about to explode - with superb gestures of hands and fan. Elzbieta Szmytka, a bright Susanna, was all clarity, spontaneity and cherishable nuance. The Countess was Hillevi Martinpelto, occasionally stiff as an actress but making a great impression with her phenomenally clean entry into notes. Cherubino (Monica Baccelli) and Barbarina (Laura Cherici) were both young, Italian and unusually appealing in voice and detail. Magali Chalmeau Damonte made much of Marcellina's aria; and Basilio and Bartolo flourished in the veteran hands of Ugo Benelli and Jules Bastin. I could pick holes if I chose - I heard some aspirate from several cast members - but I can't bear to.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Sergey </F> Ostanin and Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku March 31 TASS -- Azerbaijan welcomes any steps  aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Azerbaijani parliament chairman  Rasul Guliyev said.    The announcement was made at a meeting with a CIS  inter-parliamentary delegation led by Kyrgyz parliament chairman  Medetkan Sherimkulov that arrived in Baku on Thursday.    Guliyev praised their peace mission seeking to "untie the  Karabakh knot," adding that Azerbaijan's position remains  unchanged -- it stands for peaceful solution of all disputable  questions that have piled up over the years of confrontation.    Shirimkulov said that the current visit to Baku is the  continuation of the extensive mediatory work started in  September 1993 by the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly. It has  already organised a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian  parliamentarians in Finland. Another such meeting, this time  with the participation of representatives of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, is expected to take place in  Bishkek in early May.    "Our aim is to help the sides bridge the gap between their  positions and find a way out of the crisis," Shirimkulov said.  He added that the CIS countries are interested in restoring  peace in the trans-Caucasus.    Early on Friday the delegation will meet with deputy  parliament chairman Afiyaddin Dzhalilov and will be received by  Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev at noon. After the talks  the delegation will fly to Stepanakert, capital of  Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: All at stake for Colombia and US Colombia's assistant coach Hernan Gomez said the team were more united than ever, ahead of today's match against the US in Pasadena. Poor results in their opening Group A matches mean that defeat today, for either, could seal elimination. The US drew 1-1 with Switzerland. If they lose to the South Americans, their place in the second round would depend on winning big over Romania in their last group match and hoping for other results to fall their way. Defeat for the US would almost certainly mean a first-ever first-round elimination for the host country.</p>

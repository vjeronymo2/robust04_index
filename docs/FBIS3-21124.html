			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 7 December JAERI disclosed the manufacturing  status of the intermediate heat exchanger to be installed on the  high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR), which is a  high temperature gas reactor research facility that JAERI is  building at its O-arai Laboratory in Ibaraki Prefecture. At  present the heat exchanger is about 55% completed and is  scheduled to be transported to the construction site in  September 1994.    The HTTR heat exchanger is being built at Yokohama Plant No.  1 (Yokohama City) of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. The  device will transfer the heat from high temperature helium gas  coming out of the reactor at 850-950C to a secondary helium  gas system. The secondary helium gas will reach a temperature of  900C and become a heat source for thermal systems other  than those used for power generation.    These will be the highest temperatures in the world for a  heat exchanger installed in a reactor to operate under. To  assure durability under these high temperatures, the body of the  heat exchanger has a two-layered structure, and the space  between the inner and outer casings will be cooled by secondary  helium gas flowing through pipes at about 400C. This design  will help maintain the pressure-resistant outer casing at a  lower temperature.    The high temperature gas reactor uses [omission] as fuel,  graphite as the core structural material, and helium gas for  cooling. It offers advantages because high temperature heat can  be obtained for a variety of uses in addition to power  generation. Construction began on the HTTR at the research  facility in March 1991, and work is proceeding with a target of  attaining initial criticality in 1998.</p>

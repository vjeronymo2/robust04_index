			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: International airport charges not increasing burden for airlines Sir, Your article, 'Clouds over open skies' (June 24), is informative and mostly beyond dispute. However, there is one misleading impression which could have been created inadvertently. You state that airlines are 'burdened by increasingly heavy navigational and airport take-off and landing charges' (my italics). AACI can certainly leave it to the air traffic control authorities to speak for navigation charges, but as for airport charges, there is good impartial evidence from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to show that the burden is not increasing. In fact, these ICAO figures show that airport charges have formed a stable and modest proportion of total airline operating expenses, falling from 3.8 per cent of expenses in 1988 to 3.5 per cent in 1990, the last published data. In the period 1978-1990 the proportion has always been between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. During this time, most airports have kept their increases below inflation. Some airports have had to impose higher increases, but this has often been linked to the provision of new facilities to ease congestion. You also mention the 'start-up costs' estimated by European airlines. These are actually dominated by fixed overheads, such as aircraft leasing costs, station expenses, staff costs and marketing. Airport charges, which are in any case only 'paid as you go', are not so significant. David Gamper, chief economist, Airports Association Council International, CH-1215 Geneva 15, Switzerland</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has received a report of an accident report where a Cessna Model 172 airplane experienced engine loss because a six-inch piece of gasket material was lodged in the carburetor venturi throat. The material matched the remaining neoprene gasket on the Brackett air filter, Assembly No. BA&hyph;5110, installed in accordance with STC SA71GL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Brackett Aircraft Company, Inc., has issued Brackett Air Filter Document I&hyph;194, dated March 16, 1994. This document specifies inspection and replacement procedures for these Brackett air filters utilizing neoprene gaskets installed in accordance with STC SA71GL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incident described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent gasket particles from entering the carburetor because of air filter gasket failure, which could result in partial or complete loss of engine power. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes incorporating the Brackett air filter neoprene gasket design installed in accordance with STC SA71GL, the proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting (visually) the air filter frame for a loose or deteriorated gasket, and replacing any gasket found loose or deteriorated. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Brackett Air Filter Document I&hyph;194, dated March 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 50,000 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,750,000 or $55 per operator. This figure does not reflect costs for repetitive inspections or possible replacements; only the initial inspection. The FAA has no way of determining how many gaskets may need replacement or how many repetitive inspections each operator may incur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

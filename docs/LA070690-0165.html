			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> YALE CREW SURVIVES SHAKY START  </P> <P> Yale University overcame problems with a soft-spoken umpire and an abrupt start  to reach the quarterfinals of the Thames Cup at the Henley Regatta today.  </P> <P> Yale won a thrilling race by three-quarters of a length against an English crew  from Lea Rowing Club, but only after recovering from the confusing starting  procedure of the 151-year-old regatta.  </P> <P> Yale's bowman was still checking his oarlock when the start was called, and he  missed his first stroke. The rest of the crew, feeling that something was  amiss, began tentatively.  </P></p>

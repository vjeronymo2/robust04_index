			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Motoring: Get tough on uninsured drivers More than 1m British motorists are known not to tax or insure their cars. They weigh the slight risk of being caught against the money they save and reckon breaking the law makes good financial sense. Last October in this column, I suggested that tougher law enforcement was long overdue. If driving uninsured - or, worse, uninsured and disqualified - were the seriously anti-social offences the courts once thought them to be, perhaps it was time to seize and sell guilty drivers' cars. I lost count of the number of readers who wrote in support. Since then, the government has announced administrative action to chase motorists who do not tax (and, by inference, do not insure) their cars. The problem persists, though. This week, the Guild of Experienced Motorists echoed my thoughts. It asked the government to introduce legislation giving courts the power to confiscate uninsured vehicles. John Newman, the guild's chairman and chief executive, noted that the maximum penalty for driving uninsured was Pounds 5,000 - but that the fine recommended by the Magistrates' Association was only Pounds 540. It seemed a small price for a crime that could leave innocent victims disabled with little chance of compensation. Newman said the guild believed confiscating the vehicle and jailing the driver would be a severe deterrent. It also wanted cars to carry an insurance disc alongside their tax disc. I am sure that most readers of this column would agree.</p>

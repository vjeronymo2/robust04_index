Purpose and Substantive Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. 14, United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371); sec. 7(d) Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). An interim rule revising the CIAP regulation, 24 CFR part 968, subparts A and B, for PHAs and 24 CFR part 905, subpart I, for IHAs, and streamlining the program was published on March 15, 1993. A final rule will be published shortly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Major Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In FY 1993, the CIAP was streamlined to make it easier for smaller HAs to participate in the program and to give smaller HAs the same flexibility as CGP agencies. The CIAP Application was simplified, the processing groups were reduced to two (Group 1 and Group 2), and the modernization types were reduced to two (Emergency and Other). Under the modernization type of ``Other'', the HA may apply for, and HUD may fund, a variety of needs, ranging from a single physical or management work item to complete rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Program Highlights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Departmental Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Improving Public and Indian Housing is one of the Department's major priorities. Accordingly, a review is being made of the entire Public and Indian Housing Program. Specifically, the Department is very concerned about several aspects of the Modernization Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When identifying physical improvement needs to meet the modernization standards, HAs are encouraged to consider design which supports the integration of public housing into the broader community. Although high priority needs, such as those related to health and safety, vacant/substandard units, structural or system integrity, and compliance with statutory, regulatory or court-ordered deadlines, will receive funding priority, HAs should plan their modernization in a way which promotes good design, but maintains the modest nature of public housing. The HA should pay particular attention to design and be receptive to creative, but cost-effective approaches suggested by architects, residents, HA staff, and other local entities. Such approaches can complement the planning for basic rehabilitation needs. It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added (for example, additional landscaping) to promote the blend of public housing into the surrounding neighborhood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expediting the program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HAs are reminded that they are expected to obligate all funds within two years and to expend all funds within three years of program approval (Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) Amendment execution) unless a longer project implementation schedule is approved by the Field Office. If the HA does not obligate approved funds in a timely manner, the Department will recapture the funds unless there are clear, valid reasons for not meeting the obligation deadline; i.e., delays which are outside of the HA's control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resident involvement and economic uplift.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HAs are encouraged to explore and implement through all feasible means the involvement of residents in all aspects of the CIAP, from planning through implementation. In addition, HAs are encouraged to seek ways to employ residents in all aspects of the CIAP's operation and/or to develop means to promote contracting opportunities for resident-owned businesses. PHAs should use Section 3 provisions to the maximum feasible extent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elimination of vacant units.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Department has a vacancy reduction effort specifically aimed at reducing vacancies, HAs are encouraged to apply for CIAP funds to address eligible vacancy problems (i.e., those which do not involve routine maintenance) to the extent such problems have not been funded through other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Relationship to Technical Review Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Departmental goal of improving Public and Indian Housing is reflected in the technical review factors, set forth in section IV(c)(5), on which the Field Office scores each HA's CIAP Application. Based on the HA's total score, the Field Office then ranks each HA to determine selection for Joint Review. The technical review factors include the following Departmental initiatives to improve Public and Indian Housing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Restoration of vacant units to occupancy;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Resident capacity-building, including opportunities for resident management;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Economic development, job training and employment opportunities for residents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Drug elimination initiatives; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Partnership with local government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Capability by name - and nature / Unit trusts SINCE Capel Cure Myers launched its special situations fund in 1971, it has had a variety of identities, although retaining the same basic philosophy. Known first as Alben, then Vanguard, it now goes under the catchy name of Capability Special Situations. Kenneth Levy, the manager since 1977 and head of fund management at CCM, sums up a special situations stock as one which could be expected to show above-average capital appreciation. 'I try to buy winners and sell losers,' he says. 'That sounds easy but, to do it, I look at the fundamentals of a company. I'll buy if the profit upgrades are good and if there is a 'good news' flow. If all that is in place and the shares are underperforming, I usually won't buy because, seven times out of 10, the market knows more than you.' Levy is a believer in market momentum when the price of a share in which he has invested is moving as well as, or better, than its sector. Adopting the market momentum, by refraining from going against the market, is also designed to protect the fund from losing money. 'If there are profit downgrades, and a bad news flow, I'll cut my holding. That way, you don't get caught in a Polly Peck.' The strategy certainly seems to be working. The fund is top of the UK growth sector in the 10 years to October 1. Over five years, it is 21st out of 118 and sixth out of 137 in the three years to October 1 (offer-to-bid with income re-invested, according to Micropal). Despite the strong performance, the fund, with Pounds 33m assets under management, is relatively small. Levy says it has never been marketed aggressively and has been used mainly as an in-house broker fund. He explains that the skill of his job is 'as much about reducing poor performance as it is about getting a particular stock right.' He is only too aware that he is trying to protect investors' money as well as to make it grow; thus, he is risk-averse in a recession by switching out of the medium size and smaller companies, which make up the bulk of the fund in more buoyant times, to the relative safety of blue chip companies. Until a year ago, 70-80 per cent of the fund was invested in FT-SE 100 stocks, with cash holdings of up to 10 per cent and some gilts. 'As we've been moving from recession to expansion, I've shifted the composition of the fund so that it is now only 33 per cent invested in FT-SE 100 companies and two-thirds in FT-SE 250 companies,' Levy says. He has been selling or reducing holdings in Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group; and Weir Group, the engineering company, after profit downgrades. Instead, at a time when interest rates have been falling and are expected to drop further, he has been building up holdings in those stocks which are sensitive to interest rate movements. These include financial and insurance company stocks. The largest holdings are in General Electric, which accounts for about 3 per cent of the fund; National Westminster bank; Provident Financial, the consumer credit and insurance company; Smith New Court, the securities house; and insurance companies such as General Accident, GRE, Royal Insurance and Prudential. His favourites among the medium size companies include James Halstead, the floor-covering group which this week reported a doubling of pre-tax profits in the year to June 30; Stagecoach, the Perth-based regional bus service operator, and FKI, the electrical engineering group which demerged from Babcock International and announced a large US acquisition last week. There about 55 stocks altogether in the fund. Surely the belief in market momentum should favour tracker funds, which aim to follow the market, at the expense of managed funds? 'No,' says Levy, 'because if you apply the fundamentals, you'll get successful outperformance over time since you are more likely than not to know those sectors which can be pitfalls. Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the bid-offer spread is about 6 per cent. The annual management fee is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Pounds 500. There is a Pep attached to the fund at no extra cost but there is no savings scheme at present, although this is under review.</p>

Information Collections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements for the planning process, the application process, and the reporting process contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). The estimated public reporting burden is expected to be significantly lower than the current combined burden imposed by the CHAS, CDBG, ESG, HOME, and HOPWA programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated public reporting burden of these collections is stated under the Preamble heading Findings and Certifications. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Rules Docket Clerk at the above address; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for HUD, Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Impetus for Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To build and strengthen new partnerships with State and local governments and the private sector to make HUD's programs work to help them build strong communities, the Department has consulted with them on how to make the operation of Community Planning and Development programs more effective. In recognition of the fact that problems do not stop at jurisdictional boundaries, this rule encourages consultation with public and private agencies, including those outside a single jurisdiction, to identify shared needs and solutions to intra-jurisdictional problems. As a result of the Department's consultations, it has decided that the multitude of applications to obtain funding and the different funding cycles for various formula entitlement programs were symptomatic of a general problem. The general problem was that the easiest means for State and local governments to express their needs for federal funding (the CHAS) was hindered by HUD's procedures. Therefore, to eliminate duplication of effort and reduce the paperwork burden on these jurisdictions, the Department has decided to consolidate the program submission requirements to the greatest degree possible. This proposal will require all of the Community Planning and Development formula grant programs to use the same program year and will reduce the regulations concerning submission of planning/application/reporting documents virtually to the statutory minimum. This framework will give the States and local governments the flexibility to use existing plans and strategies to help citizens understand the jurisdiction's priority needs, and assess progress of those jurisdictions towards meeting identified goals and objectives through measurable indicators. The Department's goal is to encourage the development of comprehensive, easy to understand information on the jurisdiction's housing and community development needs that would promote meaningful citizen participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Blockbuster's after-tax profits boosted by 36% BLOCKBUSTER Entertain-ment, the fast-growing but sometimes controversial US video rental group, lifted 1991 after-tax profits by 36 per cent to Dollars 93.7m, but saw only modest growth in same-store rental revenue. In the fourth quarter alone, net profits were up by 37 per cent, at Dollars 29m, while earnings per share were 17 cents, against 13 cents. This was roughly in line with brokers' estimates although the shares eased  1/4 to Dollars 13 3/4 yesterday. Blockbuster, which is attempting to acquire Britain's Citivision and in which Philips Electronics of the Netherlands has a small investment, has expanded rapidly during the year. It has added 446 stores, taking the total to over 2,000. About half of these are company-owned and the rest run on a franchise basis. This was reflected in the substantial overall revenue growth, up by 34 per cent to Dollars 1.52bn for the year. But same-store revenue for company-owned stores which have been open for over a year, rose by only 7.7 per cent. Within this figure, same-store rental revenues rose by 4.9 per cent. Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman and also a founding partner in Waste Management, the waste disposal business, claimed the company was pleased with the figures, 'given the generally difficult economic conditionswhich affected retailing during the year'.</p>

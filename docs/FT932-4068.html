			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Yeltsin relaxed on constitution PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday conceded that his constitutional convention would probably fail to produce a draft constitution as quickly as he had hoped, and he suggested that the assembly take a month-long break. Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, Mr Yeltsin's chief legal adviser, said during that time a special commission could sort out disagreements over elements of a new constitution. Mr Yeltsin had initially instructed the convention to finish work on his draft constitution by next Wednesday. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who wants to delay the adoption of a new constitution for as long as possible, engaged in some familiar spoiling tactics yesterday. Claiming he was too ill to attend the convention at which he was supposed to speak yesterday, he announced plans to set up his own rival convention. Meanwhile, the government continued to combine radical economic action with old-style bureaucratic methods. At a cabinet meeting yesterday ministries were given a week to come up with plans for a 20 per cent cut in expenditure. The cabinet also created an inner group of ministers to deal with urgent economic reforms, to be headed by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, and including the government's three young radical deputy prime ministers. One of the duties of the commission, which excludes Mr Oleg Lobov, the conservative economics minister, is to implement an industrial policy, the details of which have yet to be finalised. Appearing weary, Mr Soskovets, who is formally responsible for industry, stressed the importance of rebuilding economic ties with other former Soviet republics. Moscow police have arrested several officials in charge of the Russian central bank's notoriously inefficient clearing system for alleged involvement in the diversion of central bank funds on the basis of forged transfer documents. An investigator in charge of the case said it was too early to release details but that the arrests went as high as managerial level. A spokesman for the central bank said that the arrests were confined to the separately-managed payments system and did not affect management of the central bank itself.</p>

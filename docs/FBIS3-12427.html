			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 25 (AFP) -- A well-trained man armed  with an Israeli Galil assault rifle can kill more than 100  people in a closed space within minutes, a senior military  officer told AFP.    The officer said a clip for the Galil 5.56 mm assault rifle  clip holds 35 bullets.    "If a man is properly trained, he can change a clip in a few  seconds," he said.    The Galil, brought into service at the end of the 1970's, is  considered heavy and less accurate than the M-16 and used only  by tank units now.    "With a gun like that in a closed space you can kill more  than 100 people."    It weighs 3.75 kilos and has a theoretically ability to fire  750 bullets a minute.    The army said a sole killer, 35-year-old Barukh Goldstein,  opened fire in a packed Hebron mosque at dawn on Friday.  Palestinian doctors said 53 people died and dozens were wounded  in the carnage.    However several Palestinian witnesses said up to five Jewish  settlers aided the American-born doctor with links to the  anti-Arab Kach movement. He either turned the gun on himself or  was shot by someone else, military officials said.    Yet another Palestinian who said he was in the mosque told  Israeli television that Goldstein was alone and re-loaded his  rifle with at least three of four or five bullet clips he  carried.    Police announced that a ballistics test would be carried out  to verify if all the bullets in the mosque came from the same  gun. Police said they were contacting witnesses to take their  testimony.</p>

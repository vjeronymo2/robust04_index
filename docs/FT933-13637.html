			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Letting the elephant walk SURVIVOR'S SONG: LIFE AND DEATH IN THE AFRICAN WILDERNESS by Delia and Mark Owens HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 306 pages AT THE HAND OF MAN: PERIL AND HOPE FOR AFRICA'S WILDLIFE by Raymond Bonner Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.95, 322 pages THE MYTH OF WILD AFRICA: CONSERVATION WITHOUT ILLUSION by Jonathan S Adams and Thomas O McShane W W Norton Pounds 15.95, 266 pages AFRICAN animals, particularly the elephant, have become one of the most powerful symbols of the conservation movement, and one of the most divisive. Rows between conservationists centre on whether the the 1989 ban on ivory trading is the best way to safeguard their future. Some favour 'sustainable harvesting' - farming elephants for meat and hides, and allowing hunters to shoot them for sport, to raise money and give African countries a reason to protect them. Most controversial is the allegation, increasingly made by environmental groups, that the longest established international conservation bodies are insensitive to African needs. In Survivor's Song, Delia and Mark Owens put themselves among those who see killing wildlife as defilement of paradise and the ivory ban as the best way to stop the killing. The book begins with their expulsion from Botswana following their criticism of the government for encouraging cattle farming at the expense of wildlife. Their search for a 'new Eden' ends in the wilderness of Zambia's Luangwa Valley. The Owens are unashamed, particularly in the passages written by Delia, of their romanticism. Delia 'craves sinking into Nature and learning her ways', and they plead for their favourite elephant, Survivor, who escapes the poachers: 'He just wants to eat these fruits, wander these hills, and live with his own kind. It is not too much for his kind to ask, or for our kind to give'. But the confusion of their metaphor of paradise - their banishment from Botswana was because of the government's sin, not theirs, they feel - sets up an ambivalence towards Africans that runs through the book. They spend more time describing what a hunted elephant might feel than on the feelings of villagers whom they are trying to wean off poaching. Their identification with animals also leads to uncomfortable anthropomorphisms, such as calling a forest clearing filled with bones an 'elephant's Auschwitz'. In many places the Owens appear to feel closer to animals than to people, even to each other - they split at one point, disagreeing on how to fight poachers. Much of the book is a gripping adventure, particularly the accounts of the poachers' attempts to kill the couple. It has something of a happy ending - the Owens say that when they started in 1986 the elephants were being poached at the rate of 1000 a year, but that had fallen to 12 a year by the end of 1991. But it is unclear whether this is due to their battles with the poachers, their loans to villagers or the 1989 international ban on the ivory trade. Their proposed solutions are also tentative - they hope that tourism should be 'designed so that it does not disrupt the ecosystem', and limited to old-fashioned walking safaris. Raymond Bonner, a former reporter for the New York Times, gives in to no such romanticism in At The Hand of Man. He accuses the World Wide Fund For Nature, in particular, of being steered too much by public opinion during emotional 1980s advertising campaigns, and for being driven against the judgment of its scientists into supporting the ivory ban. He is hard headed about his backing for 'sustainable' use of big animals, including culling them when their numbers grow too large. But although provocatively written, with an investigative journalist's eye for where the money comes from and where it goes, it is clumsily expressed. He uses layers of subclauses to capture the nuances of internal WWF wranglings, in a way that eventually slows his argument. His portrait of the WWF is also partly countered by the perceptiveness demonstrated by Adams and McShane, who are longstanding WWF staff, in The Myth of Wild Africa. In many ways, theirs is the most thoughtful of the three books in analysing the reasons for the past intractability of the problem. Their target is the kind of romantic views espoused by the Owens: the 'comfortable belief that Africa is a paradise to be defended, even against the people who have lived there for thousands of years'. They are at their best in tracing through history and literature 'the deeply rooted concept of wilderness that lies at the heart of the myth of wild Africa'. Instead they argue that human population growth will increasingly affect even the remotest areas and that 'traditional conservation, which saves animals at the cost of people' is doomed. So far, so convincing, but their proposal for joint African and Western schemes which will 'eventually . . . give control back to the African nations' is scarcely spelt out. As a result, their final wish for an approach to conservation 'in which people and their needs are brought back into the equation but the animals are not abandoned' looks - without more elaboration - almost as wistful as the romanticism they have condemned.</p>

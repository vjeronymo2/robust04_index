			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Opening concerts - Symphony Hall, Birmingham Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra took full possession of Symphony Hall on Monday. They played two one-work concerts - the complete Stravinsky Firebird at 7.30, and (with the CBSO Chorus) the complete Ravel Daphnis and Chloe at 9.15 - for two different audiences; this was a good, fair way of attempting to satisfy overwhelming demand. Just now, Birmingham is in a state of high excitement about its new possession. In purely musical terms, I must insist that any flush of pride the city may be allowing itself is more than justified. Whatever one may feel about the look of the building - and I completely share Colin Amery's sense of disappointment as expressed in these columns on Monday - in the end it is only the sound of the music that really matters. (In fairness to the architects it should be noted that the seats are extremely comfortable, the sight-lines are excellent, the leg-room satisfies even a six-footer, and entrances and exits are quickly effected.) The lucky critic who attended both halves of Monday evening can confirm, temperately, the conclusion that Brummies are no doubt already shouting from the rooftops: in acoustical terms the new hall is a plain triumph. Listening from a central stalls seat to the Firebird, I thrilled to the music in a way I have not done since first getting to know it in early adolescence. Later on, listening from a seat at the back of the first circle to the Daphnis, I was able more calmly to list and admire the linked achievements of Russell Johnson and Artec, the hall's team of acousticians. The sound of the orchestra seemed to possess ideal space, depth, intimacy, and clarity across a wide range of pitches and dynamics: in both seats - and this is the true miracle - it reached me as a physical presence naturally proportioned and positioned, with no lacks, gaps, artificial 'gramophonic' adjustments, or internal imbalances. In all the chamber-musical passages at the start of the Stravinsky ballet (whispering low strings, single woodwind strands, sudden faint percussion flickers and keyboard flutters) the softness of the playing was as it always should be: almost out of earshot and at the same time intensely 'real' and colourful. Similarly, the soft choral humming in the Ravel had an ideal degree of definition. In the encores played at the end of both concerts - orchestral versions of two Satie Gymnopedies - the hushed delicacy was simply hypnotic. Whereas in the Festival Hall even the most finely projected soft playing tends to evaporate, and in the Barbican even the most carefully focused loud can so easily become clotted, the dynamic range of both these performances was a sustained marvel of corporate artistry given sufficient room and time to express itself. Rattle's Daphnis was here far more spacious, more leisurely in its unfolding, than it has been elsewhere; clearly, Symphony Hall - which has been intentionally influenced in its acoustical planning by the sound-qualities of those auditoria (in Amsterdam and Berlin, inter alia) in which the CBSO has most enjoyed performing - is a place where the grandest musical constructions can be built up without need for hustling the pace. The built-in variables of the auditorium shell (the roof platform capable of being lowered to suit smaller forces, the extra resonance chambers that can be opened for the largest combinations) have still to be tested before the public. Now one is keen to know how a concerto soloist will sound, a single singer, the organ, a group of 'period' strings and winds. Many visits to Symphony Hall will be required to discover if there is indeed a limit to its seemingly limitless possibilities. But what is already clear, from these opening-night experiences, is that the musical life of Birmingham has received a boost of unimaginable force; and that the partnership of Rattle and the CBSO, for long this country's most exciting, is at the start of its golden era.</p>

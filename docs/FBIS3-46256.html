			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong, Chris Yeung and So Lai-fun] </F>   [Text] China and Hong Kong yesterday narrowed their  differences over financing the new airport, with Beijing saying  it would be flexible in the amount of borrowings it would allow  to extend beyond 1997 and Hong Kong expressing willingness to  pump more money into the venture.    Although the two sides fell short of specifying how flexible  they might be in the amount of equity injection and debt  ceiling, a leading pro-China party yesterday announced its  counter-proposal for the Government to inject a total of $89.2  billion to fund the $99.2 billion airport and railway projects.    Yesterday's revelation of the counter-proposal by the  Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) came  amid an argument between the two sides on whether China had  three months ago put forward a new set of proposals to finance  the airport and the rail link.    Government sources yesterday stressed that the last proposal  on the table was that sent by the British side at the end of  last June and which rejected China's repeated claim that Beijing  had sent its counter-proposals to the British side. "The ball  is in China's court," a source said.    But a mainland official asserted: "We have made a set of  proposals to the British about three months ago.    "They gave no response. Instead, it has time and again  sought fundings [from the Legislative Council.] Aren't they  going too far?" The official said that China remained committed  to the confidentiality rule but it was considering whether to  publicise its counter-proposals on the financial package,  claiming that the Hong Kong Government had ignored their demands  and blatantly violated the airport accord.    But the official also offered a note of conciliation, saying  that China was willing to agree to relax the debt ceiling of $5  billion outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the  new airport plan, despite the tough statement issued by the  State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also stressed that  the  Government was ready to show further flexibility in altering it  latest financing package to facilitate a final accord.    Expressing disappointment at China's statement that  financial  or legal obligations not approved by Beijing would be invalid  after 1997. Sir Hamish, however said he was encouraged by  remarks that China was still open to further talks in the Joint  Liaison Group Airport Committee.    "In suggesting a meeting of the Airport Committee [last  week]  we did make clear at the time to the Chinese side that we were  ready to show further flexibility," he said.    Although Sir Hamish fell short of elaborating what  flexibility the Government might offer, sources said that the  British side was prepared to consider further in creasing the  level of equity injections, which stands at $45.3 billion under  the third financing package into the airport and railway plans.    At present, Hong Kong's reserves already topped the $130  billion mark, said a source. The sources last night rejected  the DAB proposal as unrealistic even given Hong Kong's present  financial strength. But DAB chairman Tsang Yok-shing will fly  to Beijing today and forward their counter-proposal to Chinese  authority, confident that China would accept the party's  suggestion.    Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the Government  to  inject more funds to the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and  MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation] to reduce the debts  level, especially in the light of the huge reserves the  Government will accumulate in the run-up to 1997.    A mainland official, who preferred anonymity, said: "Our  demand is reasonable. The Government is fully capable of  increasing the fundings without any difficulty."    He said Beijing has clearly told the British side that they  were "willing to negotiate" on the level of government  borrowings adding the $5 billion ceiling laid down in the MOU  "can always be negotiated". The official questioned the motives  behind the insistence of the Government not to increase its  level of injections in spite of the surge in reserves in the  next few years.    "Certainly they will continue to make massive spendings. We  will tacitly let them make some gains. But they have to have a  responsible and reasonable attitude," he said.    The official said the Chinese side has already turned a  blind  eye to the previous fundings for the PAA because "we cannot  simply let the PAA dissolve". "Now they are asking for another  $4 billion. Just look at the items in the funding proposals such  as navigation system. Are they so urgently needed?" he asked.    But a government source said yesterday that while the  British  side was prepared to consider further raising the capital  injection from the $45.3 billion it proposed under the third  financing package, such a position did not mean the extra  investment should be unlimited.    In considering any further amount of capital injection, the  Government had to assess its impact on the reserves and whether  it would result in putting excessive funds to the two  corporations, thus undermining their alertness in operating with  proper financial disciplines, the source said.</p>

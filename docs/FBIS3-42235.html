[see item  EA0402195294 in previous Terrorism Report] The statement  described the incident as a massacre planned and carried out by  the National Front, leaving 28 worshipers dead [number as  received], including four students, and more than 300 others  wounded. The statement added that the incident coincided with  similar organized attacks on other mosques affiliated with the  Ansar al-Sunnah in Abu Sa'd and Zaqalona.    The statement denounced the incident and noted that this  bloody attack exposes the front and its claims that it is  defending Islam as well as its so-called cultural plan.</p>

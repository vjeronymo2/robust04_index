A special committee on precious stones  and metals was established in it, headed by Leonid Guryevich,  the democratic television personality from Murmansk who somehow  considered himself a great expert in this area, a sphere that is  already rather greatly specialized. For his outstanding services  in the field of destabilization of the diamond market following  dissolution of the parliament, Mr. Guryevich was appointed  deputy chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals. While the  Ministry of Finance attempted long and unsuccessfully to remove  the chairman of this committee, Yevgeniy Bychkov, from his  position, accusing him with justification of numerous financial  transgressions in which that very same Mr. Guryevich  participated as a partner. Following the lead of the directors  of the Russian Committee on Precious Metals (the former USSR  State Valuables Depository), the parliamentary committee began  to wage a campaign in the finest populist traditions regarding  the seemingly extortionate agreement with the international De  Beers corporation, a monopoly that sells all unprocessed Russian  jewelry diamonds on the world market.    Some commentary on the particular features of the diamond  market is necessary here. Expenditures of producers on the  extraction and sale of unprocessed diamonds are not only great,  they also involve a tremendous time lag between initial  investment and sale. The entirety of diamond production in the  world is maintained solely through sales of jewelry  diamonds--the production of industrial-use diamonds in itself is  unprofitable. The final stage of the diamond market--the sale of  jewelry items containing cut diamonds--depends strictly on the  economic situation that exists in the main consumer countries  (United States, West Europe, Japan). That very "evil De Beers"  spends more than $300 million on diamond advertisements, though  not trading in diamonds at all, with the aim of boosting final  demand. Stability of the economic state of the diamond  production industry (or more simply--its survivability) is  directly related to support for the stability of the world  diamond market, which is provided by the De Beers monopoly and  its central marketing organization (CMO). De Beers purchases raw  diamonds from producers at fixed prices within the framework of  a quota stipulated by agreements and bears a tremendous  financial load, paying for stocks of raw diamonds during periods  of poor market conditions. Indeed, De Beers controls the "free"  diamond market exchange, buying up diamond contraband unloaded  by diverse international variants of the demagogue Guryevich to  circumvent existing agreements. Incidentally, one year ago De  Beers was forced to spend 6-8 million pounds sterling per day to  buy up contraband Angolan diamonds on the market which found  their way to Antwerp as a result of the chaos caused by the  civil war in Angola.    For the time being we do not have any civil war in Russia.  Things are going excellently, however, with respect to chaos.  Mr. Bychkov, a contender for the record in political  survivability, and his colleague, Mr. Guryevich, have long been  obsessed with the idea of increasing the percentage of jewelry  diamonds sold freely and independently on the world market to 20  percent. In this regard, these gentlemen are not disturbed by  the fact that Russia lacks the assets for financing diamond  stocks and all the commotion on the establishment of Russia's  own "De Beers" died down after it became clear that the company  Diamonds of Russia, established for this experiment, was unable  to find hard currency to purchase the first consignment of  diamonds from production enterprises. The zealots of diamond  patriotism are not troubled by the fact that professionals  engaged in the extraction and trade of raw diamonds are the most  skeptical in assessing their labors.    It must be noted that rumors spread by certain figures with  respect to some kind of supposedly fantastic CMO margin are  related to a lack of understanding of the fact that De Beers is  the largest producer in the world of raw diamonds (Republic of  South Africa, Botswana) and is vitally concerned with stability  of the market and market prices. In other words--in supporting  the interests of the producers, just as Russia is. Let other  people concern themselves about the diamond consumers--Mr.  Bychkov and Mr. Guryevich, for example.    Until today, against the background of demagoguery and  dealing in petty contraband through joint enterprises related to  the Committee on Precious Metals, the fact that the contract  with De Beers is effective until 1995 has been a restraining  factor. However, a loophole has been discovered here, entirely  unexpectedly it seems. First of all, the political state of  affairs: the government has stated it will support a portion of  the budget deficit through sales of diamond stocks of the  Committee on Precious Metals on the domestic market. On the  other hand, the fairly broad spectrum of low-carat raw diamonds  previously considered industrial-use has become available for  processing thanks to the selfless labor of Indian jewelers. It  is these stones that the Committee on Precious Metals has  decided to quietly unload on the Antwerp and Tel-Aviv markets.  In this regard, all the experts of the Committee on Precious  Metals and its subsidiary organizations, on the one hand, deny  getting rid of raw diamonds, and on the other, revile the  existing agreement with De Beers. Stating that "we have never  unloaded diamonds in Antwerp," Boris Pozdnyakov, deputy chairman  of the Committee on Precious Metals, strongly undermines the  value of his guarantees. The USSR State Valuables Depository and  its partners were once caught engaging in such business. Pavel  Kovylin, representing Almazyuvelireksport, a branch of the  company Diamonds of Russia-Sakha, acknowledges "the existence of  a problem" on the intellectual level. He has not decided to  express himself more definitively, however.    As a result, De Beers is spending money to buy up not  Angolan  but Russian diamonds (totaling close to $80 million in value),  the understanding between Russia and its strategic partner for  30 years is placed in doubt, and the market--in no way the least  important from the point of view of Russia's long-term national  interests--finds itself threatened, while Mr. Bychkov and Mr.  Guryevich acquire capital based on this, political capital at  the least. In principle, the logic displayed by the Committee on  Precious Metals team coincides entirely with Zhirinovskiy's  patriotic escapades, each of which will inflict real material  damage to Russia in the form of falling prices for delivered raw  material, insofar as the stability of shipments and potential  capacity for reaching agreements with Russian partners are  placed in doubt. Thus, the political and economic situation  today has become for some people the long-awaited murky current  where, as we know, one goes fishing.</p>

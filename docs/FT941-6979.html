			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: If you like it, then go for it - That's the message on investment trusts from one analyst Investment trusts seem to have entered a topsy-turvy world where discounts have become premiums and it is cheaper to invest through a new or a C-share issue than to buy shares in an existing trust. So says analyst Robin Angus in NatWest Securities' annual review of the investment trust sector. The past year has been a boom time for investment trusts. Their performance has outshone unit trusts; more and more private investors have been taking their first plunge into the sector; and discounts have narrowed rapidly. But Angus, although generally bullish, sounds a few notes of caution. 'The performance edge which investment trusts have enjoyed over unit trusts has not come from widely differing net asset total return performances,' he says. 'It has come mostly from the narrowing of the discount. And that is something which cannot happen twice.' And while he does not think discounts are about to disappear for good, he does not believe they will return to the 20 or 30 per cent level of a decade or so ago. 'I am not saying that trusts are bad value,' Angus says. 'But now, with conventionally structure trusts, it is all down to the gearing and the low management costs, and to the performance of the underlying assets.' The message is blunt: Pick your trust - and its manager - carefully. 'Don't pile into the sector indiscriminately,' Angus cautions. 'Discounts are too low for that and there are risks involved if the market takes a quick, sudden tumble.' But he adds, too, that his old prejudice against new issues and C-shares has disappeared. 'If it's big, liquid and you like it, go for it.' Angus says the future development of the investment trust industry should focus on 'life-style needs' where savings products are provided for pensions, house purchases, school fees and private medicine. This is already starting to happen - Foreign &amp; Colonial recently launched an investment trust pension - but there are still huge, unexploited opportunities. Meanwhile, the new issues keep on flowing. Two of the latest may be of interest to investors who are looking to extend their portfolio into formerly uncharted - and still risky - territory. The public offer is now open for the Israel fund, a dollar-denominated, UK-listed investment trust managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. It closes on March 3. The fund will invest in stocks listed on the Tel Aviv exchange, or Israeli companies listed elsewhere. This is the first single-country fund for Israel available readily to UK private investors except for a very small Luxembourg-registered unit trust from Svecia, marketed through Skandia Life. Minimum subscription to the Israel fund is Pounds 1,000 and ordinary shares are offered at Dollars 1, with one warrant (exercisable May 1995 to 2004) attached to every five shares. Another fund which fills a previously empty niche for UK investors is the CS First Boston Central European Growth fund. It plans to invest mainly in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to take advantage of what its managers expect to be the fastest growing economies in Europe over the next five to 10 years. The public offer opened yesterday and closes on March 11. Ordinary shares are on offer at Dollars 1, with one warrant (exercisable between April 1995 and 1999) attached to every five shares. Minimum subscription is Pounds 1,000. Issue expenses mean the Dollars 1 shares will have an initial net asset value of 96.2 cents. Annual management fee will be 1.25 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that the Congressional mandate to evaluate substitutes based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing overall risk to human health and the environment authorizes use of global warming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as one of the SNAP evaluation criteria. Public comment failed to identify any definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall risk that warranted excluding global warming. Further, in October 1993, the President  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed EPA through the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) to use its authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 612 of the Clean Air Act to narrow the uses allowed for hydrofluorocarbons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perfluorocarbons with high global warming potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees with the statutory and legislative history arguments raised by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter. The commenter points to language that relates only to the listing of ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depleting and global warming substances, which is not relevant to EPA's authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 612(c) to regulate substitutes based on an assessment of overall risk. The fact that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress may have deleted authority for EPA to phase out use of substances based solely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their global warming potential without regard to available substitutes certainly imposes no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation on consideration of global warming potential as a factor in assessing the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of using any class I or II substitute. Especially in light of President Clinton's recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to use section 612 authority specifically to narrow uses of high global warming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential CFC substitutes based on an overall risk assessment, EPA has concluded that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to consider global warming potential as one factor in the SNAP analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in this final rule, the Agency will continue to exercise its statutory authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review substitutes for listing as unacceptable or acceptable alternatives, using the criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation set out in the NPRM, including global warming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of potentially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters supported EPA's definition of potentially available because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would speed the review process and encourage innovation in development of new substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters expressed the concern that EPA's definition of ``potentially available''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could allow EPA to review and accept a substitute which may be several years from general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial availability, and on that basis to ban some other commonly used chemical with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively higher risk. These commenters argued that EPA should at least wait until test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing has begun to consider an alternative ``potentially available'' for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP review. Another commenter argued that a knowledge of the economic viability of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute is crucial in assessing its potential availability as a substitute under SNAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 612(c) of the CAA, the Agency is specifically required to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives that are either ``currently or potentially available.'' For this final rule, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is defining as potentially available any alternative for which adequate health, safety, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental data, as required for the SNAP notification process, exist to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of acceptability, and which the Agency reasonably believes to be technically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible, even if not all testing has yet been completed and the alternative is not yet produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or sold. EPA would not prohibit use of a substitute where no substitute that reduces overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk is currently available, to avoid situations where the only available substitute to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transition away from ozone-depleting compounds is unacceptable under SNAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of a substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed support for EPA's definition of a substitute as used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NPRM. One commenter proposed the use of the word ``alternative'' instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substitute,'' while supporting the Agency's general construction of the statute to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP's purview to extend beyond chemical substitutes to a broader range of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, including process changes. Another commenter, while also generally supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's definition of a substitute, pointed out that the language ``could replace'' is overly broad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter noted that this language suggests that someone who is not using a compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an ODS replacement, but is aware that it could be used in this way, should report to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under SNAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of this final rule the Agency is using the word ``substitute'' as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synonym for alternative. As discussed in section IV.A, this definition includes chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes, alternative manufacturing processes, and alternative technologies. In response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public comment described above, the Agency has also clarified in this final rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP addresses only those substitutes or alternatives actually replacing the class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds listed under section 602 of the CAA within the eight industrial sectors identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in sections IX.D. through K.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. General Comments on Substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perfluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the NPRM for SNAP, EPA proposed perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as acceptable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited use as replacements for ozone depleting chemicals in the solvent cleaning, and fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppression and explosion protection sectors. Several commenters supported the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cautious approach toward PFCs, given the high global warming potential of these compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as their extreme atmospheric persistence. Other commenters sought clarification with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the scope of the Agency's proposed restrictions on PFCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

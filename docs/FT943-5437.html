			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Be sure to keep records Tax inspectors, like birds of prey, wait for their victims to make a mistake. In many cases, people coming to the UK take detailed advice on arranging their affairs only to find, several years later, that their plans have not been implemented properly. This can be caused by complacence, coupled with ignorance of the small print of the tax legislation - or by new rules that are overlooked. The result is rich pickings for the Inland Revenue. It is becoming increasingly common for inspectors to harass taxpayers, whether they are UK-domiciled or not. Quite often, tax is not due - but the documentary evidence to prove it beyond doubt is lacking. The victim is, therefore, pressured into paying some tax simply to avert the stress of a full-scale investigation. So, if you want an offshore structure to be tax-effective, it is crucial to have regular meetings with your UK tax advisers and make sure that proper records are kept.</p>

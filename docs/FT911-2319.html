			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Dominican Republic escapes US sanctions THE UNITED States has concluded that there are no grounds for implementing trade sanctions against the Dominican Republic over the treatment of Haitian migrant workers. The calls for sanctions, including the removal of preferences granted under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, followed claims by human rights organisations that Haitian workers, particularly those in sugar cane fields, were being mistreated. The human rights organisations said the conditions under which many Haitians were working in the Dominican republic amounted to forced labour. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola. A shortage of field labour in the Dominican Republic has attracted workers from across the border. Unemployment in Haiti is 60 per cent, and wages are low. The charges led the office of the US Trade Representative to start an investigation two years ago, and last year President Jaoquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic ordered all employers of Haitian workers to provide the government with information on the condition of their employees. The president also decreed that all contracts made out to Haitian workers should be in Spanish and Haitian creole, so the workers would be clear on the terms of their employment. There are an estimated 750,000 Haitians in the Dominican Republic, most of whom are believed to have entered the country illegally. They are employed in cane fields, rice and coffee farms and in the construction industry. The US report, which is unlikely to appease the human rights organisations, said there had been improvements in workers rights and the conditions of Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic.</p>

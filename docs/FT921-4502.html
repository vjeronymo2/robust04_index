			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Major pins poll hopes on tax concessions MR JOHN MAJOR will pin his hopes for a fourth consecutive Tory general election victory on a tax-cutting Budget, in spite of confirmation from the opinion polls that Labour will start the campaign for an April 9 election with a narrow lead. Senior ministers last night promised a 'sensible but popular' Budget package, combining immediate tax cuts with a programme mapping out further reductions and tax reform if the Conservatives are re-elected. Some ministers suggested that this could involve the introduction of a new 20p rate of income tax to apply to the the first two or three thousand pounds of taxable income. Others, however, predicted a 1p cut in the basic rate of tax. As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, put the finishing touches to his Budget speech, the consensus among ministerial colleagues was that the initial cost of the tax cuts would be between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn. Whitehall officials stressed that Mr Lamont would attribute a sharp rise in public borrowing next year to the impact of the recession rather than to his Budget package. The City expects a borrowing requirement in 1992-93 of around Pounds 25bn. Labour, however, promised to step up its campaign against any 'Budget bribes' with a presentation this morning detailing how the money could be better spent on the National Health Service. Opposition strategists said they were confident they had 'neutralised' in advance the political impact of a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax. The strategists also confirmed that a future Labour government would press ahead with an 'open-minded' review of the case for electoral reform - including proportional representation, by enhancing the status of the present Plant committee, set up two years ago. Mr Major, who spent yesterday at his Huntingdon home, finalised the election preparations during a telephone call to Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman. It is thought the prime minister will tell the Queen of his intentions during an audience at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening. At an earlier conference in London he set out the themes of his election manifesto, promising a programme for government which would ensure that 'welfare and wealth creation go hand in hand'. Two opinion polls published yesterday gave Labour leads of one and three points respectively, confirming the recent trend in its favour. That puts Mr Major in the position of being the first prime minister for more than 40 years - since Clement Attlee in 1950 - voluntarily to call an election while his party is behind in the opinion polls. A Harris poll for the Observer put Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats at 40 per cent, 39 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, while an NOP poll for the Mail on Sunday gave them 41 per cent, 38 per cent and 16 per cent. Despite jitters among Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies, senior ministers said last night that there could be 'no turning back' on an April 9 poll. One member of Mr Major's inner circle said that he was confident that the Budget, economic competence and Mr Major's popularity would allow the Conservatives to take the lead during the campaign. Mr Lamont is expected to signpost a significant programme of tax reform  - covering areas such as savings, inheritance and capital gains taxes - in an attempt to sharpen the political contrast between the Conservatives and Labour.

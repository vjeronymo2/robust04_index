			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Accor A consortium led by Accor, the French hotel group, has completed a Dollars 57m purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Pannonia, Hungary's main mid-market hotel chain, writes Nicholas Denton from Budapest. The deal's most striking provision is that Pannonia will become Accor's vehicle for expansion in the southern tier of eastern Europe, holding the exclusive right to Accor brands such as Novotel and Sofitel. In addition to the purchase price, Accor has undertaken that a privatised Pannonia will invest a further Dollars 30m for renovation of the Hungarian company's portfolio of 33 hotels. Hungary's State Property Agency, the privatisation authority which conducted the disposal of state-owned Pannonia, plans to float its residual shareholding on the Budapest stock exchange in the course of 1994.</p>

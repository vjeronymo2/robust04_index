			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Southam halves loss to CDollars 7.2m SOUTHAM, Canada's biggest newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger is a substantial shareholder, has halved its first-quarter loss and dropped plans for a rights offer to raise CDollars 75m (USDollars 62.5m). The quarter showed a loss of CDollars 7.2m, or 11 cents a share, down from CDollars 15.3m, or 26 cents, a year earlier. Revenues totalled CDollars 272m against CDollars 274m. Southam has restructured its national newspaper chain, sold printing assets and raised CDollars 180m for debt reduction by private placement of equity with Power Corp of Canada. The newspapers showed a small operating profit in the latest period compared with a CDollars 4.1m loss. Advertising lineage was down 4.7 per cent on average. Business communications were profitable. Coles, the company's bookstore arm, lost CDollars 2m against a loss of CDollars 1.6m, in spite of a 10 per cent increase in revenues to CDollars 43m. Southam says that because of the private placement it no longer needs to proceed with the rights offer. It expects to post a profit for 1993. Hollinger has 18.8 per cent of Southam. It is in the throes of selling half this stake for Pounds 72.3m (USDollars 111.34m) to The Telegraph UK newspaper which is 68 per cent owned by Hollinger.</p>

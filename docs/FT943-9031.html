			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bombay's BSE index closes at record high A rise in the yen prompted profit-taking and arbitrage selling also dragged share prices lower. The Nikkei index reversed a two-day advance, although it still closed 0.7 per cent higher on the week, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average declined 157.53 to 20,663.83 after a high of 20,825.07 and a low of 20,643.03. Some brokers tried to push the index up at the opening to support prices for options settlement, but profit-taking and arbitrage selling came in later. Volume totalled 230m shares against 248m. The bulk of morning trading was linked to the options settlement, and afternoon volume was the lowest of the year. Public funds, which had supported activity during the week, were absent, while buying of steel and chemical stocks by foreign investors remained small. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 10.74 to 1,651.78 and the Nikkei 300 lost 2.25 to 300.20. Declines led advances by 659 to 266 with 216 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.10 to 1,333.27. Arbitrage selling depressed bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,010. Brokers were also easier, with Nomura Securities losing Y10 to Y2,250. Chemical stocks were supported by foreign buying. Mitsubishi Kasei gained Y2 to Y550 and Showa Denko added Y5 to Y374. The rise in the yen to the Y100 level against the dollar hurt high-technology electricals. Hitachi fell Y5 to Y995, NEC lost Y50 to Y1,190 and Fujitsu declined Y10 to Y1,070. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 133.75 to 22,964.61 in volume of 39.8m shares. Roundup Positive performances were seen in the region's markets yesterday. BOMBAY closed at an all-time high, already enthused by good corporate results and normal monsoon rains, and encouraged further by heavy speculative buying. The BSE index closed at 4,508.15, up 113.88 or 2.6 per cent, a rise of 4.8 per cent on the week. Many local analysts expected the market to hit the 5,000 mark by the end of the year as foreign investors returned and further good interim results came through. However international analysts were slightly more bearish, fearing the weak political situation may depress any significant rises. HONG KONG rebounded late in the session after hesitancy attributed to Monday's interims from HSBC, and Tuesday's meeting of the US FOMC. The Hang Seng eased 59.98 to 9,464.56, down 1.4,per cent on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 3.24bn. TAIPEI fell back for the third successive session on nervousness prompted by central bank moves to tighten liquidity to prevent more funds flowing into the equity market. The weighted index fell 63.88, nearly 1 per cent, to 6,628.14 in moderate volume as the overnight interbank rate increased to 10.625 per cent. The electronics sector was the worst hit having been overbought in previous sessions. Analysts suggested that the market would consolidate further before testing the 6,700 resistance level again. The market lost 4.2 per cent on the week. MANILA broke through the 3,000 level as strong liquidity and sound economic fundamentals pushed the index up 30.37 to close at 3,007.36 on volume of 4.1bn shares. Analysts expected the market to continue to improve next week when the required reserve on bank deposits are cut 3 per cent to 17 per cent on Monday. SYDNEY closed lower on continuing fears of an imminent rise in domestic interest rates. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.9, or 0.5 per cent, lower at 2,051.9 in turnover of 150.1m shares, a loss of 1.9 per cent over the week. Banks were generally weaker. Westpac lost 4 cents to ADollars 4.46 and the Commonwealth 17 cents to ADollars 8.85. SINGAPORE rose in heavy trading as retail investors switched funds from Malaysian issues to local second-line stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 17.76 to 2,317.79 in volume of 445.6m shares valued at SDollars 965.56m, a gain of almost 2 per cent during the week.</p>

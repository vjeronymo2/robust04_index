			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Bosnia Fight Fair"] </F>   [Text] Not long after Bosnia erupted into civil war 21  months ago, the international community gambled that if it could  fudge its commitment to peacekeeping long enough, the conflict  would sooner or later fizzle out and be forgotten. It has not  paid off; instead, with each passing day the stakes have  increased to a point where the poverty of conscience is  bordering on ennui. The impatience of the major powers in the  shambolic [as published] Bosnian peacekeeping operation to  consign the tragedy to remote memory has left them questioning  themselves about how little they can get by with in dealing with  the Bosnias of the future. With their default over Bosnia more  or less a done deal, the NATO countries at their summit last  week hastened to reassure themselves that the Atlantic alliance  could still uphold lofty principle on elaborate pretense alone.    For while the post-Cold War world resolves its geopolitics  in  the absence of a clear definition of friend and foe, it is  pretentious to assume that self-interest is anything less than  paramount. Both France and Britain, the main participating  nations in the Bosnian peacekeeping presence, have hinted that  that interest would not be further served by exposing their  troops in an inconclusive conflict. Those troops might be  withdrawn if no agreement is reached by the spring -- it would  be pointless to stay on when the injustice of the carve-up plan  has been conceded as a given. The Bosnian Government cannot  accept the residue of their country as offered so far, and have  no choice but to keep on fighting. With its back against the  wall, it had been prepared to yield up to two-thirds of its  territory in return for a face-saving and economically viable  peace. Between immolation and a humiliating vestige of their  former sovereignty, the Bosnian Muslims are making the only  dignified choice. Having stayed neutral on the terms of a peace  settlement, the Europeans see no point in turning their token  gestures into sitting ducks.    Apart from the extremist elements, the Bosnian Muslims know  that they cannot win back all that they have lost. The realists  hope to regain the bulk of central Bosnia and wrest by force the  minimal concessions that they had thus far failed to obtain by  negotiation. The greatest irony of the West's dereliction over  the Bosnia issue is that the basis for their inaction has not  come to bear -- the conflict did not end quickly. It is now  safe to conjecture that had the arms embargo been lifted, the  fighting would have taken less time to come to a truce, with an  eventual deadlocked armistice. No matter how tense such an armed  stand-off might have been, it would have been wrought at less  suffering. Ethno-religious rivalry exacts greater attrition the  longer it is left to fester. The sooner an impasse is reached  with reasonable grounds staked out, the more amenable will the  combatants be to a practical detente.    Such "what if's" will no doubt keep historians busy in time  to come. What would make them busier still is the external and  incidental costs of the international community's betrayal of  principle. It is already obvious to most Muslims worldwide that  their interests are incompatible with those of that community's  Western leaders, vaunted principles notwithstanding. The scale  of Bosnia's neglect might be small enough to be easily  forgotten. But the religious sectarianism with which that  conflict was fought will be remembered for a long time yet.</p>

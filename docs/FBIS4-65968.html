			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that  it will not be beneficial for the UN secretary general to  present a report to the UN Security Council while talks on  confidence-building measures are continuing. Cetin departed for  Paris to attend the opening conference of the European Stability  Pact.    In a predeparture news conference at Ankara's Esenboga  Airport, Cetin answered a question on the report by UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali. He said: The report has not yet been  published. Actually, publishing a report when talks are  continuing may harm the negotiations. For this reason, the  report should be published after the talks end.    In answer to another question, Cetin reiterated that  President Rauf Denktas will go to Turkey over the weekend and  meet with President Suleyman Demirel.</p>

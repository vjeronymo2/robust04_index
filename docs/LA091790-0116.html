			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEERS FROM BACKSTAGE;  </P> <P> EMMYS: FIRST-TIME WINNERS TED DANSON OF 'CHEERS' SAYS IT 'FEELS FUNNY' TO  FINALLY WIN THE AWARD WHILE KEENEN IVORY WAYANS OF 'IN LIVING COLOR' SAYS,  'IT'S NICE TO BE RECOGNIZED.'  </P> <P> On a night when there was no dominant winner, the talk backstage at the Emmy  Awards in Pasadena Sunday was narrowly focused on the individuals bestowed with  the statuettes. Those who trekked back to meet the press -- not everyone did --  were happy but not always expansive.  </P> <P> One of the happiest was Ted Danson.  </P> <P> Veteran loser Danson, finally a winner after eight previous Emmy nominations,  said that it felt good to be recognized finally for his work on "Cheers." But  he also noted that, "It's new to my body; it feels funny."  </P> <P> Danson is committed through this season to the NBC comedy, the No. 1-rated show  over the course of the past year. Beyond that: "It's tough to say goodby to  it," he said.  </P> <P> He attributed his success and that of the series to great writing. "It's the  writing, come on. Funny things are coming out of our mouths," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, some of the success is due to the fact that "we don't  rehearse until the very last second and we play a lot of football."  </P> <P> He said that he had no plans to donate his Emmy to the "Cheers" bar: "I'll  carry it everywhere."  </P> <P> Marg Helgenberger had definite plans for where to put the golden statuette that  she picked up at the 42nd annual ceremonies celebrating TV's best nighttime  programs and personnel. "I think I am going to put the Emmy in my baby's room,"  she said, after winning as best supporting actress in a drama series.  Helgenberger, who is expecting a baby boy in seven weeks, plays the cynical  prostitute K.C. on "China Beach."  </P> <P> Her pregnancy is being written into the series. "They tried to shoot around  me," she said for a laugh. "But only on the first episode."  </P> <P> Asked if this will be the last season for her series, she said, "It's so hard  to hear things like that. We try so hard."  </P> <P> "My fingers are turning white, I have been gripping this (the Emmy) so hard,"  said Keenen Ivory Wayans, whose funky Fox series, "In Living Color," copped the  Emmy as best variety, music or comedy series.  </P> <P> "It's nice to be recognized," he said. "We came on in midseason and only have  done 13 shows."  </P> <P> No, Peter Falk said, he has no idea why his "Columbo" is such a continuing  success.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me to understand why an Eskimo and a descendant of the Aztecs  all relate to him. From Bulgaria to Minneapolis, it's all the same."  </P> <P> Falk, who won as best actor in a drama series, said that he was pleased with  the show's scripts because "we don't cheat as much (on the mystery clues of the  plots) as some other shows," he said. There are "genuine twists" and most of  the plots are plausible.  </P> <P> "Columbo" was dropped from the regular ABC schedule but is scheduled to  continue in the form of occasional TV movies, in the vein of NBC's "Perry  Mason." The actor said that he believes he can continue playing the character  for many years, because age will give the tricky detective all kinds of new  opportunities. Then, he launched into a very old-man Columbo, asking a suspect,  "Now, give me a minute. I'm not sure what case I'm on."  </P> <P> Candice Bergen veritably apologized for not having much to say, because, she  claimed, she didn't feel she'd win again this year for lead actress in a comedy  series -- especially after "Murphy Brown" lost earlier in the evening in other  categories. She figured that Delta Burke of "Designing Women" or Kirstie Alley  of "Cheers" would win.  </P> <P> But, generously, she said that it was the whole crew that helped win the Emmy  and she will "try to not be too piggy and take it too personally."  </P> <P> Bergen reflected over earlier years when the film community generally frowned  on the television community. When someone such as herself departed the former  to join the latter, she said, "I thought you would have to eat at other tables  in restaurants."  </P> <P> Nor did Jimmy Smits have much to say. He was a very sullen winner for  outstanding supporting actor for "L.A. Law"; the charm with which he infuses  his character of Victor Sifuentes was definitely not in evidence.  </P> <P> "I don't do this very well," he told reporters. "All the four nominations have  been special and winning this has been especially special. Thank you."  </P> <P> It was some sort of cruel justice that Alex Rocco won the Emmy as best  supporting actor in a comedy series for his memorable Al Floss, the ultimate  Hollywood agent -- since his first-year show, "The Fabulous Teddy Z," was  canceled by CBS because of low ratings.  </P> <P> In an effort to explain the show's demise, Rocco said that he figured "the  little guy in Idaho didn't get it, I guess," he said. He invoked the language  that Al Floss might have understood: "Maybe it was too inside. Out in the  boonies (the boondocks), it went right in the toilet."  </P> <P> As there are men without countries, one reporter pointed out that Rocco, a  veteran of 25 years in the acting wars, is an actor without a series.  </P> <P> He firmly gripped his golden award as he faced 50 photographers screaming for  him to look this way and that, and told reporters that many possible options  for Al's afterlife have been discussed by agents and producers. But nothing's  been signed, he said, and now it's up to "The Big Guy,"' as in the Deity.  </P> <P> Eva Marie Saint couldn't figure what was more rewarding, her Oscar for "On the  Waterfront" in 1954 or Sunday night's Emmy for best supporting actress in a  miniseries. She played Lil Altemus in NBC's "People Like Us." It didn't matter:  Her finest moment, she said, is being a grandmother.  </P> <P> Saint has had her ups and downs, and she quoted Cary Grant on the best acting  attitude -- that it's important "to stay on the bus . . . that some days you  have to give up your seat, and even stand around a while."  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Left in censure move over social chapter LABOUR'S ATTEMPTS to corner the government over the Maastricht treaty's social chapter were thrown into confusion last night after left-wing Labour MPs tabled a motion censuring Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker. The move came after the government seemed to have been put on the defensive by Mr Morris's decision to accept a new Labour clause calling for an explicit vote on Britain's social chapter opt-out. This appeared to be a setback for the government since the selected clause is more tightly drawn than the similar Labour new clause which the government said last week that it would accept. But it remained unclear whether the clause - known as new clause 74 - had the potential to pose a real threat to the Maastricht process by forcing the government to choose between accepting the social chapter and ratifying the treaty. The three Labour signatories to the motion of censure seemed to think that it did not. Mr Peter Shore, the veteran MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney, described both it and the new clause accepted by the government last week as 'entirely agreeable' to the government. The motion was tabled after Mr Morris, the MP presiding over detailed consideration of the Maastricht bill, again confirmed that he would not allow MPs to vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment which would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. The motion - tabled by Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, Mr Denzil Davies, the MP for Llanelli, and Mr Shore - expressed regret that Mr Morris had decided 'contrary to normal practice' not to permit a division on an amendment 'having allowed a debate upon it to take place.' It called on Mr Morris to 'reconsider his ruling forthwith' and permit MPs to 'reach a decision on that amendment'. Unless withdrawn, it is expected to be debated today or tomorrow. But there were predictions last night that its main effect could be to make a vote on the amendment less rather than more likely. This was because it might undermine the efforts of the Labour front bench to secure a vote on the amendment - known as amendment 27 - during the bill's report stage. If the motion were heavily defeated as seems likely, the reasoning went, it would suggest MPs were happy with Mr Morris's ruling and this could weaken the argument for holding such a vote at report stage. Later Liberal Democrat support helped the government to win a vote to extend debate beyond 10pm by a margin of just 7 (302 votes to 295.) With Labour abstaining, MPs then voted by a margin of 200 (296 votes to 96) that clause one - the measure's main substantive clause - should stand as part of the bill.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The renewed rise in the yen against the dollar triggered by US-Japan tensions over trade is expected to provide support for the government bond market this week. Bond traders expect the yen's appreciation to depress corporate earnings, and hence delay recovery in the economy. A possible barometer of investor confidence will be the auction for April government bond issues scheduled for this week. Although the ministry of finance may be forced to postpone the auction due to the parliamentary wrangling over the budget talks, analysts expect institutional investors' appetite for long-term bonds, to have improved considerably due to the turn of the new business year. Volatility in the stock markets due to increased political turmoil has decreased alternative investments. However, the key for movements of the No 157 10-year benchmark will continue to be price movements in the US Treasury market. Investors are focusing on the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting held for the three days to Wednesday. In spite of some bright economic indicators, especially in the consumption area, government officials and central bankers remain cautious about the economy and towards pointing to the end of the recession.</p>

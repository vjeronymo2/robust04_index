			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate hopes spur fresh gains in shares INTEREST RATE cuts in Germany and elsewhere in Europe provided a favourable background for a UK stock market featured yesterday by the successful reception for the pricing of the Zeneca rights issue which triggers the demerging of ICI. Last-minute fears that the Zeneca issue might bring surprises proved unfounded and the terms and size of the rights offer were comfortably in line with the market's original expectations. Equities were in good form from the opening, helped by Wall Street's strength overnight and led forward throughout by a good premium on the FT-SE 100 Index June future contract. A larger cut than expected in the Bundesbank's 14-day repurchase rates, widely regarded as the precursor to a reduction in Lombard and discount rates next week, strengthened hopes that a beleaguered UK government can be bounced into lowering domestic base rates. The FT-SE 100 closed 24.7 points ahead at 2,860.8, just below the best of the session. In late trading, London brushed off a sluggish opening to the new session on Wall Street, which was 5.2 Dow points off in London hours. Trading volume increased to 773.6m shares, swollen by good but not frenzied activity in the various ICI/Zeneca instruments - conventional ICI shares, and grey market dealing in post-merger ICI, in Zeneca ex-rights shares and in Zeneca nil-paid rights. Investors appeared to be moving towards the conventional ICI shares rather than Zeneca, the bioscience and pharmaceutical company to be demerged shortly. The rest of the market was relieved to see the ICI/Zeneca rights deal out in the open safely, but must still brace itself for the sale of further BT shares by the British government and also the monthly funding of government bonds. Although some trading houses reported a healthy input of overseas cash into the London market yesterday, others were not completely convinced. This week has seen a successful rally in UK stocks, in part because investors hope that the poor electoral showing of Mr John Major's government in last week's local and by-elections will encourage it to cut base rates. However, even after yesterday's performance, the Footsie remains about half-way through what has been identified as the current trading range and may not face a final test of confidence unless it clears the 2,900 mark. Second-line stocks, which suffered much less in last week's sell-off, have also fared better than the Footsie shares this week. Yesterday, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 13.7 points at 3,145 and is now within 10 points of its all-time peak. Retail, or customer, volume in equities, which is regarded by fund managers as the most convincing guide to the market's health, has remained satisfactory, if not exciting, over the past week. On Tuesday, Seaq trading of 676.8m shares was worth Pounds 1.29bn in retail business. Strong performances among bank and oil shares led the blue chip sectors ahead yesterday. Selective US demand was seen, although London traders somewhat over-anticipated this during the first half of the session and were caught out briefly when Wall Street proved slow to follow through after its 25-point gain on the previous day.</p>

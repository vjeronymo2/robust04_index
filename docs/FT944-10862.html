			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / S African land bill moves on South Africa's national assembly yesterday passed a Restitution of Land Rights Bill in a first step towards compensating millions of blacks dispossessed under apartheid. The bill, the first significant legislation aimed at redressing the wrongs of apartheid to go through parliament, provides for the setting up of a Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights to help claimants bring their cases to a Land Claims Court. The legislation provides for hearing of any claims dating as far back as 1913. Most parties support the idea of land restitution for the estimated 3.5m blacks forcibly removed from their lands over the past 80 years, but most claims will be difficult to assess as little documentary evidence of past tribal ownership exists. Given its budgetary constraints, the government will also find it hard to provide financial compensation for those whose claims are upheld. The bill still has to be passed by the Senate before it can be signed into law.</p>

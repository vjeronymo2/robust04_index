			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "Persons Influential in Foreign </F> Policy Fall Into Two Groups: Politicians Stick to Neutrality,  Government Officials Support Alignment"]    [Text] Those who wield the most influence on Finland's  foreign policy are divided into two schools of thought with  regard to how Finland's foreign and security policies should be  handled in future.    In the opinion of the political decisionmakers--members of  the Eduskunta and ministers--Finland should follow a foreign  policy line of cautious neutrality, one that adheres to  nonalignment. Politically, supporters of this approach are found  in the left and in the center.    In the opinion of high-ranking officials responsible for  foreign policy and international relations in the ministries,  Finland should try to align itself.  <H5>  Two Schools </H5>   According to the hopes of the officials, Finland should move  closer to the European Union (EU) and the NATO defense alliance.    The managers of the big export companies are in sympathy  with  the officials' views.    The difference in point of view comes out in an opinion poll  commissioned by the Foreign Policy Institute, which was  published on Wednesday [15 December]. Dr. Weijo Pitkanen, an  institute researcher and political scientist, conducted the  poll. The Finnish and Russian Peoples' Friendship Society funded  the poll.    Pitkanen refers to the first-mentioned school as the  "neutrality school" and the second one as the "alignment school."    Conducted by the Finnish Gallup Company, 214 influential  people responded to the poll. The questions were sent to  representatives of the church, the political parties, the big  export companies, the Armed Forces, and the news media, in  addition to the politicians and government officials. The  president of the Republic did not participate in the poll.    Pitkanen described the respondents as "Finland's foreign  policy elite." All of the respondents either directly or  indirectly influence the making of foreign policy decisions.  <H5>  Officials Changed Views </H5>   Pitkanen saw in the results of the poll a noticeable change  to the old way of handling foreign policy in the days of the  Paasikivi-Kekkonen line. Specifically, in past years officials  saw to it that Finland adhered closely to a policy of  neutrality, while politicians were willing to be flexible, as  necessary.    The Armed Forces and the church are trying to walk a  tightrope between the two schools of thought. The Armed Forces  support EU membership, but, as supporters of an independent  defense, the military entertain doubts about NATO membership.    The news media's position is inconsistent. According to the  poll, the media are hesitant about EU membership, but there is  support for NATO membership among them.    A certain indecisiveness is reflected in the results of the  poll. The "secure," bipolar system has disintegrated, and a new  system of cooperation that gives the impression that it will  endure has not yet been found. The respondents are pleased with  the disappearance of the old system.    In agreement with the official line, nine out of 10  respondents declared that the bases for Finland's foreign and  security policies are an independent defense and action within  the framework of the CSCE.    They expressed the hope that the CSCE would be developed  into  a new, pan-European security system, but they do not have very  great faith that it will.    Only a fifth of the respondents felt that the CSCE is an  effective guarantor of the stable evolution of Europe. They had  even less faith in the United Nations.  <H5>  Confidence in EU and NATO </H5>   On the other hand, they had great confidence in the EU and  the NATO defense alliance. Three out of four respondents felt  that NATO is an effective guarantor of the stable evolution of  Europe, and two out of three respondents felt that the EU is.    Eight out of 10 respondents felt that membership in the EU  is  desirable. They took a more cautious view of membership in NATO:  The percentages of those in favor of membership in it and those  opposed to it were even.    Membership in the EU was felt to be especially desirable by  42 percent, while only 14 percent felt that way about membership  in NATO.  <H5>  Russia Feared </H5>   Their attitudes toward Russia were also split. On the one  hand, they hoped that Russia would participate in European  cooperation and, on the other, they expressed suspicion and fear  of it. Russia was not viewed as a military threat, but primarily  a civil threat.    They felt that Russia's environmental problems, the increase  in professional crime, its economic difficulties, and the rise  in big brother nationalism are the biggest threats.    Two out of three respondents thought that "the threat posed  to Finland by the situation in Russia is growing."    The poll was conducted in the fall, in part before Rutskoy's  and Khasbulatov's attempted coup, but clearly before the Russian  elections.    The respondents were asked for their opinion as to how  Finland should prepare for the Russian threat.    The influential respondents' indecisiveness shines through  their responses: Over half of them reject the view that Finland  should apply for membership in NATO because of Russia and over  half of them are also in favor of traditional neutrality.  <H5>  Karelia Not Wanted </H5>   The return of Karelia did not receive very much support in  the poll. Only a small percentage of the respondents stated that  they support the submission of an official proposal to Russia  that negotiations on the return of Karelia be initiated.    Some sympathy for negotiations on Karelia is to be found in  the church and the Armed Forces.    The influential respondents' optimism was also assessed in  the poll. In Weijo Pitkanen's opinion, most of the respondents  are pessimistic [about the future]. Only the members of the  Eduskunta and the ministers were categorized by Pitkanen as  being "optimistic."</p>

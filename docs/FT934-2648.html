			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (5): Success proves a hard act to follow / A look at the continuing drive to win the foreign investment that will provide employment Trucks going to and from Telford ply the M54 day in and day out, testimony to the hive of activities within the town. The statistics are impressive. More than 1,000 companies have located in Telford, attracted towards the relatively spacious lay-out of the town which puts almost every site within five minutes of a motorway junction. Easy access for supply vehicles also means that people can easily get to the town to work. The town itself has a population which is younger than the region, while the pool of economically active people within half an hour's travelling time is forecast to grow from 552,500 in 1991 to 587,000 by 1995, according to a study carried out by Wrekin District Council and consultants. Telford has also benefitted from being an area which qualified for government grants for companies setting up in the area, or existing companies investing in expansion. That this status has now ceased can be seen as testimony to Telford's success. It is now the older urban areas and towns in the south which have been hit hard by the contraction of defence and other high technology activities, which qualify. Publicity for the town draws heavily on the appeal it has had for overseas companies. More than 130 companies, from 18 countries, have set up in the town, mostly in manufacturing, or distribution, but some are service companies. The US tops the list, but the 24 Japanese companies - including NEC, Ricoh, Epson, Maxell - might be said to have sealed the town's reputation. Companies from Taiwan, one of the newer investors from Asia, are the latest to choose Telford. The bulk of the town's employers, however, have less exotic backgrounds. Most have relocated from other parts of the West Midlands. Two of the most important relocations, however, have been from the public sector: the Inland Revenue, which set up its central computer activities in the town, and the Land Registry. But cherries of this size are not likely to drop again for some time. Given the uncertainties in the British economy, the Telford Development Agency (TDA) must still look overseas to meet the demand for jobs from people living in and around the town. Japanese investment has slowed, German and other European Union interest is not being confirmed. The US is also slow. The TDA is targetting Switzerland, from where eight Telford companies have already arrived. Telford was picked for the proposed first British Sky Park. The concept is for 64 houses to be built, each with a hangar at the bottom of the garden, which would be connected to a central runway, so that executives of foreign companies could jump into small, private planes and be in their head offices within a couple of hours. The suitability of Sky Park to Telford is still awaiting the verdict of the UK environment secretary. Even if it is turned down, it offers an interesting angle on the diverse ownership of companies in the town. Telford's economic architects would like to see a greater diversity of activities to serve as a bulwark against recession and the continued rationalisation of locations by companies. The town suffered badly in the early 1980s. The current motor industry sales dip has taken its toll even in the past month, with the closure of the GKN/Jaguar pressings activities, which is moving to take up Ford spare capacity on Merseyside. Telford wants more research facilities and would like to embrace higher technology. A science and technology park is on the cards. The new Shropshire campus of Wolverhampton University will help to emphasise that the town is increasingly capable of accommodating more than the sort of routine assembly and back office jobs that have proved vulnerable. Unemployment in the Telford Travel to Work Area is 9.7 per cent. In the town itself, it is at least a couple of points higher. The latest West Midlands Survey* puts the figure for Shropshire slightly higher than the rest of the region, where employment prospects are improving. Telford seems to be reflecting this trend, since the rise in unemployment also lagged behind that of the West Midlands. With a growing population, the town has to create more jobs simply to stand still. But Telford is not all 'new town'. One part of north Telford - based on the old mining settlements of Oakengates and Hadley - displays social and economic characteristics associated with inner cities. The isolation of its inhabitants is all the greater because the new investment has been made close to the area. But a bid to get the area designated for the government's City Challenge programme did not succeed. Labour-led Wrekin Council is conscious of area's needs. With the Commission for New Towns and several housing associations, Pounds 17m investment is going to meet unsatisfied demand for cheaper housing, both to rent and for purchase. The upgrading of facilities, such as shopping, is also planned for the districts. Small factory units are being built with the help of European regional development money. Telford cannot afford to take its eye off the ball for a second. The town has to look good and work well if it is to continue to attract incomers. Its marketing people argue that much of the relocation is 'self-selecting', determined by the need of the components sector for good sites in the region, and that Telford has those sites. Loss of assisted area status will not help. Competition with other areas, particularly Wales, is intense. Furthermore, Telford tends only to come into the picture when a company has already decided it wants to set up in Britain. At the same time it must continue to meet the requirements of companies that are already established in the town. The problem with success is that it can be a hard act to follow. * The West Midlands Business Survey, Autumn 1993, Wolverhampton Business School in conjunction with Warwick Business School and Price Waterhouse.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Struggling with the US market - Richard Lapper on the tough going for insurance brokers YESTERDAY'S decision by Sedgwick to cut its dividend is evidence of just how difficult trading conditions have become for the leading international insurance brokers. Like the other three large publicly-quoted companies  - Marsh McLennan, Alexander &amp; Alexander and Willis Corroon  - Sedgwick obtains more than 40 per cent of its brokerage revenue in the US and has been badly hit by the intense competition in that market. While rates in some other insurance markets have hardened recently, the US market remains stubbornly depressed. Sedgwick's main competitors have all struggled to increase their income. Alexander &amp; Alexander, which reported interim results last month, saw operating revenues dip to Dollars 668m (Pounds 350m) from Dollars 676m. Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, saw an increase in revenues from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.5bn, but this was largely explained by the inclusion of revenues from Faugere et Jutheau, the Paris-based subsidiary acquired by Marsh earlier this year. In addition Marsh also benefits from the income earned by Putnam, its investment management subsidiary. Willis Corroon, which is tipped to report reduced pre-tax profits when it reports interim figures tomorrow, is also expected to have found the going tough in the US. All four companies have also been faced with a fall in interest rates worldwide, which has dented investment earnings, while Sedgwick and Willis, in particular, have been badly hit the fall in the weakness of the dollar. Roughly 60 per cent of Sedgwick's income is in dollars. Analysts have been expecting the US insurance companies to begin to increase premium rates, following a period of intense competition and heavy underwriting losses. Instead Mr Quill Healey, chief executive of Sedgwick James USA, said rates had fallen by a further 30 per cent in some cases. Mr Healey said Sedgwick had met with 25 of the biggest insurance companies with which it places business. 'Invariably each company says the other 24 companies are so very competitive and are going broke. The fact is that each company is fighting hard to maintain existing accounts and win new business. it is very very competitive,' said Mr healey. Rates on a typical property policy had fallen by between 10 and 15 per cent. Rates on contractors' policies 'the sort of thing we would sell in Boise, Idaho,' had fallen by 30 per cent, said Mr Healey. He added that low interest rates in the US were partially responsible for the continued ferocity of rate competition. Falls in interest rates were increasing the value of bond portfolios, with capital gains from this source offsetting underwriting losses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] British Secretary of State [title as  heard] Douglas Hogg has met with the president of the republic  of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, in Prishtina. We remind you that  Mr. Hogg is visiting Kosova as part of his tour to several areas  of former Yugoslavia. We go over to Skender Durmishi's report  from Prishtina:    [Durmishi] The start of a dialogue on Kosova is necessary  and the first step to precede all measures and other actions  toward solving the Kosova question, as one of the most important  points of the crisis in the former Yugoslav area. We should  keep looking for concrete forms and solutions -- this was the  main message with which British Secretary of State Douglas Hogg  arrived in Prishtina today. At today's talks, Hogg put forward  this message to both sides.    During the meeting with Kosova's president Rugova, the  high-ranking British guest considered the visit as a gesture of  good will and expressed his views on possible solutions to the  Kosova problem.    On this occasion, Rugova pointed out that the commitment of  Kosova Albanians to a peaceful solution is a clear testimony of  our readiness for dialogue through the mediation of a third  party. Mr. Rugova said that on the basis of referendum results,  we have our option for an independent and neutral Kosova, with  which we can enter the process of dialogue with no prejudice.    Considering today's meeting to be very important and after  briefing the high-ranking guest about the grave situation in  Kosova, president Rugova demanded more active commitment from  the international community to a fair solution of Kosova's  problems. In this respect, we hope that Great Britain, as an  expert on the problems of Kosova and Albanians, will grant fresh  assistance, Mr. Rugova said.    As part of his visit to Kosova, Foreign Office Minister  Douglas Hogg met today with representatives of the Serbian side,  a meeting that was held behind closed doors.    In two brief news conferences held after these meetings,  recalling that he has not brought along any definitive project  but is expressing his own opinions on possible solutions, Mr.  Hogg told reporters that the Kosovar problem should be solved  within the framework of Yugoslavia, because there can be no  changes to borders. The fact that 90 percent of the Kosovar  population are Albanians cannot be ignored and this requires  that economic, political, and the maximal cultural autonomy be  granted to the Albanians of Kosova.    Conditions should be created for the Albanians to exert full  control over topics of interest, such as the economy, education,  communications, and their security, as well as having complete  political and social freedoms. Mr. Hogg also pointed out the  high level of disagreements and options between the Albanian and  Serbian sides, which, he said, with the mediation of the  international community, could be brought closer by means of an  equal dialogue, because if both sides are not equal, this cannot  be called a dialogue.    Hogg stressed that the pressure on Serbia for the immediate  return of the CSCE monitors to Kosova is another step for the  international community, and should follow immediately.    In the evening, Hogg held talks with several leaders of  political parties and intellectuals in Kosova.</p>

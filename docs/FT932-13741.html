			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Small business audits reviewed THE government will today hold out the prospect of a significant reduction in the regulatory burden on small business with the formal opening of public consultation on scrapping the audit requirement for small private companies. But the ambition of the Department of Trade and Industry to abolish for all unquoted small companies the requirement for independent annual audit of their accounts still faces fierce Treasury opposition. The Inland Revenue has persuaded the Treasury that the audit requirement is an essential element in reducing potential fraud. The DTI consultation paper is therefore expected to foreshadow a more limited relaxation of the rules, concentrating initially at least on limited companies in family ownership and with a relatively low annual turnover. One suggestion is that the requirement be abolished initially for businesses whose turnover is below the Pounds 36,600 threshold for value added tax. That would help about 250,000 companies. But the Institute of Chartered Accountants recently won widespread backing among bankers, businesses and accountants for a proposal that only those companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000 a year be subject to annual audit.</p>

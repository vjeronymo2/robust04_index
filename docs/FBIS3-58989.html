			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Arnaud Rodier: "Armament -- France Reassures </F> `Dragons'"]    [Text] It is no accident that [Foreign Trade Minister]  Gerard Longuet -- intent on reaffirming that France does not  intend to burn all bridges with Taiwan -- chose to make this  statement in Singapore.    Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet wants  everybody to be happy. He reaffirmed yesterday in Singapore  that, on 12 January, France did not undertake to cease selling  weapons to Taiwan altogether, but only those weapons "deemed  offensive for mainland China" or "likely to threaten its  integrity or its security."    This is a way for Mr. Longuet to expand on statements made  by  Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who insisted last week on the  fact that Paris reserved the right to continue selling  "nonoffensive" equipment to Taiwan.    However, choosing to do it from Singapore was no accident.    France, which will supply 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft  and their weaponry to Taiwan, knows that it must give up hope of  selling it three assault submarines worth 20 billion francs.  <H5>  Making Up For Lost Time </H5>   However, France has not given up its intention of selling  assault armored vehicles as well as Roland missiles, since such  equipment can very well be considered as defensive weapons. And  above all, France does not want to lose other customers in the  region, including Singapore.    "The agreement signed with Beijing is likely to open markets  which were hitherto closed to France, but it also creates a risk  of destabilization for noncommunist countries, including  Southeast Asia's `dragons,'" says a weapons manufacturer.    This analysis applies not only to the defense industry, but  also to civilian sectors. And, as reaffirmed yesterday by  Gerard Longuet, France wishes to position itself in Singapore so  as to be better placed in Malaysia, India, and Vietnam.    France did not prove active enough in this region. It needs  to "make up for lost time," insists Mr. Longuet.    As for manufacturers, from Aerospatiale to Thomson to  Alcatel-Alsthom, if the government works toward smoothing things  out, so much the better. Improved relations between Paris and  Beijing are expected to help Airbus Industries sell its aircraft  in China. However, this does not justify ignoring other  countries, which would immediately turn to the United States  anyway.  <H5>  Minister Seeks To Reassure </H5>   Singapore is one of them. Its influence in the region is  substantial. Accordingly, Gerard Longuet waxes reassuringly  toward those who fear France might focus on China to the  detriment of everyone else.</p>

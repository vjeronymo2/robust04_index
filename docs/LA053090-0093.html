			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENSION FUND URGES FIRMS TO SPURN ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW  </P> <P> In a new sign of the increasing militancy of large pension funds, the  California Public Employees Retirement System on Tuesday asked 22 of the  largest companies incorporated in Pennsylvania to withdraw from that state's  far-reaching anti-takeover law.  </P> <P> CalPERS, the nation's largest and most influential public pension fund, with  about $57 billion in assets, said the recently passed law placed radical  restrictions on the right of shareholders to change management.  </P> <P> The law essentially makes it harder for hostile parties to buy a company  incorporated in the state and for disgruntled stockholders to change management  through proxy fights aimed at ousting the board and other tactics.  </P> <P> The pension fund sent a letter dated May 11 to the companies. It said it has  not yet received any direct responses.  </P> <P> Large pension funds, which can own million of shares of publicly held  companies, are increasingly taking a more active role in corporate affairs in  order to ensure that their investments remain profitable.  </P> <P> "There's a growing trend to militancy" among the once-passive trustees of large  pension funds, said Richard Koppes, general counsel to CalPERS.  </P> <P> CalPERS may completely divest its stock holdings in Pennsylvania companies,  which total $500 million, and the fund has already joined a lawsuit to overturn  the controversial legislation, he said.  </P> <P> The Pennsylvania anti-takeover law has galvanized pension funds into protecting  their own interests more aggressively, Koppes said. CalPERS is currently  weighing plans to lobby for change in the law, and may freeze any further  investments in the state.  </P> <P> "We're going to urge more federal intervention" against state anti-takeover  laws, such as the law passed by Pennsylvania last month, Koppes told Reuters.  </P> <P> The Pennsylvania legislation, which is considered the nation's toughest  anti-takeover measure, was signed into law on April 27. It allows companies 90  days to decide whether they want to be included under its provisions.  </P> <P> "The Pennsylvania law is a real problem for pension funds in general, both  public and private," Koppes said.  </P> <P> The bill was supported by many major Pennsylvania corporations and labor, but  it was opposed by Canada's Belzberg family, whose takeover overtures to a  company in the state prompted the bill.  </P> <P> Already, PNC Financial Corp., the state's biggest bank holding company, has  recommended that it not be covered by the bill. But PPG Industries Inc., a  large building materials company, said it wanted to be included under the  bill's provisions.  </P> <P> CalPERS said the anti-takeover legislation impairs the ability of U.S.  companies to compete in a global market while diminishing the rights of  stockholders.  </P> <P> Critics of the new law have said that it would serve to protect entrenched  management's interests, and make U.S. companies less competitive by making it  hard to oust incompetent managers.  </P></p>

The electronic body scanners and luggage security checks in  the main customs posts in Guangzhou, Kowloon and Jiangmen have  given way to two new passages, known as the "red passage" and  the "green passage".    Under the new rules, customs formalities for travelers going  through the "red passage" take a maximum of three minutes, while  passengers having nothing to declare can go through the "green  passage" without examination.    According to the bureau, the new rules stipulate that random  luggage examination will replace universal examinations.    Officials said that the measures, first tried out in the  Luohu and Zhongshan customs of the province, have brought China  closer to the established international practices in the field.    Starting January 20, the simplified customs formalities will  be officially implemented in the province's customs posts at  Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Shantou, Wangpu, Jiangmen and  Zhanjiang.    Statistics show that the daily number of travellers going  through the province's customs has increased from less than  20,000 in the early 1980s to the current 200,000, some 80  percent of the country's total.</p>

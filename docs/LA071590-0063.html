			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GENEROUS REWARDS TO TREASURE HUNTERS HELP INDONESIA KEEP ITS ART;  </P> <P> ANTIQUITIES: AN EXHIBIT TOURING THE U.S. SHOWS THE WISDOM OF A NATION'S PAYING  MARKET VALUE FOR FINDS.  </P> <P> Indonesia may have a lesson to teach other countries that are rich in buried  ancient art.  </P> <P> In such places, looters often sell artifacts to private dealers rather than  turn them over to the authorities. In Indonesia, however, the authorities  compete with private collectors by rewarding finders generously.  </P> <P> A show that opened this month at the National Gallery of Art displays many  treasures that came to the Indonesian government because of this system.  </P> <P> One of the treasures was found in a cave on the island of Java by archeologists  helping the government survey tourist sites.  </P> <P> Jan Fontein of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, who put the show together,  described the find: " . . . inside the cave filled with stalagmites and  stalactites, on top of a tall rock shaped like an altar, they discovered a  large bronze vessel containing several objects, including this gold and silver  statuette of a couple holding hands."  </P> <P> Archeologists calculate that the tiny figures -- less than 5 inches high --  must be at least 1,000 years old. They still aren't sure who the subjects  represented, probably the Hindu god Shiva and his consort, Parvati.  </P> <P> Both are naked from the waist up. Their heads are surrounded by halos and  protected by little golden parasols.  </P> <P> "The Sculpture of Indonesia" exhibit, in Washington through Nov. 4, will also  travel to Houston, New York and San Francisco. Many of its best items were  found by chance.  </P> <P> A much bigger Shiva -- more than 42 inches high -- in gold, bronze and silver  and with four arms and three eyes, was found in 1933 by farmers bathing in the  Kali Wadas River.  </P> <P> Fontein has counted 854 separate finds, some of which include several objects.  They were reported to Dutch authorities before Indonesia became independent,  and since then to the Indonesian government and other official bodies.  </P> <P> "There's a tendency to report them because of the fair way the authorities  reward the finders," he told a news conference.  </P> <P> In many parts of the world finders get more by selling their treasures secretly  than they would if they reported them. That enrages museums and archeologists  because thieves and amateurs often destroy much of the evidence, sometimes  unwittingly.  </P> <P> Fontein told of a boy working in an Indonesian garden last year who found a  gold neckpiece that weighed more than 3 1/2 pounds. He said the authorities  paid the full market price of the gold and divided it between the boy and owner  of the garden.  </P> <P> "The boy's education is assured," he added.  </P> <P> Fontein was allowed to see the neckpiece on condition that he did not ask for  it to be sent to the exhibition. An attempt will be made to film it for a  production linked with an 18-month celebration of Indonesian culture that is to  open here in September.  </P> <P> J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibit opened  before September because so many people visit Washington in summer.  </P> <P> Fontein said he did not know why so many objects were buried. Many of them were  found close to the surface. One farmer found a temple bell in a field when  planting a new kind of sugar cane required him to plow a few centimeters  deeper. Near it was a box with a chain from which the bell had been hung.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I think they buried them just for us to find," he said.  </P> <P> Faithful Buddhists and Hindus buried many things when Indonesia was invaded by  Muslims 400 years ago. The Muslims disapproved of human images and  representations of living things and objects connected with other religions.  </P> <P> Buddhists and Hindus took refuge in the hills of Java. The final object in the  show is a three-panel sculpture, apparently of Hindu origin. It is more than 5  feet high and 7 feet long and shows a scene in a blacksmith's shop. On one side  is the smith forging a sword. On the other is a man working a bellows to heat  the forge.  </P> <P> In the center panel is a fat man with the head of an elephant, naked and  dancing. He is wearing a priest's headdress and holding a small dog in one  hand.  </P> <P> What is he doing there? That story is lost.  </P></p>

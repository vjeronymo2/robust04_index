			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations jumps 95% CONTINUING actions on costs and trading margins enabled Sheffield Insulations Group to offset a further significant fall in construction activity and hoist pre-tax profits by 95 per cent, from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.95m, in 1992. Turnover of the group, which supplies insulation products and services for energy conservation, was only slightly ahead at Pounds 133.5m (Pounds 132.1m), but price deflation masked a real increase in volume. Further increases in market share were recorded in all businesses. Earnings rose from 3.7p to 7.9p, while an unchanged final dividend of 3.6p makes a same-again total of 5.4p. Bad debts, although 16 per cent below the 1991 level, remained high at over 1 per cent of sales. Gearing was slightly lower at 41 per cent (42 per cent).</p>

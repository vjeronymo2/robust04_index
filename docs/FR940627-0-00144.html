			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs are required to accumulate at least 4,000 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to emission testing. For engines operated on an engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamometer, the minimum break-in requirement is 125 hours of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation for testing baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. The 4,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the emission stabilization procedures used in EPA's new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle certification program. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  An intact aftertreatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device must be used when accumulating mileage in the evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Mileage can be accumulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a number of ways, i.e., on a test track, on a dynamometer, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the street, or as part of a manufacturer's fleet. No specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving cycle is required, but it must include a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of transient operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 86.094&hyph;26. Mileage and service accumulation; emission requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For atypical F/FAs, the minimum mileage accumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required prior to testing is also 4,000 miles for test vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 125 hours for test engines. After completion of the 4,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mile/125 hour minimum mileage accumulation, an attempt should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Mileage accumulation must continue until either: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 percent or more of the input mass of each atypical element is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in the emissions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate combined), or (2) a maximum mileage accumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to 40 percent of the average useful life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable vehicle/engine (e.g., 40,000 miles for light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, 116,000 miles for heavy-duty vehicles, or engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent) has been reached. When either of these conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been met, emission generation can begin for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission characterization or biological testing. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of atypical species in specific emission fractions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be dependent on the nature of the particular atypical element,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recommends examination of all emission fractions (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). The determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate intervals for conducting emissions measurements is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left to the manufacturer's discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers of atypical F/FAs may choose to accumulate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic wash coat). <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  However, the sampling and analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions for detecting the atypical element(s) of interest,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to emission characterization or biological testing, must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done with a non-functional aftertreatment device. A brief period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of warm-up driving (i.e., 10 miles or equivalent time) needs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precede the sampling for the detection of atypical element(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the manufacturer chooses to accumulate mileage without a functional aftertreatment device, and if the manufacturer wishes to do this outside of a laboratory/test track setting, then a memorandum of exemption for product testing must be obtained by applying to the Director of the Field Operations and Support Division [see &sect;79.51(e)(6)(iv) of this rule]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the mileage accumulation period for the testing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any fuel or fuel additive, vehicles and engines used for emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation must be maintained in good condition by following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended maintenance practices in the appropriate vehicle or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine owner's manual. Maintenance requirements were described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the previous section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Special Requirements for Additives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes provisions for the testing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific types of additives that might require modification in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission generation requirements. These include additives used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in conjunction with aftertreatment devices, additives used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrequently, and diesel additives produced exclusively for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in diesel  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the above sections, EPA is requiring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions used for Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing be generated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles/engines with non-functional aftertreatment devices. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to comments received on the Reopening Notice, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is including in this final rule a special allowance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific types of additives that are designed to work in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with aftertreatment devices. In the case of fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives specifically intended to enhance the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust aftertreatment devices, the related aftertreatment device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be used on the emission generation vehicle/engine during all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mileage accumulation and testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding infrequently used additives, EPA recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some aftermarket additives are intended by the manufacturer (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated in the additive's instructions for use) to be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel tank only at infrequent intervals. During mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation, these types of additives may be applied according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the manufacturer's specifications. However, during emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation and testing, EPA requires that each tankful of fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used contain the fuel additive at its maximum recommended level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of bulk additives used intermittently for the direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during storage or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or other component of the fuel distribution system (and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also requires that the additive be added to the base fuel at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum concentration recommended by the additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer for treatment of the fuel or distribution system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component. If the manufacturer of infrequently used aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or bulk additives (as described above) is concerned that the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle/engine may be adversely affected and/or the emissions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be subject to artifacts due to overuse of these types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification in test procedure requirements. Any such request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include test data (e.g., emission characterization data) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the claim that procedural modification is needed, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a suggested substitute procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

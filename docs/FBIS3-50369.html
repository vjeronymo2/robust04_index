			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Borders Are Unchangeable"] </F>   [Text] Dunajska Streda--Yesterday's District Assembly of  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Dunajska Streda  was attended by HZDS Chairman and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.    In his opening statement, he pointed out that current HZDS  district assemblies confirm that the movement is gathering new  strength and that any opposition pressures are in vain because  the ruling movement is fulfilling, and will fulfill, its  electoral program. He noted that, in conformity with the  Constitution of the Slovak Republic, the movement is trying to  address ethnic issues so that everyone's freedom and the  equality of all citizens regardless of nationality be  guaranteed. No one is a second-class citizen in our country, the  prime minister stressed. If someone suffers from the internal  complex of being a second-class citizen, let him undergo  treatment and not go public with it.    Relations among citizens in the south of Slovakia are not  complicated, but the problems are being exaggerated by Central  European bodies and also by some circles from Hungary. Our  borders are unchangeable, and each political party at home as  well as abroad must realize this, Vladimir Meciar said, among  other things.</p>

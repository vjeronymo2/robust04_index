			<p>BFN     [Text] Over 25,000 tractors, diverse implements, and  vehicles from the Agriculture Ministry [Minag] will be subjected  to a preservation process. The Minag has approximately 150,000  such resources nationwide; approximately a sixth of which will  be mothballed.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In regard to  tractors,  for example, we must prepare approximately 8,000 for long-term  storage, as well as a similar number of diverse transportation  vehicles. There are also approximately 10,000 implements. [end  recording]    The decision to put away and preserve these resources, in  addition to material limitations, was made based on the  existence of more efficient forms of organization in Cuban  agriculture such as the Basic Cooperative Production Units and  the Youth Labor Army integrated farms. In this manner, the  Minag's productive plans for 1994 are not compromised.    The process of preservation and storage will be conducted by  the enterprises which will result in a rational use of available  resources and the reorganization and betterment of their  technical assistance network. It was announced at the  demonstration class on preservation held in Guantanamo that the  Minag provincial office recommended stopping 40 percent of its  machinery, half its transportation vehicles, and 30 percent of  its implements.    It is a matter of preservation now to conserve for the  future.</p>

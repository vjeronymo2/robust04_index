			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Builders warn against rate rise Any further rise in interest rates would 'risk stalling the housing market completely', according to a survey of more than 600 building companies published today. The survey by the Building Employers Confederation said the industry was making a slow but patchy recovery. Consumer confidence was very fragile, however, particularly in the housing market where sales in September had not seen the normal seasonal uplift. About 52 per cent of builders expected total construction output to rise in the next 12 months, however, compared with 37 per cent which expected output to remain the same and 11 per cent which expected output to fall.</p>

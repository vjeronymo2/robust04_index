			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Futures bounce back POOR bank holiday weather failed to dampen spirits in the short sterling market and dealers returned from the long weekend in a more optimistic frame of mind over possible interest rate cuts, writes Peter John. Consequently, the futures contract for September delivery bounced back from Friday's low, moving ahead nearly 15 basis points on heavy turnover and closing at what dealers considered a more realistic level. The announcement of a UK Cabinet reshuffle and the appointment of Mr Kenneth Clarke as chancellor of the exchequer had not provoked a rush of enthusiasm. The principal reaction appeared to be a technical adjustment following the shift from rumour to fact and a feeling that a further rate reduction was unlikely over the summer while Mr Clarke got his feet under the table. Yesterday, however, there was a return to the argument that if there were to be a shift in the rates in the near term it is more likely to be down than up, and the September contract finished the day at 94.28, still not discounting a cut of  1/2 percentage point but sitting on the lower interest rate side of the fence. Almost 40,000 contracts changed hands. Meanwhile, overnight money traded between 5 1/2 and 5 1/4 per cent during the morning as a gilts repurchase agreement relating to the Bank of England's support for the pound before Black, or Golden, Wednesday was rolled over. It was then squeezed up to just under 7 per cent. In the money markets, the Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 450m and offered no early help. It did not operate during the morning but came in during the afternoon with Pounds 75m of assistance, buying band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent rate. However, it provided around Pounds 540m of late unspecified assistance, bringing total help to Pounds 615m. This compared with the latest forecast of a Pounds 600m liquidity shortage. In Germany, call money remained firm at the start of the new month, but dealers expected rates to ease in the coming week as the market adjusted. Overnight funds were quoted at between 8 and 8.25 per cent. Rates had risen to as high as 8.5 per cent on Friday due to tightness in the market at the end of the month.</p>

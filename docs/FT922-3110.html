			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments shares tumble on 29% fall SHARES in Oxford Instruments underperformed a declining market by tumbling 10 per cent to 229p, as the advanced instrumentation company revealed a sharper-than-expected 29 per cent fall in profits. The pre-tax return of Pounds 8.6m for the year to March 29, struck on sales 5 per cent lower at Pounds 103.3m, was about Pounds 1m lower than analysts had expected. Losses estimated at about Pounds 3m at three subsidiaries were believed to have been responsible. Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, held out little hope for an improvement in the current year, saying that new orders were about 17 per cent down to Pounds 95m on the previous year. He added, however, that the decline appeared to have bottomed out and two of the three subsidiaries were expected to return to the black this year. The dividend is raised to 2.9p for a total of 4.3p (4.15p). Earnings per share fell to 14.7p (16.8p). The good news came from Oxford's joint venture with Siemens in magnetic body scanners, which increased its profits contribution by 44 per cent to Pounds 5.1m. This was due to an increased share of a market which was largely static, Mr Williams said. Profits were also helped by the Pounds 1.2m tax benefit on the release of provisions relating to asset disposals in 1991. The tax charge fell from Pounds 3.99m to Pounds 1.45m. Mr Williams stressed the continuing importance of research to Oxford Instruments. The group spent Pounds 8.1m on research and development, roughly equivalent to last year. COMMENT Oxford enjoys a roller coaster relationship with City sentiments: sometimes up, sometimes down. Yesterday's results sent it hurtling towards earth. For a start, Oxford's great hope, the synchrotron, may be working very well but it has no orders for new ones; and the longer it has to wait for an an economic upturn, the more chance competitors have to catch up. Furthermore, the lead times are long and the semiconductor market is still flat on its back. On the brighter side, the cash position is very strong and a lot of work has been done to rein in costs without damaging research. Also, Oxford enjoys a healthy lead in some interesting technical areas. But any recovery will long term. Forecasts are for Pounds 8.5m, with a prospective p/e of about 20 times. This is not a company for amateurs and certainly not for short-termers.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Saskatchewan ripe for diamond rush' Canada's next diamond rush is likely to be in Saskatchewan, according to Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French banking group. 'Saskatchewan has a very high potential for the discovery of an economic diamond deposit over the next few years,' suggests analyst Mr Charles Kernot. Diamond hunting in the province has been going on spasmodically since 1948 but was given a boost by the recent diamond rush in Canada's Northwest Territories. The most high-profile operation in Saskatchewan is a joint venture between two uranium companies, Cameco and Uranerz Exploration, which has found diamonds in the Fort a la Corne region. Monopros, the exploration arm of De Beers, the world's biggest diamond group, is earning a 33 per cent interest in that project and providing access to its sampling laboratories in Johannesburg. Credit Lyonnais has a vested interest in Saskatchewan diamonds because it is in the process of raising CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m) net from European investors for Kensington Resources, a small Vancouver-quoted company that is exploring for gems in the province. Kensington has hired the head of the Saskatchewan ministry of energy and minerals' diamond exploration programme, Mr Malcolm Gent, as a consultant. De Beers is moving into diamond mining in Ghana. The South African group will spend USDollars 1m to re-evaluate state-owned Ghana Consolidated Diamonds' Birim River reserves. If the outcome is positive Ghana's government will take 20 per cent of a new company, Birim River Diamonds, and De Beers will share the rest with Lazare Kaplan, a US merchant. Meanwhile, De Beers will take over management of GCD's existing operations and expects to double output of mainly near-gem and industrial-quality diamonds to more than 400,000 carats in the coming year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Answering questions about his opinion on the latest  UN secretary general's report, Archbishop Khrisostomos said: "We  are not at all satisfied with UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report. The attribution of some vague  responsibility to the Turkish side is ruined by the alternative  procedures that are suggested."    Among other things, the archbishop said in his statement:  "Who is Butrus-Ghali to threaten with his reference to the  withdrawal of the UN international peacekeeping force that is  stationed in Cyprus? Certainly not the Turkish side..... It is  a threat to us, who will essentially remain exposed to the mercy  of the fully armed Turkish troops and settlers."    "...the UN secretary general's report makes no reference to  the need to put an end to the invasion and occupation or that  the Turkish troops and settlers must withdraw. It also makes no  reference to the basic UN resolutions."    The Archbishop suggests that:     -  The political leadership  make united demands that the national issue return to its  basis--that is, the invasion, occupation, and violation of human  rights. We are all obliged to appeal to the United Nations,  without hesitation or disagreement, and insist firmly that the  basic UN resolutions be implemented.    -  We appeal to the powers  guaranteeing Cyprus' independence--Great Britain and Greece--and  demand that they fulfill their responsibilities and commitments  stemming from the treaty that guarantees Cyprus' independence.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations pertaining to the medical deduction, particularly in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area of reporting and verification requirements for allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical expenses. Under the 1989 interim rule, households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to monthly reporting are given the option of either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and verifying all medical expenses monthly, or of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and verifying changes in medical expenses in excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $25 occurring during the certification period, but they cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to report under both procedures. The 1989 interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i) and (ii), (i)(1), and (j)(3)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to specify the household's options with regard to reporting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifying medical expenses in a monthly reporting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrospective budgeting (MRRB) system. In addition, 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.12(a)(1)(vi) and 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3)(iii) were amended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 interim rule to simplify reporting changes in medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses. The 1989 interim rule required that changes in total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical expenses greater than $25 must be reported, as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a $25 change in each individual allowable medical expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following publication of the 1989 interim rule, the 1990 Leland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act was enacted. Regulations published to implement provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that Act superseded some of the changes made in the 1989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule. Section 1724 of the 1990 Leland Act delegated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each State agency the responsibility for design of the monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report form, including the determination of what information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to eligibility and benefits was to be included on that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form. These provisions of section 1724 were implemented by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes final rule, published on December 4, 1991 at 56 FR 63597.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming amendments to verification requirements associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the monthly report were also made at that time. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory amendments in the December 4, 1991 final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superseded the changes made to 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i), (ii), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii), and (i)(1) by the 1989 interim rule, because the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions concerned the information that the Department mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be contained on the monthly report form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments made to the regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(a)(vi) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.21(j)(iii) (C) and (D) by the 1989 interim rule were neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finalized nor superseded by subsequent regulations. As explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below, however, the Department is now making new amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1717 of the 1990 Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food Stamp Act to provide for a simplified means for eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households to claim the excess medical expense deduction for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recurring medical costs. Section 1717 requires State agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate at certification a recipient's recurring medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses for the certification period based upon the recipient's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current verified medical expenses, as well as available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about the recipient's medical condition, and public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or private medical insurance coverage. The household's medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction would be based on these estimates, and further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification would not be required. In a proposed rule entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Miscellaneous Provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hunger Relief Act and Food Stamp Certification Policy,'' published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29594), the Department stated that food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8) and 273.12(a)(6) already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected the intent of the statute and that, therefore, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change to the regulations was required. No comments disputing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this position were received, and the position was reiterated in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule published on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63594).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has come to the attention of the Department that some State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies may not be properly applying section 1717. This may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to confusion on the part of State agencies with regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's decision not to issue regulations in connection with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1717. To ensure that State agencies are in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 1717, the Department issued three memoranda to FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional offices, dated February 3, 1994, April 1, 1994, and May  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12, 1994. In the memoranda, the Department instructed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional offices to remind State agencies that they must be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the provisions of section 1717. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also offered direction as to how the State agencies can implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions of section 1717.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a further effort to insure that State agencies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the provisions of section 1717, the Department is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending food stamp regulations that concern the medical expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction. These changes will clarify current regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better express the intent of section 1717. Accordingly, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule amends 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i), 273.10(d)(4), 273.12(a)(vi),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.21 (h), (i), and (j)(iii) (C) and (D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the amendments, the household will be required to report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and verify all medical expenses at certification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recertification. The household's monthly medical deduction for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its certification period will be based on the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported and verified by the household, and any anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the household's medical expenses that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected to occur during the certification period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on available information about the recipient's medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified medical expenses. If the household reports a medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense at certification but cannot verify the expense at that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, and if the amount of the expense cannot be reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated based on available information about the recipient's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current verified medical expenses, the expense will be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time the amount of the expense or reimbursement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported and verified. The household will not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file reports about its medical expenses during the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical expenses, the State agency will act on the changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with current regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

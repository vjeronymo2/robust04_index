It is learned that  Wang Fengchao, director of the Second Department of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office [HKMAO], will be promoted to the  position of deputy director of the HKMAO, while Chen Zuoer,  director of the First Department, will be transferred from  Beijing to Hong Kong as a representative to the Sino-British  Joint Liaison Group [JLG]. Besides, the Chinese side is  carefully thinking over the retirement of Guo Fengmin, chief  representative of the Chinese side to the JLG, and is  considering choosing an appropriate official from the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs to take his place.    It is learned that when Sino-British relations went  downhill,  the HKMAO had an intense discussion among its officials on how  to keep pace with the new circumstances. In the end, the  hardliners gained the upper hand, followed by a series of  personnel changes. Wang Qiren, former deputy director of the  HKMAO, was earlier given an official promotion to the  chairmanship of the Bank of China Group's board of directors.  The vacancy he left behind will be filled by Wang Fengchao,  director of the Second Department of the HKMAO, who has been  responsible for Hong Kong's political and social affairs.    Wang Fengchao is about 50 years old. He studied in the  Chinese Department of Beijing University and worked with  LIAONING RIBAO as a journalist for some time. Later, he became  a fellow at an institute of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences and worked there for a period of time before moving on  to the HKMAO. In 1992 he headed a delegation to Hong Kong and  last year he attended the Sino-British talks on constitutional  reforms in Hong Kong in the capacity of the Chinese side's  adviser and expert.    Wang Fengchao's wife, Lei Yuping [7191 3254 1627], is one of  the persons in charge of All-China Journalists' Association.  They were classmates in the university and later got married.  Wang's father-in-law is General Lei Yingfu [7191 5391 1133], a  CPC celebrity. CPC leader Mao Zedong called Lei a "gifted  scholar" during the Yanan period and held him quite close.    Chen Zuoer, former director of the First Department of the  HKMAO responsible for Hong Kong's economic affairs who became  widely known among the people of Hong Kong because of the talks  on the new airport project, will be transferred from Beijing to  Hong Kong as a Chinese representative to the JLG, taking the  place of Luo Jiahuan who is currently holding this position.    The two vacancies Wang Fengchao and Chen Zuoer are to leave  behind will be filled by the two deputy directors of their  respective departments, namely, Xu Ze [1776 3419] and Zhang  Lianglian [1728 5328 2808]. Chen Guangming [7115 1639 2494],  another deputy director of the Second Department, will be  transferred to Guangdong.    On the other front, the central authorities in Beijing are  considering the retirement of 63-year-old Guo Fengmin, chief  Chinese representative to the JLG. He will be succeeded by an  appropriate person handpicked by the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. It is learned that Zhao Jihua, director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, is among the  candidates being considered.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Legal &amp; General Having underperformed the Prudential by 25 per cent over the last two years, Legal &amp; General is the Cinderella of the life assurance sector. Mortgage indemnity losses are partly to blame. But L&amp;G is still losing money in general insurance and estate agency while the Pru is free to concentrate on what both companies do best: managing long-term savings. Yet the tide may be turning in L&amp;G's favour. Increased provisions against mortgage indemnity look conservative, although the same was said last year. By reinsuring its household account, L&amp;G has capped exposure to future storms and floods. If estate agency improves from here on, the market may finally focus on the value of the life assurance side. With its shares trading below the value attributable to shareholders in the life fund, L&amp;G stands out from the crowd. Underperformance may continue, though, until L&amp;G has convinced it can compete successfully for new life and pensions business. The decline in mortgage-related sales might explain away the recent poor new business performance and a triple-A credit rating coupled with a respectable investment performance should, in theory, leave it well placed to sell more policies. But the market will demand hard evidence that marketing and distribution are up to scratch before the shares trade at much of a premium to the value of the life fund.</p>

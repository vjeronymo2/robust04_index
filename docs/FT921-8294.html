			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Observer: Carrying the can Graeme Gilchrist's sudden exit from Union Discount means that two high-profile City jobs will have to be filled pretty sharply. As chairman of the London Discount Market Association, Gilchrist was the man responsible for telling the Governor of the Bank of England what he couldn't find out about the market from his Reuters monitor. This weekly task will now fall to his deputy, Robin Moser, managing director of Alexanders, the oldest discount house. Finding a replacement for Gilchrist should not be too difficult. Admittedly, there has been a fairly heavy turnover of Union's executive directors of late but Derek Lyons, managing director of the traditional discount house business, would be the obvious internal candidate, and very capable too. 'We have shut the stable door very firmly, though obviously to some extent the horse has bolted,' says Robin Herbert, Union's old Etonian chairman. Having recently taken over from Alec Ritchie, another well-connected merchant banker who headed Union for 20 years, no blame can be laid at Herbert's door. But given the wealth of non-executive City talent on Union's board, it seems a trifle unfair to lay all the blame for Union's strategic errors on poor old Graeme Gilchrist.</p>

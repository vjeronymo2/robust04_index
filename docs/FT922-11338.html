			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Partners accused over Polly Peck TWO PARTNERS at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, face the possibility of disciplinary action for an alleged breach of professional ethical guidelines connected to their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International. Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers, and Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of Cork Gully, the firm's insolvency arm, are to appear before the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales late next month. They will deny charges that they breached the institute's ethical guidelines by accepting the appointment in October 1990 when there had been 'a continuing professional relationship' between Coopers, Polly Peck and its chairman Mr Asil Nadir during the previous three years. The work included a series of feasibility studies for Polly Peck during the 1980s and personal tax advice to Mr Nadir. Coopers' defence is likely to centre on whether the work it conducted constituted a continuing professional relationship rather than a series of one-off assignments. The disciplinary hearing comes in spite of the ratification of the appointment of the two partners by Mr Justice Millett in February. The firm refused to comment yesterday on the allegations.</p>

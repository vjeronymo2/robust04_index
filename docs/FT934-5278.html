			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): A struggle for power THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN EUROPE: COMPETITION AND REGULATION IN THE EC ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY By Francis McGowan Royal Institute of International Affairs, Pounds 12.50 104 pages Francis McGowan does not tell us whether he was alluding to AJP Taylor's Struggle for Mastery in Europe in choosing the title for his book on electricity competition. Either way, the comparison is more apt than it may appear. Both Taylor, whose book concentrated on European diplomacy in the 19th century, and McGowan had to get to grips with complex issues. And both deal with subjects of political import. As McGowan points out it was Lenin who pointed to the power of electricity when he said communism equals Soviets plus electricity. But throughout the world virtually all political systems have considered electricity to be a strategic industry safest in monopolisitic, often state, hands. The political power of electrical power explains the intense struggle the EC is facing to liberalise the industry and free it up to competition, with strong opposition coming both from the European parliament and the utilities. The liberalisation attempts form the focus for McGowan's study which manages to combine comprehensiveness with accessibility. Unlike many writers, McGowan, a university lecturer, has no political axe to grind. His book provides useful reading for the growing numbers of industrialists who will need to understand the proposed changes. The need arises because the EC's proposals would radically change the way the industry operates and reshape its relations with both consumers and suppliers. The main elements of its reform plan include increasing transparency of utilities accounts, achieving greater access for non-utility power producers to grid systems. Third Party Access, another plank of reform, would give greater scope for large energy users and distribution companies to deal directly with competing power producers. The effects would be to end privileged relationships between national utilities and local suppliers of fuel and equipment, and change pricing structures for consumers. Some charges may fall as competition bites but others, for example those affecting rural communities, could rise as cross-subsidies would be threatened. The trends towards privatisation and diversification among utilities would be strengthened and utilities would have to reconsider broader commitments to social policy such as maintaining job levels. There is also a risk of service deterioration. With so much at stake it is not surprising that the utilities are fighting, often with the backing of their governments, to limit the effects of the change. The book charts the influence on the debate of the UK, which through privatisation has shown how electricity systems can be ordered differently but does not necessarily provide a model for Community-wide reform, and of France, widely viewed as the country where monopolistic tendencies are most acute. McGowan points to the likely compromise solutions between the commission and opponents of reform. Under one scenario, the commission would water down its TPA directive by maintaining the principle of a more competitive system but leave it to individual users to to request access to systems. In any event the European electricity industry is moving from its strong monopolistic bias towards greater competition. The EC's willingness and ability to exercise its will should none the less determine the speed and depth of change.</p>

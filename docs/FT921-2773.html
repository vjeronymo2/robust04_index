			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: A point about the HIV virus Sir, Dominic Lawson underestimates the incidence of the HIV virus ('Sex and the single company', March 14). 0.04 per cent is 1 in 2,500 (not 1 in 4,000) and 0.016 per cent is 1 in 6,250 (not 1 in 16,000). By Mr Lawson's maths the more precision in the percentage the less the likelihood. A few more decimal places would make the HlV virus a mere curiosity.

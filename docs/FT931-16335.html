			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GT Management sets up open investment company GT MANAGEMENT, the fund management group, is launching an open-ended investment company to invest in the debt of emerging markets. It initially hopes to raise between Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m) and Dollars 40m. The GT Emerging Markets Bond Fund will be authorised in Dublin and is aimed at institutional investors in the UK and continental Europe. The launch period will last from January 11 to January 22, with a minimum subscription of Dollars 400,000. Mr Robert Stirling, GT's senior global fixed income fund manager, said the fund would aim to capitalise on small emerging markets as they removed barriers to global trade. It plans to have a 40 per cent weighting in Latin America, with holdings of 8 per cent in Asia, 24.5 per cent in Europe and 27.5 per cent in the Middle East and Africa. Mr Stirling said the risk was higher than for other government bonds, but that factors working in favour of emerging markets, such as anti-inflationary policies and attacks on fiscal deficits, were favourable for fixed-interest investors.</p>

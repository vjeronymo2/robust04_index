			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec put his signature on materials concerning the Czech  Republic's membership in the Partnership for Peace project, he  said at a press conference today.    The materials will be submitted to the government, which is  to discuss them on Wednesday [9 February], Zieleniec said.    According to the Czech Constitution, parliamentary approval  is not necessary for the Czech Republic to join the Partnership  for Peace, Zieleniec said. After the government gives its  approval, either Premier Vaclav Klaus or Zieleniec himself will  sign the general declaration on joining the project.    The Partnership for Peace programme, which was approved by  NATO member countries on January 10, 1994 in Brussels, envisages  military cooperation with the countries of Eastern and Central  Europe and their eventual admission to the Alliance.    Zieleniec said that after signing the document he would  oversee the Czech Republic's special proposal for specific  cooperation with the Alliance and that NATO would also draw up  similar materials concerning this cooperation. These two  documents will then form the basis of the agreement between the  Czech Republic and NATO on the Partnership for Peace.    While under the Partnership for Peace, Czech soldiers could  eventually be sent abroad, Zieleniec said that the Czech  Constitution requires parliamentary approval of sending armed  forces outside of Czech territory. Therefore, "some adjustments  will be necessary" to the regulations, he said.</p>

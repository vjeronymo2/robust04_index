			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Savoy reveals push by Forte for control The board of the Savoy yesterday brought into the open an attempt by Forte to gain control of the hotel group without having to buy more shares. The Savoy board said it had 'become aware of discussions between Forte and certain of the trusts which have a significant interest in the share capital of the Savoy. These discussions could extend the level of co-operation between Forte and these trusts in relation to the management of the Savoy.' Although neither side would elaborate, the trusts concerned are widely thought to be those of the Wontner family, represented by Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director. If Forte can persuade Mr Sinclair to become its ally, it will have gained effective control of the Savoy. Following an acrimonious takeover battle in the 1980s, Forte acquired 68 per cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of its votes. Support from Mr Sinclair would give Forte a clear majority of the votes. Backing for Forte from the Wontner family trusts would not be without its ironies. Sir Hugh Wontner, the former president of the Savoy group who died in 1992, fiercely opposed a Forte takeover. Sir Anthony Tuke is likely to remain Savoy chairman for the time being. Savoy and Forte have been unable to agree on a successor. The latest candidate, Sir Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, is thought unlikely to be approved. A successful outcome at Savoy would be welcome news for Forte, which earlier this year was beaten by ITT Sheraton of the US in its attempt to take over Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel chain. Forte's bid to win control of Meridien, the French chain which is 57 per cent owned by Air France, looks uncertain. Accor, the French hotel group, has argued that it should win Meridien, despite submitting a lower bid than Forte. Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique acting for Air France, has asked Forte to examine new information. City analysts believe the exercise may result in Air France finding a justification to sell the chain to a French buyer. Lex, Page 18</p>

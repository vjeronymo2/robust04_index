			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Training guidelines attacked DRAFT government guidelines for training policy next year show that Training and Enterprise Councils and Local Enterprise Councils, their Scottish counterparts, are expected to lead local initiatives on training targets and to extract more private-sector funds to support training, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. A scathing response from the Merseyside Tec says the government has ignored its own leadership role and that Tecs need more public funding. They are willing to be partners but cannot lead effectively when many of their objectives concern areas outside their influence. The draft of the guidelines - to be published late this year - and the Merseyside response reveal sharp divergences on objectives, how to achieve them, and the roles of the Tecs. A member of another Tec board said: 'The Merseyside commentary articulates what very many of us are feeling. I am sure many other Tecs are preparing similar responses.' The government wants all employees to be undergoing training or development by 1996, when it says half the national workforce should be aiming for basic national vocational qualifications or 'learning units' towards them. By the following year, 80 per cent of young people should have basic NVQs. Merseyside's response states: 'Quality foundation learning for young people is the responsibility of us all and should be resourced by the nation through the public purse. It should not be dependent upon the willingness and capacity of employers to support education initiatives and youth training.' It adds that current funding levels, especially in youth training, will not enable the government's aims to be met.</p>

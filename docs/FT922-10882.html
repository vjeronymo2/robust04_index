			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: L'elisir d'amore - Opera in London We owe this latest Donizetti revival to Luciano Pavarotti. He was due to return to Covent Garden in La Boheme, which opera he then exchanged for L'elisir before withdrawing altogether, leaving the work scheduled and no tenor to lead it. Then the house's luck began to improve. Alfredo Kraus was persuaded to take Pavarotti's place as Nemorino, and Sumi Jo to join him as Adina. The pairing, as shown on Monday, works winningly. Indeed, the display of finespun singing offered by both provides a delectable treat for lovers of the genre. It is not exactly a warm-blooded performance. Mr Kraus, an exceptionally well-preserved sexagenarian of elegant carriage and patrician profile, is hard to accept as a lovelorn peasant youth, graciously though he lends himself to the capers of the Covent Garden staging. Miss Jo, a Korean, seems to have been schooled down to the last eyelash-quiver, skirt-flounce and pout in the Italian tradition of Adina-as-saucy-baggage. Given that this production is already an indigestible feast of multicolour cuteness, the shortage of 'heart' limits the composer's tenderly compassionate view of human affections. But the singing is very fine, and in Donizetti that counts for a good deal. Miss Jo's pearly soprano, not large but perfectly projected and meltingly sweet at every point in its compass, seems made for the lighter and semiseria roles in the 19th-century bel canto repertory. She knows how to float delightful, colourful sounds, how to thread notes and words into phrases, how to caress a whole sequence; she is not just unfailingly lovely to listen to, but a performer of musicianly charm - the demeanour may be pert but the voice constantly arrives at a more genuine strain of artistry. Mr Kraus no longer commands ripely resonant tenor tones, but those he has are deployed with miraculous ease. Apart from the occasional unwritten - and rather fierce - high-note climax, his is an art of suggestive understatement, which reaches its peak in a 'Furtiva lagrima' offered as a reverie, not a crowd-pleaser. One devoutly hopes his Nemorino will be viewed as a sort of masterclass vivant by the Belcore of the evening, Anthony Michaels-Moore. The most promising and normally the most stylish of the younger British baritones, he allows himself to ham up the comedy and blare out the notes with worrying crudity. Dulcamara, whose presentation as an oriental potentate is one of the show's many dislikable features, is taken by another veteran, Paolo Montarsolo - amusingly at moments but superficially, and with very little 'real' tone at his disposal. Richard Buckley, an experienced American conductor making his house debut, keeps the show moving with considerable skill. A handful of expressive nudgings and underlinings are a small price to pay for the general feeling of 'go' in the air. Covent Garden Box Office: 071-240-1066 (in repertory until May 9)</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "A Drowning Man Clutches At </F> Straws"]    [Text] While angry and argumentative, the RSPP [Russian  Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] leaders, Messrs.  Bolskiy and Vladislavlev, are able to ascertain "who is the most  valuable from a historical standpoint." Meanwhile the leader of  the association of goods manufacturers, Yuriy Skokov, expresses  his presidential aspirations, while the producers themselves  presented the president and the government with a package of 10  proposals, after which the financial crisis, in their opinion,  vanished as if by magic. As expected, they are raising as a  matter of priority concern for politically oriented people, the  development of an economic program and a strategy for structural  reorganization that is "coordinated with the goods  manufacturers." The allergy to all types of programs, declared  earlier by them on more than one occasion, it turns out is  rooted in the absence of a visa for the goods manufacturers for  developed programs. With the removal of this ommision and  "having assigned priorities and outlined effective methods for  supporting them," the country can look boldly into the future.    Their advice is to slash the producers' nonpayments in a  manner such that the government returns the debts to the rural  areas -- whether or not the products were ordered by the state  or they constitute a line in the budget is of little importance:  the chief concern is whether or not the guns and butter are in  the homeland's storage facilities, in accordance with the  producer prices. The producers supplement the return of debts  with a proposal to free the enterprises from bank credit  interest rates, that is: in early 1993, the director seized 300  million rubles and, taking inflation into account, can pay out  40 million rubles. But this is not a limit for the "traders":  they insist that they be granted two years of interest-free  credit for augmenting their working capital. Meanwhile, no  provision is made for such "ceilings" and if one recalls that  commencing 1 January the balance value of the fixed capital of  enterprises was increased on average by a factor of 25, then it  becomes clear that such credit will prove to be very costly for  the state.    The subject of taxes, which suppress production, and the  instincts of entrepreneurship are found throughout the document  of the goods manufacturers. A reduction in the total amount of  tax to 35 percent is being proposed. Although wise in principle,  this measure is long overdue. According to data supplied by  Minfin [Ministry of Finance], in 1993 the proportion of taxes  amounted to 23.4 percent of the VVP [gross domestic product], a  reduction of 2.7 percent compared to 1992. With regard to the  almost mandatory requirement of the producers, to release from  taxation in 1994, with no restrictions or reservations, all  resources actually intended for investment in production, it is  appropriate to cite here an evaluation provided by the chairman  of Goskomnalog [State Committee for Taxes]. Vladimir Gusev  stated that enterprises make only weak use of the benefits  allowed by law for taxing the profits used for production  development, preferring to increase wages or to spend for social  assistance. And the directors themselves, according to Minister  of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan, are "taking advantage of the legal  chaos and rapidly increasing their own wages."    It would seem that monthly earnings ranging from 2 to 7  million rubles can furnish some comfort to a plant  administration that is oppressed by reforms. But no, today their  state of well-being is low. They think about the future,  proposing to raise export duties such that energy carriers  generally will not be exported. A similar thought prevails with  regard to import rates -- to protect themselves from foreign  competitors, although a flowery proposal is being developed: on  the one hand, the duties must ensure a "sensible priority for  domestic goods manufacturers and, on the other, they must  destroy monopolism in the internal market."    The proposal "to introduce temporary state price regulation  for primary energy resources, after first ensuring financial  support for the extractive enterprises of initial processing,"  contains much that is interesting although high-sounding. That  is, in all branches with the exception of TEK [fuel and energy  complex], the prices are free and for TEK -- temporary  subsidies, with the time period to be established later by the  producers. It appears that they refer to these as "reforms --  for the people and not at their expense." In their present form,  according to Yuriy Borodin, the general director of "Mashpribor"  AO [joint stock company], the reforms pose a threat to the very  existence of the nation and state." Hence the tenth point of the  Proposal by the goods manufacturers is quite logical "to restore  the thoughtlessly destroyed economic contacts with the republics  which comprised the Soviet Union."    It is doubtful if the manifest of economic outsiders was  adopted by the government as a guide to action. But it is  interesting as an indicator of the frame of mind of a  considerable portion of our domestic directorate.</p>

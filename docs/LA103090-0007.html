			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL RESOLUTION;  </P> <P> LIABILITY CLAIM  </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council has reaffirmed one of the basic and vital principles  of international law: There must be no profit from aggression. Iraq has been  reminded that it is liable "for any loss, damage or injury" stemming from its  invasion and systematic plundering of Kuwait and from its mistreatment of  Kuwaitis and third-country nationals.  </P> <P> In calling specific attention to Baghdad's responsibility for war damages and  human rights abuses in Kuwait, and in inviting states to begin collecting  information on relevant claims, the council has paved the way for future  actions that could well cost Iraq billions of dollars in damages.  </P> <P> The council resolution, sponsored among others by the United States and the  Soviet Union, doesn't specify how Iraq would pay to settle claims against it.  British officials suggest that compensation could come from Iraq's foreign  assets, most of which have been frozen as a result of its aggression. Working  through the courts, unsatisfied claimants might also seek to attach other Iraqi  property -- its future oil shipments, for example.  </P> <P> The lengthy resolution, the 10th directed against Iraq since its invasion of  Kuwait on Aug. 2, also calls for collecting information on Iraq's human rights  abuses in Kuwait, a possible first step toward future war-crimes claims.  Pillage, massacre and rape committed by a conquering power are as old as  warfare itself. Only in this century have international conventions been  enacted forbidding such outrages. Iraq has signed those agreements. The council  has now laudably set the stage for calling it to account.  </P></p>

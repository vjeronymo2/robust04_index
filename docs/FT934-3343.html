			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Good Natur'd Man' - Theatre The Orange Tree in Richmond is the pleasantest of London's admirable array of small theatres. Whereas the Gate and the Bush tend to specialise in passionate intensity, the Orange Tree has a lighter touch. And so it is with The Good Natur'd Man which makes a natural complement to the same author's She Stoops to Conquer, still running in the West End. Oliver Goldsmith wrote The Good Natur'd Man around 1767, about five years before She Stoops. The former is not nearly as funny nor as mature as the latter, but it is still, in parts, a very elegant piece of writing and what the two pieces have in common is an abundance of good nature. This is not incompatible with satire: it simply illustrates the point that you do not have to shout in order to be heard. The Good Natur'd Man should really be called The Good Natur'd Woman. For the male hero, aptly named Honeywood, carries good nature to the point of naivete and beyond. There is a splendid female by the name of Miss Richland who bails him out. Played here by Claire Rushbrook, Miss Richland has all the desirable attributes: looks, sense, money and good nature to boot. It is not the largest part in the play, but it is the key. Ms Rushbrook (a name that might have been invented by Goldsmith) never shows off, not even stooping to effortless superiority. She just stands there, holds the ground, and is superb. The plot is hard to follow, even when you have done your homework. A subplot about a potential elopement to Scotland is unnecessary except to give the play a decent length. A man called Croaker seems impossible in the written script, but in practice, given a sprightly performance by Will Knightley, he is a distinctly recognisable figure who simply changes his mind with each new piece of hearsay. Some of the dialogue is delightful. Croaker had a friend named Dick Doleful who 'before he made away with himself used to say 'Croaker rhymes with joker', so we used to laugh'. Mrs Croaker, by contrast, is a woman described as 'all laughs and no jokes'. Clearly there are tensions beneath the surface. There is also some tenderness, as when the good natur'd man and Miss Richland talk about how they first met at the French Ambassador's. Honeywood asked the plainest woman in the room to dance because he felt sorry for her: Miss Richland noticed and danced with him the next night. Some social comment, too: catch a passing reference to a man called Lord Neverout, who might be still with us today. Anthony Cornish who produced the piece in New York last year, directs. Here, it is an example of the fringe playing to near perfection. Orange Tree, Richmond until January 29. (081) 940 3633</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Capital bond remains open Scottish Amicable's Capital Guarantee Bond remains open until December 14. This represents a step forward for guaranteed products, since it offers income reinvestment, rather than simple growth. Investors are guaranteed, over five years, either the growth in the FT-SE 100 Index (including dividend income) or their money back over five years. However, the indexation applies to the bid value of the units and there is a bid-offer spread of 5 per cent. The allocation rate is 96 per cent, although this can be enhanced to up to 98 per cent by investing greater sums. As a consequence, the amount of your sum which is indexed could be as low as 91 per cent.</p>

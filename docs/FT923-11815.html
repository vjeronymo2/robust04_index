			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Australian Industry Commission urges end to post monopoly AUSTRALIA'S government-run postal monopoly should be exposed to competition from private sector express freight carriers, the Industry Commission said yesterday. The commission, which advises the federal Labor government, has been the driving force behind much of the liberalisation of the Australian economy which has taken place since 1983. Its attack on the Australia Post monopoly will be welcomed by freight carriers such as TNT, which has extensive experience of express delivery in the UK and elsewhere. However, the report is likely to provoke widespread opposition from trade unions and consumer groups. Mr Neil O'Keefe, who is chairman of the Labor party's parliamentary communications committee, said that it should be dismissed 'out of hand'. The commission said that the Australia Post monopoly on letters weighing less than 500g should be replaced by a maximum price set by the federal government. This would allow the country's private sector competitors to enter the market, while maintaining a reasonably priced service for customers in remote areas of rural Australia. It said loss-making services should be directly funded by the government. 'The monopoly is stifling the development of innovative, low-cost ways for business and individuals to communicate,' the commission said. The draft report is intended to provide a basis for public hearings on the postal monopoly in September. The commission is expected to present its final recommendations to the government in October.</p>

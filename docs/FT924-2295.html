			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The European Market: German investors tax the Bundesbank ACCORDING to cliche, Germans stick to the rules. When it comes to tax affairs, however, they are compulsive rule-breakers. Only a desire to get round the law can explain the massive flow of German funds into Luxembourg and other tax havens before next month's introduction of a 30 per cent tax on interest income. There is nothing illegal about shifting funds to Luxembourg - so long as the income on those investments is subsequently declared to the tax authorities. But it seems many Germans have no intention of declaring this income. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, made this clear in a speech last month, when he condemned the outflows as a form of 'money-laundering'. He said the amount of money likely to leave Germany by the end of the year would exceed the sum which departed in 1988-89. Then, Germany's financial markets and the D-Mark were disturbed by a cash exodus before the introduction of a 10 per cent withholding tax on interest income. In the first nine months of this year, Germans invested DM31bn in Luxembourg funds managed by German banks, and only DM4bn in domestic funds. Dresdner Bank's investment subsidiary recently reported that funds under management in Luxembourg have trebled to DM14bn since the beginning of the year. At Deutsche Bank, Luxembourg funds have nearly doubled to DM27bn. These figures understate the overall outflows. They do not include money deposited with non-German institutions in Luxembourg - or cash transferred across other frontiers, to Switzerland or Austria, for example. Frankfurt economists estimate that the total outflow for the year could be about DM100bn, compared with DM72bn which left the country in 1989. The flow of money worries the Bundesbank. It has contributed to extra demand for banknotes, as Germans have cashed in their investments and driven across the border to Luxembourg to buy securities there. 'It is entirely normal for someone to walk into our branch here with DM50,000 or DM300,000 in cash,' says the head of the Luxembourg subsidiary of one German bank. The increase in cash in circulation has been one factor behind the sharp growth in money supply, now growing at an annualised rate of more than 10 per cent. The transfers are also of concern for the German government, keen to increase its tax revenues so as to reduce its budget deficit. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has aimed a number of verbal fusillades at the banks, accusing them of publishing misleading advertising for their Luxembourg operations. The new tax is designed to avoid the problems associated with the original 10 per cent withholding tax introduced at the beginning of 1989. This tax drove foreign investors away from the German markets and was abolished a few months after it was introduced because of the damage it was doing to Germany's status as a financial centre. The German constitutional court in Karlsruhe subsequently ruled that a replacement tax would have to be implemented. This time, foreign investors are excluded, and most domestic taxpayers will not have to pay any tax either. Individuals earning interest of DM6,000 or less, and married couples earning DM12,000 or less, will be excluded from the tax. It is thought that only the wealthiest 20 per cent of the population will be affected. Assuming interest rates of 6 per cent, a married couple must have savings of over DM200,000 before they become liable for any tax. Many people however seem to be moving their funds although their income is below the tax threshold. One factor may be the banks' advertising which - as Mr Waigel has complained - tends to give the impression that everyone would be better off investing in Luxembourg. Another reason is that people are seeking to avoid tax on income which should have been declared years ago. The new tax is deducted at source. For investors to receive a rebate if their income falls below the threshold, they must first declare it to the tax authorities. 'If you have hidden your capital for the last five years, you have to continue to hide it,' says one Luxembourg banker. 'If you suddenly put it in your income tax declaration, the tax officer will obviously ask where it came from. You will end up being taxed retroactively.' 'It is fair to say that taxes have never been paid on the funds which are flowing now,' says Mr Pierre Jaans, director general of the Luxemburg Monetary Institute, the Grand Duchy's equivalent to a central bank. Mr Jaans says Luxembourg would be willing to participate in a pan-European harmonisation of tax systems, which could help prevent such large capital transfers in future. Since the chances of this happening are fairly remote, the D-Marks will presumably carry on taking the road to Luxembourg.</p>

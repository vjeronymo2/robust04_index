			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN OF FETAL TISSUE EXPERIMENTATION NOT POSSIBLE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  </P> <P> Schrage's cold and merciless article on the use of aborted babies' bodies for  medical research makes the new breed of horror movies look like a little girl's  tea party.  </P> <P> The final irony was the phrase "the gift of life" in a quote by Dr. Willard  Gaylin. I don't think it is a fitting remark for such circumstances.  </P> <P> Schrage remarks that, for the record, he is pro-choice. He need not have told  us.  </P> <P> MARION FORD  </P> <P> GLENDALE  </P></p>

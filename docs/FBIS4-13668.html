			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Rabin this morning held  consultations on what is thought to be the final stage of the  peace talks. Israeli and PLO leaders have said the talks may be  completed next week, though this was not certain. If they are,  the agreement could be signed in Cairo by Rabin and Yasir  'Arafat in the first week of May. Jack Katzenell reports:    [Begin Katzenell recording] Taking part at this morning's  meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv were Prime Minister  Rabin, Justice Minister David Liba'i, Environment Minister Yosi  Sarid, and the Israeli negotiators at the Cairo talks, headed by  Major General Amnon Shahaq. It emerged that the civilian issues  being negotiated with the PLO were almost completely settled.  These have to do with the transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho  from the Israeli civilian administration to the Palestinian  authority and many other matters. But certain issues have not  yet been settled -- for example, the number of Palestinian  prisoners to be released. The criteria for their release were  discussed at this morning's meeting. They will not include  those who have murdered Israelis, and Israel insists that they  should not include people who committed terrorist acts after 13  September, when the Oslo agreement was signed. The most  difficult issue not yet settled is that of jurisdiction.    Minister Yosi Sarid said after this morning's meeting that  no  Israeli will be tried in a Palestinian court. If an Israeli is  accused of committing an offense in Gaza or Jericho, he will be  tried in Israel, Sarid said. If this or any other issue is not  settled by next week, the Israeli and PLO liaison committee will  meet in Cairo under the joint chairmanship of Foreign Minister  Peres and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas].

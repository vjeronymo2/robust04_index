			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has  criticized the statement released by the 'Arafat leadership in  reaction to the heroic commando attack at the Erez checkpoint in  the northern Gaza Strip. The Islamic Jihad Movement's statement  called 'Arafat's reaction another example of capitulation to the  Zionist will and dictates. The statement regretted that the new  authority should have reacted the way it did against an  operation carried out by the Jihad Movement, when it cannot bar  armed settlers from the self-rule areas. We reject this skewed  logic, as do our people, who yesterday were jubilant over the  heroic operation.    Our jihad will continue and we will keep our weapons as long  as the occupation remains, the Jihad Movement's statement  emphasized.    Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has  issued  a statement to mark the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. As  we celebrate the 'Id, advocates of negotiation and lovers of  normalization with the Zionist entity try to convince us that  the 27,000 sq. km that is Palestine has now shrunk to 400 sq.  km, where they plan to set up an authority to provide for the  security of the Zionist settlers and guard the interests of the  shabby leadership.    The Hamas statement called for remembering the martyrs,  detainees, and wounded, who put their lives on the line for the  sake of the homeland. The statement also appealed for help to  be extended to the poor among our people, whose ranks have been  swollen by the Zionist closure of the occupied territories.</p>

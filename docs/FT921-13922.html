			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: New Morgan Grenfell fund Morgan Grenfell is launching the Japan 'Bullet' fund, a Dublin-based offshore unit trust. The fund's investment policy will mirror that of the group's existing Japanese smaller companies fund, which is top of the combined onshore and offshore Japanese sector over the five years to January 5. The fund will have a single price, which in practice means that the 5.74 per cent initial charge will be shown separately - thus the investor subscribing for the minimum of Pounds 1,000 will receive around Pounds 940 of units. There will be a fixed offer price of 100p from February 3-7; those who apply through an independent financial adviser will get a discount of 1 per cent. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent.</p>

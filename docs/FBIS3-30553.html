			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina's embassy  in Vienna charged Sunday [6 February] that the UN Security  Council was responsible "de facto" for the latest bloody attacks  in Sarajevo by failing to carry out air strikes on the Serb  besiegers. "The Security Council is empowered to prevent  attacks on safe havens (in Bosnia-Herzegovina), which can be  done by taking any action necessary, including air strikes," the  embassy said in a statement published Sunday after a mortar  attack on a Sarajevo market Saturday killed 66 and wounded 200.    The Bosnian capital is one of six UN-designated "safe  havens"  in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic.    "The international community has also pledged to prevent any  further strangulation of the city of Sarajevo," the statement  added. "It stands to reason that by not using its full powers  and commitments, the Security Council in fact supports the  aggressor and encourages his crimes."    Differing with the UN, the embassy went on to say that an  attack on a food line in the suburb of Dobrinja on Friday killed  12 people and wounded 40. Latest figures from the UN Protection  Force in Sarajevo put the number of deaths at 10. It added that  the mortar shells which exploded at Dobrinja "were fired in a  precise way at the line of people waiting for humanitarian aid."    The statement confirmed that 66 people were killed when a  shell hit the Markale marketplace in Sarajevo on Saturday.</p>

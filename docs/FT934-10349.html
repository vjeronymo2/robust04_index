			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philips returns to the black as tax bill falls PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, swung into a net profit of Fl 133m (Dollars 70m) in the third quarter from a net loss of Fl 139m the previous year, helped in part by a significant drop in tax bills and financial expenditure. The company continues to suffer from slack markets in Europe, where it generates just over half of its annual sales. A better performance in other markets such as North America helped to offset weak conditions closer to home. Despite difficulties in Europe, third-quarter operating profit rose to Fl 560m from Fl 345m a year earlier. However, Philips also benefited from a sharp drop in financing charges to Fl 296m from Fl 475m. The decline is due to Philips' continued progress in reducing its heavy debt burden as well as to the decline in worldwide interest rates. Losses in consumer electronics narrowed, while higher results were achieved by the components and semi-conductor division. However, professional products suffered a setback caused by reduced investments by Germany's telecommunication authority. Group sales totalled Fl 14.13bn, up 4 per cent from the 1992 third quarter, but sales for the first nine months were steady at Fl 41.4bn. The company continues to face strong downward pressure on selling prices, particularly in lighting and consumer electronics, two businesses which account for nearly half of total sales. Net profit for the first three quarters soared to Fl 1.45bn from Fl 102m, reflecting an extraordinary gain of Fl 1.1bn booked in the second quarter on the sale of Philips' stake in a semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita of Japan. Mr Dudley Eustace, finance director, said Philips had realised Fl 400m in extraordinary gains from the recent share issue by PolyGram, the group's London-based music company. The gain has been set aside to pay for divesting unprofitable businesses in Europe as part of Philips' 'portfolio choice' programme. 'Under the current recessionary circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sell off businesses and get even book value in exchange,' he said. Philips stands to receive 'several hundred million guilders' in January under a lease-back transaction with Rabobank, the co-operative bank.</p>

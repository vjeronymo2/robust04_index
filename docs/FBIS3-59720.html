During the decomposition of  waste, no carbon dioxide nor water is exhausted and the waste  itself is decomposed into micron units which makes it appear as  if the waste had disappeared. This type of waste treatment  machine is the first in the world. The Company is applying for a  patent on this waste decomposition method.    The decomposition of waste is performed by mixing the waste  with decomposition cultivator that looks like wood chips and the  moisture from the raw waste causes a chemical reaction leading  to decomposition into tiny particles. A large size decomposition  machine that would treat 20 kgms of raw waste would be 1 m 20 cm  wide, 1 m 8 cm high and 1 m 10 cm deep and completely made from  stainless steel. Compared to the existing waste treatment  machine, no water or organic solid residues remain and the  decomposed particles soak into the decomposition cultivator  making it appear to the eye as if the waste had disappeared.  Past experiments have shown that egg shells have decomposed in a  week. ``It is most appropriate for a crammed ship that will be  sailing for over a month'', was quoted (The Co.). The desired  retail cost is 44 million. A smaller machine that would treat  one kgm would cost 499 thousand.</p>

Kiraly, parliamentary deputy and </F> chairman of the Hungarian Interest Party, by Laszlo Danyi; place  and date not given: "The Hungarian Democratic Forum Is A Big  Wooden Trojan Horse"]    [Text] Parliamentary Deputy Izabella B. Kiraly is the  chairwoman of the Hungarian Interest Party [MEP], founded on 7  September 1993. Her young party -- which characterizes itself  as a national, conservative, Christian, democratic, and  pragmatic party -- differs from Istvan Csurka's Hungarian  Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only through the one letter in  their acronym but also because, unlike the MIEP, the MEP does  not think in terms of restoring St. Stephen's Hungary, but it  regards the beginning of a Hungarian presence of a much older  time. The MEP does not relate to the Jews' identity problems,  and it supports the just efforts of the international Gypsy king  to create, like the Jews, their own homeland, Romanistan, in the  Danube Delta.    [Danyi] When did you leave the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF]?    [Kiraly] I do not remember exactly.    [Danyi] When did you first feel that that was the end  regarding the MDF?    [Kiraly] I already suspected for a considerable time that  the MDF was a big wooden Trojan horse, in other words, it no  longer spoke about the things that it used to at the beginning,  and it was not carrying out its promises. The great protest of  the government forces came in the wake of the Trianon Meeting  held on 4 June 1993 and my parliamentary speech on the  Hungarian-Ukrainian basic treaty, in which I urged a peaceful  reunification of the Carpathian Basin. Then I fell victim to  ethnic cleansing. I also know that these events can be traced  back to the demonstration held in Kossuth Square on 23 October  1992, in which President Arpad Goncz was not allowed to deliver  his speech, a demonstration at which I was not present because I  was delivering a speech at Corvinter.    [Danyi] How did you get into contact with the young people  called fascists in the "Evening Balance" program on Hungarian  Television?    [Kiraly] These youngsters came to me around 26 October 1992  to protest against this label.    [Danyi] You are slowly turning into the Hungarian skinheads'  defending matron? Do you accept this role with pride?    [Kiraly] The situation is not as complex as it looks. This  labelling is aimed at discrediting us politically. When the  civilized West was burning witches, our King Kalman Konyves said  the following: "There are no witches!" Now I say the same:  There are no skinheads.    [Danyi] But there are skinheads.    [Kiraly] There were women in Kalman Konyves's time who  claimed to be witches. Do you understand? They could not be  witches; at most, they were healing soothsayers. In my opinion,  there are unsolved problems. For example, the degenerate  actions in Rostock drew my attention to the fact that, for  years, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] had failed  to recognize that its liberal immigration policy had not been  serving the interests of the German people. They actually  provoked the youngsters' brutal acts. I generally regard the  skinheads' movement as some kind of self- justice to  counterbalance an administration of justice that does not work  adequately. The approach that there can only government justice  and right is unacceptable.    [Danyi] In your opinion, how many skinheads are there in  Hungary today?    [Kiraly] Look, we can speak about such a movement, but we  should also examine whom we can call skinheads. If a shaven  head is the basic criterion, then Matyas Rakosi, Gyorgy Gado,  and Janos Kis can also be listed as skinheads. One should not  start from the outside appearance, because there are youngsters  who have bald heads and leather jackets with boots merely  because of fashion. Instead, one should argue with their ideas.  Does anyone know what these people think about refugees and  immigration? The way I see it, with their appearance, these  youngsters protest against the old regime. They are justified in  wondering why the red star is still there on top of Szabadsag  Square in Budapest.    [Danyi] Let me repeat my question: What is the approximate  number of Hungarian skinheads?    [Kiraly] I know of many organizations, but they can no  longer be regarded as independent. I think that there are a lot  of youngsters with national feelings in this country both in the  Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] and the MIEP, but there  are relatively few of them in an organized framework. At the  same time, it is a fact that, out of the 19 founders of the MEP,  there were six bald youngsters. It is outrageous how little the  police know about these people; the police simply have no real  information about them. I do not know how their undercover  people work. This is why I was surprised at the exaggerated  police supervision of the festivities on 15 March.    [Danyi] What about the more than 100 skinheads arrested in  Szeged on the eve of our national day?    [Kiraly] I can imagine that, because the buses carrying  people from Miskolc and Eger to the meeting in Budapest on 15  March were halted and the passengers were checked and frisked  for almost two hours. There is no need for such preventative  measures in a democracy.    [Danyi] Among others, you have also been invited to Moscow  by Zhirinovskiy. Have you accepted the invitation?    [Kiraly] Yes.</p>

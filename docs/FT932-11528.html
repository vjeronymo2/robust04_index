			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Women hindered in work training MANAGERS BELIEVE that the biggest barriers to women's training and development are family commitments, the prejudices of male managers and child care problems, an Industrial Society survey shows. The survey, of nearly 400 member companies of the Industrial Society, looked at general training issues and focused on the training and development of women employees and secretarial and administrative staff. On training generally, managers were slightly more pessimistic about the level of their company spending on training than in a previous society survey six months ago. There was also a rise in the proportion of managers who were dissatisfied with their company's training budgets. The Industrial Society said one possible explanation for the latter finding was that after a period of static or minimal growth in training budgets managers were looking for an increased commitment to training in their organisation, and they were dissatisfied with the position that they were in. On women's training and development the survey found that: Assertiveness ranked top of managers' priorities for women-only training. Managers rate the Equal Opportunities Commission as the most important influence on policies for women's development and training. Opportunity 2000, a private-sector-led initiative to promote women's employment, was rated the least influential of the several bodies cited. Creche provision is very rare during company training courses and 30 per cent of managers said offers of training had been refused be-cause of family commitments. About one in 10 managers said they had received complaints from trainees about discriminatory language in their organisation's training courses. Complaints about sexual harassment were very rare. The findings on secretarial staff suggested they were taking on a growing number of managerial tasks and spending less time on more traditional secretarial jobs. Training Trends.

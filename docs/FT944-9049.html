			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Jobless drop is sharpest for six years The sharp fall in the unadjusted rate of claimant unemployment last month was the biggest monthly decline since October 1988, when the rules governing claims by 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds were altered. According to the Department of Employment unadjusted unemployment, as a percentage of the workforce, fell from 9.2 per cent in September to 8.7 per cent in October. The decline of 125,344 to 2.45m was boosted by students getting jobs after the summer break and by October being a five-week month, exaggerating the rate of decline. After seasonal adjustment the decline was reduced to 45,800, the second highest monthly fall in the recent recovery. Since the biggest decline also occurred in an October, this suggests that the seasonal adjustment process is not completely smoothing the fluctuations. September's seasonally adjusted fall was revised to 31,600 from 28,000. In the six months to October the seasonally adjusted total declined by an average 27,500 a month. The Department of Employment estimates the trend is for a monthly fall of 20,000 to 25,000. The seasonally adjusted unemployment total was 2.52m in October, or 8.9 per cent, its lowest level since December 1991. Unemployment fell in all regions and among both men and women. Since the peak in December 1992 unemployment has fallen by 455,100. The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres increased by a seasonally adjusted 10,600 in October to 177,100, its highest level since 1990. Long-term unemployment, defined as those out of work for more than a year, fell by 47,800 between July and October and dropped below 1m for the first time since October 1992. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, described the fall in long-term unemployment as 'a very welcome movement'. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the government was continuing to fail the long-term unemployed. He added: 'Slight falls will not resolve the massive underlying problem.' Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, said: 'Official figures suggest that unemployment is still rising among the unemployed and that jobs are still being lost in the economy.' The fall in unemployment has yet to result in a pick-up in jobs in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment fell by 4,000 between August and September and was up only 2,000 over the quarter. Manufacturing employers seem to be asking their existing staff to work longer hours instead of taking on new workers. Overtime working jumped by 1m hours a week between August and September to reach 9.84m hours, its highest level since July last year. Short-time working fell to 0.15m hours in September, the lowest-ever recorded level.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / CBI chief forecasts 'patchy' economic recovery WEAKENING order books for British manufacturers and a sharp downturn in a leading consumer confidence index suggested yesterday that the UK's recovery from recession will be sluggish and hesitant at best. The Confederation of British Industry reported that manufacturers expect output to grow only slowly over the next four months following a partial reversal of an earlier improvement in orders. The latest consumer confidence survey by Gallup, the market research company, showed the biggest drop in consumers' confidence about the UK economic outlook since January 1991. However, the CBI said tough competitive conditions had brought inflationary pressures at factory level to their lowest point for more than 25 years, indicating further progress towards making the UK a low-inflation country. Commenting on the CBI's latest monthly industrial trends inquiry, Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said the signs of recovery were 'rather less substantial' than a month ago. 'It would be wrong to say that the recovery has stalled, but it is hesitant and seems likely to continue to be slow and patchy.' Mr Gordon Heald, Gallup's managing director, said the consumer confidence survey showed greatly increased fears of rising unemployment and that 'any post-election euphoria disappeared in the second half of May'. The CBI polled 1,461 companies in 50 industries between May 22 and June 17. Together they are responsible for more than half UK manufacturing employment and exports. It found that orders overall deteriorated in the period, although there was a less significant weakening of export demand. Output expectations were revised down in response, but manufacturers' replies during the past three months suggest that they still expect to increase production. The CBI found that 28 per cent of companies expected to increase output in the next four months against 20 per cent that predicted a cut. The resulting balance, indicating the trend, was a positive 8 per cent compared with 13 per cent in May and 5 per cent in April. The survey showed 13 per cent of companies planned to cut prices compared with 9 per cent intending rises. The resulting 4 per cent negative balance indicated the weakest producer price expectations since October 1966. Gallup's survey of nearly 2,000 people in the first two weeks of June showed the balance of respondents expecting the economy to improve over the next year dropped from 30 per cent in May to 13 per cent. It also noted a big increase in the balance of people expecting increased unemployment and a deterioration from 14 per cent to 5 per cent in the balance expecting their financial situation to improve.

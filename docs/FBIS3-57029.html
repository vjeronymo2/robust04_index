The U.N. Security Council must make the final decision as  far  as the possibility of deploying peace-keeping forces is  concerned, Ardzinba said in an interview with Abkhazian  television Saturday evening.    Participants in the Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in Geneva  on January 11-13 called for stationing Russian troops as  peace-keepers on the border River Inguri.    Abkhazian frontier troops must be deployed on the border  alongside of the peace-keeping forces, Ardzinba said. As for  Abkhazia's armed forces, their units, he noted, will be  stationed in Gali District "behind international peace-keeping  forces".    Before the issue of deploying peace-keeping forces is  settled  "Abkhazia must strengthen its army and be ready to protect its  territory", Ardzinba pointed out.    With reference to the return of refugees to Abkhazia, the  Abkhaz leader said that this will relate primarily to the  inhabitants of Gali District. According to him, the Abkhaz  authorities will have individual approaches to everyone who  wants to return to Abkhazia. "Those with blood on their hands  can hardly expect to get back to Abkhazia," he declared.</p>

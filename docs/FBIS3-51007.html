Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the Senate and of the  National Assembly, left his seat under police protection after  he was manhandled by hostile parliamentarians because he wanted  to end the session. During these incidents, Mr. Jean-Louis was  protected by several parliamentarians, including Deputy Frantz  Robert Monde, who physically intervened. The diplomatic corps  quickly left the Parliament under the protection of their  bodyguards. We still do not know if a new session will be held  today.    Mr. Frantz Robert Monde, an independent who votes with the  Socialist bloc, solemnly warned his colleagues about the threats  of anti-parliamentarism by the left and by the right. In a brief  statement to AFP, he said that there was a real danger that the  extreme right would take advantage of a parliamentary vacuum if  the Parliament did not agree to find a Haitian solution to the  crisis.    The neo-Duvalierists of the Revolutionary Front for Haitian  Advancement and Progress, FRAPH, threatened the Parliament with  a mob dissolution if its members did not find a solution  quickly. The incidents were triggered by the presence of the  parliamentarians elected during the controversial partial  elections of January 1993, held by a government not recognized  by the international community. The Parliament was going to open  debates aimed at reaching a final vote on the problem caused by  the election of those parliamentarians, but two senators  favoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, namely Eudrice  Raymond and Judenel Jean, wanted to leave their seats. Their  adversaries, who reproached them for invalidating the quorum and  for thus making the continuation of the session impossible,  physically prevented them from leaving the Parliament before  things degenerated.    After several hours of procrastination, the National  Assembly  scheduled for 10 January at 0100 eventually took place at about  0405 at the Haitian Parliament, with the question of the 18  January parliamentarians at the heart of the debates because  they were present at the session to have their voices heard,  although their names were not cited during the roll call.    The tension was rising, and in the area surrounding the  Parliament demonstrators called for the dissolution of the 45th  legislature due to ineffectivenss and called for the transfer of  power to the Court of Cassation so new general elections can be  held in the country. To realize all that, they demanded the  intervention of the Army. Meanwhile, inside the Legislative  Palace, with a very fragile quorum at the Senate -- with 11  senators present -- the parliamentarians met in National  Assembly in the presence of political and diplomatic  personalities. Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the  National Assembly, pointed out the needs of the time and hoped  that a solution could be found to the problem of the 18 January  1993 parliamentarians. [passage omitted]    Everything was going to fly to pieces when -- after the  departure of the National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD]  deputies [as heard] -- Sen. Eudrice wanted to leave as well to  protest the insertion into the agenda the question of the 18  January parliamentarians. He stressed the reasons that had  prompted him to decide to leave the room.    [Begin Raymond recording, in Creole] The assembly is not  supposed to have other elements than [words indistinct] of the  day of the National Assembly, opening of the assembly, and  closing the agenda. Once the assembly has taken upon itself the  right to add another element to the agenda, personally (?I have  lost) the obligation I had to be present today. It is a fact  that I have met my obligation as I am present within the scope  of the assembly; I participated in the opening. As far as I am  concerned, I do not have to be present when other elements are  added to the agenda. [end recording]    It was finally chaos when Judenel Jean decided to leave as  well. The 18 January parliamentarians, notably Gabriel Ancion,  Margareth Martin, Pierre Romel Manigat, and Rousseau, hindered  the departure of this parliamentarian. [Passage indistinct] This  was the situation at the time when the 18 January  parliamentarians were trying to hinder the departure of Senators  Judenel Jean and Eudrice Raymond. Those scenes unfolded in the  presence of foreign diplomats who came to attend the session.  It should be pointed out that three out of four ministers of  the resigning government departed even before the beginning of  the session. They wanted to protest because the protocol  official of the Haitian Parliament asked them to let the  representatives of the Army, the Port-au-Prince bar, and the  governor of the Central Bank take the first seats.</p>

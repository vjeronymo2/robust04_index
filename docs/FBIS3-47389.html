			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Association of Job Placement Companies has  reported that Thai workers are encountering difficulties in  obtaining visas to reenter Libya. Those workers who have  returned and are now applying for reentry visas are having  problems. Libya has refused to issue visas to workers whose  contracts have expired. New job seekers are also encountering  many problems. They have to wait for a long time to get a visa  to work there. Job placement companies have been waiting, but  have not received an answer. This has disrupted the businesses  of brokers who send Thai workers to work in Libya. The delay in  issuing visas comes despite the fact that Thai workers are  skilled and the companies that hired them want them to return  and complete the projects they were hired for.    Thamrongsak Saengthong, owner of (Fa-ez) Thailand Company,  admits that he can do nothing to help the workers because it is  up to the Thai Government and the Foreign Ministry to solve the  problem. He is waiting for the outcome of how the government  will handle the problem. Job placement companies are confused  on the issue of Libya. They hope Phaithun Kaeothong, the new  labor minister, will be able to solve the problem effectively.    According to a source at the Labor and Social Welfare  Ministry, Phaithun Kaeothong made a remark to some high-ranking  authorities that he is concerned about the problem. The problem  was discussed at a meeting of the committee in charge of helping  Thai workers in Libya, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai  Wirawan. Phaithun has been informed by the brokers that they  were told to send all Thai workers home by February, including  those whose contracts have expired as well as those whose  contracts are still valid.    "Workers whose permits have expired will not be given  reentry  visas. As for new workers applying for visas, Libya has not  rejected their applications, but is just delaying issuing visas.  As of 4 January, the Labor Ministry instructed its officials in  Greece to check with Thai workers in Libya and report the facts  they obtain back to the ministry. Therefore, a report is  expected this week," the source said.    According to the same source, Labor Permanent Secretary  Sawai  Phrammani has discussed the matter with his deputy, and they  agreed to send a team to negotiate with Libya once a report is  received from the labor attache in Greece. They stressed,  however, that the issue of Thai workers must be separate from  that of international relations.    "The Libyan attitude is seen as a tactic to pressure  Thailand  into working actively to establish diplomatic relations between  the two countries. The matter was discussed with Libya a long  time ago, but Thailand has remained quiet about it, especially  now that it has become a member of the Nonaligned Movement.  Libya is serious about it. If Thailand makes its position  clear on diplomatic relations, it is believed the problem of  Thai workers will be settled," the source said.    The Labor Ministry's Job Placement Department reports that  there are currently about 20,000 Thai workers in Libya. They  are confused about the Thai Government's attitude. The  companies say that workers were asking questions after a report  said that Libya was unhappy with Thailand's policy of following  America.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Boardroom changes at Arthur Shaw ARTHUR SHAW, the buildings materials group, has announced further management changes following an egm at which rebel shareholders ousted the board. Mr Peter Ryan, the caretaker chairman, has resigned. He has been replaced by Mr Brian Phillips, a former managing director. The moves follow the removal of Mr Gordon Pearson and the board after shareholders backed rebel demands for a change in direction at the loss-making group. Mr Alan Bearman and Mr Donald Crammond, two directors on the original board who were first ousted last August for backing the rebels and then reappointed recently, have also stepped down. Mr Ian Tickler, the rebel leader and Mr Pearson's predecessor, will remain a director. Mr Tickler, whose family controls 49 per cent of the equity, hopes to sell the Jackdaw engineering subsidiary to reduce the group's Pounds 3.35m debt.</p>

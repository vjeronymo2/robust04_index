L. 100&hyph;656) established the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering (A&amp;E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993. Modifications to solicitation practices are outlined in the Supplementary Information section below and apply to solicitations issued on or after April 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> effective date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ida Ustad, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, (202) 501&hyph;1224. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Procurements of construction or trash/garbage collection with an estimated value of $25,000 or less will be reserved for emerging small business concerns in accordance with the procedures outlined in the interim policy directive issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (58 FR 13513, March 11, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Procurements of construction or trash/garbage collection with an estimated value that exceeds $25,000 by GSA contracting activities will be made in accordance with the following procedures: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Construction Services in Groups 15, 16, and 17 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Procurements for all construction services (except solicitations issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions 2, 9, and 10 in Group 15 and Regions 2, 3, and 5 in SIC 1794) will be conducted on an unrestricted basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procurements for construction services in Group 15 issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions 2, 9, and 10 and in SIC 1794 issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions 2, 3, and 5 will be set aside for small business when there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining competition for two or more small businesses.

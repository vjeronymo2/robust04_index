			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falconbridge to restart number one smelter FALCONBRIDGE of Canada is to restart the number one smelter at Falconbridge Dominicana, its ferro-nickel facility in the Dominican Republic, in mid-March, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The smelter was closed last October because of the weak state of the nickel market. Falcondo has an annual capacity of 32,000 tonnes of ferro-nickel. The closure of the smelter cut production by half.</p>

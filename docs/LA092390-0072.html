			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISCRETION IS THE BETTER PART OF LANNAN FOUNDATION  </P> <P> We all missed it.  </P> <P> On Sept. 11, an announcement about six winners of $35,000 did not catch our  attention. There was no media hype, no champagne, no gala, no news at 11.  </P> <P> "LOS ANGELES -- The Lannan Foundation today announced the recipients of the  1990 Lannan Literary Awards celebrating literary excellence in fiction,  nonfiction and poetry."  </P> <P> In an era of aggressive self-promotion, a private family foundation was  guarding its own privacy, plus the privacy of its lucky winners.  </P> <P> Such discretion is by Meghan A. Ferrill's design. Ferrill, since 1987 the  director of the Lannan Foundation's literary program, is responsible for the  selection and distribution of $450,000 annually in grants and awards.  </P> <P> However, Ferrill is no paper-pushing bureaucrat. She works much like the poets  her program serves, intuitively following the emotions and inner voices so  crucial to literary pursuits. She believes that a poet's precarious writing  life can be undermined by sudden celebrity.  </P> <P> So before the official announcement last week, Ferrill nervously phoned Dublin  and alerted poet Seamus Heaney to watch for a $35,000 check in the mail.  </P> <P> "What do you want me to do?" Heaney asked Ferrill after she explained his 1990  Lannan Literary Award for poetry. "Do I have to come to L.A.?"  </P> <P> Ferrill understood Heaney's anxiety. What's the catch? Heaney was asking.  Surely the Lannan Foundation wanted publicity, would exhibit its winners.  Wasn't that what corporate sponsorship was all about?  </P> <P> But Ferrill assured the Irish poet that he was safe from L.A.'s notorious  celebrity worship.  </P> <P> After expressing his amazement, Heaney told her how he hoped to spend his  $35,000: "I would love to use the award to secure space and silence."  </P> <P> The perfect response, the kind Ferrill loves to hear.  </P> <P> "That's what a writer really wants and needs," Ferrill explained to a reporter  on the eve of the announcement. "Nothing's more valuable or more expensive than  time to write."  </P> <P> And that's exactly what the Lannan Literary Awards will do for Heaney and  fellow recipients John Hawkes, Barry Lopez, Carolyn Forche, Derek Mahon and  Peter Reading: provide time to write what they wish in their own space and  time.  </P> <P> This was business as usual for the philanthropic organization founded in the  early 1960s by Chicago financier and former ITT Chairman J. Patrick Lannan. His  passion for contemporary art and literature made him chairman of the board of  the Modern Poetry Assn. Upon Lannan's death in 1983, a substantial endowment  from his estate increased the foundation's asset base to more than $100  million. When J. Patrick Lannan Jr. relocated the foundation's headquarters to  Los Angeles in 1986, its literary philanthropy also expanded.  </P> <P> Today, no other literary program in the United States compares to the Lannan  Foundation's. Besides the awards program, there is a 26-volume video series of  English-language writers and poets reading from their works, ranging from Allen  Ginsberg to Octavio Paz. Generous funds support readings at the Los Angeles  Theatre Center's Poetry/Literature Series, at the Beyond Baroque Foundation in  Venice, at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the poetry series sponsored by  the Folger Shakespeare Library and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.  The foundation supports San Francisco State University's Poetry Center and  provides grants for the Streetfare Journal, visual displays of poems located in  public transportation systems nationwide.  </P> <P> It's not just the financial commitment that sets the Lannan Foundation apart  from most other literary supporters. There are no application forms to fill  out. The Lannan style is low-key but personal -- patronage like Renaissance  artists enjoyed.  </P> <P> "This isn't a clinical program," Ferrill emphasized. "The awards aren't  clinical. The grants aren't clinical. I'd go crazy if I thought I had to  conform to some sort of system. We're talking about people. It's not just  projects or grants or applications. It's people. It's creative life. And to be  able to support it and nurture it is amazing."  </P> <P> Admittedly ill-at-ease with the press, Ferrill sits uncomfortably behind her  desk in the foundation's Westside headquarters, a converted industrial building  that also houses gallery space. (Currently on exhibition is "18 Oktober 1977"  by German painter Gerhard Richter and "The Tables" by New York sculptor Tom  Otterness. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday.  Admission is free.)  </P> <P> An attractive 33-year-old with an infectious laugh, Ferrill would rather read a  book or talk to a poet or editor than be interviewed.  </P> <P> "It's an amazing experience to talk to these people," Ferrill said of the  writers she meets, "and to be in this position. Somehow, I sense that my  grandfather would approve of what I'm doing."  </P> <P> Ferrill describes her maternal grandfather, Lannan Sr., as "a very private  person with a life apart from ours." She remembers growing up in a Chicago home  crowded with poetry books. She would read these without fully understanding but  was "intrigued by the language." After graduating from the University of Iowa  with degrees in English literature and journalism, Ferrill spent a year in  London on a graduate writing program sponsored by Temple University. There she  met her future husband, Jan Peter Kooyman, and relocated in Amsterdam. The next  three years were spent working for a Dutch publishing house and for an  international film distribution company.  </P> <P> After her grandfather's death, Ferrill's uncle, Lannan Jr., reformulated the  foundation with the goal of increasing its philanthropic range. He asked if she  would fly to Los Angeles and discuss initiating a literary program dedicated to  the encouragement of English-language writing. The foundation was already  influential in the world's art community.  </P> <P> (The Lannan Foundation rescued the notorious Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective  in Washington, D.C., after its peremptory cancellation by the J. Corcoran  Gallery of Art.)  </P> <P> But when Ferrill arrived in Los Angeles in September, 1987, there was no  literary program, no grants or awards, no guidelines. Its staff was just five  employees. Upon being offered the position, Ferrill asked herself, "God, can I  do this? I've always been a reader, but what qualifies me to run a program like  this? But then, what qualifies anyone?"  </P> <P> Ferrill and her uncle agreed that the Lannan Foundation should not use existing  program models. They would develop their own unique family style. She  immediately began traveling to meet writers and editors.  </P> <P> Ferrill also decided there would be no grant applications for the Lannan  literary program. "Literary centers and programs are so labor-intensive  anyway," she found, "and there's just such a heavy end on the administrative  side that it didn't seem fair to ask them to fill out another laborious  application."  </P> <P> Daniel Halpern, editor of the literary journal Antaeus, became one of her many  unofficial advisers. Ferrill soon developed a literary network stretching from  California to London. But as word went out that the Lannan Foundation would be  funding projects, she began receiving mounds of letters and applications.  Rather than simply examine them, Ferrill traveled to the sources and personally  interviewed applicants.  </P> <P> "The San Francisco State Poetry Center had asked for this huge grant before I  got to Los Angeles," she remembered, "so I had to go up and find out who they  were. They wanted $65,000 to redo their catalogue for a distribution of only  250 copies! So we gave them a grant to develop four direct-marketing mailings  to high schools, libraries, ethnic studies programs."  </P> <P> Prior to Ferrill's arrival, the Lannan Foundation had explored the videotaping  of poetry readings. They began with Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko at the Los  Angeles Theatre Center. The tape was still in rough cut when Ferrill arrived,  and she was horrified to discover that the commercial television crew cost the  foundation $40,000 for an unfinished tape. Her literary budget of $450,000  annually wouldn't survive long at that rate.  </P> <P> But then she was introduced to poet Lewis MacAdams, former director of the San  Francisco State Poetry Center and currently a video director for EZTV. She had  been impressed by his co-direction of the documentary "What Happened to  Kerouac?"  </P> <P> "I've always felt poetry is a popular art, and the Lannans are the first to  agree with me," MacAdams explained.  </P> <P> MacAdams offered to tape poetry readings for a minimal fee. The project would  record writers reading their own work and would include an interview. EZTV's  John Dorr and MacAdams would co-produce and co-direct. Nearly 26 volumes later,  the series has become a major educational tool at high schools and  universities.  </P> <P> Next, Ferrill met with Alan Mandell, consulting director for the Los Angeles  Theatre Center, whose series of Monday night poetry and literature readings by  prominent writers have become popular literary events.  </P> <P> "I found Meghan to be a breath of fresh air," Mandell remembered of that  initial meeting. "She has a kind of almost infectious enthusiasm for poetry and  literature."  </P> <P> The Lannan Foundation began endowing the LATC reading series and had a stage on  which to tape major writers. Each reading was videotaped, an interview with the  writer was added, and the cassettes were made available to the public for  $29.95 through the San Francisco State Poetry Center.  </P> <P> Before initiating an awards program, Ferrill conducted an intensive yearlong  dialogue with other foundation members. What kind of an award should it be?  Best book of poems? Lifetime achievement? How do you conduct an equitable  decision-making process?  </P> <P> Gradually a "nominations network" was created, composed of about a dozen  professionals who serve anonymously for free. Their suggestions are fed to a  seven-member committee, four of whom are Lannan board members. The final  decision is left up to the committee.  </P> <P> "We don't compromise," Ferrill said of the committee's nomination process.  "There's lots of lively discussions. We're a compatible group."  </P> <P> The six awards are divided into three prizes for English-language writers who  are accomplished in their careers, and three fellowships "for lesser-known  writers whose work we've chosen to encourage," Ferrill said. Prize categories  are poetry, fiction and nonfiction. None of the writers know they're being  considered for the awards.  </P> <P> "I was completely blind-sided, then embarrassed because I couldn't find the  language to express my gratitude right away," said this year's nonfiction  award-winner Barry Lopez by telephone from his home in Oregon.  </P> <P> "The gift sharpened my desire, my will to work harder as a writer in terms of  my social responsibilities," he added. "It also increased my own desire to be  more generous to younger writers."  </P> <P> Ferrill's most enthusiastic comments revolve around the friendships she's  managed to create through her position. For example, a recipient of one of the  first literary awards was 89-year-old novelist and teacher Kay Boyle. Now  residing in what Boyle terms "an active retirement village" in Mill Valley, her  special award for "outstanding literary achievement" enables Boyle to complete  numerous writing projects.  </P> <P> Ferrill visits Boyle whenever possible. "Every time I leave Kay," Ferrill said,  "I hope I can do something, contribute something in my life. She has done so  much in this ongoing commitment, is so thoughtful and so intelligent.  </P> <P> Ferrill displays a handwritten letter from Boyle that reads in part: "I have  been able to keep in touch with the dissident students in China. . . . Their  appreciation to me is more important by far than if I had been awarded the  Nobel Prize. It is such a wonderful thing when young people turn to very old  people in understanding and gratitude, and I am glad that I have lived to see  the day this miracle happened to me."  </P> <P> The Chinese students of whom Boyle wrote were thanking her for sending them  tapes of poetry readings recorded by the Lannan Foundation.  </P> <P> That's the personal touch Ferrill's work is all about.  </P></p>

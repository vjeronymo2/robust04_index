			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: UK brewing industry one of the most competitive Sir, You reported on a study by Lehman Brothers which alleged that the UK wholesale price of lager was twice the level in France and the Netherlands and that brewer productivity in the UK fell 11 per cent between 1989 and 1991 ('UK brewers top list for dear beer', April 5). Both these statements are incorrect. Government figures show a productivity growth of 0.6 per cent between 1989 and 1991. Also, using this short period does not give the full picture since productivity grew by 21.5 per cent from 1985 to 1991. These figures are based on UK employment data which include work areas excluded from comparable Continental figures. On price, the comparisons in the report are for standard lagers defined as 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent alcohol. This may be the right basis for Continental countries where such beers account for at least 80 per cent of sales; in the UK they account for a little more than 10 per cent of total volume. The comparison is therefore between mainstream Continental beers and specialist UK beers, and is not comparing like with like. Typical supermarket prices for leading lagers of about 4 per cent convert to Pounds 106-Pounds 113 a hectolitre. These figures include excise duty and retailers' gross margins and yet are below the Lehman Brothers wholesale price, net of all duties, of Pounds 117. Net of duty, but still including the retailers gross margin, prices fall to Pounds 65-Pounds 70 a barrel. Overall, it is clear the UK brewing industry is one of the most competitive in the world, with five national brewers and a large number of smaller companies providing active competition. This contrasts with most other countries where there are invariably fewer leading players, and the industry is often dominated by one or two companies.

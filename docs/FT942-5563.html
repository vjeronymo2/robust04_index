			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Life insurers selling despite Nikkei's rally - Japan's biggest investors need to lift declining returns on assets Something has been missing from the Tokyo stock market's rally this week. Japan's biggest investors, its life insurers, who own 12 per cent of the equity market's capitalisation according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, have on the whole continued to sell shares even as the Nikkei index hit new highs for the year for four days running. Nippon Life, Japan's largest institutional shareholder, admitted it planned to sell at least Y315bn (Dollars 3.01bn) of shares before building up its equity portfolio again. Daiichi Life says it is a small net buyer, yet insurers in general have stayed on the sidelines. Foreign institutions, convinced that Japan is in the early stage of a recovery, have greedily snapped up the unwanted stock, not the first time this year that they have provided the impetus for a rise in prices. Other Japanese institutional investors, formerly sellers, have also turned buyers for fear of missing out on the share price rises. Traditionally, life insurers have an unspoken public responsibility to support the market. Why have they changed? Life insurers are selling shares because they badly need to boost their declining return on assets, according to a recent study* by Mr Andrew Smithers, a London economist. They can be expected to take every chance presented by a new rise in share prices to sell more, he predicts. He cites a valuation by Tillinghast, a UK actuary, which suggests that the Japanese life insurance industry's liabilities may exceed its assets, if judged under more stringent international standards than used in Japan. Japan's life insurers are mutual organisations and hence unquoted, so their financial pressures are less widely broadcast than is the case for banks and industrial companies. According to the study, the problem is that over-dependence on low yielding equities (a consequence of a rush into the stock market during the *something in here (HP) * share price rally in the late 1980s) has left the 27 leading life insurers with an average 4.3 per cent return on their Y148,000bn assets at the latest count in 1992. A return of 4.3 per cent however, is well below the 4.96 per cent return the study estimates they needed last year to cover payouts to policy holders. Insurers have reacted to the problem by obtaining finance ministry permission to reduce guaranteed returns to corporate annuities, so requiring companies to increase direct contributions to their own pension funds, and by increasing premiums. Japanese insurance portfolio managers have already started to switch strategy in response to the collapse of asset prices, but probably not enough, the study suggests. They have become as stringent as Scottish investment trusts in valuing shares, according to stockbrokers in Tokyo. 'If a company can't give its depreciation charges for the past 10 years down to the last yen, they won't even look at it,' jokes one US broker. Insurers have, as their recent share sales show, started to reduce their proportional exposure to equities, in the search for better performing investments. Equities accounted for 8 per cent of their net outflows last year, well below the 26 per cent of assets or Y40,000bn held in shares at estimated market value, the survey estimates. But this moderate change in new investment flows is insufficient to lift the return on assets enough to meet current liabilities, says Mr Smithers. A wholesale portfolio reorganisation, away from low yielding equities into higher yielding bonds, is needed, he argues. If life insurers were to move more equity funds and some of their Y9,700bn in cash and loans into government bonds, total returns could rise to 5.3 per cent, well above the required minimum, he calculates. This assumes equities yield 0.8 per cent and allows for the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond to fall to 3.6 per cent, from its current 3.9 per cent. The freedom of Japan's top investors to unload shares will however, be limited by their own and the finance ministry's desire, to avoid hitting prices. Yet the life insurers' asset problems are applying a little publicised brake on the Nikkei's ability to rise. * Japanese Life Insurance: The Industry's Problems and Stock Market Consequences.

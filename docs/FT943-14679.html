			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: United Breweries decision soon - Future may be resolved after banks consider restructuring plan The future of United Breweries, the financially troubled USM-quoted company controlled by Indian businessman Mr Vijay Mallya, could be resolved next week. Four banks, with a combined exposure of about Pounds 9m, have been considering their response to a restructuring plan. It involves them writing off approximately Pounds 2.5m of debt and converting further debt to 'some sort' of convertible loan stock, say company advisers. However, Mr Michael Potts of Allied Irish Bank, UB's main lender, said yesterday that the company was being asked to submit further proposals - for the third time - so a decision could be made next week. 'We are still to make up our minds,' said Mr Potts, who added that 'We are fairly confident that the banks will be presented with fresh proposals that they will look at,' he said. The company's other banks are the Yorkshire Bank, National Home Loans and Adam &amp; Co., a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. Negotiations followed a Pounds 7.2m write-down in the value of UB's 76 public houses in April, which led to it breaching banking covenants. Just 18 months earlier, Mr Mallya's Indian-based UB Group had bought 15 per cent of the company, then called Wiltshire Brewery. UB Group, which has management control but still has only a 15 per cent stake in the company, changed its name from Wiltshire Brewery to United Breweries. It still plans to use UB to expand its UK brewing interests. According to one of his advisers, Mr Mallya, who is chairman of UB, is negotiating on the basis that 'the banks must be willing to accept some of the pain. Mallya is not frightened to walk away'. Such an outcome would deprive UB of the 'interim financial assistance' which UB Group has recently been providing. 'The banks are unlikely to pull the plug, but there is a risk that one of them will fall out of bed the wrong way one morning and say 'sod it, I've had enough',' said Mr Christopher Stainforth, head of corporate finance at Guinness Mahon, who is advising UB. UB stresses that the company's future could be bright if restructuring plans succeed. Up to three acquisitions are planned, funded by a rights issue, all to be implemented by a new deputy executive chairman working alongside Mr O'Neil Nalavadi, UB's chief executive. Advisers say that the executive is 'an experienced hand, currently director of a major drinks company'. The banks have been told who he is but he will not be named publicly unless the negotiations succeed. The plans are believed to include taking full control of UBSN, the drinks distribution company jointly owned with Shepherd Neame, the Kent brewer. UBSN distributes Kingfisher, the Indian beer widely sold in curry houses in the UK. UB's turnover for the year to November 30 1993 leapt 68 per cent to Pounds 4.14m, while operating profits before exceptional items improved from Pounds 38,000 to Pounds 463,000. However UB was left with an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.57m after the Pounds 7.2m pub write-down, compared with a loss of Pounds 978,954 the year before.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: New issues The raft of companies floating on the market seem to be enticing Sid into making a comeback. With returns on cash being whittled away by falling interest rates and the stock market buoyed by hopes of recovery, private investors seem prepared to take a punt on new issues once again. Last month's offering by David Lloyd Leisure was almost seven times oversubscribed. Westminster Health Care, a nursing homes company, which is raising Pounds 63m this week, has had requests for prospectuses from 45,000 potential investors. Institutional investors, too, appear receptive to issues from smaller companies with a big exposure to the UK economy. Although the FT-SE 100 has performed somewhat laggardly this year, smaller capitalisation stocks have risen by almost 15 per cent. This may encourage more flotations. The timing would certainly seem to be ideal for management buy-out companies contemplating a return to the market. MBOs which have struggled through the recession appear in need of funds to finance expansion. But the window of opportunity may not last. Secondary issues from quoted companies will continue to take money from shareholders' pockets. So far this year, almost Pounds 3bn has been raised in rights issues. Big equity issues from ICI and British Telecommunications will follow this summer while the government's gilts programme will drain further funds.</p>

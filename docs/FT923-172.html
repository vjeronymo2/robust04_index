			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: EC offer averts trade war with US THE US and the EC were hauled back from the brink of trade war last night following an 11th-hour EC proposal of compromise on a long-standing dispute over trade in oilseeds. The EC move in Gatt's governing council came after it formally rejected a US demand for binding arbitration by an independent Gatt panel on trade damages caused by its oilseed subsidies. The compromise offer occurred as the US administration came under fierce pressure from Senate Republicans to move fast and firmly in imposing retaliatory tariffs on EC food and drink imports - for what it claims is Dollars 1bn in losses suffered by US oilseeds producers because of market barriers in the EC. The EC has offered compensation of less than Dollars 400m. Two Gatt panels have ruled in favour of the US in the dispute, which has dragged on since 1987. The oilseeds dispute, together with a tit-for-tat escalation of wheat dumping, threaten to derail efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, and plunge the US, the EC and their trading partners into trade war. The last-minute compromise proposal by Mr Tran van Thinh, EC ambassador to Gatt, which will be discussed in more detail by the Gatt council today, combines elements of the independent panel called for by the US with elements of a Gatt working party favoured by the EC. A small group, excluding the US, EC and other interested parties, would be established under Gatt to consider EC compensation for losses to oilseed traders within a fixed time period. As trade negotiators haggled at the Gatt council in Geneva, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Julius Katz, her deputy, were called to a meeting with Republican senators in the office of Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader. The senators stressed the concern they had found among farm state voters about the administration's failure to make headway in its long running oilseeds dispute. An observer at the meeting said the trade officials expressed concern about the damage to be inflicted on US business from EC counter-retaliation, but that senators were adamant that the oilseeds dispute be made 'a litmus test' of the Gatt's ability to resolve trade disputes. Any final decision to move ahead with US retaliation must be made by the Bush cabinet and the president himself. The opportunity for such a meeting is not expected until next week. Earlier in the day in Geneva, both the US and the EC drew fierce criticism from trading partners over escalating subsidies for wheat exports. Mr David Hawes, Australia's ambassador to Gatt, said US and EC export subsidies had 'effectively created a two-tier world market where more than half the wheat traded was sold at predatory, subsidy-discounted prices'.</p>

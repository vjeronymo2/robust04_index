			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf failed to file accounts THE 1991 accounts of Leyland Daf, the failed van and truckmaker, have not been filed at Companies House and are now more than four months overdue, the government said yesterday, David Owen writes. Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and industry minister, said the accounts were due by the end of last October and that default procedures had been initiated last year. In a written answer to a question from Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, Mr Hamilton said that follow-up letters were issued on November 16 and January 8. The government had decided that further action against the directors would be inappropriate as responsibility for the company's affairs now lay with the administrative receiver appointed last month. Meanwhile Leyland Daf dealers yesterday attacked a Pounds 250,000 advertising campaign that criticises the government's handling of the company's financial crisis. Posters and press advertisements calling for support in saving jobs at the company have slogans including 'The government's too mean to buy a bunch of Dafs'. The dealers said the campaign - paid for by Leyland Daf Finance, one of the operations to escape receivership - is 'misplaced and untimely' with management buy-outs planned at the Birmingham and Leyland plants.</p>

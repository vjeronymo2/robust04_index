			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METHANE DETECTORS LACKING IN LEAK ZONE  </P> <P> As crews began pumping out dangerous methane gas that forced the closure of 50  stores in the Fairfax District, Los Angeles building and safety officials said  Wednesday that many homes and businesses required under a 1986 city law to  install gas detection devices do not have them.  </P> <P> Apparently, city officials said, only high-profile businesses along 3rd Street  have the mandated detectors. Many homeowners could not afford the devices,  which cost up to $1,000, and follow-up inspections in many cases were not done.  </P> <P> There were no estimates on the number of homes and businesses lacking the  detectors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enforcement Called Lax  </P> <P> Officials acknowledged that enforcement has been lax, but they said Tuesday's  leak and evacuation are likely to prompt a comprehensive city program to ensure  compliance with the ordinance, which was enacted in the wake of a 1985 blast in  which 21 persons were injured.  </P> <P> "Enforcement may not have been strict, but the net result is the same," said  Building Bureau Supervisor Ron Shigeta, whose section enforces the gas  detection ordinance. "(The detectors Tuesday) warned people that there was a  problem, and there was no loss of life."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a few stores reopened Wednesday, and work crews erected a 70-foot  tower to begin the pumping operations to draw out the excess methane and  rainwater, which may have precipitated the leak. Fire Department officials said  work to relieve the methane gas forced to the surface is likely to continue  today. If all goes well, 3rd Street may be reopened by Friday, Fire Department  spokesman Vince Marzo said.  </P> <P> City Councilman John Ferraro, whose district includes the Farmers Market area,  acknowledged that "there may not be enough detectors in the area" but pointed  out that the cost of each device might help explain why some homeowners do not  have them.  </P> <P> Under the law, an estimated 15% of homes and businesses in a 400-block  "potential risk" zone near the Farmers Market were required to install the  devices. Especially targeted are those structures with basements.  </P> <P> The ordinance was praised Tuesday by Fire Department officials, who said  detectors in the basements of the Ross Dress for Less and K mart stores warned  employees of the methane gas leaks. That summoned fire units to the area, which  was closed after highly flammable readings were registered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Criticized  </P> <P> But Wednesday, spokesmen for several homeowner groups criticized the city for  largely ignoring the ordinance, charging that more detectors should be  installed in the area.  </P> <P> "All we have is this fantastic ordinance, but nothing happened," said Harald R.  Hahn, president of the South of Burton Way Homeowners Assn. "We need proper  supervision of those few safety measures now in place, as obviously this is not  now taking place."  </P> <P> Hahn and Diana Plotkin, president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., also  criticized Ferraro and other officials for not ordering a geological study to  assess the potential of danger in the area where "overdevelopment" might cause  more problems.  </P> <P> People should not have to worry about their lives being in "danger from this  gas where they live," Plotkin said.  </P> <P> Ferraro, in a telephone interview, said a new geological study is under  consideration. But he criticized the homeowner groups for turning Tuesday's  incident into a forum of second-guessing.  </P> <P> "It's easy to be a Monday morning quarterback," he said. "They are opposed to  any development in the area."  </P> <P> At one of the reopened stores, there was free if somewhat stale bread being  offered.  </P> <P> "I got all this bread," pleaded Effie Villanueva, shortly after Eva's Bakery in  the Town and Country shopping center was allowed to reopen. "You want some?"  </P></p>

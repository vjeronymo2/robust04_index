			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At an extraordinary  session today chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the  Yugoslav federal government discussed the development of the  situation following NATO's air strikes against the territory of  the Srpska republic in the Gorazde area last night.    The federal government sharply condemned the United Nations'  decision to use NATO's air force, which amounts to its direct  involvement in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina on the  Muslim side, a statement by the Federal Ministry of Information  said.    The federal government particularly stressed that the United  Nations did this without having fulfilled the assumed obligation  of demilitarizing the Muslim army in Gorazde. Furthermore, it  tolerated the planning and carrying out of Muslim offensive  military operations launched from the protected area against  Serb positions in the Gorazde area. Only when the Muslim spring  offensive was defeated did the United Nations remember that  Gorazde was a protected area and asked NATO fighter-planes to  launch strikes against the Serb side under attack.    It is regrettable that the United Nations, which is obliged  by the Charter to preserve peace and international security,  took steps that put in jeopardy the peace process and caused the  escalation of the war. By taking such biased and war-mongering  positions, the United Nations has seriously discredited its  reputation as a peace-making force in former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and has assumed responsibility for all consequences of a  possible further uncontrollable development.    By acting as a side involved in the conflict, the United  Nations has set a dangerous precedent, which can have  far-reaching implications.    The federal government stresses that the way out of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be based on a policy of  double standards, and on the world organization [UN] and other  factors siding with any of the three warring sides in the civil  war there, but on the same treatment of all three warring sides,  as well as on unbiased and unselfish contributions to the peace  process. Any deviation from this principle only boosts the  Muslim side in its belief that by stubbornly obstructing peace  efforts and continuing military hostilities it can win the civil  war and impose the concept of a united Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  federal government calls on the United Nations to immediately  abandon the irresponsible and dangerous policy of getting  involved in the war on the side of the Muslims and to fight  against the war and fight for its unconditional, immediate, and  lasting end by pursuing peace rather than war.    By consistently pursuing its principled and peaceful  policies  in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia will continue to provide support for all  constructive efforts to reduce the present tensions and to bring  an end to the hostilities, and to a just and comprehensive  political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On this  occasion, the federal government draws attention to the  solidarity of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  with the Serb people in the Srpska republic who are victims of  the latest aggression, the Federal Ministry for Information says  in its statement.</p>

This new group shares the scene with a few old-guard  survivors who were not devoured by the CPI -- Senator Pedro  Simon (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul], Senator Mario Covas  (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo State],  Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal  Party-Para State], Senator Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front  Party-Pernambuco State], Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP)  [PMDB-Amapa State], and State Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes  (PFL-BA) [PFL-Bahia State].    Even some historical Planalto hopefuls like [Sao Paulo]  Mayor  Paulo Maluf (PPR-SP) and [former Sao Paulo Governor] Orestes  Quercia (PMDB-SP) can no longer move without the participation  of the "new foxes," a team of congressmen -- whose average age  is about 40 -- that was formed during the second half of the  military regime. Despite all the difficulties, they earnestly  entered the scene. For example, PMDB President Luis Henrique  (SC) [Santa Catarina State] mustered enough courage to forge an  alliance with the PSDB and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party],  contradicting Quercia who considers himself the proprietor of  the ticket.    PMDB leader Tarcisio Delgado, Luis Henrique's squire, said:  "We obviously have different styles. Nevertheless, we are  responsible for solving our country's problems honestly."    One of the most substantial succession talks took place at  the Brasilia residence of newcomer Sergio Machado, a jeans  manufacturer who entered the political arena to help his friend  Tasso Jereissati, the PSDB president, with the only experience  of having been Ceara governor. The meeting at Machado's house  united the PSDB leadership with the PMDB anti-Quercia band in  the early hours of the day on which Congress rejected a quick  approval of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic  program.    Machado's house is on Lake Paranoa in Brasilia, near where  former Minister Jorge Bornhausen also lives. At the PFL  president's house, the spectrum ranges between Mayor Paulo Maluf  and Jose Serra, the PSDB leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and  includes new ticket leaders like Alvaro Dias (PP-PR) [Popular  Party-Parana State]. The succession talks at Bornhausen's house  have always been attended by Luiz Eduardo and Benito Gama, two  Bahia congressmen who are serving their second term and have  matured through the succession of crises prompted by the  investigations of the CPI that handled the PC [Paulo Cesar]  Farias case.    Jose Genoino, who is at the far left of the new generation  of  foxes and describes himself as "a democratic radical," explains:  "We are molding a new profile of politicians who are concerned  over supplying institutional responses to society's  requirements. This common sentiment overcomes ideological  disagreements."</p>

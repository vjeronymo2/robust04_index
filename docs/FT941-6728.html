			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Fiat workers vote for deal to save jobs Works councils at Fiat's Italian vehicle plants have endorsed overwhelmingly a complex government-sponsored agreement avoiding large job losses. The deal directly affects 16,000 of Fiat's 95,000 vehicle workforce and was brokered by Mr Gini Giugni, the labour minister, between management and union leaders last Monday. The main engineering union, Fiom, insisted the agreement be put to a shop-floor vote because Fiat's plans to cut its workforce by more than 5 per cent and lay off a further 10 per cent had provoked serious unrest. Although less than 60 per cent of the workforce voted, almost 90 per cent favoured the deal in most plants. The high numbers in favour suggested employees previously threatened with job losses or up to two years laid off (and with an uncertain future after that) opted for a generous package of work sharing and early retirement. The more militant among the unions rejected the deal because they said it funded job cuts at Fiat without any clear future industrial strategy. The deal is based round four points: early retirement for 6,600 workers and staff; 'solidarity contracts' covering some 3,500 jobs and affecting 8.700 people, involving a shorter working week, salary cuts and job sharing; government subsidised retraining and job hunting for 2,200; and the commitment to spend up to L450bn (Pounds 182m) on the development of a clean car. According to labour ministry estimates the agreement will cost some L310bn more than the original package proposed by Fiat last November. Of this L220bn will cover early retirement, split jointly between the government and Fiat. A further L90bn covers the solidarity contracts over the next three years. The funds earmarked for developing a clean car include over L300bn for an electric car. These were already in the science ministry budget. Put together the overall cost of achieving labour peace at Fiat and allowing the group the means to fight the recession in the automotive business over the next three years comes close L900bn.</p>

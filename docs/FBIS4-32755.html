			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 27 June, 1994 (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's  soon-to-be-established coalition government has declared that it  must seek new ways of tackling Hungary's economic problems.    According to the section of the Coalition Agreement dealing  with the economy, the continuing dramatic deterioration of the  country's balance of payment makes it of vital importance that  the new government avert a general economic collapse, at the  same time ensuring that Hungary does not fall behind.    The Coalition Agreement was approved by congresses of both  the Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] at the weekend.    The section on economic policy concludes that Hungary faces  a  deep crisis, characterized by declining domestic production and  declining foreign trade, unemployment, a budget deficit, a  slowing of investment, and a deterioration in competitiveness.  Although domestic supply is better than in the past, it is  still insufficient, it says.    The fact that the previous government undertook many more  domestic and foreign obligations than would have been justified  by the budget situation gives the new government even less room  for maneuver than originally thought, while the precise extent  of the obligations is still to be fully established.    The first priority will be to publicize a thorough general  economic inventory, in order that both the government and the  public may clearly see the situation and realize that there is  no chance of quick economic growth.    A significant amount of purchasing power has appeared in the  market as a result of campaign-related economic measures, the  inflationary effect of which can already be felt, the document  says.    The main purpose of the new government's economic policy is  to establish a market economy dominated by private ownership,  which would pave the way for economic growth, while at the same  time bringing down unemployment. This can only be achieved by  reducing the budget deficit and controlling inflation.    The economic policy document gives a detailed discription of  measures to be taken in order to reorganize the state budget, to  develop the institutions of market economy, to consolidate and  privatise banks and state-owned companies, to improve the  employment situation and industrial performance, to establish a  general economic foreign strategy, to improve infrastructure and  enviromental protection, and to prepare for the 1996 EXPO.</p>

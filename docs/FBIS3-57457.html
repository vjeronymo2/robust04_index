			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [VoyenTV "Arsenal" video report; from the "Military Courier" </F> program]    [Text] The new Russian Su-34 frontline bomber has become  the latest sensation. The aircraft has an almost unlimited  flight range. The Su-34 can fly 4,000 kilometers without aerial  refueling or auxiliary fuel tanks. Its fundamentally new  on-board digital computer, and other radio and electronic  equipment, unerringly guides the aircraft to a given target with  accuracy down to a meter. And it does this in any meteorological  conditions. [video shows the aircraft landing, taking off, and  in flight, showing its similarity to an Su-35 with a cockpit  similar to that of the Su-25TK]    The homing and guided missiles, and bombs permit the Su-34  to  strike well-defended point targets at a distance of from 0 to  250 kilometers and it carries sufficient weapons to fulfill any  task. The new aircraft is equipped with a so-called artificial  intelligence system which allows the bomber to perform intricate  maneuvers at top speed and at minimal altitudes, and to  unerringly follow the lay of the land and easily avoid the  anti-aircraft actions of ground forces. [video shows the Su-34  on the ground being viewed by a group of people]    The Su-34 looks like no other aircraft. It has its own  features, its own bearing, its own fighting spirit, and its own  purely Russian unpredictability. This is our own domestic  aircraft which is not a threat to anybody. It was created for  us, for our spirit, for the defense of Russia. [video shows A.A.  Kokoshin, first deputy Russian Minister of Defense, being  interviewed among a group of officials; a man on his right has  the air force banner over his shoulders]    [Begin recording] [Kokoshin] Those who built this machine  today and who lifted it into the air are the real heroes, our  Russian people, and our country has always had many of them. You  agree, Nikolay Ivanovich?    [Man with Banner on his Shoulders] Yes. (Lizovtsy) and  Chkalovtsy, you can be proud. We have achieved victory.  Hurrah. [everybody cheers] [end recording]</p>

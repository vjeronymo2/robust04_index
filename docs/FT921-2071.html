			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Candidates take out insurance cover AT LEAST 500 parliamentary candidates are taking out insurance to cover the cost of any legal battles arising from the election campaign, Richard Lapper writes. Legal Protection Group, a subsidiary of Sun Alliance, and Careassist, which is owned by Royal Insurance, provide legal expense policies for candidates. These cover costs arising from libel or defamation claims as well as actions under the Representation of the People Act. So far, LPG - which is selling a policy valid for the period of the campaign  -has received requests from 242 candidates. Careassist, which sells a policy covering all local and parliamentary elections over a 12-month period, says that it has sold a block scheme covering all Liberal Democrat candidates. It also has 300 Conservative and a handful of Labour candidates on its books. LPG is set to pay a Pounds 50,000 claim to finance legal action by Labour candidates who sued Liberal Democrat opponents over a bogus Labour council by-election document in Tower Hamlets, London. The Appeal Court found in favour of the Liberal Democrats last week. Mr Reg Brown, whose syndicate at Lloyd's underwrote the LPG policy for the last two elections, says there have been 45 claims on the policy.</p>

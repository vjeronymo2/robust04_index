			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Nigeria oilworkers to remain on strike NIGERIA'S oil workers are to stay on strike until Monday despite the return to work announced yesterday by the rest of the labour movement. The blue-collar oil workers' union, NUPENG, angrily rejected the agreement by the Nigeria Labour Congress to call off the three-day general strike in return for a suspension of last week's 10-fold increase in the price of petrol. Although the oil workers' strike has not stopped the production of crude oil, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of export earnings, it has halted public transport and kept fuel stations dry in many parts of Nigeria this week. In the big cities in the south, available reserves of fuel are disappearing. The biggest hospital in Nigeria, in Lagos, has run out of fuel and fear of reprisals is preventing tanker drivers from strike-breaking. The oil workers' strike keeps the pressure on Mr Ernest Shonekan's interim government to reach a compromise with pro-democracy groups and the deposed winner of the June presidential elections, Mr Moshood Abiola. A meeting between labour congress leaders and the government on Wednesday failed to resolve their differences over the June election results.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Serb forces are only 5 km away from the  Muslim-inhabited town of Gorazde. UN reports indicate that the  Serb forces have advanced 10 km in the area, but UN officials  still say that Gorazde is not facing a serious threat.    Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran has called for  speedy  action by the United Nations to prevent the fall of Gorazde and  the massacre of its innocent inhabitants. In a letter to the  United Nations, our country's foreign affairs minister has also  made reference to the fact that Gorazde was earlier declared a  safe area. The letter, furthermore, cautions against the  occurrence of yet another tragedy in Bosnia.    The Islamic countries have also started a series of  diplomatic initiatives in the United Nations with the aim of  inducing the Security Council to pass a resolution to prevent  the fall of Gorazde.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac is continuing his  official visit to Poland. [passage omitted]    This afternoon he had talks with the president of the Polish  National Bank and then he met with journalists. Our  correspondent Michal Michalcik was present at the news  conference:    [Michalcik] [passage omitted] One of the questions was why  no  Polish-Slovak agreements were signed during this visit.  President Kovac admitted that there were plans to sign two  agreements. Last Tuesday, however, the Slovak Government  neither approved them nor was in a position to approve them:  they were still not ready. [passage omitted]    Another question was why [Slovak] Economy Minister Ducky did  not come to Warsaw Michal Kovac said on this topic:    [Begin Kovac recording] Naturally, I am upset by the fact  that the government has not agreed to Mr. Ducky's participation,  but this changes nothing about the importance and the nature of  my visit, because whether these agreements are signed during my  visit or Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to the Slovak Republic,  or on a different occasion, is not so important, in my opinion.    I do not think that there is poor communication with regard  to the preparation of the president's foreign visits. It is  possible that the prime minister was not properly informed that  coordination was taking place between the Foreign Ministry and  the president's office--specifically, its foreign policy  department. Coordination usually does not take the form of the  president and the prime minister meeting the foreign minister  and saying: When are we going, where, and how? This is prepared  usually by institutions on the basis of various invitations we  have received or made. In my opinion, with regard to this  visit, coordination was as it should have been. It might not  have been good between the Foreign Ministry and the government  office--views were not united, or proper information was not  released on which agreements would and would not be prepared.  [end recording]    One of the questions was, naturally, about Milan Panic's  letter. President Kovac said on this topic that this is a gross  provocation against Slovakia. He showed journalists a statement  the president's office sent to the Slovak press agency, TASR.  [passage omitted]</p>

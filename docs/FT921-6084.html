			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Stainless Metalcraft Losses deepened at Stainless Metalcraft, the USM-quoted medical and engineering group, from Pounds 141,000 to Pounds 256,000 pre-tax in the year to August 31 1991. The company said that the anticipated pick-up in sales in the off-shore and petrochemical sector did not materialise because of the post-Gulf war deferral of clients' capital spending. However, turnover grew to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 8.1m). Losses emerged at 3.3p (2.2p). The dividend for the year is being passed (1p). The company said 'a significant return to profitability both after six months and, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, in the full year' was anticipated.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR VETOES COUNTY AIRPORTS' EXEMPTION FROM TOUGH LAND-USE LAW  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted  Los Angeles County airports -- including Palmdale, Burbank and Van Nuys -- from  a law designed to control growth around the state's airports.  </P> <P> Under current law, Los Angeles County planners have until 1992 to fashion  comprehensive land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential  developments are compatible with flight safety and noise control regulations  around the county's 15 airports.  </P> <P> "Without such planning, airports and the businesses surrounding them may be  forced to close as development encroaches" because the increasing population  would put the airports in violation of state law, Deukmejian said in vetoing  the exemption bill.  </P> <P> The governor said he does not believe "that the county should be completely  exempted from provisions of this act, which will assist in preserving necessary  airport facilities."  </P> <P> The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in  1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement  for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an  outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities, which complained that their  planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county.  </P> <P> The exemption proposal was introduced by state Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Manhattan  Beach), who earlier this year successfully pushed through legislation to give  Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But Deukmejian  said he would not allow the law to be eased any more.  </P> <P> Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of  the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the exemption proposal will be  revived next year.  </P> <P> Leland described the current law as "so vague, so general, it doesn't tell you  what you are supposed to do."  </P> <P> Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional  Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency,  does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around  airports. Other opponents say that most airports in Los Angeles County already  are surrounded by development.  </P> <P> But Ann Blue, a lobbyist for the city of Los Angeles, said the governor's  action means "that the county will have to take on the responsibility of doing  land-use plans around airports." She said the city opposed the Beverly bill  because in many cases, including Palmdale, residential development already is  coming too close to airports and preventive action is needed soon.  </P> <P> One source familiar with the legislation predicted that Los Angeles County  cities, worried that the county will begin to control local zoning decisions  around airports, will go to court to challenge the constitutionality of the  current law and regain power over airport planning for itself.  </P></p>

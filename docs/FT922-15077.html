			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Factory orders rise in US NEW ORDERS for manufactured goods in the US rose by 0.5 per cent in February to register their second consecutive monthly increase, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Shipments of goods were up 2.1 per cent - the 10th increase in the past 11 months. Inventories - stocks of unsold goods - fell for the fifth month, dropping to their lowest level for three years. This suggested that companies will have to increase production so as to meet rising demand. The rise in orders followed a 0.5 per cent increase in January and a 3.7 per cent decline in December. Orders in February were 0.2 per cent higher than in the equivalent month last year. Orders for durable goods, however, fell 0.3 per cent in February, compared with January. Excluding defence, new orders were up by 1 per cent. The orders figures were seen as broadly consistent with a batch of reports pointing to a revival of consumer and business demand since Christmas.</p>

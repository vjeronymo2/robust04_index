			<p>S                              U M  M A RY      The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), which won an absolute  majority in the May parliamentary election, is facing major  internal conflicts over economic reform between the party's  liberal wing and representatives of the powerful Hungarian trade  union organization.                              END SUMMARY      Although the MSZP, the successor of the communist party's  reformist wing, condemns the outgoing right-of-center governing  coalition--led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)--as inept  and misguided, it emphasizes that the new government will not  depart from the MDF's basic goals of creating a market economy  and seeking integration with Western Europe.  Saying that it is  "difficult to understand" why his communist past should make  anyone doubt his "conversion" to reformist economic views, Gyula  Horn, the MSZP's chairman and its nominee for prime minister,  declared "firmly" after the election in the French daily Le  Figaro (2 June) that the MSZP's "intention" is "to set up a  market economy."  Similarly, MSZP deputy chairman Imre Szekeres  has stressed that the law on privatizing state property "must be  implemented" and that his party views privatization as a "means  for attracting capital, creating employment, and renewing  technology" (Hungarian Television, 24 May).      Social Market Economy    The MSZP's acceptance of market forces  is qualified, however.  Not a simple market economy, but a  "social market economy' is the MSZP's goal, Horn has said  repeatedly (Kossuth Radio Budapest, 16 May; Hungarian Television,  25 May; MTI, 30 May).  The qualification "social"--which the  outgoing MDF government also used at the beginning of its tenure,  and then dropped--highlights the MSZP's commitment to cushioning  the social impact of economic reform.  Providing such a cushion  will require considerable government intervention through an  "overall government program," whose "goal," Horn emphasized in an  interview to the trade union daily Nepszava (24 May), will be  "creating workplaces," since it is "not enough to stimulate the  enterprises" to create them.  Although he stressed that the MSZP  does not want "any kind of restoration, for example,  renationalization," Horn has suggested that his party will to  some extent resort to the centralized management of resources,  saying that social problems can be alleviated by a "much fairer  distribution system" (Kossuth Radio Budapest, 16 May).  Similarly, while repeatedly voicing a commitment to further  privatization, Horn has stressed that the process will be put  under parliamentary control in order to "prevent corruption" and  that his government will not "deliver Hungary to uncontrolled  commercialism" (Le Figaro, 2 June).      Conflicting Trends     Horn's apparent ambivalence toward  economic reform appears to reflect conflicting trends in his  party.  As an editorial in the daily Magyar Hirlap (2 June)  noted, a recent Hungarian Gallup poll indicated that a majority  of the MSZP's voters "do not like capitalism, are not in favor of  private property, and prefer a caring state," making it likely  that they will put pressure on MSZP deputies--70 percent of whom  won their seats in districts rather than through regional or  national party lists--to resist painful reforms.  Thus, the  party's reformist leaders are operating under constraints and  Horn is apparently heading for a centrist position, "balancing"  between the pro- and anti-reformers.  Each wing is led by a  prominent member of the MSZP leadership.      Bekesi's reform wing.  The MSZP's most prominent economic expert,  parliamentary deputy Laszlo Bekesi--considered a strong candidate  for finance minister--has unequivocally expressed support for  economic reform.  In contrast to Horn's call for a fairer  distribution system, Bekesi has criticized the outgoing  government precisely for having an economic policy that has been  "characterized" by excessive "distribution" since last year.  Instead of redistributing wealth, the government should  "concentrate on creating the prerequisites for income production"  even if it is "painful for the whole society," he insisted.  Banks must be privatized "as soon as possible" and the increase  in the budget deficit "must be stopped" by cutting 50 billion  forints ($500 million) from the supplementary budget right away,  Bekesi said (Figyelo, 19 May).  Social welfare benefits should be  based "on needs, rather than fairness," and benefits should  compensate for only half of the "4 or 5 percent reduction" in  real incomes and purchasing power that will result from reform,  he asserted (Nepszabadsag, 29 April).  Calling for a coalition  with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), Bekesi said  that he would "not accept a ministerial post in a one-party  government" because "if the MSZP governs on its own, it will have  to yield to powerful trade union demands," causing  "overdistribution" (Magyar Hirlap, 3 June).      Nagy's trade union wing.  While National Federation of Hungarian  Trade Unions chairman Sandor Nagy has nominally accepted the  MSZP's economic program, which is a modified version of Bekesi's  plan, he clearly opposes radical reform.  Nagy--who was second on  the MSZP's national election list, after Horn and just before  Bekesi--stresses that he has not given a "blank check to the  future government" and that implementation of the economic  program must "naturally" be linked to employment and welfare  measures remedying "the most serious social problems."  Directly  contradicting Bekesi's view that only half of the reduction in  real incomes should be made up through benefits, Nagy demanded  "full compensation."  Moreover, indicating that he is against  letting market forces dictate privatization and employment, Nagy  insisted that buyers who "guarantee an employment level" should  be given "preference" and that trade union representatives should  be "present at privatization decisions" (Figyelo, 19 May).  Although he has given lukewarm approval to an MSZP-SZDSZ  coalition and to Bekesi's participation in the government  (Nepszabadsag, 2 June), Nagy has stressed that it will "lead to  many senseless conflicts" between the government and trade unions  if the SZDSZ's liberal economic program--which is close to  Bekesi's views--is implemented (Nepszava, 27 May).     Foreign Trade     In contrast to the disagreement on domestic  economic policy, there appears to be wide agreement in the MSZP  that the new government must abandon the outgoing government's  policy of focusing almost entirely on Western markets.  Since the  Western markets available to Hungary are "rather limited," Horn  stressed after the election, the market for its agricultural and  food industry products must "primarily be Eastern Europe," even  if it means creating "barter trade, product for product."  Although this is "not the most modern form" of trade, Horn  conceded, Hungary must resort to it since "we have to stay alive,  and what is more, we have to progress."  This turn toward the  East "does not mean weakening Hungary's relations with the  Western countries in the least," Horn insisted (Kossuth Radio  Budapest, 30 May).  Apparently in full agreement on this point  with Horn--and presumably with Nagy, who is unlikely to oppose  any trade that would increase employment--Bekesi has stressed  that a "return to the Eastern Markets is unavoidable" and that  Hungary must "exploit barter possibilities" in the region  (Figyelo, 19 May).      Implications     Although Horn has displayed considerable  ambivalence toward specific aspects of domestic economic reform,  his desire to bring the SZDSZ into the government--which would  greatly strengthen the MSZP's "liberals," who, according to him,  are a "negligible minority" in the party (Nepszava, 24 May)-  -indicates that he considers at least some aspects of reform to  be necessary and is therefore trying to counterbalance the  powerful anti-reform elements represented by the trade unions.  If the SZDSZ joins the government and Bekesi becomes finance  minister, it is highly likely that there will be bitter struggles  within the coalition--and within the MSZP itself--between  reformers who are willing to risk considerable social  dissatisfaction for long-term economic gains and anti-reformers  such as Sandor Nagy, who are concerned mainly with meeting the  immediate social and economic needs of their constituents.  It  remains to be seen whether Horn will be able to strike a balance  between the two trends, maintaining a centrist position.   (AUTHOR: BARCZAY.

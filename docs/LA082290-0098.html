			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH FIRE CREWS: BAD BOYS TURN HEROES  </P> <P> Wade Hamel gives chain saws to teen-age criminals.  </P> <P> And he's proud of it.  </P> <P> Hamel, director of Camp Joseph M. Paige in La Verne, puts young felons and  hard-core gang members to work clearing brush to aid Los Angeles County  firefighters.  </P> <P> The camp, one of two associated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, is  home to 116 boys ages 16 to 18, most of whom have been convicted of serious  crimes -- just about everything short of murder.  </P> <P> This summer and fall, with the drought pushing the danger of fire to a critical  point, youths from Camp Paige and from Camp Louis Routh, in Tujunga, are on  alert 24 hours a day to fight fires all over Los Angeles County. They work side  by side with firefighters and adult prison inmates, performing the backbreaking  job of clearing tinder-dry brush out of the path of the flames.  </P> <P> "The community feels very angry at juveniles when they hear of them committing  crimes," Hamel said. "But when we take these boys out to do fire suppression,  the community looks on them as heroes. Probably this is the first time in their  lives they've had the opportunity to be looked up to for something real they've  done."  </P> <P> The firefighting experience also has been known to spark a little attitude  adjustment on the part of the boys.  </P> <P> County firefighter Joe Alvarado tells the story of driving his red crew truck  out to the scene of a brush fire in Webb Canyon in June and seeing a sight he  never expected.  </P> <P> As he prepared to face the leaping flames, thick black smoke and rain of ashes,  Alvarado glanced into the glass-enclosed passenger section of his truck and saw  nine juvenile delinquents huddled together in frightened prayer.  </P> <P> Some had not thought twice before of wielding weapons, stealing cars or  invading private homes. Now, stripped of their macho veneer by the heat of the  flames, these former property-destroyers were protecting the possessions of  others.  </P> <P> Authorities allowed interviews with some of the youthful firefighters on the  condition that their last names not be used.  </P> <P> One of them, David M., a 17-year-old who landed at Camp Paige after he was  caught burglarizing cars and ditching school, worked on the fire lines for 12  hours during the June 28 Webb Canyon fire.  </P> <P> "It's very exhausting," David said. "But it gets your adrenaline going. The day  moves by quick."  </P> <P> The boys used chain saws, rakes and hoes to slash through the yucca plants,  manzanita bushes and poison oak plants that fuel a fire. The dirt paths, or  fire lines, act as breaks to stop a blaze from spreading.  </P> <P> Because they are minors, the boys cannot normally work more than eight hours at  a stretch, but in emergencies they are called on to work 12 hours a day.  </P> <P> They continued cutting back chaparral into the night, and the flames gradually  receded and the sparks died down. "We give them a lot of responsibility and  they kind of rise to the occasion," Alvarado said. "There's really no other  choice in a fire situation."  </P> <P> As the night turned into morning, a nearby homeowner came out to survey the  damage and express thanks that his home had been saved.  </P> <P> "Once they saw a grateful family there, they were the proudest, happiest kids  alive," Alvarado said.  </P> <P> But along the way the youthful offenders faced real danger.  </P> <P> During a fire in late June, a 23-year-old inmate from the Bautista Conservation  Camp in Hemet was killed when a 17-member fire crew was overrun by flames.  Victor Ferrera was serving time for armed robbery.  </P> <P> Four youths and their fire captain were killed during a Puente Hills fire in  September, 1955, probation officials said.  </P> <P> Hamel said there have been no serious incidents involving youths since then,  but he added that it is always hazardous on the fire lines, especially for the  youths who are specially trained to use chain saws to mow down large brush. All  of the boys wear protective gear, carry food, water and special fire tents, and  must pass 80 hours of rigorous physical and academic training before they are  placed on fire crews.  </P> <P> Hamel said that a selected group of the boys who have been evaluated according  to their previous criminal records, their histories of violence and their  personal suitability are assigned to operate the chain saws. "After they've  been in camp quite a few weeks, we know the boy and how he handles himself,  what kind of maturity level he has and what kind of impulse control he has,"  Hamel said.  </P> <P> In the three years he has been director of Camp Paige, there has not been a  violent incident involving the chain saws, or the other sharp, dangerous tools  the boys use in firefighting. But Hamel still worries about that possibility.  </P> <P> "I can't say that I'm not apprehensive about it. That's one thing that always  weighs on your mind. It's almost like I'm scared to mention it," he said.  </P> <P> He explained that the violence in a Camp Paige boys' records usually involves a  group crime, like a gang shooting. "Probably without that group participation,  these boys would not become involved in violence," Hamel said. "We don't have  boys here who are sick kids, whose sickness manifests itself in some kind of  personal violence."  </P> <P> Boys who are sent to Camp Paige must have parental permission to work on fire  crews. The average ward stays for about six months. During wet winters, they do  flood control duty.  </P> <P> According to records compiled between 1982 and 1984, about half of the boys  from probation camps were eventually convicted again of other crimes. There  have not been any more recent studies following up on boys who are involved in  the fire program, however.  </P> <P> "Considering what we start out with, that's pretty good," Hamel said. "Looking  at their records, you wouldn't give that many of them much hope to do well in  camp, let alone after they go home."  </P> <P> Although their records as juvenile offenders do not stop them from competing in  the job market once they are released, only a handful of boys who work on fire  crews in probation camps actually are hired by the county Fire Department,  Hamel said. Jobs are scarce, and the boys rarely do well enough on Civil  Service exams to compete with other applicants, he said.  </P> <P> On the morning after the Webb Canyon fire, when the boys returned to the  probation camp, they showered, ate and bunked down in their barracks-style  dormitory. But they did not sleep.  </P> <P> "I was hyper, so I didn't feel tired," David said. "It was very exhausting, but  I enjoyed the excitement and the experience."  </P> <P> "That crew was so wired they just couldn't fall asleep," Hamel said. "This is  the high they used to get from gang activity and from hurting people. I don't  know where they'll find it when they get home. But maybe here we've planted a  seed."  </P></p>

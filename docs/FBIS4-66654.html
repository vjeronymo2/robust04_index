			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akram Belaid: "Economic Elites </F> Embittered"--first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES  introduction]    [Text] The imminent accord between the IMF and the Algerian  Government is not going to ameliorate the plight of cadre and  heads of enterprises. The latter live in fear of terrorist  attacks against themselves or their businesses. And they feel  they are kept poorly informed about current economic conditions  in Algeria...    0930. Hamoudi Belatache, general manager of an EPE (economic  public [i.e., parastatal] enterprise[.sup]1[/] that  specializes in distribution, finishes reading the four major  local French-language dailies. "For some months now," he sighs,  "the only economic news I get comes from the newspapers." Most  public-sector industrial leaders are in the same boat. Political  uncertainty and questions about the future are making both  supervisory ministries and participation funds (similar to  boards of directors on which other EPEs hold seats) increasingly  tight-lipped. Many managers complain of being kept in the dark  about developments in the just-concluded negotiations with the  IMF (see LA TRIBUNE of 11 April 1994) and decisions coming in  the next few months about the restructuring of the Algerian  economy. "The metaphor of a ship captain battling the storm  alone is not too strong," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Today,  everyone knows things are going to change, but I can't even  allay the misgivings of my executives or other employees by  telling them what is going on. How can we talk about  `motivation' when the very survival of the enterprise as an  economic unit is in question?"    Two days before, three men armed with automatic rifles  appeared on the premises of the enterprise. A guard, seriously  wounded, managed to sound the alarm. Firemen responding to the  alarm were able to save a large part of the company vehicle  fleet from the fire the terrorists had set in an effort to  destroy it. The damage: a truck destroyed by fire, and the  departure of three guards whose families received threats the  day after the attack. The past year has seen an ever-increasing  incidence of arson, sabotage, and hold-ups targeting public  enterprises. Many industrialists say security has become a major  concern in their everyday lives. "I'm looking out first of all  after myself," one of them confides. "As manager of a public  enterprise, I am seen by the terrorists as an accomplice of the  state. We are under as much of a threat as journalists and  intellectuals. A friend pointed out to me the other day that the  fact I have a duty vehicle and driver could make them mistake me  for a government official--except that I don't get the same  close protection." So this manager no longer keeps regular hours  or arranges appointments over the telephone, trembles whenever  his secretary announces visitors, and compulsively calls the  office three times a night to make sure all is well. Despite all  the terrorist attacks, the Algerian Government does not seem to  be moving quickly to respond to industry's need for protection.  The much-publicized addition to the security forces of the first  graduating class of security agents is not enough to calm  employers' fears. "Arson destroyed part of our facilities,"  explains the manager of a furniture manufacturing company.  "We're still waiting for supplemental appropriations to install  effective systems." Installers of alarms, anti-intruder systems,  and remote surveillance equipment are overwhelmed by requests  for estimates, but firm orders are few and far between. "I  wonder sometimes if the state really knows what's going on,"  muses the manager of Secu-electro, a small PME [small or  medium-size enterprise] specializing in industrial security.  "Every day our technicians visit Algerian companies where it  would be child's play to gain entry and set a fire."  <H5>  Image Problems </H5>   So far, most public enterprises are doing well just to post  sentry teams composed of regular employees. "It would be  stretching the truth to say all workers feel personally  concerned about this," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Motivating them  by trying to tell them that because the enterprise is partly  theirs they owe it to themselves to protect it amounts to  reviving demagogic slogans of the socialist era that no one  wants to hear anymore."    Years of centralized, bureucratized management have also  tarnished the image of managers. Most blue-collar workers still  equate them with the nomenclatura of the old regime and believe  all their managers, with or without diplomas, are equally  incompetent. So it is difficult, at a time of rumors of massive  layoffs, to be candid with employees, especially since the  majority of them voted for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS].  Interior Minister Selim Saadi acknowledged recently that some  workers had been involved in setting fires at their own  enterprise, often under duress but sometimes on their own  initiative. Unthinking, vindictive actions... "As a general  rule, Algerian employees do not like management," says Hamid  Larbaoui, instructor at the Advanced Institute of Management and  Planning. "Under the circumstances, the heads of public  enterprises oscillate between authoritarian and paternalistic  approaches, both of which tend to engender hostility. The  contradictions are exacerbated, naturally, by the climate of  violence raging in our country, and the company's internal  cohesion is put to a rugged test."    Even while faced with the urgent need to cope with a  deteriorating security environment, public-sector enterprise  managers must try to keep up production levels. The growing  scarcity of foreign exchange and drastic reductions in raw  materials imports have caused industrial production levels to  plummet to less than 50 percent of capacity. "The situation is  almost catastrophic," says the manager of a garment factory. "We  produce little, and what is worse, we sell little." It is easy  to see why. The crushing weight of external debt, which leaves  nothing left for investment, is one of the prime villains. Also  cited repeatedly is unfair competition from the black market,  which imports the finest quality Western products from Tunisia  and Morocco on a massive scale. But few managers questioned  admit the need to completely rethink their production options  and the way their company is organized, even though  restructuring is the order of the day. Last autumn, a report  prepared by experts underlined the necessity of rethinking  Algeria's development model. The entities most directly  affected, public enterprises, are marking time, waiting for  their fate to be decided, while local experts entertain serious  doubts about the ability of managers now in place to implement  the coming reforms.    "The majority of public enterprises have been audited by  international research consultancies," explains an official in  the Ministry of Industry and Mines. "We have concrete solutions  that will make the EPEs the spearhead of economic activity. What  we do not know, though, is whether the public-sector enterprise  managers are going to work with us." The latter say they are  ready to adapt to the market economy. "I hope at last I will  have the chance to do what I am professionally trained to do,"  says the manager of an enterprise that manufactures industrial  machinery. "We have never had the means to be managers. The  enterprise was always subject to outside influences.  Interventions by the minister or politicians were and still are  pervasive in every domain. If I issue a call for tenders, I know  the choice of foreign supplier will not be ours. If I start  hiring, I will have a dozen applicants forced on me, and if I  decide to fire an insubordinate executive, I will come under  pressure from every direction to rehire him." Educated at elite  institutions, dispatched frequently on "overseas missions,"  Algerian managers dream of being able to put into practice the  expertise that local exigencies have always relegated to the  backburner. "In the meantime, we content ourselves with managing  day-to-day activity," Belatache confesses. "That means signing  documents put in front of me and receiving the occasional  Western commercial representative stationed in Spain, analyzing  for the nth time our plans--temporarily on hold--for a  partnership with some Italian firm."    Optimistic in spite of all obstacles, public-sector  employers  hope the successful IMF negotiations will presage a long-awaited  break with 30 years of statist economics. That question is on  everyone's lips, even though many local officials are predicting  that the Algerian state will do everything possible to  "rehabilitate" the EPEs. "Many employers are uncomfortable about  seeing their enterprise privatized," admits a member of the  national union of public entrepreneurs [UNEP]. "Some, naturally,  are afraid of losing their job, but a fair number simply  mistrust private entrepreneurs, whom they judge very harshly."    Long marginalized, the private sector is gradually coming  out  of the shadows. Employer associations have become indispensable  partners in the social dialogue, while large financial groups  have been put together to prepare for the opening of the  economy. But few Algerians believe private-sector industrialists  will be able to play a dynamic role. Redha Hamiami, himself both  an entrepreneur and minister for small and medium-size  enterprises, admitted recently that the private sector did not  have CEOs able to become competitive managers in the global  marketplace. In the end, the minister says, it will be necessary  to call on managerial skills of foreigners and encourage  public-sector managers to start up their own enterprises. "We're  just like the public sector," shrewdly observes one official in  the Algerian Employers Confederation. "It is true we have never  had the benefits that were showered on the EPEs, but most of us  still depended on state-imposed protectionism for profitability.  Decontrol of foreign trade is going to cut a wide swath of  destruction. At present, and with very few exceptions, our  manufactures aren't competitive--even within the Maghreb."  <H5>  Battle for Finance </H5>   Little by little, a new breed of employer is emerging. The  majority are young, most have attended an Algerian university,  and they have decided to create their own business rather than  join the swollen ranks of executives in the state-owned  companies. "I don't have anything to do with the branch of the  private sector that has grown fat under the protection of state  monopolies," claims Azzedine Fares, who heads a printing house  in the suburbs of Algiers. "Being a young private-sector  entrepreneur in Algeria is a constant struggle." There's no lack  of battles, and the biggest is the battle to obtain financing to  support production. Azzedine must constantly "chase after  black-market foreign exchange." The French franc is worth 13  dinars on the parallel market, while the official rate is 4:1.  "The private operators that meet at the big hotels in the  capital and owe their fortunes to the largess of the system  under Boumediene and Chadli are not having problems. They know  where to get lines of credit, and they jealously guard that sort  of information," says Azzedine, who hopes to form an association  of private entrepreneurs. (If established, it would be the fifth  of its kind, as Algerian entrepreneurs are incapable of  unifying.)    The only thing that unites the private operators are the  "shakedowns" that victimize them all. Karim Zerrouki, who heads  a construction company, is among those who has "paid." On the  order of a hundred million centimes, in a series of small  installments, and there is absolutely no way he can afford to  report it to the police. The scenario is almost always the same.  First comes a letter telling the private-sector CEO "to prepare  to contribute to the war effort." Next comes a telephone call  setting forth the amount to be paid, and finally an impromptu  visit by several young men, always elegantly dressed, to pick up  the cash. Sometimes, what is even more terrifying, a letter is  delivered in the name of the Armed Islamic Group or the Armed  Islamic Movement. "There is nothing to be done about it," says  Karim Zerrouki. "Even private-sector industrialists who are tied  in with politicians opposed to the Islamists have paid. You have  to budget for shakedowns the same way you make provision for  possible losses on currency exchange, the erratic tax regime,  and inflation in the price of foreign currency on the black  market."    In all these tribulations, it is the managers of the local  public enterprises (EPLs) that suffer most. These small  state-owned PMEs, mostly operating in the red, may end up being  sold on the auction block to the highest bidder--a scheme that  the government of Redha Malek, which resigned yesterday, refused  to give up despite protests from the unions, though it did agree  to postpone implementation until after the forthcoming  devaluation of the Algerian dinar. "It has now been more than  six months since our workers have been paid," explains the  manager of one EPL. "The banks do not want to hear about it, and  the government, after an initial effort at financial reform,  announced a year ago it was going to sell the EPLs. The workers  are frustrated, hanging on to the hope the enterprise will be  bought by a rich private investor with deep pockets." This  embittered manager, who hopes to find a position in an EPE,  notes nothing is being done to prepare public-sector managers  like himself for the change. Many EPL managers are trying to  create an association to lobby against systematic privatization  of the local enterprises. "The state has never listened to the  voices of public-sector enterprise managers," regrets one member  of UNEP, "and it is greatly to be feared that the liberalization  under way will blow us away like straw in the wind."  <H5>  Brain Drain </H5>   Engineers, architects, doctors, young graduates, and  experienced managers are leaving Algeria in ever larger numbers.  In the last few months, the trickle has grown to a veritable  hemorrhage. "I'm getting out so my daughter can get decent  schooling," said Kader, a department head at Algiers effort, the  other day. The slow decay of security conditions and the very  real fear of a sudden slide into civil war are spurring many of  the Algerian elite to emigrate. Morocco and Tunisia are the most  popular destinations, far ahead of France. "Mr. Pasqua can  relax," quips Hadi Moncef, head of an agrofood enterprise.  "Algerians with diplomas or money know it will be 10 times as  easy to relocate in the Maghreb as in France, to which it is  almost impossible even to get a simple tourist visa!"    Many private-sector entrepreneurs have resettled in Tunisia,  especially in the Zarzis free zone or in the Tunis suburbs. No  visa or work permit is required, and Algerians there are  standing in line for jobs, mostly managers from the public  sector who decided they have had enough. "Setting up a company  is much easier in Tunisia than in Algeria," gloats an  entrepreneur in the construction field who liquidated all his  assets soon after the failure of the national dialogue  conference. "And I can hire Algerian cadres who would never have  agreed to work for me in Algeria."    By contrast, relatively few entrepreneurs have installed  themselves in Morocco, though the latter attracts a goodly  number of Algerians with graduate degrees and former  public-sector managers. "Morocco and Tunisia will reap the  benefits of Algeria's education policy," drily notes an official  in Algeria's Education Ministry. According to a recent study  made by a private consultancy for a Western client, two out of  three white-collar Algerians are considering leaving Algeria  before the end of the year.    The prospect disturbs both political decisionmakers and  employers, confirms Ould-Khallef Farid, a member of the Algerian  Employers Confederation. "The departures will be bad for the  economy here. Liberalization of external trade and future  privatizations will create a large demand for expertise and  professional experience that is going to be difficult to meet."  Many specialists note too that, in contrast to the trend in the  1980's when numerous students on scholarships defected overseas,  it is experienced cadres that are leaving now.    Not even the flagships of Algerian industry have been  spared.  Thus training program officials at Sonatrach [National Company  for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], a state-owned  oil company that has been largely immune from austerity, admit  they now think long and hard before sending cadres to training  programs overseas. "Any training abroad will improve their  resume," admits one computer engineer who hopes to be able to  emigrate legally to Canada.    "We talk a lot about the flight of the intellectuals,"  concludes a functionary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs,  "but the emigration of employers, managers, and white-collar  employees is more serious, even if less publicized."   <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-024-14A>      Algerian Economy: Industrial </FIG>  <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-024-15A>      Flight of Educated Cadres: </FIG>   Footnote    [.sup]1.[/] There are two types of public-sector  enterprises in Algeria. Economic public enterprises, EPEs, are  an outgrowth of the restructuring of big state-owned companies  in the early 1980's. The local public enterprises, EPLs, are  smaller--rather like public-sector PMEs--and they are owned or  controlled at the local government level.</p>

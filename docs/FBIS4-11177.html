			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F> the "Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"]    [Text] A promise is a promise, so we will continue to talk  about the men who will make up Zedillo's team. Yesterday we  commented on the members of his team who are associates of  Salinas and Zedillo. At this time we will discuss the  associates of Zedillo and Colosio, the so-called "Orphans of the  Tijuana Tragedy."    First, however, we must make a clarification. The existence  of such a group should surprise no one because Colosio and  Zedillo worked together. They were not rivals. If the new  candidate had been Camacho (who was assassinated with Colosio,  only politically), the story would have been different. In  addition, let us keep in mind that Zedillo, in his 29 March  speech accepting the candidacy, mentioned Colosio some 30 times.  Throughout, his speech carried a message of continuity.    Enter Sonora-born Manlio Fabio Beltrones, another of  Zedillo's men. By reason of his birthplace and political  inclination, Beltrones hitched his carriage to that of his  countryman, Colosio, to the extent that he, Beltrones, appointed  Colosio's father in his state cabinet. Perhaps for his  relationship with Colosio, Cordoba selected Beltrones to present  Zedillo as the new candidate. It was said at a dinner that  Zedillo and Beltrones presented a united front against the  followers of Colosio who had proposed Lievano Saenz to be the  coordinator of Zedillo's campaign.    Zedillo's list includes Mario Luis Fuentes, the strongest  link between Colosio and Zedillo, and Victor Manuel Palma Cesar,  Zedillo's deputy coordinator for Colosio's campaign and who is  believed to be appointed senator for the State of Morelos.    Guillermo Hopkins Gamez was born in Magdalena de Kino,  Sonora. Politically speaking, he was very, very close to  Colosio. Hopkins holds a degree in political science from the  Ibero-American University and a master's degree in public  administration from the University of Colorado. He held the  position of adviser to the Chief Clerk from 1987 to 1988 and  worked in the planning and budget areas in the Sonora State  Government. He was deputy logistics coordinator for the PRI  campaign under coordinator Zedillo. It has been said he stands a  good chance of becoming senator for Sonora and even governor of  the state.    Another of Zedillo's men and Colosio's associates is Andres  Marco Antonio Bernal Gutierrez, also Tamaulipas-born, who was  president of the SEDESOL [Social Development Secretariat]  National Solidarity Institute during 1992 and 1993 under Colosio  and deputy planning coordinator for the PRI campaign under  Zedillo.    As for Lievano Saenz, we know that prior to the campaign, he  held the post of chief clerk at SEDESOL and that he was social  communications spokesman for the PRI presidential campaign. He  could become senator for Chihuahua in the future.    Nevertheless, it has been said that, among Colosio's  friends,  Esteban Moctezuma Barragan is one of the men closest to Zedillo.  He holds a degree in law and economics from National Autonomous  University of Mexico, a master's degree in political economy  from Cambridge University, and a degree in regional development,  which he obtained in Japan. In addition, Moctezuma Barragan  started out at the Planning and Budget Secretariat [SPP], in the  area managed by Colosio, held the post of chief clerk at SPP  under Zedillo, and was Colosio's private secretary when Colosio  was head of the PRI National Executive Council. He was also  Deputy Secretary for Educational Planning at the Public  Education Secretariat. Of all the men mentioned, he is closest  to Zedillo. For this reason, it is believed that he will be  appointed for a very important position.    We can say that Colosio's associates and Zedillo's  associates  can well be taken for one another because their political  inclinations and ideologies, not only are compatible, but nearly  parallel. All of them are birds of a feather. All of them are  young, educated, hold master's and doctor's degrees obtained  abroad, and have been following a steady political course.    By reason of mutual friendship, this group also includes  Carlos Rojas, former SPP deputy secretary under Zedillo and in  charge of the National Solidarity Program, as well as Francisco  Labastida Ochoa, former governor of Sinaloa. Let us keep in mind  that all of these people will appear in the country's political  horizon for the next six-year term if Zedillo is elected  president.</p>

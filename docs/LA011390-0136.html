			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WESTERN RUNS, GUNS BUT STILL STRUGGLES TO DEFEAT SAVANNA  </P> <P> Western High School created plenty of mayhem Friday night.  </P> <P> The Pioneers played at the fast tempo they desired. It was very fast.  </P> <P> That's not to say the style was always successful. In fact, the Pioneers caused  plenty of problems for themselves.  </P> <P> But Western did enough things right to defeat Savanna, 69-57, in an Orange  League game at Savanna. The victory left the Pioneers in a first-place tie with  Brea-Olinda, at least until Wednesday, when the two teams play.  </P> <P> Pioneer Coach Greg Hoffman hopes his team will be a little more consistent by  then.  </P> <P> "I'm tired of setting up a game plan and then see it wasted because we make  mistakes," Hoffman said. "We haven't been able to sustain anything all year."  </P> <P> Hoffman's point was well taken on Friday.  </P> <P> The Pioneers played well at times, but also nearly blew leads of 13, 16, 15 and  12 points.  </P> <P> Western (11-4 overall, 3-0 in league play) started strong. The Pioneers pressed  and ran and ran and pressed, which had the Rebels reeling.  </P> <P> Savanna committed four turnovers in the first two minutes and had difficulty  getting into its offense.  </P> <P> After three minutes, the Pioneers led, 12-3, and the Rebels had yet to make a  shot from the field. The lead swelled to 36-20 late in the second quarter.  </P> <P> However, at times the Pioneers appeared to get ahead of themselves in trying to  create the up-tempo pace. They had 13 turnovers in the first half and 22 for  the game.  </P> <P> Still, Western appeared to things well in hand at halftime. The Pioneers led,  37-23, thanks mostly to their 60% shooting from the field.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to put anybody away all season," Hoffman said.  </P> <P> True to form, the Pioneers gave the Rebels the opportunity to get back into the  game. Trailing, 44-29, midway through the third quarter, Savanna went on a 16-6  run to pull within, 50-45, going into the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Center Eric Preuss sparked the run as he scored all seven of his points in the  third quarter. Ben Smith also scored seven points in the quarter and finished  with a team-high 16.  </P> <P> "You have to give Savanna credit," Hoffman said. "A lot of teams would have  collapsed after getting behind by that many points early in the game. But they  hung in there and kept coming back."  </P> <P> Western, led by Sam Sabbara, opened a 59-47 lead. Sabbara, finished with 16  points, scored nine in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The Rebels scored seven consecutive points to cut the deficit to five, 59-54.  </P> <P> What saved the Pioneers was free throws. They made nine of 16 in the fourth  quarter and 24 of 36 for the game.  </P> <P> Robbie Shelton was 15 of 21 from the foul line and finished with 31 points.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda 52, Valencia 48 -- Keith Walker had 20 points and Rodney Stewart  had 11 to lead Brea-Olinda (14-3, 2-0). Richard Tibbie had 18 points for  Valencia (6-11, 0-2).  </P> <P> Anaheim 68, Magnolia 63 -- Guards Danny Castro and Greg Cole each had 20 points  to lead host Anaheim (7-8, 1-1). Wayne Thomas had 18 points to lead Magnolia  (5-9, 0-2).  </P></p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Belgium bound The Channel tunnel's formal opening earlier this month, provoked much discussion abut the future of travel between the UK and France, writes Mike Skapinker. A less-widely noted consequence of the tunnel's opening was that there will be rail services between London and Brussels. A monthly guide to all air and sea crossings and fares between the UK and Belgium is now on sale for an annual subscription of Pounds 44.50. Rail services will be included as they become available. The guide is available from Cross Channel, PO Box 347, London WC2A 1QD.</p>

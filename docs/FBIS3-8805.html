			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A visit to Poland by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin in May; a protocol on this year's  cooperation in two weeks' time; the completion of work on a  long-term agreement on economic cooperation in May--these are  the results of Polish-Russian talks that ended in Moscow.  Correspondent Viktor Siezieniewski reports:    [Siezieniewski] Waldemar Pawlak and Viktor Chernomyrdin's  talks lasted longer than scheduled. As both underscored later,  it had been a very concrete dialogue of partners interested in  breaking the impasse in economic relations. The heads of  government did not conceal their satisfaction at the course of  the negotiations. I asked Waldemar Pawlak for details.    [Begin recording] [Pawlak] We focussed on actions that could  bring quick and measurable advantages. Among the long-term  actions, it is worth mentioning the prospects for signing a  long-term agreement on economic cooperation. It might yield a  protocol of agreements for 1994 even this year [as heard],  including financial solutions for servicing our cooperation.    In the more distant future, there are solutions that,  through  the activities of our governments, can contribute to the  expansion of cooperation between specific enterprises and  people, from cooperation in banking and finance, through the  building of the infrastructure of transport, railways, highways,  and communications, to cooperation concerning strategic raw  materials, including the construction of a pipeline for  transporting Russian gas to Western Europe. These are the big  ventures on which the activities of the governments are to focus  in order to create conditions for meetings and contacts at all  levels. This would be the practical implementation of our idea,  put forward at the beginning of this year, for the partnership  for development and multidirectional foreign policy.    [Siezieniewski] Did you find a partner in Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin?    [Pawlak] Yes. We have already decided on a concrete working  schedule for particular ministries aimed at reaching practical  decisions that will contribute to the expansion of cooperation.  We both agreed that the time wasted could not be made up in the  future.    [Siezieniewski] When will the next meeting be held?    [Pawlak] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will visit Poland in  May. Then we will take further steps to make our cooperation at  all levels easier. [end recording]</p>

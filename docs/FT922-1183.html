			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: ERM debate in need of a proper airing Sir, Martin Wolf's timely rejoinder on the poor performance of nominal domestic demand over the past five years ('Destabilising effects of exchange rate stabilisation', June 22) is a welcome contribution on the ERM debate. As Mr Wolf notes, not only did Mr Nigel Lawson's misplaced enthusiasm for quasi-international monetarism impair the excellent inflation performance of the early 1980s, but it again highlighted the potential Dies Irae for pegged exchange rate systems. Although the debate has supposedly moved on from the late-1980s and we are now 'irrevocably' committed to the ERM, it would be foolish not to question this pledge while the recovery remains sluggish. What is the point of a policy framework which offers the promised elixir of low inflation, while exacting the price of rising unemployment and poor growth? Perhaps it is not so much the monetarists who are crying out for a return to the past, but disgruntled economists from the 'golden age' haggling after some form of parity fixing in a system which is fundamentally flawed. Until the government gives a proper airing to this stultified debate (preferably via a Treasury select committee), the reluctance to consider any alternative exchange regimes will condemn the UK economy to an anaemic monetary policy with persistent low rates of growth.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Rimpac Joint Manoeuvres" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- If the United States,  Japan and the South Korean puppets continue aggravating the  situation by such military exercises as Rimpac, they will invite  a bitterer condemnation as wreckers of stability and peace in  the Asia-Pacific region, warns NODONG SINMUN in a commentary  today.    In the manoeuvres due from the end of May to the end of June  in the Pacific, United States intends to tie Japan and the South  Korean puppets tighter to its war chariot and use them for  attaining its dominationist aim, the analyst says, and goes on:    It must not go unnoticed that the timetable of the  manoeuvres  was announced at a time when the United States, Japan and the  South Korean puppets were bringing the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain over the "nuclear  issue" of the DPRK.    The United States is now beefing up its forces in South  Korea, crying for "military counteraction" against the DPRK,  Japan is intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, calling for the  enactment of "a law on the case of emergency" on the Korean  peninsula and the South Korean puppets are seeking military  adventures after making public what they call "new operational  plan".    It is a logical conclusion that the Rimpac joint military  exercises projected by the United States, Japan and South Korea  will be targeted against the DPRK.    The manoeuvres will result in a more strained situation in  the Asia-Pacific region. Trying to frighten our republic with  the demonstration of force is a dream of an idiot.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 16 (AFP) -- Northern troops loyal to  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Monday [16 May] were  pushing forward to capture the southern oil province of Shabwah,  a northern spokesman in Sanaa said.    The northern forces are also on the move on three other  fronts to blockade Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's stronghold  of the southern port-city of Aden, and force him and his  followers to surrender.    Northern ground forces, including tanks and heavy artillery,  were trying to reach Aden in an pincer movement from the north,  along the Sanaa-Aden road, Zanjibar to the west, and Abyan to  the east.    The spokesman said the fighting in Shabwah, 300 kilometers  (180 miles) northeast of Aden, is centered on northern attempts  to capture the main city of 'Ataq, and another town, Bayhan.    Al-Bid's forces are using extensive air power to check the  advancing troops, including firing long range Scud missiles, the  spokesman added.    A defeat for the southerners in Shabwah would deprive them  of  Massila oil field revenues, set at 170,000 barrels per day.  Massila's output is shipped by pipeline to the southern port of  Mukalla.    It would mean that all of Yemen's oil resources would be in  the hands of Salih, since his troops already control the other  key oil province of Ma'arib, 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of  Sanaa. It produces 140,000 barrels per day.    Elsewhere, the northern forces are trying to clear the way  to  the southern Al-Anad air base, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of  Aden, defended by more than 20,000 soldiers and militiamen.    A southern military commander on Sunday said the northern  troops were spotted 30 kilometres (18 miles) away from the base.    In Abyan, 55 kilometers (33 miles) east of Aden, the  northern  crack brigade al-'Amaliqah was trying to capture the heights  surrounding Aden.    The brigade commander, Colonel 'Ali al-Jayfi, said his  forces  were between 15 and 20 kilometers (nine and 13 miles) from the  southern port.    The northern forces are also trying to drive their rivals  from the coastal road linking Aden to Kharaz, to the west.    Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad al-Basindwah, who is loyal  to the president, said that the northern forces want to blockade  Aden to force the surrender of al-Bid and his followers, but not  to take the city, in order to "save lives and facilities."    The southerners made a new ceasefire offer on Sunday,  proposing a national unity government.    The northern leadership has demanded that the southerners  surrender before halting fighting, which began almost two weeks  ago.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIOIOSA LINKS ROSE TO SECOND PIK SIX WINNER  </P> <P> Thomas Gioiosa today implicated Pete Rose in another race track gambling scheme  during his drug and tax-evasion trial, giving federal prosecutors more evidence  in their investigation of the former Cincinnati Reds manager.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination, Gioiosa said that he had cashed a second Pik Six  ticket for Rose and claimed all the winnings on his taxes. Rose now has been  linked to two Pik Six payoffs during Gioiosa's trial.  </P> <P> Rose is under investigation by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati looking into  whether he hid income from gambling, memorabilia sales and autograph  appearances.  </P> <P> Gioiosa, who lived with Rose from 1979 to 1984, had refused to discuss his  gambling associations with Rose before his trial in U.S. District Court.  </P> <P> However, he told to a 12-member jury today that he cashed a winning $6,351 Pik  Six ticket from Turfway Park in northern Kentucky for Rose in December, 1986.  Gioiosa later reported the full amount on his taxes, even though he said he  gave the money to Rose and got back only a part of the winnings.  </P> <P> A Pik Six pays off when a bettor correctly chooses the winner of six  consecutive races.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Kathleen Brinkman asked Gioiosa who won the $6,356 Pik  Six.  </P> <P> "I was with Pete Rose. I went down and cashed it and gave him the money,"  Gioiosa said.  </P> <P> He said Rose then gave him a share of the winnings, but he wasn't sure how  much.  </P> <P> "I didn't count it," Gioiosa said.  </P> <P> When asked who bought the ticket, Gioiosa said, "I don't remember."  </P> <P> Gioiosa, 31, of New Bedford, Mass., is on trial on charges of conspiracy to  distribute cocaine and tax evasion. Gioiosa could be sentenced to up to 38  years in jail and fined $2 million if found guilty on all counts.  </P> <P> One of the tax evasion charges involves another Pik Six ticket from Turfway  Park -- this one a $47,646 payoff that Gioiosa claimed on his taxes but the  government contends actually belonged to Rose.  </P></p>

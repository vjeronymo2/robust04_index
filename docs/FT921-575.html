It is bringing forward its interim dividend of 1p per share from June to April 3. Mr Norman Bell, company secretary, said this reflected concern over the election and the board's wish that shareholders should receive their money in the current tax year. Further questions were referred to Mr Arnold Ziff, the company's chairman. Unfortunately Mr Ziff was not available for comment, but he has been more forthcoming in his other capacity as chairman and main shareholder of Stylo, the Bradford-based shoe retailer.

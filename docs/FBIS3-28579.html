			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppet foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, at "a meeting of heads of  embassies and legations abroad" on February 5 charged the North  again with the non-existent "nuclear problem" and cried for "a  stern measure" against the North, according to a radio report  from Seoul.    His bellicose remarks were a dangerous provocation bringing  the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.    When the process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula has been driven to a fatally blind alley  by the U.S. perfidious act, the South Korean puppet clique is  showing feverish activities to bar the third-stage talks between  the DPRK and the United States and touch off a nuclear war in  league with outside forces.    Han Sung-chu also paid a lip-service to "dialogue." But this  was nothing but a sophism for covering up the anti-national,  anti-peace and anti-reunification criminal acts of the puppet  clique which is driving the situation of the peninsula to the  brink of war.    Crying for "dialogue" while brandishing the sword is  virtually an insult to dialogue and its total negation.    The South Korean puppet clique is trying to isolate and  stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the help  of outside forces, clean indifferent to North-South dialogue.  This invariable intention of the puppets was made clearer when  Han Sung-chu stated that to take "a stern measure" was their  "consistent position."    The South Korean rulers must clearly look at the will and  resolution of our people and act with discretion. Their  reckless new war provocation moves will bring them to  destruction.    The puppet clique must unconditionally renounce the  anachronistic moves of North-South confrontation.</p>

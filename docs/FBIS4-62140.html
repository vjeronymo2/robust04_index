			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Navy Baltic Fleet Commander Vladimir Yegorov  failed to arrive in Estonia today in order to supervise Russian  troop withdrawal. The plane carrying Yegorov and a group of  officers was refused landing in the Amari airport which remains  in the disposition of the Russian Armed Forces.    Estonian Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Mari-Ann Rikken  told Interfax that the appropriate notification had been  transmitted by the Russian Embassy in Tallinn only two days  before. She underlined that the internationally accepted norms  demanded at least fifteen days for consideration. No  information on the officers accompanying Yegorov had been given.  Rikken said this had made impossible to authorize them to come  to Estonia.    However, Russian Military Attache in Estonia Anatoliy  Chizhikov told Interfax that Russia and Estonia had an agreement  giving five days for consideration of notifications on landing  of military jets, although such issues were as a rule resolved  within one or two days. Chizhikov pointed out that the Russian  Embassy had received no clarification on new terms for  consideration of such notifications and refused to comment on  the decision by the Estonian Foreign Ministry.</p>

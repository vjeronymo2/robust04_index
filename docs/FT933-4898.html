			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Bifu rails at Co-op Bank job cut plan BIFU, THE banking union, launched a campaign yesterday to embarrass the Co-operative Bank over the bank's plan to breach an agreement on a lack of compulsory redundancies, Robert Taylor writes. The bank plans to shed up to 100 managers and the union is sending postcards to union members who are customers of the bank calling on them to protest. The union believes the bank will dismiss clerical staff next year and it is considering industrial action if the bank does not change its position.</p>

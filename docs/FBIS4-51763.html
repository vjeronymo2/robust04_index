			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  has decided to reject -- firmly and unequivocally -- yet another  North Korean attempt to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement  with a peace treaty with the United States alone.    Cornered by a scheme of its own making (the Stalinist  state's  refusal to allow outside inspection of its nuclear facilities),  North Korea is obviously trying to muddy the issue and eliminate  Seoul as a player in the nuclear row.    Taking advantage of Washington's efforts to maintain the  global nuclear non-proliferation regime at any cost, Pyongyang  is trying to force the United States to pull its troops from  South Korea by linking the withdrawal with the nuclear question.  North Korea's attempts, which are not very difficult to fathom,  are of course unacceptable to Seoul.    Washington firmly rejected Pyongyang's overture after North  Korea, in a Foreign Ministry statement issued on April 28,  proposed negotiations between the two on concluding a peace  treaty.    Pyongyang followed up by serving notice that it would  withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Prior to  this, North Korea had refused to attend MAC meetings since March  1991 when South Korean Major General Hwang Won-tak was appointed  chief delegate of the United Nations forces. The North said it  would not recognize Hwang since the South was not a signatory to  the Armistice Agreement.    In short, Pyongyang wants to replace the Armistice Agreement  signed in 1953 between North Korea and China on one side and the  United Nations on the other with a U.S.-North Korean peace  treaty.    This is not the first time that North Korea has advanced the  idea of signing a peace pact with the United States.    Pyongyang made that overture to the United States  persistently before signing the basic accord on reconciliation,  non-aggression and exchanges with South Korea in 1992.    Outwardly, North Korea said a peace treaty was needed to  restore peace to the peninsula. South and North Korea are  technically still at war some 40 years after the conflict ended.  But Seoul refused to accept the North Korean proposal at face  value because its real intention was to force Washington to  withdraw its troops deployed in the South.    South and North Korea argued about problems related to the  need for a peace treaty until they signed the 1992 inter-Korean  basic accord. In the five-item supplementary agreement to the  inter-Korean accord on reconciliation, the two sides agreed to  faithfully implement the accord and the declaration for the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in order to transform  the state of war into that of a lasting peace.    It follows, therefore, that if North Korea wants to raise  the  problem of a peace treaty, it has to honor the inter-Korean  accord as well as the denuclearization declaration, the Seoul  government says.    The supplementary agreement also spells out that South and  North Korea will work out appropriate measures to change the  state of war into peace and that the two sides will honor the  Armistice Agreement until a firm peace is established.    Consequently, Seoul maintains that the recent attempt by  North Korea to conclude a peace treaty with the United States  obviously violates the inter-Korean basic accord.    South Korean ministries concerned with unification are said  to be coordinating their views on "a rather drastic" North  Korean attempt to sign a peace treaty with the United States,  one-sidedly ignoring the inter-Korean agreements.    So far, the Seoul government has viewed the North Korean  move  as undeserving of comment. But it was reported that Seoul was  still unable to adopt countermeasures to an apparent North  Korean violation of the armistice treaty.    "The government is currently analyzing North Korea's real  intention," said one senior official. "We plan to approach the  problem cautiously, taking into consideration all aspects of  inter- Korean relations including the nuclear question."    In other words, the Seoul government will firmly oppose the  North Korean move to conclude a peace treaty with the United  States while trying to find a solution to North Korea's  violation of the Armistice Agreement through dialogue.</p>

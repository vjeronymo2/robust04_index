			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councillors share credit for economies - An unusual accord in Berkshire's county council elections AN approach to council services more radical than that put forward by central government does not seem a likely way of taking the politics out of local politics: yet that is what Berkshire county council's policy of 'externalisation' has done so far in the county council elections. The largely non-partisan in-itiatives in Berkshire have enabled councillors of all parties to benefit by sharing the credit for making savings to provide extra money for services used by the public. From the late 1980s, the Tory administration kept a couple of steps ahead of the Department of the Environment's prescriptive regime for compulsory competitive tendering of blue- and white-collar services, by voluntarily letting out contracts before central government told it how to do it. When the Tories lost control to a non-Conservative consensus last May, that policy was continued. Earlier this month the coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors who together can beat the Tories by just one vote, announced that it was contracting out its finance services and that an employee buy-out backed by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, was the preferred contractor. In March the council awarded what it believes to be the largest contract ever from a local authority - worth more than Pounds 30m in fees - when the Babtie group, engineering consultants, took over the county's highways and planning services, along with over 300 of the department's 383 staff. Mr Tony Allen, Berkshire's chief executive, says a combination of factors led to the change. 'We've been under continuous budget pressure  - for four years we have been up against the capping limit, having to make big savings. The parties were open-minded on ways of putting money into frontline services.' Councillors of all persuasions emphasise the progress in reducing waste and improving the quality of services, by building up a relationship with a private sector partner company rather than by simply taking the lowest cash bid. Mr Gareth Gimblett, the leader of the Tory group, says that the process puts councillors in a better position to monitor services than when the authority is both purchaser and provider. 'There is far greater control of service delivery than when the council is delivering the service,' he argues. Mr Lawrence Silverman, the leader of the Labour group, sees the move as in line with the Labour leadership's relaxed attitude about the distinction between public and private sectors. Though there has been some grumbling from local government trade unions, he admits, they recognise that transferring to the private sector is preferable to losing jobs. The wide political consensus on the issue does not extend indefinitely, however. A re-formed Liberal Democrat and Labour administration would probably conclude the initiative had just about reached its limits. By contrast, a Tory-controlled Berkshire, would look at contracting out more direct services, such as some aspects of social services and libraries and cutting back further the education services still provided by Shire Hall. But for the present, the advantages of externalisation are so undisputed that it is an issue in the campaign only insofar that one or another party is accused of not pursuing it strongly enough.</p>

However,  the boom in foreign-funded enterprises has also given rise to  some problems that must never be treated lightly.    This article, based on a massive survey, reveals some  shocking facts which will give the reader much food for thought.  [end editor's note]    Foreign-funded enterprises have been emerging dramatically  on  China's horizon, giving an impetus to the economic development  and modernization of the country. However, the development  process is not always smooth. It is true that some  foreign-funded enterprises, especially medium and small ones  running processing businesses with supplied material, drawings,  and samples; assembling with supplied parts; and compensation  trade, have disregarded China's labor laws and ordinances, or  simply ignored workers' safety, wantonly infringing upon the  workers' legitimate rights and interests. As a result, many  serious cases have occurred. We can never turn a blind eye to  this phenomenon.  <H5>  Seriously Biased Employment Relationship </H5>   In June 1993, a letter of complaint signed by "37 workers at  Asia Woolen Knitwear Company Limited, Shenzhen," was sent to the  office of the Shenzhen City Labor Bureau's Employment Monitoring  Group. The letter complained about improper labor management of  the company and also raised five other issues. As one of the  five issues mentioned, the letter disclosed that "so far the  company has not signed any employment contracts with its  employees."    The labor contract is the legal document to confirm and  regulate the employment relationship between the enterprise and  the workers. Properly signing and implementing the employment  contract is the precondition and basis for maintaining  harmonious employment relations and safeguarding the legitimate  rights and interests of both the management and labor. However,  a curious but rather common practice among foreign-funded  enterprises, is that many employers do not sign contracts with  their employees. In Xiamen, over 90 percent of Taiwan-funded  enterprises and other enterprises wholly owned by foreign  investors have never signed employment contracts with their  workers. A general inspection of the implementation of the  "Labor Law" in Shenzhen City in 1992 showed that 19.5 percent of  the 280,000 staff and workers working in the 2,055 sampled  enterprises were employed without fulfilling any recruitment  formalities. The number of enterprises which have not signed  employment contracts with their workers respectively account for  70 and 90 percent of all the foreign-funded enterprises in the  Shantou Special Economic Zone [SEZ] and Zhuhai City respectively.    The absence of a binding employment contract has resulted in  a seriously biased employment relationship between  foreign-funded enterprise owners on the one hand and their staff  and workers on the other. An employee's behavior, whether it  has violated labor laws and ordinances or not, will be regarded  as wrong so long as the boss believes it is wrong. The worker's  only obligation is to work and he is entitled to no legitimate  rights. Some foreign-funded enterprises have even imposed  restrictions on their staff and workers' personal freedom. A  joint venture in Shanghai has made it a rule that no employee  can spend more than five minutes in the rest room per visit and  no one will use the rest room more than once each working day;  and no worker "is allowed to date any boy or girl within three  years after her or his employment by the company." A Taiwan  factory owner warned newly employed workers: This factory is  mine, so I am the boss. That means you have to do whatever I  tell you to do and you have to work as long as I tell you to  work. Whoever does not work conscientiously will be fired.  There are plenty of job seekers everywhere now and I can easily  hire as many workers as I want to....    A noteworthy phenomenon is that all the foreign-funded  enterprises which have failed to properly sign and implement  employment contracts are, without exception, very vigorously and  strictly enforcing the company discipline, rules, and  regulations which they have established on their own. Very  often they replace the contracts with their own company rules  and regulations. Their company rules and regulations even  contain articles which apparently run counter to the state's  current labor laws and ordinances and violate the workers'  rights and interests. As a result, the employment contract has  been rendered an "agreement" which merely safeguards the  management's rights and interests and gives the management all  the say. Last March, Zhuhai City Labor Bureau received a copy  of the "employee's letter of intent committing themselves to  abide by the factory regulations in Chengfa Garment Factory."  This self-contradictory document under a heading which bore  both the terms "letter of intent" and "factory regulations,"  contains 14 articles. All the articles, from Article 1 through  Article 14, are rules which employees are obliged to strictly  observe, whereas none of them mentions terms of pay, social  security, fringe benefits, or legal holidays. What is more,  some foreign-funded enterprises have undisguisedly declared in  their factory regulations: "Where any other rules and  regulations contradict these company regulations, the latter  will override the former." In so doing they have wantonly  ignored China's labor laws and ordinances. The relationship  between management and labor is one between an employer and  employee, in which the two sides act on an equal footing either  in terms of law or personality.    However, some foreign investors have persisted in acting  their own way, interpreting this relationship rather as one  between the master and the slave than as an equal relationship.  In consequence, the employment relations have become too tense  and complicated, disputes between management and labor have  gradually increased, and collective industrial action and  strikes have taken place in some foreign-funded enterprises.  All these are related to infringements upon the staff and  workers' legitimate rights and interests.  <H5>  Pay Is Not That High </H5>   When the first foreign-funded enterprises were founded in  China, many people were very eager to work in them. The main  reasons were because foreign-funded enterprises offered higher  pay. However, things were not as beautiful as people expected.  In many foreign- funded enterprises, the pay for employees, in  fact, is not in direct proportion to the work they do. Much  exciting hearsay has turned out to be merely beautiful legends.    The Wang sisters came from a small mountain village in  Shaoyang, Hunan. Like millions of migrant laborers, they were  extremely excited when they first set foot on Guangdong, a land  of which they had long dreamed. However, soon after they began  work in a Huizhou toy plant wholly owned by a Hong Kong firm,  they found they were earning bitter feelings and many annoyances  as well as a humble living and they realized that the world  outside was not so attractive as they had expected. Although  they had to work for over 10 hours a day on average and seven  days a week, their total income was barely over 300 yuan a  month. With payments for meals and other expenses deducted, the  amount of money they could take home was less than 3,000 yuan a  year.    In fact, compared with many other more unfortunate wage  earners, the Wang sisters are earning quite a handsome income.  According to a Sichuan girl working in Dongguan, Guangdong, her  boss not only extends the working hours but deprives her of the  benefit of legal public holidays. What is more, her employer  insists on paying the workers for overtime work at the normal  rate. Several migrant workers in a Taiwan-funded enterprise in  Panyu, Guangdong, lodged a complaint with the Guangdong People's  Broadcast Station, revealing that, although they were working 14  hours a day, the management still refused to pay them wages  under the pretext that the factory's products were unmarketable.  Furthermore, the management also forced them to pay for their  board and lodging, or their identity cards would be confiscated  by the management.    According to the labor department, complaints with regard to  wages being lodged by staff and workers in foreign-funded  enterprises are gradually increasing. In 1992, Baoan District  in Shenzhen City received and accepted a total of 3,607  complaints against foreign-funded enterprises; of these cases,  1,114 were related to wages. Of the cases of complaint lodged  by foreign- funded enterprise staff and workers over the years,  nearly 60 percent have been related to wages and the percentage  is on the increase. The complaints focused on low pay, because  the wage range in most labor-intensive enterprises is only  between 200 and 300 yuan a month. This is not only much lower  than the wage level for workers doing the same type of jobs  abroad but also slightly lower than the wage level for many  state-owned enterprises at home.    What should be pointed out is that some foreign-funded  enterprises have very often failed to pay even such meager wages  to their workers in due course and what the workers finally  receive is an amount with various deductions.    Many foreign-funded enterprises have very rigid factory  regulations. They are ruled by penalty, fines can be imposed on  workers under various pretexts, and the slightest lowering of  vigilance in work on the part of a worker may cost him a fine of  a certain amount. Those who take sick leave must pay an amount  as a fine, those who take casual leave must pay an amount as a  fine, and those who refuse to work overtime must pay an amount  as a fine too. A certain factory has made it a rule that any  worker who talks while working is liable to a fine of one yuan  for each offense; anyone who talks loudly is liable to a fine of  two yuan for each offense and, what is still more shocking, is  that workers will have two yuan deducted from their pay for each  time they use the rest room. The Taiwan-funded Yongqi Company  in Fuzhou City has made it a rule that anyone who takes one hour  sick leave must pay two yuan; coming to work more than one hour  late is counted as a one-day absence, causing the deduction of  three days' wages and 30 yuan of full- attendance bonus from the  monthly pay. In the case of a Chinese staff member working with  a foreign-funded enterprise in Fujian, he earned nearly 300 yuan  a month but the cumulative amount of fines deducted from his pay  for a certain month was as high as 150 yuan or more. A woman  worker in a foreign-funded enterprise in Qingdao manufacturing  corduroy, received a monthly earning statement for last February  showing a balance of only 16 yuan after all fines had been  deducted. She was extremely shocked when she received the sum  of 16 yuan as her income for the month and she quit the job in  grief.    Intensive labor equals low wage minus fines. This annoying  equation has been disturbing so many wage earners working with  foreign-funded enterprises!  <H5>  Endless Overtime Work </H5>   To workers in some foreign-funded enterprises, endless  overtime work is a nuisance indeed.    Generally, wages in China mean the income an employee earns  for his work during the normal working hours (8 hours a day).  However, nowadays, almost all foreign-funded enterprises count  overtime pay as a part of the worker's normal monthly wages. If  a worker does not work overtime, then he will not be able to  earn a barely acceptable amount of wages. The remuneration  package offered by many foreign-funded enterprises look pretty  high but one immediately finds out it is actually rather low if  one considers the extremely long working hours in these  enterprises.    The Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau once conducted a  questionnaire survey among the more than 14,000 staff and  workers of 17 foreign-funded enterprises. The survey findings  showed that, in most enterprises, workers had to work 10 to 12  hours a day and seven days a week. The workers of Shift B in  the assembly workshop of a toy company in Zhuhai, once worked  overtime up to 170-192 hours each per month and the highest  cumulative overtime work record was 214 hours that month,  amounting to about 26 working days! An electronics company in  Qingdao has kept its workers on overtime of up to 100 hours a  month each on average over the past more than a year since its  opening. A certain knitwear company once forced its workers to  work three days and three nights nonstop and, as a result, many  workers passed out at their posts!    Back in 1919, the International Labor Organization had  already set the rule: "Eight-hour working day and 48-hour  working week for industrial enterprises." However, a small  number of foreign-funded enterprises are violating this  "eight-hour working day system."    China's labor department has formulated a policy on overtime  work, which stipulates that each worker's accumulative monthly  overtime work shall not exceed 48 hours. However, the fact is  that in numerous foreign-funded enterprises, workers work much  more overtime than this.    Let us now review the reward workers gain from overtime  work.  China's labor policy clearly provides that pay for overtime  work, either calculated on a piece or time rate basis, will be  1.5 times the normal rate and work on legal public holidays  shall be paid for as double the normal pay. However, in most  foreign-funded enterprises, workers do not get their due pay for  extraordinarily long overtime work.    The practice of extended working hours and overtime work is  mostly related to labor-intensive enterprises dealing in the  processing business with supplied material, drawings, and  samples, assembling supplied parts, and the compensation trade.  Operation of these enterprises generally is subject to  restriction by the amount of orders on hand. In order to force  their workers to work overtime so that they can meet the  deadline for delivery, many factory owners usually set the pay  standard for overtime work according to the amount of orders and  the delivery deadlines. They do not follow any fixed  remuneration scale, just paying arbitrarily. Hardly any  factories have paid for overtime work in accordance with the  overtime pay rate as set by the Ministry of Labor but most  enterprises pay for overtime work at the same rate as the  ordinary working hour rate. So, there is no actual "overtime  pay rate." The workers get no extra compensation for extended  working hours.    Why then is the practice of working overtime still so  common?  Are workers willing to work overtime? In fact, most wage  earners do not want to work overtime but, rather, they are  forced to do so. The Shenzhen Asia Woolen Knitwear Company  Limited has set a rule: "Anyone who refuses to work overtime is  liable to a fine of 25 yuan." So, if a worker refuses to work  overtime, he will lose three days' wages. Therefore, workers  dare not resist the management's order to work overtime although  they have a lot of grievances and complaints.    Some enterprises induce workers to work overtime with  bonuses. With overtime work and bonuses linked together, the  management can now rest assured that the workers will not refuse  to work overtime. A Hong Kong-funded hardware factory in  Shenzhen has incorporated the following practice as part of its  written regulations: Seventy hours overtime work is the  criterion to qualify a worker as a recipient of full-attendance  bonus and is the minimum amount of overtime workload for every  worker. This factory simply ignores the Guangdong provincial  authorities' regulation that no worker shall work overtime of  more than 48 hours a month.    Some other plant owners do not set any minimum requirement  regarding overtime work but resort to another tricky practice:  They arbitrarily set piecework limits on their own. In the  workshop, manufacturing second hands for a joint-venture  timepiece plant in Zhuhai, the piecework requirement for each  worker per duty shift is 4,000 pieces, whereas the requirement  for a worker of the same category in Japan is only 2,500 pieces  per shift. More than 200 workers in the sewing machine workshop  of an enterprise in Tianjin, wholly owned by ROK interests,  lodged a complaint to the labor department that the workload  requirement was too high for them to fulfill in an eight-hour  working day. To meet the requirement they could do nothing else  but work overtime and if any worker still could not fulfill the  requirement after having worked overtime, then it would mean  that worker would get no pay for the day. Given the  unreasonably high workload, the workers in that plant often have  to work until 2000 or 2100 or even later before they can go home.  <H5>  Personality Without Dignity </H5>   No Chinese could ever forget the plaque hung on the gate of  Hongkou Park in Shanghai in old China which bore the words: "No  Admittance to Chinese or Dogs." This plaque aroused the  national indignation of the several generations of Chinese. It  is shocking indeed that an absurd incident, in which a human was  kept in a cage together with dogs, happened in a Taiwan-funded  enterprise in Fuzhou, China, today in the 1990's.    On the evening of 7 November 1993, Yu, a woman worker from  Jiangxi Province, were caught when she tried to take away two  pairs of shoes from Yongqi Company. Managerial personnel from  Taiwan, Chang, Chen, and several other men immediately tied the  woman worker up. They beat her up and then hung the shoes  around her neck in front of other workers. As the woman worker  tried to struggle away, Chang and Chen locked her up in a dog  cage. Two big dogs barked at the worker fiercely. She was  frightened and trembling, calling loudly for help. Having kept  her in the cage for more than two hours, Chang and his  assistants took the worker to another dog cage.    The company owner Chen spoke to more than 600 woman workers  the next day: "I have treated you as humans in the past but now  I am going to treat you as dogs."    This company owner was really swollen with arrogance and  his remark was disgusting! He himself is a Chinese but he is  without the least national sentiment!    It is noteworthy that cases like this in which laborers'  personalities are insulted and their dignity is trampled on are  not unusual in some foreign-funded enterprises. An enterprise  wholly owned by a ROK firm has assigned a "foreman" to every  workshop. These foremen walk around the workshops holding a big  stick in their hands. When they find any worker being slow at  work, they will beat him or her with the stick. One day, a  foreign "foreman" found several woman workers slow at work, he  ordered them to prostrate themselves in a line with their hands  on their heads. As the woman workers refused to follow his  order, he kicked their legs to force them to prostrate  themselves.    A male worker at Fenghan Company in Tianjin once  accidentally  hit a foreign managerial officer when unloading a truck. The  latter, without looking into the cause of the accident,  immediately climbed up into the container and kicked the worker  out of it, thus injuring him.    Workers at a certain chemical fiber company in Qingdao City  are ordered to run round the plant or to stand facing a wall as  a penalty for coming to work late. Foremen at a shoe factory in  Guangdong often scold and beat workers and the workers "are not  allowed to refute or resist," otherwise they will be fired. A  Taiwan-funded enterprise in Guangdong even practices the system  of "collective penalty," by which a whole work team comprised of  dozens of members, has to prostrate itself if any one member has  committed a mistake. A shoe company in Putian, Fujian Province  has invented some peculiar penalties: Workers are ordered to be  drenched by rain, to be exposed to the sun, and to jump like  frogs.    A young female worker in a ROK-run enterprise in Tianjin,  who  once violated labor discipline, was forced by the foreign  managerial personnel to eat seven cakes (100 grams each) and  seven eggs and drink two glasses of water on one occasion before  she was allowed to go home. The management's behavior was  really inhumane!    Body searches are a violation of human rights which is not  allowed by Chinese law. The cases of illegal body searches in  the nude, as happened in the JAL-Longpo Hotel in Shanghai, have  aroused strong reaction. However, cases like this are still  taking place from time to time in a few foreign-funded  enterprises.    A toy factory in Qingdao has had male security guards  searching female workers with a view to preventing the workers  from taking away goods when they leave the factory for home.  Woman workers at a private enterprise wholly owned by a foreign  firm in Tianjin complained that they had often experienced  insulting body searches upon their leaving the factory for home.  A survey conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of  Trade Unions among 20 foreign- funded enterprises in 10 cities  reveals that 17.6 percent of the workers in these enterprises  had been searched or had seen their colleagues being searched by  managerial personnel.    To be sure, China is not a wealthy country. But insulting  the personality is by no means tolerable by the law!  <H5>  The Price of Blood and Life </H5>   More than 60 years ago, Xia Yan, in his report "Indentured  Laborers," depicted the miserable life and terrible working  conditions of a worker nicknamed "Thin Wood Stick." His  description shocked the readers. Since liberation, the Chinese  working classes have become the masters of the country and the  working conditions and environment for workers have been  improved remarkably. However, the situations in a small number  of foreign-funded enterprises are awakening reminiscences of the  past.    Let us hear the complaint of a group of female workers at a  foreign-funded enterprise in Tianjin: We, 30 people in total,  live in a room 20 square meters in area. There are no beds and  we have to sleep on the floor. It is easy to step on others  when walking through the room to go to the toilet at night. The  working conditions are very poor in the factory--the workshop is  simple in structure and it becomes as hot as a food steamer on  hot days. The rest room is built within the workshop and there  are a lot of flies in there. All the windows are sealed by  welding and the window glass is painted over. The workshop is  not air conditioned so we workers often suffer heatstroke. The  iron gate of the workshop is always locked during working hours.  We simply think we are working in "hell."    There are still more horrible things. Industrial accidents  and occupational diseases are a pair of swords hung over the  workers, the former being the hard and overt one and the other  being the soft and covert one. They are constantly threatening  the workers' lives and impairing their health.    Fire is the greatest and most direct threat against foreign-  funded enterprises. The fire that took place in Shenzhen on 19  November and the one in Fuzhou on 13 December, both covered by  the newspapers, killed a total of more than 140 Chinese workers.  Many foreign-funded enterprises do not have enough fire  prevention facilities and, what is worse, the management does  not have a sense of fire prevention.    Industrial accidents seem to be very common in some  enterprises running businesses processing with supplied  material, drawings, and samples, assembling supplied parts, and  the compensation trade. According to the Shenzhen City Labor  Department, quite a few workers are electrocuted each year in  the city and cases of fingers being cut off by machines, such as  punching machines, metal cutting machine tools, and injection  molders in particular, which have no safety protection casing,  have happened from time to time. A metal component part  manufacturing plant run by a Hong Kong investor in Xili  Industrial Zone, Shenzhen City, once experienced five hand-  cutting accidents in a single week. The management of the plant  did not report these industrial accidents to the authorities,  nor did they take any precautionary measures afterward. In  consequence, two more cases of arm cutting happened later. A  Taiwan-funded enterprise in Xiamen City has experienced 43 cases  of severed arms and fingers and other injuries, in which the  worker victims lost a total of 38 fingers! A survey conducted  among five township and town clinics in Baoan District, Shenzhen  City, shows that they received a total of 11,679 in-patients  during the survey period, 1,033 of them or 8.84 percent were  workers from foreign-funded enterprises who had been injured in  industrial accidents.    Workers in foreign-funded enterprises are facing another  more dangerous threat--occupational nuisances.    Exporting pollution to underdeveloped areas is a usual  practice by some investors from developed areas. An  international environmental protection expert has pointed out:  The present trend is that overseas business interests are  exporting some "sunset industries" to China in a planned way.  In 1993, Zhuhai City Public Health Department conducted a  sample survey in seven Taiwan-funded enterprises. The findings  indicated that the percentages of benzene, toluene, and xylenol  in the air were all eight to 10 times higher than the respective  international standards, the problem being particularly serious  in such industries as toy making, plastics, shoemaking, fabric  printing and dyeing, and chemicals. Incidents of poisoning had  taken place in three foreign-funded toy manufacturing plants,  causing 81 casualties of whom four died and eight were  irremediably handicapped.    A poisoning case which took place in a garment factory in  Dalian City causing 42 casualties was due to the poisonous gas  released by the fabric supplied by an overseas customer for  processing. In Qinhuangdao City, 12 workers in a Sino-foreign  joint venture were poisoned the first day the plant started  operations. As revealed by the findings from a monitoring  operation conducted by the Dalian City Occupational Disease  Research Institute at the workshops of 34 currently operating  foreign-funded enterprises generating occupational nuisances,  only six enterprises met the public health standards. Shenzhen  City has conducted an air pollution survey in 547 enterprises  wholly or partly run by foreign interests, and it found that  only 29.6 percent of the imported equipment installed at these  enterprises have antipollution devices and only 26 percent of  the machines in these enterprises have gone through pollution  tests before being put into operation.    Occupational diseases have already impaired the health of  the  staff and workers of some foreign-funded enterprises. In  Shenzhen, a health examination focusing on occupational diseases  conducted among 1,100 staff and workers in two shoe factories  with serious occupational nuisance problems and another arts and  crafts workshop, revealed that many workers experienced a  remarkable decrease in the quantity of white blood cells only a  few months after they joined the plants, which meant that their  health was under serious threat. Meanwhile, however, a survey  conducted among 101 enterprises running paint spraying and  coating businesses in the city showed that hardly any  enterprises provided their workers with antipollution gauze  masks, gas masks, or gloves. Some enterprises have only  provided their workers with cotton gloves which are of little  use in labor protection, while workers in most enterprises are  left to be exposed to industrial pollution.    In Guangdong Province, 70 percent of the currently operating  foreign-funded enterprises have not carried out pre-employment  health checks on their staff and workers according to the  relevant state regulations and 80 percent have not introduced  any regular physical examination system for workers engaged in  polluting operations.    Our wage earners who have mortgaged their lives and health  to  their employers are paying a very high price!</p>

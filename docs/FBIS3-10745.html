Endara added  that Aleman's appointment is backed by the Constitution.    Cesar Quintero, constitutional expert and former Supreme  Court justice, said the position of a minister without portfolio  does not exist in presidential system governments like that of  Panama but that it does exist in parliamentary governments.  Quintero said the only precedent was in 1944 when the government  of President Adolfo de la Guardia appointed Demetrio Porras as  minister without portfolio, but for a relatively short time.    This week, the board of directors of the Legislative  Assembly  said it will file a suit of unconstitutionality at the Supreme  Court against President Endara for violating the Constitution  and taking over functions he does not have by appointing a  minister without portfolio.    According to the president, Minister Aleman placed his  position at the president's disposal on 8 March "to avoid  problems and eliminate speculations." Endara did not accept the  resignation and asked Aleman to remain in the post until the  current presidential term ends.    On 7 March the Legislative Assembly harshly questioned  Presidency Minister Ivonne Young about this appointment. Since 9  February Aleman's name has appeared in the GACETA OFICIAL as  minister without portfolio.    "I think the legislators and the Assembly board of directors  have been extremely unfair with Minister Young, because she was  not the one who appointed Aleman. I appointed him," Endara said.  He said the Constitution empowers him to appoint the ministers  he considers necessary for the efficient functioning of his  administration. "The legislators are mistaken. I do not have to  consult with that government branch to appoint a minister,  because the Constitution gives me the power to make these  appointments," Endara said.    Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino believes the  minister without portfolio should not sign cabinet decrees and  resolutions. "I am of the opinion that the president has the  right to appoint all his advisers, but I do not think it is  advisable for Aleman to be signing cabinet resolutions," he  added.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Claremont Garments advances to Pounds 8.47m CLAREMONT Garments (Holdings), which last summer expanded its business with Marks and Spencer through the purchase of J&amp;J Fashions, increased pre-tax profit by 35 per cent, from Pounds 6.28m to Pounds 8.47m, over the 12 months to December 26. The share price gained 5p to close at a new high of 345p. It has climbed from 154p in July 1991, the month that Claremont demerged from Alexon, the retailer. J&amp;J and Alexander Milnes, a much smaller buy, added Pounds 27m to turnover, which increased 60 per cent to Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 50.9m) - of which about 95 per cent goes to M&amp;S. The acquisitions were included for five to six months. A 2-for-5 rights issue raised Pounds 22.1m towards total spending of about Pounds 29m on acquisitions. The extra equity limited the advance in earnings per share to 19 per cent at 16.4p (13.8p). Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said three of J&amp;J's factories had been closed and some of its work transferred to Claremont factories. About 400 jobs had been shed. A final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 7.25p (6.5p). COMMENT Claremont has benefited both from the resilience of M&amp;S and from its own management rigour in wringing impressive margins from that business. The tantalising prospect of similar discipline being imposed on J&amp;J has helped drive the share price forward. The only surprise in yesterday's results was the pleasant one of cashflow being much stronger than expected. Most of the acquisition debt plus Pounds 1.9m of reorganisation costs were rapidly cancelled out. For the future, apart from J&amp;J, the main scope for organic growth seems to lie in exports to the Continent. The corporate wear business has promise but is small and the M&amp;S cocoon becomes a bit of a straitjacket when the group considers selling to other retailers. A more serious prospect for medium-term growth is that Claremont will acquire further M&amp;S suppliers. A conservative pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 11m this year gives a prospective p/e of nearly 19 times. This is well up with events, but it remains worth holding as a quality stock.</p>

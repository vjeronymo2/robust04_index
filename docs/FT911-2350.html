			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Arco posts earnings decline ATLANTIC Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company, yesterday posted a decline in underlying first-quarter earnings, in line with its earlier predictions, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Arco's 1990 results were distorted by a Dollars 323m gain from a change in accounting methods and Dollars 233m after-tax charges relating to environmental clean-up costs and tax provisions. Including these one-time items, Arco's net income for the first three months of 1991 dropped 41 per cent to Dollars 351m or Dollars 2.17 a share from Dollars 592m or Dollars 3.55 a year earlier. Mr Lodwrick Cook, chairman, said the first-quarter results reflected unseasonably low natural gas prices, lower average crude oil prices and lower margins and volume for chemical operations. These more than offset stronger refining results and higher crude oil and natural gas production levels. Arco's worldwide oil and gas exploration and production operations earned Dollars 261m after tax, down 19 per cent from Dollars 319m a year ago. Refining and marketing earned Dollars 74m against Dollars 72m.</p>

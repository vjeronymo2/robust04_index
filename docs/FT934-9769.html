			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: EW Fact makes Pounds 11m acquisition EW Fact, the USM-quoted accountancy training group with a market capitalisation of just Pounds 7.82m, is to pay Pounds 11m for Accountancy Tutors Limited. Mr Suresh Tanna, Fact managing director, said that at his company's suspended share price of 104p the enlarged company would have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 18m. A full market listing has been applied for. The company was to have announced the merger last week with its interim results, but, although the acquisition price had been settled, not all the documentation had been finalised. Mr Tanna said that Fact and ATL were in the same market but had different customer bases. Further, Fact is represented in north and central London, Manchester and Leeds, while ATL has a presence in south London, Southampton and Dublin. The Pounds 11m consideration is to be satisfied by the issue of 9.9m new ordinary shares at Pounds 1 and of Pounds 1.1m of loan notes. The loan notes are to be allotted to Mr Dhanraj Gidwaney, the founder of ATL, as are 900,000 of the ordinary shares, which he cannot dispose of for two years. Another 987,000 of the ordinaries will go to seven of ATL's shareholders and cannot be disposed of until April 6. Qualifying shareholders can apply for the 8.77m placing shares in the open offer on a 7-for-6 basis.</p>

Traveling with Li are Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu,  Governor of the Central Bank of China Samuel Shieh, Chairman of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development Hsiao  Wan-chang, Executive Yuan Advisor Jeffrey Koo, Presidential Vice  Secretary-General Raymond Tai, and the directors of the Foreign  Ministry's Central and South American Affairs Department Yen  Ping-fan and African Affairs Department Du Ling.

Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua Wednesday afternoon. He  will spend two days there.    Li will then fly to Costa Rica to attend the Sunday  inauguration of President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, and later  fly to South Africa, where on May 10 he will attend the  inauguration of newly-elected South African President Nelson  Mandela. He will travel to Swaziland on May 11.    During his tour, Li will sign joint communiques with his  counterparts in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Swaziland to  strengthen bilateral ties.

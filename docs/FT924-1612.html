			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Water watchdog attacks salaries DIRECTORS' salaries and dividend increases at a water company came under attack yesterday from one of the customer service committees of Ofwat, the water industry regulator. Mr Clive Wilkinson, chairman of the central customer committee, said in a letter to Mr John Bellak, chairman of Severn Trent, the Birmingham-based water and sewerage company: 'To see dividend increases at more than twice the rate of inflation by a monopoly utility at a time of serious recession is unacceptable.' Ofwat said yesterday that the committees did not speak on behalf of Mr Ian Byatt, its director-general. In July Mr Bellak was given a 29.6 per cent increase in basic salary to Pounds 160,000. He said last night that total remuneration included bonuses set at the end of the year, and that because of a cut in bonuses he had seen a 4 per cent drop in remuneration in the year to March 1992.</p>

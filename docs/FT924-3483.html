			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Israel hails Tokyo's call on Arab boycott ISRAEL has warmly welcomed Japan's call for an end to the Arab economic boycott of the Jewish state. But a new trade dispute between the two countries has arisen over demands that Japanese exporters enter counter-purchase deals for Israeli goods. Israeli officials described as very significant a statement late last week from the Japanese Foreign Ministry urging Arab countries to suspend the boycott following moves by Israel to freeze Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. Israel has long accused Japan of avoiding trade with it for fear of jeopardising ties with the Arab world, especially oil supplies. It now hopes a steady increase in Japan-Israel trade will grow more quickly. However, no sooner have Japanese imports started to flow than Israel has complained about a lack of counter-purchasing. Last month a senior official from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry warned that pressing the issue could halt the expansion of trade. But Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, will take it up when he visits Tokyo next week. A big deficit with Japan worries Israel, which, until recently, ran a healthy trade surplus with it thanks to big exports of polished diamonds. But a surge in Japanese vehicle imports and a slump in demand for diamonds has meant that this year Israel will be some Dollars 200m in deficit out of total bilateral trade near Dollars 2bn.</p>

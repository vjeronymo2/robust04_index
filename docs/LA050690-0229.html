			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CASTING CALL  </P> <P> As a viewer devoted to KCET and video feature films, I took some heart with the  debut of "Twin Peaks" on network television.  </P> <P> The series is mature, artistic and engaging. There is only one point with which  I would quibble.  </P> <P> With casting directors having achieved the professional pinnacle that calls for  full screen credit and, thus, presumed heightened expertise, why do they cast  actors who appear to be in their 20s in roles calling for the late teens of  high school? The otherwise splendid film, "Dead Poet's Society," suffered from  this identical flaw.  </P> <P> James Higson, Newport Beach  </P></p>

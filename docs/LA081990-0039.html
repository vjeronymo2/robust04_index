			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD PRICING STRATEGY USES CONVOLUTED LOGIC  </P> <P> Two items in your July 25 "Briefly" column really stood out: (1) Domestic car  and truck sales off, with Ford dropping 18.8%, the most of all; and (2) Ford  Motor Co. said the average price of one of its 1991 cars will be $528, or 3.2%  higher, and the average light truck price will increase by 3.6%.  </P> <P> How they figure that raising prices will increase sales is mystifying. I can  only assume that they use the same convoluted logic that the state Lottery used  when deciding that decreasing the odds of winning by adding more numbers would  increase revenue.  </P> <P> In the words of Charlie Brown: "Good grief!"  </P> <P> HOWARD R.

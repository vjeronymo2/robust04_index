			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P reduces rating on Dollars 2bn of Alcan debt STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has reduced its rating on nearly Dollars 2bn of Alcan Aluminium's long-term debt from A to A- but left Alcan's US commercial paper unchanged. S&amp;P cited Alcan's tightening cash flow due to persistently lower world primary metal prices and market disruptions caused by Commonwealth of Independent States exports. Net financing needs rose in 1991 and despite cuts in capital spending and in the cost base, Alcan's debt leverage may rise in 1992, S&amp;P said. Aluminum Co of America's senior debt is rated as A, though S&amp;P said all its ratings were under continuous review.</p>

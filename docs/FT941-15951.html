			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Australian group in coal joint venture Savage Resources, the Australian coal-mining and mineral resources group, together with two Asian joint venture partners hope to produce 3m to 4m tonnes a year of thermal coal in Queensland's Bowen basin after winning a tender for a newly-released exploration area there, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Savage will be an equal partner in the venture, alongside Mitsui Mining, the Japanese coal producer, and a consortium of Korean companies, including Hyosung Corporation, Yukong, Dongbu Corporation and the Korea Mining Promotion Corporation. Savage hopes a mine will begin production in seven to 10 years and be able to supply south-east Asian power stations now in the design and construction stage.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: A cheer for the knights at arms - Serious Money READ the next few sentences and try to guess who is speaking about the life assurance industry. 'I should like to see a shift in competition away from who gives the best commission to who gives the best value to the customer. I hope that product competition will come to be stimulated by publication and comparison of charges. I hope that consumer interests might be better served through the availability of products without heavy early surrender penalties, and by greater emphasis being given to improving the persistency of policyholders.' Some of you will probably assume that the above comes from the mouth of a consumer pressure group, or more likely, from the pen of some know-nothing financial journalist. In fact, those comments were made this week by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, a government body with responsibility for ensuring competition and consumer protection. Sir Bryan is a brave man. He made his remarks in a speech to the annual conference of the Chartered Insurance Institute. Judging by the reaction of the industry's trade body, one hopes he had a fast car waiting at the back of the hall. The Association of British Insurers dismissed his speech, saying Sir Bryan 'betrayed a lack of understanding about the way the insurance industry operates.' Regular readers of the Financial Times will not be surprised to learn that I am on Sir Bryan's side. But judge for yourself whether his following analysis of life assurance products displays ignorance or shrewd observation. 'A key aspect of life assurance is the 'halo effect' of combining protection with investment. Customers might find it helpful to know how much they are paying for protection, that is, commonly, the right to receive the amount in question if they die before the end of the term of the policy. The costs are often only small sums but knowing them would enable customers to compare the investment element of life insurance more readily with alternative investment vehicles.' In other words, when you pay Pounds 30 a month for an endowment policy, how much is going to provide you with life cover, and how much is invested in stocks and shares? If you knew the answer, you could compare the policy with a combination of term assurance (basic life cover, with no investment element) and a unit trust savings plan. Sir Bryan also dealt with commissions and the surrender penalties applied to endowment policies in early years. 'Given that such policies are mainly investments, people naturally ask why the bulk if not all of premiums should be lost on early surrender' he said. 'This month's Which? consumer magazine shows that, for 40 different companies, surrender values at the end of year two on similar policies, averaged about Pounds 700 against total premiums paid averaging about Pounds 1,700. Why should consumers lose some Pounds 1,000 on such early surrenders? No other investments result in such heavy automatic losses.' Sir Bryan referred to the practice of 'front-ending' commissions, whereby salesmen are paid heavily in the years immediately after selling a policy. 'If commission depended more on the maintenance of policies over their extended lifetime, sales people might give more attention to whether the policy fitted the needs of the customer - the industry would be forced to address the quality of sale issue. and thereby reduce the level and costs of inappropriate sales.' To this observer, at least, Sir Bryan's analysis is splendid stuff. Given that he is about to advise the government on the SIB's review of retail financial regulation, one can feel that the consumer's interest is in safe hands. Coincidentally, another Sir Bryan has been battling on the consumer's behalf. Sir Bryan Hayes, published a consultative document this week on the formation of a new regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA). The idea is beguilingly simple. Rather than the current alphabet soup of regulatory bodies, Lautro, Fimbra and the like, financial companies which deal with the private investor would be regulated by just one - the PIA. Consumers would know where to complain and uniform standards could be set across the industry. The snag is that the system will remain self-regulatory. No-one will be compelled to join the new body, they will have to be persuaded to do so. Since products such as life insurance are increasingly sold through banks and building societies, it is only logical that they should be regulated by PIA. But the major banks are reluctant, fearing that they will be swamped by the life companies and forced to pay, via the investors compensation scheme, for the mistakes of others. To calm these fears, the consultative document proposes a 30 strong board, with a balance of industry representatives and consumers. An elaborate voting system would require major changes to be approved by 75 per cent majorities of the industry groups. Although the PIA is a good idea, the structure seems a recipe for bureaucratic chaos. And the more you please the industry, the less you are likely to protect the consumer. A PIA with statutory backing would be a better solution, especially if Sir Bryan Carsberg were allowed to run it.</p>

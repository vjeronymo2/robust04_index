			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sandoz ahead 10% in first half SANDOZ, the Swiss pharma-ceutical and chemicals group, reported consolidated net income up 10 per cent in the first half to SFr998m (Dollars 660.7m), and said 'a significant increase in earnings is also expected for the full year'. However, sales advanced only 2 per cent in the first six months to SFr8bn, with growth hurt by the substantial cuts in prices paid for drugs by some European governments. In the second quarter, group sales were up only 0.9 per cent to SFr3.82bn. Sandoz said the strong profit growth was due to 'efficient cost management and improved margins'. It was the first time that the group had published an interim net income figure. Pharmaceutical sales were flat in the second quarter at SFr1.77bn. Positive developments in the US and Japan were outweighed by a slowdown in Germany and Italy. However, growth was expected to accelerate in the second half, due in part to the introduction of new products. Sales of seeds fell 11.5 per cent to SFr245m in the second quarter due to the sale of non-strategic activities and negative currency impacts. The nutrition division, where sales were down 7.5 per cent in the second quarter to SFr445m, was also affected by currency conversions. Chemical sales were flat at SFr669m, but grew in volume terms as gains in North and South America and in Asia offset results in recession-plagued Europe. Agricultural chemical sales jumped 14.7 per cent to SFr383m in spite of the negative impact of reforms of the European Community farm support regime. Construction and environmental system sales, up 7.4 per cent to SFr306m, were strongest in Latin America and south-east Asia and weak in the US and Europe. Acquisitions also contributed. Saurer, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, has appointed Mr Carl Hahn, the former chief executive of Volkswagen, as its chairman following the sudden resignation of Mr Vittorio Ghidella. Italian magistrates have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Ghidella, a former head of Fiat Auto, in connection with a fraud investigation into the activities of Oto Trasm, an Italian motor components company that is now a Saurer affiliate.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P>  Continue feeding chrysanthemums every three weeks until their buds show color.  </P> <P> Remove dried up, faded flowers and replant containers and flower beds with more  annuals to continue the color show well into fall.  </P> <P> Because warm weather continues well into fall, be sure to maintain a regular  watering schedule with deep, thorough soakings.  </P></p>

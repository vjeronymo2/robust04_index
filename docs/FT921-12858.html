			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Aberfoyle blames low metal prices for dividend cut ABERFOYLE, the Tasman-ian-based mining group, has joined the list of Australian resources companies which have fallen victim to historically low world metal prices, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The base metals company has cut its annual dividend to 10 cents a share from 27.5 cents after 1991 earnings fell to ADollars 10.9m (Dollars 8.38m) from ADollars 30.0m. Revenue fell to Dollars 125.6m from ADollars 179.1m. The directors said the decline was caused by sharply lower metal prices and near exhaustion of the company's long-standing Que River operation. Yesterday's report indicated the Hellyer operation was the company's most profitable.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Ballot over pay deal at Vauxhall MANUAL WORKERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, began voting yesterday on a pay offer which would provide 5 per cent in the first year of a two-year deal. Shop stewards predicted that they would be in favour of taking industrial action in an attempt to win a better package. The offer, which would be backdated to last October, would provide an increase in line with inflation in the second year. Workers would also receive in the second year a lump-sum payment equivalent to 0.5 per cent on annual pay. Employees at Luton would receive an extra 5 per cent for agreeing to changes in working practices as part of the deal.</p>

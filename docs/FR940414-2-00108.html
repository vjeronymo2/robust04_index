			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The Company proposes to deduct a mortality and expense risks charge (1) daily, from the assets of the Separate Account, at an annual rate of .80% and (2) monthly, from the Contract value in the Separate Account and the Fixed Account at an annual rate of .45%. The Company estimates that approximately .85% of each charge is attributable to the mortality risks assumed by the Company in connection with the Contracts and .40% is attributable to the expense risks. According to the Applicants, the mortality risks assumed are the risks that (i) annuitants may live for longer periods of time than the periods indicated in the mortality tables on which the Company calculated the annuity tables in the Contracts, (ii) mortality will cause a Contract to terminate prematurely before the assumed annuitization date and (iii) the risk that mortality will cause the Company to incur higher costs than anticipated for certain benefits payable on the death of the Contractowner. The expense risks assumed are that expenses in administering the Contracts will be greater than the Company estimated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Company is aware that deducting a portion of the mortality and expense risks charge monthly instead of daily is slightly different from typical industry practice. To assure that the less frequent deduction of the 0.45% portion of the mortality and expense risks charge does not result in that charge being effectively larger for Contractowners than a solely daily charge at an annual rate of 1.25%, the 0.45% charge will be administered as a 0.449928% charge. As a result, the overall effective rate would be 1.24225%, as compared to an effective rate of 1.24226% if the charge were deducted as a daily charge at an annual rate of 1.25%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants submit that if the mortality and expense risks charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risks assumed, the Company will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to the Company and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act requires that all payments received under a periodic payment plan certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants submit that the Company is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks, and Applicants represent that the aggregate of (i) the daily charge of .80% per annum and (ii) the monthly charge of .45% per annum is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon an analysis made by the Company of publicly available information about selected similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as the right to increase charges above current levels, the existence of other charges, the number of transfers permitted without charge and the nature of the free withdrawal provisions. Applicants represent that the Company will maintain at its service office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants submit that for it to be administratively possible for the Contracts to be issued by the Separate Account (as opposed to a new separate account), the accumulation unit values calculated on a daily basis must equal the accumulated unit values calculated for existing variable annuity contracts issued by the Separate Account. That can only be accomplished by deducting a portion of the Contract's mortality and expense risks charge at the Contract level. By splitting the charge into two components, the Company can avoid the cost of establishing, administering and auditing a new separate account. Such costs would otherwise have to be passed on to Contractowners in some form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charge under the Contracts is expected to be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risks charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the withdrawal charge. In such circumstances a portion of the mortality and expense risks charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to distribution on the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contractowners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by the Company at its service office and will be available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Company represents that the Separate Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes, in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by the particular company's board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants agree to the following conditions if the order is granted: (1) The fee table examples in the prospectus for the Contracts will reflect all applicable charges in a manner that will permit comparison with other contracts on the same basis as if the daily and monthly portions of the mortality and expense risks charge were combined; (2) all advertisements of the performance of the sub-accounts of the Separate Account will reflect the impact of both elements of the mortality and expense charge; (3) if the size of this charge is discussed in advertising, it will be presented as a 1.25% charge, with part deducted daily and part monthly; and (4) changes in accumulation unit values will not be advertised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

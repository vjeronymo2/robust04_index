Wage reform, which had been discussed and planned for a long  time, was originally introduced with the civil service system.  Due to the current high inflation, the grim economic situation,  and the heavy tasks of reform, however, the CPC senior  leadership decided at the end of last year that wage reform for  cadres, servicemen, and teachers should be sped up and that it  should be completed before the Spring Festival so as to maintain  the stability of the "backyard" [hou yuan 0683 7108].    Following the wage reform, Jiang Zemin has become the  official who receives the highest income. Of the many titles he  holds, he receives his salary with the highest-paying title of  the Central Military Commission chairman, a monthly income of  1,600 yuan.    This time, there were not many new elements in the wage  reform. It still determines pay scales with such indexes as  seniority, post, and technical title; the higher the position,  the higher the wages.    The wage reform's increase rate was 36 percent on average.  The troops had higher rates than those for officials in the  localities, and cadres had slightly higher rates than those for  teachers. In the wake of the reform, high-ranking military  officers and officials at the local ministerial level receive  approximately 1,000 yuan; field officers and cadres at the local  department or bureau level receive approximately 700 yuan, and  cadres at and below the sectional level and general teachers  receive approximately 400 yuan. The wage gap has obviously  widened.    The wage reform was implemented at a time of rather large  financial difficulties. For the 3 million troops, the state had  to spend approximately 3 billion yuan and for the 30 million  cadres and teachers, it had to spend another 20 billion yuan or  so; so that their wages are paid according to the new pay scale  retroactive to October 1993.    There are advantages and disadvantages in wage reform. The  advantages are that it has stabilized the long shaky moral of  the troops and the general moral of cadres and teachers. But  its disadvantages seem to outnumber the advantages. First, at a  time when organizational reform has not been completed and when  organizations are overstaffed, wage reform has not succeeded in  improving work efficiency. Second, under the current social  situation, it will inevitably lead to competition and spark off  big increases in wages. For large numbers of loss-making  state-owned enterprises particularly, it will lead to rising  labor costs and accelerate financial difficulties while their  efficiency does not seem to improve. Third, the substantial  wage increases will accelerate inflation. At a time when China  is a the buyer's market, an increase in the currency that people  hold in their hands will pave the way for a worsening economy.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Eisner admits Euro Disney pain Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, has written to shareholders describing Euro Disney, the troubled French theme park that is 49 per cent owned by Disney, as his company's 'first real financial disappointment'. 'This had been a very serious problem: one that has cost us an enormous amount of time and anxiety,' wrote Mr Eisner. He added that Euro Disney's performance had been dire. 'Some would call it dreadful, and in a financial sense, I'd be forced to agree.' Mr Eisner's comments came at the end of a year in which Euro Disney's difficulties have depressed Walt Disney's share price and finances. Walt Disney shares fell Dollars  1/4 by yesterday in New York to Dollars 43 7/8 . Euro Disney's shares rallied in Paris to close up FFr2.85 at FFr31.90, having fallen sharply the previous day. Euro Disney, which is struggling to avert bankruptcy by negotiating an emergency financial restructuring package with its creditor banks, has since the opening of the EuroDisneyland theme park in April 1992 been burdened by heavy debt and badly affected by the European economic recession. The company, which recently reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 607m) for the year to September 30, has severe cashflow problems and is expected to run out of cash early next year, thereby becoming technically bankrupt. Walt Disney has promised to support it financially until the completion of the restructuring, but only until March 31. Mr Eisner stressed that he would not allow Euro Disney's problems to imperil his company. He told shareholders: 'We certainly are interested in aiding Euro Disney, the public company that bears our name and reputation. We will deal in good faith with our fellow shareholders and Euro Disney creditors. But in doing so I promise all shareholders of Walt Disney that we will take no action to endanger the health of Disney itself.' The Disney camp is awaiting an audit commissioned by the creditor banks into Euro Disney's financial position before full-scale negotiations over restructuring can get under way. Lex, Page 12</p>

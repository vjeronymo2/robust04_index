			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITISH FIRM TO ACQUIRE DUNKIN' DONUTS  </P> <P> Two months after rejecting a hostile takeover bid from a Canadian group,  Dunkin' Donuts said today it reached a $325-million agreement for acquisition  by a British food and drink corporate giant.  </P> <P> Under the definitive agreement, Allied-Lyons PLC will acquire outstanding  shares of the coffee and doughnut shop franchiser's common stock with a cash  tender offer at $47.25 per share on or before Nov. 24. Shearson Lehman Hutton  Inc. will act as dealer manager for the offer.  </P> <P> Trading over the counter on the New York Stock Exchange just after the market  opened today, Dunkin' Donuts stock was up 37.5 cents to $46.875.  </P> <P> "The combination with Allied-Lyons will clearly strengthen our position as the  world's largest coffee and doughnut chain. We look forward to building upon our  accomplishments as part of the Allied-Lyons team," said Dunkin' Donuts Board  Chairman Robert M. Rosenberg.  </P> <P> The two companies said the total value of the transaction is about $325  million. The agreement is subject to Allied-Lyons' acquisition of at least 75%  of the outstanding shares. In connection with the execution of the merger  agreement, Dunkin' Donuts agreed to pay Allied-Lyons a $7 million termination  fee under certain conditions.  </P> <P> Allied-Lyons, based in Britain, primarily owns and operates drink and food  businesses. Its holdings include Baskin-Robbins franchised ice cream stores,  Tetley Inc., DCA Food Industries and Hiram-Walker-Allied Vintners, the wine and  spirits company which markets Kahlua, Ballantines, Courvoisier, Canadian Club  and Tia Maria.  </P> <P> In September, Dunkin' Donuts rejected a $45-per-share hostile takeover bid from  DD Acquisitions of Toronto which valued the company at about $310 million.  </P></p>

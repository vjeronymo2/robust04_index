			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Complete text of article obtained through NIKKEI BIZ </F> DATABASE]    [Text] Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has added a new type to  its line of turbo refrigerating machines for large capacity air  conditioners by employing "HFC-134a," a CFC substitute, as the  refrigerant. By adjusting the heat exchange cycle, the new  machines can be used for heating up to 50&deg;C and for cooling  to -10&deg;C.    HFC-134a has less impact on the environment than "CFC-11"  and  does not deplete the ozone layer. The turbo refrigerating  machines using HFC-134a are the third type to employ a CFC  substitute, following those with "HCFC-123" and "HCFC-22."    The new type consists of six models with different  refrigeration capabilities ranging from 150 to 400 refrigerating  tons and priced from &yen;39.5 million to &yen;56 million. Large  capacity models of up to 7,000 refrigerating tons will be  developed based on the sales conditions of the smaller models.</p>

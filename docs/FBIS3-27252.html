			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nanjing, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Burgeoning  multi-leveled labour markets in east China's Jiangsu Province  have effectively alleviated the problem of unemployment and  maintained social stability by affording regular work  opportunities for many local people.    Last year, a total of 206,000 people found jobs through  labour markets, reducing the unemployment rate of the province  to two percent, lower than the country's average.    To answer the call of establishing a socialist market  economy, Jiangsu labour departments have exerted themselves to  foster development of labour markets in recent years.    By now, well-functioning profession-introduction  institutions  have been established in Jiangsu's 11 cities and 64 counties and  more than 75 percent of its towns and villages have improved  services involving employment.    Combining group recommendation with individual introduction,  these labour markets manage to satisfy the fluctuating needs of  enterprises and institutions for labour forces.    They also offer a series of services for employers,  including  delivering employment information, handling recruitment  procedure and taking out employment insurance.    Apart from setting up labour markets all over the province,  local labour departments have strictly implemented the relevant  laws and regulations and strengthened supervision and direction  for the operation of privately-owned profession-introduction  institutions, to keep the development of labour markets sound.    Employment training programmes have been offered by labour  departments at all levels.    However, as the improved labour markets have attracted not  only those who are seeking employment but also those who want to  change jobs for more lucrative ones, substantial changes have  also occurred in employment training courses.    Now people from all walks of life can benefit from these  courses by learning skills and knowledge, either to increase  competitiveness in employment or just for interest.    Various employment training centers all over Jiangsu  province  now total 601, with more than 110,000 people having received  technical training last year.    Jiangsu Province is abundant in labour forces. Surplus rural  labour forces in northern Jiangsu used to be a headache for  local people.    In past several years labour markets have effectively  channeled surplus labour forces to other provinces or even  foreign countries which are short of labour.    Along with a flourishing labour market, competition for  employment has become more fierce. Local provincial government  has accordingly attached much importance to the improvement of  unemployment security.    Relief funds are extended to people who are out of work for  less than two years. Some well-run large enterprises are chosen  to provide temporary working opportunities for jobless people.    Jiangsu Province has also boosted the development of the  service industries as part of the efforts to create more  employment opportunities for unemployed people.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NOVELIST RELIVES LABOR CAMP NIGHTMARE  </P> <P> Like Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who turned long years as a  political prisoner in the Soviet Union into his most powerful work, Chinese  novelist Zhang Xianliang relives the ordeal of 22 years spent in labor camps.  </P> <P> Zhang's best-known book in the West, the semi-autobiographical "Half of Man Is  Woman," is about a young man sent to prison in China for 20 years for writing a  poem. Living under watchful eyes of prison guards he is at nearly 40 still a  virgin.  </P> <P> To his horror he finds himself impotent when he manages to marry a fellow  inmate. "That was me at a certain point of my experience in the camps," Zhang  said.  </P> <P> Zhang was consigned to hard labor at the age of 21 for writing a poem the  authorities disapproved of. He emerged from the camps at 43 with a wellspring  of images of an Orwellian nightmare.  </P> <P> "All the sorrow in that book was about me, but none of the happiness was about  me," he said.  </P> <P> The novel's protagonist becomes infatuated with a sensuous woman prisoner, but  must wait years until political conditions allow them to converse. He is  bitterly disappointed by her venality but marries her nonetheless.  </P> <P> Published in 1985, the book's sexually explicit passages created a sensation in  China, where puritan values in literature still prevail.  </P> <P> China's artists and writers have been the target of waves of persecution  campaigns since the communist takeover in 1949. Zhang was swept up in a major  one in 1957.  </P> <P> "They labelled me a rightist-deviationist because I wrote about my feelings  about myself, my people and my country," said Zhang.  </P> <P> "To this day, I do not know what is a rightist or a leftist," he added.  </P> <P> He was exiled from his home in Nanjing, the graceful old capital in China's  southeast, to the desert wastes of Ningxia in the remote north.  </P> <P> After his release, Zhang sought refuge from politics by staying in Yinchuan to  the south of the two labor camps where he once toiled.  </P> <P> The pace of life in the tree-shaded city appears slow and relaxed compared with  Beijing, where security remains tight after martial law was lifted last  January.  </P> <P> Thanks to its large Muslim minority, Yinchuan has a Middle Eastern air with  many mosques and Islamic restaurants.  </P> <P> "The good thing is, it's far from Beijing." Living in the Chinese capital left  one too open to scrutiny, Zhang said.  </P> <P> From his less exposed vantage point, Zhang continues to write about the anguish  of lost freedom and his sadness at the craven deeds men sometimes commit to  survive.  </P> <P> His current work, as yet untitled, is about starvation in labor camps during  the 1960s. "It's more about the sad state of China's intellectuals than  physical starvation," he says.  </P> <P> Artists and writers are again under siege as Beijing continues its crackdown on  dissent, one year after the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests.  </P> <P> Several prominent editors and journalists have been dismissed from their jobs  and government-orchestrated orthodoxy is the order of the day.  </P> <P> Zhang has seen it all, in his youth lost in prison camps from 1957 to 1979. "I  was never able to write in all those years. How could I? I was watched  constantly," he said.  </P> <P> "I kept my sanity during those years because I believed things would someday  get better," he said. "But I still dream about those days a lot, even though I  try not to think about them all the time."  </P> <P> He confronts his nightmare past by writing about it. "It is my catharsis," he  says.  </P> <P> But he is understandably wary about going out on a limb, knowing what it cost  him in the past.  </P> <P> Zhang, now 53 and owlish in large-framed glasses, married at the age of 44, a  year after he emerged from prison. He has a 9-year-old son.  </P> <P> Zhang said he made $4,250 as a flat fee for "Half of Man Is Woman," hardly a  princely sum compared with what successful writers in the West can expect.  </P> <P> Chinese authors do not earn royalties, so even large sales do not benefit them,  he said.  </P> <P> "But if one gets the Nobel Prize, at least one's reputation is helped," he said  with a laugh.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National  Front] says the ANC [African National Congress] and government  have embarked on a combined Boer-bashing campaign. AVF  spokesman Stephen Maninger says allegations that right wingers  are involved in township violence are hypocritical and  opportunistic.    [Begin Maninger recording] Well, our position is this, the  government and the ANC accused us yesterday of contributing to  the violence in the townships. That is total nonsense. We  think that it's ridiculous to suggest that right wingers on the  whole are involved because we are not the people with the  AK-47s; we are not the people that are assassinating the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] leadership, that are involved in  shootouts in the townships. I mean, it is ridiculous to suggest  that we are in any way linked to that sort of struggle. [end  recording]</p>

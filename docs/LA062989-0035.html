			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROHIBITION EXTENDED FOR OFFENDING FENCES  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has extended until May, 1990, a moratorium  on the construction or placement of fences, hedges and walls that significantly  impair a view from an adjacent neighbor's rear yard.  </P> <P> The council imposed the moratorium May 16 so that it could examine  view-preservation amendments to the development code. The council will receive  those recommendations from city staff at its Aug. 1 meeting.  </P> <P> In a related action, the council Tuesday also adopted a second urgency measure  similarly banning walls or hedges that block side yard views. Fences were  excluded in the second urgency measure because five-foot fences are required  around swimming pools.  </P> <P> The interim ordinance is effective until Aug. 4, when it can be extended for an  additional 10 months and 15 days.  </P></p>

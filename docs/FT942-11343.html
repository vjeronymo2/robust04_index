			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Clinton protests at Singapore caning Singapore yesterday carried out a caning sentence on Michael Fay, 18, a US citizen convicted by a local court of vandalism offences, including spray-painting cars. President Bill Clinton said bluntly that Singapore had committed 'a mistake', write Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur and Jurek Martin in Washington. The error was 'not only because of the nature of the punishment related to the crime but because of the questions raised about whether the young man was in fact guilty and involuntarily confessed'. Mr Clinton promised a more definitive reaction later. Meanwhile, the Singapore ambassador was summoned to the state department to receive US protests. Fay received four strokes of the rotan, a 4ft cane. He had originally been sentenced to four months' jail, and fined SDollars 3,500 (Pounds 1,489), with six strokes of the cane. The Fay case has caused considerable controversy in the US. Singapore has accused the US media of orchestrating a campaign against it and has insisted no one has the right to interfere in the workings of its judicial system. Official figures show Singapore (population under 3m) canes about 1,000 people each year.</p>

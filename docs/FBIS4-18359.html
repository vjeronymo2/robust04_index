			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, April 1 (AFP) -- The leader of Turkey's  Islamic-based Prosperity Party Friday [1 April] said his party  aimed to set up a "world union of Islam" after taking power in  Turkey.    Necmettin Erbakan, addressing some 10,000 supporters after  Friday prayers at the Eyup Sultan mosque, did not spell out what  he meant by a "world union of Islam," but he praised Eyup, an  Arab soldier who fell during a siege of the town in 668, saying  he was a "great example of Islamic jihad (holy war)."    Erbakan, whose party won municipal elections here, in Ankara  and in some 25 other towns last weekend, joined in prayers with  new Istanbul mayor Tayyip Erdogan and 17 other local district  mayors before they took up their posts.    "We have taken power at the local, geographical and  demographic levels in two-thirds of Turkey and now we are  marching to take central power in the near future," the leader,  perched on a bus, told his supporters.    In the municipal elections, the Prosperity Party "soared  into  the sky like a missile," while centre parties "which copy the  West plummeted from the sky," he said.    Meanwhile, the Turkish pound was again under pressure here  Friday as the country awaited the know whether Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller's mainstream secular True Path Party, which  obtained the most votes of any single party in the election,  with around 22 percent of the vote, would continue to govern.    It could continue in a coalition with the centre-left Social  Democratic Populist Party or ditch it in favour of an alliance  with the opposition Motherland Party.    On the local free currency markets, the Turkish pound was  trading at 27,500 to the dollar, down from 25,500 on Thursday.    The Turkish currency has lost 60 percent of its value  against  the dollar since the beginning of the year.    In Athens Friday, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  expressed concern at the Islamic success in the Turkish ballots,  "particularly" in Istanbul.    He told a meeting of his ruling PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] party that the Turkish election results were "a  worrying sign, especially in this already troubled region."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three projects, for which the Federal Ministry of  Research and Technology (BMFT) has granted funding, will take on  a pilot role for other reclamation plans. About 25 million  German marks [DM] will be spent on developing and testing  reclamation processes for use on heavily contaminated soil at  the former Buna chemicals combine, the Ilsenburg copper mill,  and the Zichow hazardous waste dump.    Approximately DM19 million are earmarked for the Buna  project, where the main emphasis is on dealing with high  concentrations of mercury contamination. In addition to  developing and testing analysis and surveying methods for use in  hazard assessment, the team will work out  environment-compatible, economically viable methods for  demolishing the buildings and machinery. A representative  quantity of contaminated material and soil will also be  reconditioned in the course of the project.    The second pilot project is the Ilsenburg copper mill, which  is contaminated with a high level of heavy metals, dioxins, and  furans, as is the area surrounding it. An initial DM4.2 million  will be spent in the first stage on developing reliable  processes for decontaminating factory buildings that cannot be  demolished in the normal way.    The third site is the "Great Zichow Hollow," a sink still in  use as late as 1989 as a hazardous waste dump for solid,  viscous, and fluid waste. As it has no underseal, it poses a  hazard to the groundwater and the surrounding drinking water  conservation area. In addition to securing the sink to avert  this danger, the first phase of the project will draw up a  strategy for decontaminating the solid and fluid waste. The  second phase will cover a partial reclamation of the dump by a  combination of various methods.</p>

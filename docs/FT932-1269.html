			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Greenalls bids to expand its pub chain GREENALLS, the UK pubs and hotels group, yesterday made an agreed Pounds 214.3m offer for JA Devenish, the west country pubs group. The combination would be one of the UK's biggest independent pub chains with an estate of more than 2,000 outlets. The offer comprises one Greenalls share and 394.5p nominal of convertible bonds for every two Devenish shares. There is a cash alternative of 356.5p per share. The surprise move outflanked rival pubs group, Boddington, which had been considering another offer for Devenish after an unsuccessful Pounds 120m hostile bid two years ago. Boddington said it would accept the cash offer for the 19.2 per cent stake it had acquired in Devenish. It will emerge with a profit of about Pounds 15m on its holding. Mr Michael Cannon, chairman, and other board and family interests, have given irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer for their 26.4 per cent stake. Mr Cannon and his family will collect Pounds 26m. The Devenish chairman started in the business with a Pounds 30,000 investment in one Bristol pub in 1976. He later formed Inn Leisure, a small pub chain, floated it on the unlisted securities market in 1982, and reversed into Devenish in 1986. Whitbread Investment Company, which in 1991 backed the Boddington bid, remains a Devenish shareholder with a stake of about 11 per cent. Greenalls shares, reflecting analysts' views that its offer was generously pitched at 21 times historic earnings, closed 28p lower yesterday at 358p. Devenish added 85p to 367p; and Boddington gained 13p to 286p. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls chairman and chief executive, said: 'The acquisition will strengthen the group's market position and provide it with additional purchasing power, an increasingly important factor in negotiating beer supplies from national brewers.' Greenalls would gain greater geographical spread from the deal. Its 1,450 pubs, many of them specialist food outlets, are concentrated mainly in north-west England and the Midlands. The Devenish estate of 550 pubs - 115 of them leased from Whitbread, the brewer - is largely based in the south-west. Greenalls pubs made operating profits last year of Pounds 56m; Devenish reported 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 24</p>

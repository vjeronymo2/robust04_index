			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Chinese stocks lose their shine  -Caution is the watchword The first flush of enthusiasm for 'China Inc' that was so much in evidence last year has given way to caution. Since the beginning of the year the share prices of the first clutch of Chinese state companies listed in Hong Kong - the H-share companies - have come under pressure, which has become especially acute as they have reported their earnings over the last two weeks. Since the beginning of the year, the Hang Seng Index has fallen 31 per cent. But the share price of Guangzhou Shipyard has slumped 54 per cent, and those of Maanshan Iron and Steel and Shanghai Petrochemical by 45 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. Only Tsingtao Brewery has outperformed the market, falling by 29 per cent since the start of the year. Mr Ravi Narin, head of Hong Kong research at Peregrine Securities, a local brokerage, says: 'We've told investors to sell all of them. They had been pushed up to ridiculous levels. We don't like them on relative valuation basis; we have questions about their currency exposure; and their managements and businesses are largely unknown.' In spite of impressive-looking earnings reports for the H-share companies - Maanshan's profits rose 431 per cent and Tsingtao Brewery's rose more than 300 per cent - investors looking ahead to an uncertain year in China and studying the fine print of the reports are concerned. Investors have also been taken aback by some novel accounting practices  - such as taking 'below the line' items which a western company might allocate above it, such as welfare provisions akin to funding a pension scheme. There is a growing appreciation among the financial community that the mainland is poised for a sharp slowdown in economic activity. Also causing concern are signs that the Chinese government's policy of economic retrenchment has begun to bite, showing up in the sharp, and to some alarming, rise in debts owed to the H-share companies. Mr CY Ho, head of China research at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, says: 'In the past it was a question of 'why bother to offend people?' If you did not collect receivables you just made borrowings - it was the same thing. Now it's a different story. The H-share companies have become alien to other state-owned enterprises; they are forcing them to pay back their debts, so relations are not going to be that smooth in 1994.' The brokerage calculates the increase in debtors has outstripped the growth in sales at four of the six companies - Beiren Printing, Kunming Machinery, Maanshan Iron and Steel and, most dramatically, Tsingtao Brewery where a 35 per cent increase in sales year-on-year has resulted in a 230 per cent jump in money owed to it. Mr Ho says difficulties in debt collection can be exacerbated by the very privatised status which underlines H-share companies' accountability to shareholders. In China the companies are perceived to be cash rich and, as such, come bottom of the list to be paid off. But it also reflects a systemic problem in corporate China. State owned companies across the board are floundering, giving rise to the re-emergence of 'triangular debt'. This is a peculiarly Chinese phenomenon which afflicts the state-owned sector and was meant to have been eradicated by Mr Zhu Rongji, now China's economics minister, after a high-profile attack on the problem in 1992. The inability of one company to pay its debts feeds straight through the system of corporate relationships: company A cannot pay back company B until it receives payments from company C. Those companies with cash are making loans to each other, commanding interest rates in excess of 25 per cent. Tsingtao has lent a total Yn263m (USDollars 20m) to other Chinese companies. Another aspect of the latest H-share reports which has raised eyebrows is the treatment of certain transfers from the profit and loss account. The H-share companies are required to transfer 10 per cent of their after-tax profits (before distribution to shareholders) to a 'collective welfare fund' and another 10 per cent to a 'statutory surplus reserve', a form of compulsory retained earnings. H-share companies have to accumulate these reserves until they equal half the paid up capital of the company. The 'collective welfare fund', which is also defined as 'shareholders' funds' is for the benefit of the work force. All of the H-share companies are the creations of merchant bankers and had no independent existence before the Chinese government decided they would be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Companies such as Shanghai Petrochemical and Maanshan Iron and Steel were (and still are) industrial towns with integrated social services which the welfare funds support. It is a fine point whether the collective welfare fund should be treated as an expense, and therefore above the line, as it represents some of the costs of doing business in China for these companies. In any event, it appears that the heyday for H-share companies is over for the time being. The interest generated in China stocks was partly due to their scarcity, but their rarity value is about to be eroded as 22 more state companies are listed in Hong Kong - 17 of which will have their primary quotation in the colony. In a market notorious for its short-termism, stock market analysts now say that mainland companies are for those investors with a long-term view. That is Hong Kong's way of saying 'sell now and buy another day'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- China's companies in Hong Kong: Profits after tax (Yn m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1992  Prospectus     1993   Change on                              actual    for 1993   actual    1992 (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Maanshan Iron and Steel       407.5       1,250  1,758.0     431 Shanghai Petrochemical        443.0         848    870.0      96 Tsingtao Brewery               45.1         193    187.8     316 Guangzhou Shipyard             67.7          85    105.6      56 Beiren Machinery               42.2          85     83.8      98 Kunming Machine Tool           16.4          31     72.5     342  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: UK co-managers selected in Wellcome Trust sale Wellcome Trust, which is working towards the sale of the majority of its 73.6 per cent stake in Wellcome, the drugs company, yesterday announced its selection of co-managers for the UK tranche of the issue. The sale, which could raise over Pounds 4bn, and is being arranged on a global basis, is expected in the summer. The co-managers are James Capel, Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, Hoare Govett and NM Rothschild. Co-managers in other regional syndicates will be announced later. It is expected that a UK house will be included in the US syndicate because few US brokers have published research on Wellcome.</p>

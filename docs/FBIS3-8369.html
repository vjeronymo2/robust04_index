			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (AFP) -- Separatist Serbs in  Croatia's Krajina province denied Wednesday [9 March] having  shot at a Spanish Air Force plane used by NATO which was forced  to make an emergency landing on Tuesday [8 March].    A military headquarters statement carried by the ISKRA news  agency said the Serb forces had not been informed-of the flight  and had not even picked it up on their tracking equipment.  "Consequently, our units could not have opened fire on the  plane," it said.    In Zagreb, the Croatian Defence Ministry said the plane, a  C-212 Aviocar transport, was hit by anti-aircraft fire, but did  not explicitly say the Krajina Serbs were responsible.    Three of the five people aboard were slightly wounded. The  plane, heading from Zagreb to Split on the Adriatic, made an  emergency landing on Krk island near Rijeka port.    The NATO supreme command in Brussels said Tuesday the three  wounded were from France, Britain and the United States.</p>

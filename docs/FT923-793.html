			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Jail sentence for Greek publisher A GREEK newspaper publisher was yesterday sentenced to six months in jail for defying an anti-terrorist law which bans publication of guerrilla statements, Reuter reports from Athens. Mr Christos Tegopoulos was also fined Dr5m (Pounds 15,400) for publishing a statement by the leftist November 17 guerrilla group in his newspaper, Eleftherotypia, in 1991. Under Greek law Mr Tegopoulos may buy off his sentence at a rate of Dr1,000 a day and it was said to be unlikely he would go to jail. He was absent from the trial. The ban on publishing guerrilla statements, part of a 1990 anti-terrorist law passed by Greece's conservative government, has touched off a battle over censorship with the Greek media. Seven publishers were sentenced to jail in September 1991 for violating the ban.</p>

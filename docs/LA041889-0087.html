			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> CNBC, NBC's 24-hour consumer and business-news cable service, dawned Monday  with only minor opening-day problems -- a slight audio glitch in a live report  from London shortly after the cable service began operations at 6 a.m. EDT, a  10-minute stoppage in a stock-market ticker and a Wall Street report in which  correspondent Arthur Alpert forgot but then remembered to put on his lapel  microphone. NBC President Robert C. Wright called the venture, which cost an  estimated $65 million to launch, "the most significant programming effort NBC  has ever undertaken outside of the network. . . ." Ironically, NBC's new  financial news service can't be seen on Wall Street because CNBC has no  Manhattan cable outlet yet. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

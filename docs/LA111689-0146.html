			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGANS SEE THEIR WHITE HOUSE PORTRAITS  </P> <P> His hair shorter and noticeably grayer, his statutory authority gone but his  sense of humor intact, former President Ronald Reagan returned to the White  House Wednesday.  </P> <P> With his wife, Nancy, standing by, he took one look at their official  portraits, on display for the first time, and cracked: "They're sure different  than a lot of those cartoons we had to put up with."  </P> <P> Reagan was full of the jokes that he had used to spice his speeches throughout  his White House years.  </P> <P> "Well, George and Barbara and distinguished guests: As Henry VIII said to each  one of his six wives, I won't keep you long," he began.  </P> <P> "I can't really find the words to express how I feel to be back here in this  house," Reagan said. "Maybe it's because my staff is a bit smaller now than it  used to be," he added, referring to the fact that he no longer has a stable of  presidential speech writers.  </P> <P> President Bush said that Reagan's likeness "reflects the qualities that make  him so special -- kindness, gallantry, decency and humor."  </P> <P> Bush proved himself gallant as well in describing Mrs. Reagan's portrait.  </P> <P> "Here stands a person who refurbished the White House with grace and with  elegance," he said, "who helped millions of Americans say 'no' to drugs and  started what has become a real crusade across our country -- thank God: No to  drugs and yes to life."  </P> <P> After the ceremony ended, Reagan squeezed in one more story, this one from a  state dinner honoring French President Francois Mitterrand and his wife,  Danielle.  </P> <P> Mrs. Mitterrand said something to him twice in French, and Reagan asked an  interpreter to tell him what she had said. "I was standing on her gown," he  recalled.  </P> <P> The separate portraits of the Reagans were painted in oil by Aaron Shikler of  New York. The former President's will be hung on the first floor of the White  House. Mrs. Reagan's will be hung one floor below, on the ground floor.  </P> <P> The portrait ceremony was the final event in a day that found the Reagans going  from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other. On Capitol Hill, he drew a  cheering crowd of 1,500 at the noon dedication of the Ronald Reagan Republican  Center, headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  </P> <P> Reagan had lunch at the Commerce Department and stopped in southeast Washington  at the Martin Luther King Elementary School, which he "adopted" in 1983 at the  same time that he chose Rudolph Hines, then 7, as a pen pal. Reagan told about  200 youngsters to "study hard . . . be good friends and neighbors . . . tell  your parents what you learn and ask them to help you."  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil set to approve coffee relief package A ROLL-over of Dollars 276m in debt and CrDollars 240b (Dollars 102m) in new financing for the 1992-93 crop are the centrepieces of a government package to boost the Brazilian coffee sector. The measures await approval by the National Monetary Council, which is scheduled to meet today. The length of debt refinancing will depend on the nature and source of the original loan. For some, payments may be extended for up to five years. New credit will be awarded on the basis of productivity and will favour those who did not receive loans for the 1991-92 harvest. Growers who did not receive credit last season and who produce fewer than 45 bags (60 kg each) per hectare will have access to financing of CrDollars 11,000 per bag; those whose production is between 45 and 90 bags will be able to borrow up to CrDollars 13,000 per bag, and those who harvest more than 90 bags per hectare can obtain funding of up to CrDollars 15,000 per bag. Mr Suelly Evandro Amarante, president of the National Coffee Council (CNC), a producers association, hailed the measures as 'highly positive' and 'an important beginning' for a recuperation of the sector. However, he believes the amount of new credit is insufficient. The CNC is also lobbying for additional measures, including tax reductions and port reforms to ease exports. Mr Amarante stressed that domestic measures alone could not solve the problems of Brazilian coffee producers.</p>

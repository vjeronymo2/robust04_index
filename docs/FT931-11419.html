			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Italy's balances of payments deficit quadruples Italy's balance of payments deficit quadrupled in 1992 despite an improvement in the final quarter following the September float of the lira, writes Robert Graham. The 1992 payments deficit was L32,549bn (Pounds 14.5bn) compared with L8,571bn in 1991. The deterioration, reflecting an overvalued lira, is even more marked when measured against the 1990 surplus of L15,156bn. The worst month was September when the monthly deficit reached L29,000bn after the massive lira support operation. But from October Italy began to record a surplus again.</p>

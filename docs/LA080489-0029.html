			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: WILL IT COVER LAUGH LINES?  </P> <P> The announcement about a fashion collection with Tammy Faye Bakker's name on it  prompted us to call the Designer Boutique in Orlando, Fla., the one shop in the  world that carries the label. Shop owner Ken Coppersmith told us that he and  Bakker are friends and have been talking about this for some time. But, he  explained, she doesn't actually design the clothes. She gives them her OK, once  they're ready for the shop, he explained. The actual work is done by a local  talent whose name Coppersmith will not reveal. He says the first Tammy Faye  collection has been in his store for several weeks and includes a cloak and  some casual outfits in pastel colors, priced from $70 to $160. "There's a  jumpsuit on the drawing board now," he adds. Next is a cosmetics line with  Bakker's name on it, Coppersmith says. It will replace the one that was  discontinued when Tammy Faye's husband, Jim, resigned amid controversy from his  post as the head of the PTL (Praise the Lord) television ministry and theme  park.  </P> <P> After-Hours Shopping  </P> <P> There was a tap at the door. It was 6:25 p.m., and the store was already  closed. Valerie Seres, manager of Fred Hayman's women's department, peered  through the glass and recognized Meryl Streep. "Are you closed?" Streep asked.  Seres replied in the affirmative, as she opened the double French doors. The  actress was in search of a bottle of 273, the store's signature perfume, which  her mother had requested as a birthday gift. At the same time, Streep, who is  in town making a movie version of Carrie Fisher's novel, "Post Cards From the  Edge," treated herself to a bottle of spray cologne.  </P> <P> Smile While You Work Out  </P> <P> Apparently the Soviets get a kick out of aerobics. And they want everybody to  know it. So this week at the new Mezzeplex sports complex in West Los Angeles,  Soviet officials signed an agreement to participate in the International  Competitive Aerobics Federation Championship in 1990. Oleg Belik, deputy head  of international relations for the Soviet state sports department, was  accompanied by a team of Soviet aerobicizers clad in red Reebok leotards. The  kids did a rousing round of one-armed push-ups and leapfrogs, and then Belik  told the audience that "Aerobics has a big future in our country, because it's  a very optimistic and democratic sport." He referred to it as being in the  spirit of the Soviet Union and added: "We are tired of gymnasts and acrobats  without smiles." Then he introduced the members of his smiling team, including  perky, blond Svetlana Rozhkova, the only TV star in the group. She brought  "Jane Fonda's Workout" to Soviet television.  </P> <P> Eyewitness News  </P> <P> In the movie "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," leading lady Meg Ryan grows older  and wiser. We know, because she starts wearing glasses. Her romantic interest,  played by Billy Crystal, is smitten by the look. And so are at least 322  moviegoers across the country. As of last week, that's the number of phone  messages left for the woman who supplied the frames. Cheryl Shuman, owner of  Starry Eyes in Burbank, says potential buyers cared enough to track her down  through Castle Rock Entertainment, the film's production company. As for Ryan,  she turned out to be as picky in person as she is in the movie. She looked at  more than 600 frames and didn't see anything she liked until she looked at  Shuman herself, who was wearing a pair of vintage glasses by Robert La Roche.  Now these $195 Austrian imports, with an enameled, marble-gray temple and an  adjustable bridge, stand a good chance of becoming the Sally Spectacles.  </P> <P> Penney for Your Togs  </P> <P> Latino teen-agers making their social debut, their Quinceanera, might want to  take a look at a special catalogue just out from JC Penney. It's filled with  clothes that meet the dress code at these lavish events -- voluminous white  gowns lavished with lace for the honoree, and pastel-colored bridesmaid-style  dresses for attendants. The catalogue is written in both Spanish and English  and represents one of the first attempts by the industry to accommodate the  Latino market directly, says Patricia Asip, national segment marketing manager  for JC Penney. Items offered range from $10 for a pair of finger-less gloves to  $100 for a lace gown.  </P> <P> In and Out the Door  </P> <P> David Hayes tells us "a funny thing" happened to him as he was on his way out  the door at Bullocks Wilshire earlier this week. Candy Spelling, wife of  producer Aaron, was on her way in and up to see his fall collection. She was  simply dressed in blue jeans, wore no makeup and was trying to look incognito,  Hayes was told later. The ever-shy designer didn't dash back to say hello, and  he doesn't know what she bought. If asked, he says, he would have advised her  to get the silk-rayon ("Rayon's not a dirty word anymore.") little black dress  with a jewel neckline and a dramatic hip drape. Why this particular dress?  Well, for one thing, "She could wear beautiful jewelry with it."  </P> <P> Fountain of Youth  </P> <P> Wondering what to buy the kids next? How about a bottle of shampoo? A slew of  hair-care companies have introduced baby-grooming products lately, with  no-tears guarantees. Paul Mitchell has Baby No More Tears, found in beauty  supply stores, while Redmond Products, available in drug and grocery stores,  offers tear-less Gramma Redmond's Aussie Natural Baby Shampoo. But the most  exclusive and extensive of the lot is San Francisco-based William &amp;  Clarissa's product line, sold here at I Magnin. Bubble bath, soap oil, lotion,  powder, sunscreen, lip balm and after-bath splash are available, along with the  shampoo. Prices are up there -- from $2.50 for the lip balm to $15.50 for a  gift pack with 2-ounce splash, 2-ounce lotion and 2-ounce shampoo. But at least  some parents are prepared to spring for the kiddie-luxe line. "With two-income  families, most parents can afford good products for their children," explains  Karen Mann, a company spokeswoman. "Because they can't spend the time they  might like with them, they will buy them something nice instead."  </P></p>

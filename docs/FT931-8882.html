			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Temple Bar net assets rise Attributable profits of Temple Bar Investment Trust fell from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 7.82m over 1992, equal to basic earnings of 13.57p per share, against 14.29p. The final dividend, however, is lifted to 8.75p, making a 13.25p (13p) total. Net asset value per share net of prior charges at nominal value improved from 269.81p to 310.9p. Net of prior charges at market value the figure rose from 270.88p to 310.76p. The board was more confident about 1993 and said it seemed likely that the year would see a modest return to economic growth in the UK. However, directors added that the recovery was 'unlikely to be without setbacks' and 'it would be wise to caution against excessive optimism'.</p>

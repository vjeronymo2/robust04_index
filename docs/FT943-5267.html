			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Glaxo Holdings - Other companies Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group is expected to report interim profits up from Pounds 1.67bn to between Pounds 1.88bn and Pounds 1.9bn on Thursday following increased volume sales of Zantac, its best-selling anti-ulcer drug, and buoyant demand for its respiratory products. The figures, however, could be hit by the group taking some of July's Pounds 100m bond losses against first-half profits.</p>

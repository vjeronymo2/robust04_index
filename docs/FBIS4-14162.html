			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher arrived in Cairo this evening as part of his current  tour of the region. He was met at Cairo Airport by Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Embassy staff.    As soon as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  arrived, a ceremony was held at Cairo airport to deliver  vehicles, given as the first part of American assistance to the  Palestinian police force. The vehicles were received by Dr.  Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, in  the presence of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and senior  Palestinian Embassy staff.    In a speech, Musa said: Christopher's presence gives us a  chance to welcome him, especially at this important stage in  which we are working to end the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement.    Musa said he was happy to be joining the U.S. secretary of  state and representatives of the Palestinian people in  celebrating the delivery of the first American contribution to  the Palestinian police. The celebration indicates that all  parties are ready to put the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles into practice, he said.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he was glad  to return to Egypt. I am looking forward to meeting President  Mubarak again and also 'Amr Musa, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, he said.    He added that he was happy with the arrival of the first  American contribution to the Palestinian police. The police, he  said, will be a basic factor in implementing the Declaration of  Principles. He said the United States is sure of this and will  help the Palestinian police force perform its duty in Gaza and  Jericho.    Christopher pointed out that the American assistance  includes  200 vehicles and spare parts, 100 pickup trucks, 50 personnel  carriers, and 50 bulldozers. He said the rest of the equipment  will arrive in the next few weeks.    Christopher said the donation, which also includes 2,300  blankets and 1,800 pair of shoes, shows that the implementation  is taking place. It is also a good sign that the Israelis and  the Palestinians are moving ahead with the negotiations to reach  agreement for peace in the region, he said.    During the implementation, Christopher noted, the tragedy  can  be forgotten and the creation of a new climate based on mutual  respect can be started. This step will be the response to  attempts by the extremists to harm peace, he added.    He thanked the Israeli Government for giving the donor  states  the chance to provide assistance to the Palestinian police.    He also thanked and hailed President Husni Mubarak for his  important role in the peace process and the implementation of  the Declaration of Principles.    In conclusion, Christopher said he hoped the Palestinians  would use the equipment to achieve its objective of bringing  about peace and reconciliation in the region.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th delivered a speech. On behalf of the PLO  and the Palestinian police, he thanked the United States and  Christopher for their valuable assistance. He noted the  importance of that assistance for implementing the agreement,  which is expected to be signed soon, on the entry of the police  force to Gaza and Jericho.    Sha'th said: We will remember 13 September 1993, the day the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and  will remember that two weeks later, the U.S. President invited  the donor states to meet. Those states pledged to provide $2.4  billion to the Palestinian authority to implement the agreement.    He added: As a representative of the Palestinians, who for a  long time lacked peace and freedom, I would like to emphasize  that these vehicles will be used to ensure security for the  Palestinians so that they can work in peace to build their  homeland, of which they are proud.    He stressed that the Palestinian police will respect human  rights, freedom, and democracy, and will serve as a factor of  peace and stability to ensure the well-being of the Palestinian  people.    Sha'th thanked President Mubarak and the Egyptian people for  Egypt's great support for the Palestinian people, backing of the  Palestinian negotiators, and help in deploying the Palestinian  police in Gaza and Jericho.    He also thanked Norway for its role and the U.S. secretary  of  state, who came to deliver the assistance. He stressed the  Palestinians' pledge to achieve the peace that serves the  Palestinian people and the peoples of the region.</p>

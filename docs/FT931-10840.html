			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amax ends year Dollars 284m in red AMAX, North America's third largest aluminium producer and a diversified mining company, yesterday reported a 1992 loss of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 1.71 a share, excluding Dollars 137m in charges for required pension and accounting changes. Including all special charges, Amax's loss for the year was Dollars 284m, or Dollars 3.27 a share. It was the company's first full-year loss since 1985. By comparison, Amax had earings of Dollars 30.2m, or 31 cents a share, in 1991. Amax's sales for 1992 were Dollars 3.7bn, slightly below 1991 levels. In the fourth quarter Amax posted a loss of Dollars 151m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 10m, or 12 cents, in 1991. The 1992 fourth-quarter loss included a previously announced Dollars 115m charge for downsizing and restructuring. Sales were Dollars 945m, up from Dollars 897m in 1991. Amax said its 1992 operating loss came primarily from deteriorating market conditions. Shipments of all of its businesses except aluminium were lower than 1991 levels, and depressed metal prices reduced revenues. The group's aluminium unit, Alumax, which usually provides two thirds of the company's revenue, had its first-ever operating loss as a result of Dollars 51m in start-up expenses on its new Quebec smelter. Mr Allen Born, Amax chairman, said he did not see significant improvement in metal prices early in 1993, although recent upturns in the US economy could improve demand and prices for Amax commodities later in the year.</p>

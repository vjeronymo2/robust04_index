The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry Press Service has revealed  that the enemy attacks were rebuffed and the Armenian military  units forced to retreat to their previous positions.    Reports from Azerbaijan's occupied areas said the Armenian  military units are being forced to maintain their attacks  regardless of the casualties they suffer. That's because they  are being fired on by special obstructive units in the rear  lines. Those units are made up of Armenians from Karabakh and  other criminal elements.    The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has informed a  correspondent  from [name indistinct] newspaper that the Azerbaijani National  Army units killed 318 enemy troops, destroyed six tanks, and  disabled seven armored vehicles and four trucks in their recent  combat operations.    Reports say that 850 occupation units were urgently  dispatched from Armenia to Azerbaijan's Karabakh region during  the past two days. Most of them have not even had preliminary  military training.    A wave of discontent and some disorderliness have been  observed among the occupation units in Karabakh. A violent  clash took place in Karmirgyukh between the occupation elements  affiliated with two political parties in Armenia. Several of  them were killed. Azerbaijan's defense units have reportedly  approached the heights near Kelbadzhar that are held by the  Armenian occupiers.</p>

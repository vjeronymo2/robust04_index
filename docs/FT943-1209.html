			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / IMF confident of accord to raise financial resources International Monetary Fund officials are confident that they will be able to finalise an agreement at their annual meeting in Madrid next week on a package of measures intended to boost the financial resources of the former communist economies and other less prosperous countries. A senior IMF official said negotiations were still continuing, but some form of deal would be reached, including an allocation of special drawing rights, the IMF's own reserve asset, an increase in the amounts member governments can borrow, and an extension of the Systemic Transformation Facility, which lends money to countries making the shift from communism to the market economy with fewer of the IMF's traditional conditions. 'On all of that there are still brackets in our documents and a lot of uncertainties, except for one thing: there is a very strong wish to come to a constructive agreement in Madrid,' the official said. But there is still a wide gulf between the proposal of Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, for a general distribution of SDR36bn to all members, and a plan by the UK and the US for a more limited allocation of between SDR12bn and SDR16bn targeted at countries from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union who have no SDRs because they joined the IMF since its last allocation in 1981. IMF officials said a SDR36bn allocation would mean Dollars 1bn more for Russia than the smaller allocation proposed by the UK and the US. Mr Camdessus argues that the larger distribution is needed to finance the rapid expansion of the world trading system and make the SDR a significant reserve currency. But some of the industrialised countries, especially Germany, have argued that there is no shortage of liquidity and that a large injection of SDRs into the world monetary system could fuel inflation. A senior IMF official said the US-UK proposal 'goes a great distance in the right direction' but said that a SDR16bn allocation would still leave the SDR's role among the world's reserve assets in decline. In addition, a targeted allocation would need a change in the IMF's articles. This would require ratification by national parliaments, and could hold up the distribution for two or three years. IMF officials said they expected the Interim Committee, a grouping of finance ministers that sets the IMF's policy direction, to direct a rethink of the way costs are divided. Because the administrative budget comes out of income from loans, the cost is entirely borne by borrower countries.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WHITE APPARENTLY LEFT UNPROTECTED BY RAMS IN NFL FREE AGENCY PLAN  </P> <P> Running back Charles White of the Rams reportedly is 1 of 600 National Football  League players made free agents this week in the plan imposed by club owners.  </P> <P> Each team was allowed to protect 37 players of the average of 59 on the regular  rosters and various reserve lists.  </P> <P> While the lists were not expected to be officially released until today, early  reports from players and agents confirmed what team officials have been saying  -- that long-time starters and even All-Pros might be unprotected in favor of  young unknowns with potential who might be grabbed by sharp personnel  departments.  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins, for example, left available 10 players who were  regulars last season as they fell from Super Bowl champion to 7-9. They include  38-year-old defensive tackle Dave Butz, middle linebacker Neal Olkewicz, free  safety Todd Bowles, center Jeff Bostic and Russ Grimm, a three-time All-Pro  offensive lineman who will turn 30 on May 2.  </P> <P> "I understand why they're doing this but it kind of hurts your ego a little  bit," said Grimm, who makes $450,000 a year. "Will I look around? I don't think  I'll look that hard but if the phone rings I'll answer it."  </P> <P> At the same time the Redskins protected cornerback Carl Mims, linebacker Brian  Bonner and running back Willard Reaves, all rookies who spent last season on  injured reserve.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'm worried about it," Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said. "I've talked to  each one we left unprotected and tried to explain it. I wish it wasn't just  37."  </P> <P> Others left unprotected include 36-year-old defensive tackle Randy White of  Dallas; Seattle's 34-year-old Steve Largent, the league's all-time leading  receiver; and one-time Pro Bowl linebacker E.J. Junior of Phoenix.  </P> <P> The NFL Management Council, which devised the plan, is optimistic it can  convince Judge David Doty, who is presiding in the antitrust suit filed by the  union after the 1987 strike, that there is freedom of movement for players.  </P> <P> "There's a ton of players out there," council spokesman John Jones said. "There  are some with several productive years ahead of them."  </P> <P> The system is an outgrowth of that 24-day 1987 strike, which ended with an  antitrust suit filed by the NFL Players Assn., asking the courts to grant it  the free agency it couldn't get on the picket line.  </P> <P> Gene Upshaw, executive director of the players union, said Wednesday that the  two sides negotiated on Super Bowl Sunday, trying to reach a contract before  the free agency system was imposed.  </P> <P> Upshaw said that at one point management negotiators offered unconditional free  agency for all players after 7 years, 1 more than the union is seeking. When he  countered with 5 years, Upshaw said, the owners toughened their offer to 8  years for wide receivers and running backs, 10 for linemen and linebackers and  12 for quarterbacks, punters and kickers.  </P> <P> "In no other sport is free agency based on what you've done," he said. "In  baseball, a guy who hits 50 home runs can't be protected, and in basketball, a  guy who scores 30 points a game can become a unconditional free agent at some  point, if he wants."  </P> <P> Many of the free agents are under contract. If they don't receive an offer by  April 1, they revert back to their old teams under terms of the old contracts.  </P> <P> Some unprotected players understood their positions; others had their feelings  bruised; others were philosophic, like like 29-year-old Billy Ard, a starting  guard for the New York Giants who said he would be interested in offers that  might bring him more than the $300,000 he currently makes.  </P> <P> "We don't give it much significance," said Bradley Peter, agent for wide  receiver Wesley Walker of the New York Jets, a former All-Pro who was left  unprotected.  </P> <P> "If he was 28 years old and left unprotected, I think we'd have his house up  for sale. At 33, realistically it's a business decision. We have been given  assurances it's not a reflection on their interest in Wesley for 1989 and we  understand and respect it for what it is."  </P> <P> The Giants also left unprotected nose tackle Jim Burt, wide receivers Stacy  Robinson and Phil McConkey, strong safety Kenny Hill, running back Ottis  Anderson and backup quarterback Jeff Rutledge while protecting rookie defensive  back Sammy Lilly.  </P></p>

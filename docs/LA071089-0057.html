			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Vietnamese immigrant who offered $5,000 in a Thai newspaper for the return of  his teen-age daughter abducted by pirates five years ago said he "has a good  feeling" his child is still alive. Tang Bao Can, 44, and his wife, Thai Thi  Loan, 45, of Santa Ana, placed an ad in the Bangkok Post offering the reward  for information leading to the return of their daughter, Tang Bich Hang, 18.  Can, manager of an auto parts store, said his daughter was taken from his arms  in the Gulf of Thailand by suspected Thai pirates, who boarded the refugee boat  in which Can's family and about 100 others were adrift. Can said he believes  his daughter may have survived because the kidnapers seemed "more human" than  other pirates who had tried to waylay the boat previously.  </P></p>

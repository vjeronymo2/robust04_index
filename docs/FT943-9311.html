			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Varenikov acquitted of treason A Russian court yesterday acquitted one of the leaders of the failed 1991 coup of treason. The court ruled that General Valentin Varenikov, former Soviet deputy minister of defence, and his colleagues had been 'guided exclusively by the state interests of the USSR'. The verdict is an indication of how starkly public opinion has shifted since August 1991, when Muscovites took to the streets to oppose the coup. In a further revision of the general interpretation of the events as they were unfolding in 1991, the court also ruled that former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was not a victim of the coup but, at the very least, a tacit supporter. This week's trial, during which even the prosecution argued for Gen Varenikov's acquittal, was another step in the public transformation of Russian hardline politicians from accused traitors to popular heroes.</p>

Helmut Werner, the new Mercedes-Benz chief  executive officer [CEO], appointed in May 1993, has great  ambitions. His company, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group,  will gain market shares in the future. Sales--down to 508,000  vehicles in 1993 compared with 522,000 the year before--are  expected to reach 570,000 vehicles in 1994, and between 850,000  and 900,000 in 1998, at the end of the five-year plan started  this year. Last year was difficult. The company lost money on  cars and trucks (trucks were already losing money in 1992).  Sales declined by three percent, to 64.6 million German marks  [DM] (about 219 billion francs [Fr]). They should rise by five  percent this year, reaching DM68 billion.  <H5>  Cultural Revolution </H5>   In support of this prospect, Mr. Werner indicated that sales  during the second half of 1993 achieved an annualized rate of  300,000, thanks to the Class-C compact car introduced last  summer. Apart from that, Mercedes plans to expand its line with  a van called Viano, a small convertible, an all-terrain vehicle  to be manufactured in Alabama, and a Class-A "mini" to be  introduced in 1997. Innovation in the product line is the first  direction of Mr. Werner's strategy.    The second one is structural reform. Mercedes eliminated  11,000 jobs in 1993 and will eliminate another 8,000 this year.  But this policy, in addition to "adding to the recession  spiral," is wearing out. Mr. Werner explained that, from now on,  they must take into account the productivity of capital, not  just that of labor. In other words, machines must be made to  work more efficiently. Mercedes will use three methods to  achieve this end: relocation--one Mercedes vehicle out of 10  will have to be manufactured outside of Germany "in the  intermediate term," compared with one in 50 at present;  increased subcontracting (60 percent of components in 1998  compared with 55 percent now); and, finally, cooperation with  other manufacturers. Mercedes is currently negotiating setting  up plants in Korea and in India, in cooperation with the local  group Tata.    This policy implies cost savings, which amounts to a  cultural  revolution at Mercedes where engineers used to rule the roost.  The five-year plan was reduced by DM3.3 billion, down to DM 18.7  billion for investments and DM16 billion for research and  development. Mr. Werner said he was confident as to the  capacities of the German industry which, for the new age,  "possesses greater potential" than its U.S. and Japanese  competitors.</p>

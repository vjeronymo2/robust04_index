			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: GETTING A FEEL FOR RIGHT KEYBOARD  </P> <P> I'm a fanatic when it comes to keyboards. I'm just not happy unless my keyboard  has the right feel and layout. Trouble is, what's right for me may not be right  for someone else. Choosing a keyboard is a very subjective process.  </P> <P> It's also an important decision. It's common for users to enter several  thousand keystrokes per hour. A poorly designed keyboard can slow you down,  increase your mistakes and tire you out.  </P> <P> So, the next time you buy or upgrade your PC, don't just take whichever  keyboard the system comes with. Try out several keyboards before you buy and,  if you don't like the one that comes with the machine, ask the salesperson to  substitute one you do like. Most PCs come with standard jacks that will  accommodate any of the after-market keyboards. Most important: Don't buy a  keyboard strictly on my or anyone else's recommendation. Try before you buy.  </P> <P> When it comes to feel, IBM keyboards are my favorite. Every time you press a  key on a genuine IBM keyboard, you hear a "click" and get some reassuring  "tactile feedback" from the switch underneath the key cap. Other firms have  come close to duplicating that feel, but no one does it like IBM.  </P> <P> Despite the great feel, I don't use an IBM keyboard because I don't like the  layout. Once again, it's a subjective opinion, but I'm not fond of where IBM  put the Control key.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there are some good after-market keyboards. DataDesk International  of Chatsworth and Northgate Computer Systems of Plymouth, Minn., make excellent  keyboards. Neither has quite the same feel and sound as IBM keyboards, but  they're pretty close. Both companies give the user some control over the key  layout.  </P> <P> The Northgate OmniKey Ultra comes with two sets of function keys. One set is on  the left just as it was on the early IBM PC. Another set is above the number  keys, where IBM and most other companies now place them. The keys on the left  work like regular function keys. The ones on top normally perform a  Shift/function key. They can be reprogrammed to perform like regular function  keys, a Control/function key or Alt/function key.  </P> <P> I like the Northgate keyboard, but my favorite is the SwitchBoard from DataDesk  International. I have one SwitchBoard connected to my IBM compatible and  another on my Apple Macintosh. That makes it a lot easier to switch back and  forth between the machines.  </P> <P> Like the Northgate board, the SwitchBoard makes it possible to switch the Caps  Lock and Control keys and to make the comma and period keys active even when  the shift key is pressed. But that's just the beginning of the board's ability  to accommodate user preferences. The SwitchBoard is designed so that you can  add, remove or move modules to suit your individual needs.  </P> <P> The basic keyboard, which looks pretty much like the standard IBM keyboard,  comes with three sections, or modules. Standard letter and number keys are on  the left, the cursor controls are in the middle and the numeric keypad on the  far right. But these modules can be repositioned, or you can add or substitute  sections.  </P> <P> The company offers an optional track ball for $149.95. A set of 15 vertical  function keys ($49.95) will be out soon, and a module with 24 programmable  function keys will be out by year-end.  </P> <P> The SwitchBoard has a suggested retail price of $249 but can be purchased for  $159 from PC Connection (800) 243-8088 and other discount outlets. Northgate's  OmniKey Ultra has a suggested price of $149 but is available for $99 from  Access Computer Technologies (800) 359-6800.  </P> <P> Northgate can be reached at (800) 548-1993. DataDesk can be reached at (800)  DATADES or (818) 998-4200.  </P></p>

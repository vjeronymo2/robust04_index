			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Italy tries to curb shoe imports ITALY is seeking to restrict imports of shoes, ceramics and silks from non-EC countries entering via Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. A letter to this effect has been sent by Mr Claudio Vitalone, the Italian trade minister, to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner in charge of trade policy. Sir Leon has already raised the issue threatening action against these three countries and the matter was discussed inconclusively in the March 8 Council of Ministers, according to the Italian trade ministry. Italy is alarmed that some Italian companies are taking advantage of liberalisation in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands following the January inauguration of the single market by importing direct from these countries goods from non-EC members. The main area of concern centres on imports of shoes, ceramics and silks - all items which domestic industry is extremely sensitive about  - from China, North Korea and Vietnam. The Italian move appears designed to put pressure on ministers of the Community to resolve the issue of third-country imports. In the meantime, Italy has given notice that it reserves the right to protect itself under Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome.</p>

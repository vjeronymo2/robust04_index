			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Merlin reduce loss to Pounds 104,000 Merlin International Properties, the property and investment company whose shares have been suspended since 1991, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 104,000 for the year ended June 30. Mr Peter Jevans, chairman, said that although results showed a very significant improvement, last year's figures included trading losses of Pounds 1.15m from the Trowbridge Shopping Centre development. The improvement largely arose from reducing the overdraft, containing overheads, maximising property income, lower interest rates and the ending of costs in respect of the dispute over the compulsory purchase order issued on the Deansgate, Manchester, property. After a three-year battle, the Secretary of State has recently issued his decision in favour of the group and has quashed the CPO issued in respect of the Deansgate property. Until his decision, Mr Jevans said Merlin had been completely 'frustrated' in its attempts to implement its strategy of a financial reconstruction, elimination of the overdraft by a share placing and relisting of shares. Mr Jevans said he looked forward to the very real prospect of being able to implement Merlin's plans which he believed would ensure a return to financial stability and the relisting of its shares. Turnover for the year dropped from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 2.99m. Net losses were reduced from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 232,000, equivalent to 11.1p (23.8p) per share.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Bonds: Adverse conditions unsettle Eurobond new issues ADVERSE conditions in European bond markets yesterday afternoon unsettled new offerings in the Eurobond market. Wednesday's huge Pounds 500m five-year offering for Hanson, the UK industrial conglomerate slightly outperformed a weaker gilts market, however. The deal was bid at 99.50, down from its fixed reoffer level of 99.71, which compared quite favourably with a  1/4 point fall in five year gilts, but prompted some speculation that lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston was supporting the deal quite heavily. However, CSFB said only a small amount of paper was yet to be placed. Meanwhile, two more offerings emerged in the sterling sector. Avco Trust, the UK consumer finance arm of US-based Avco Financial Services, launched a small Pounds 60m three-year deal, arranged by Warburg. The single-A rated company is not well known by European investors, who showed little interest in the transaction. However, the deal met some demand from banks: the company is authorised under the UK Banking Act, and consequently has only a 20 per cent risk weighting for bank investors. This means that banks which buy the paper have to hold substantially less capital against it than for corporate debt, which has a 100 per cent risk weighting. When banks purchase this sort of paper, they typically swap the proceeds for floating-rate assets. In the floating-rate sector, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society launched a Pounds 175m issue of four-year floating-rate notes via Kleinwort Benson. The deal met strong demand, partly because of a lack of paper in the sector. As a floating-rate note issue, it was not affected by the weakness in the gilts market. Abbey National Treasury Services acted as a co-manager in the transaction, the first time the treasury arm of the UK bank has taken such a role. An official pointed out that the bank had taken no underwriting risk, since its portion of the deal was to be held as an investment. Abbey National may take the same approach to other sterling transactions, he said. The move allows Abbey to own the paper at a lower price than it would have to pay in the market. An official at C&amp;G said the society had been waiting to tap the fixed-rate market for some time; however, the floating-rate market offered substantially cheaper funds than could have been achieved by tapping the fixed-rate market and swapping the proceeds. C&amp;G, which so far has Dollars 100m outstanding on its recently established Dollars 1.5bn Euro-medium-term note programme, will continue to keep an eye on opportunities in the fixed-rate sector. The surge of activity in the sterling bond market does not appear to be over, despite yesterday's decline. A number of UK companies are believed to be ready to tap the market. In addition, the European Investment Bank is preparing a Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m 10-year deal, likely to emerge next week. Elsewhere, a L500bn 10-year offering for the World Bank via Istituto Bancario San Paolo was considered aggressively priced. Even taking into account the tax benefits for Italian investors, for whom the name is exempt from withholding tax, dealers said that demand was likely to be subdued.</p>

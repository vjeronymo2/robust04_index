			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 2 -- The government has issued a new  ordinance permitting Vietnamese credit organisations to sell  shares to foreign buyers.    The ordinance enclosed with Decision 228/QD-NH5 by the  governor general of the Vietnam State Bank was signed to take  effect from Dec. 2, 1993.    Under this document, the state bank will allow any  Vietnamese  commercial stock bank which has had more than one year of  profitable operation [to] establish external banking relations,  and the governor general of the state bank will allow any  commercial stock bank which has a prescribed capital of 50  billion VND [Vietnam dong] (5 million USD) or more to sell  shares to foreign share-holders. Shares are payable by foreign  share-holders with the US dollar or other convertible foreign  currencies, but they must be converted into the Vietnamese dong  at the buy rate announced by the state bank at the time they  decide to buy shares.    These shares will bear the names of the foreign  share-holders  and register the value contributed on Vietnamese dong.    However, a legitimate foreign share-holder or his/her  replacement is only allowed to hold at most 10 percent of the  prescribed capital of a credit organisation, and the total  share-holding of all foreigners in a credit organisation should  not exceed 30 percent of its prescribed capital. Foreign  share-holders can join the managing council in proportion to the  value of the shares they hold, but they will not be allowed to  become chairman of the managing council, and a foreign  share-holder shall not take part simultaneously in the managing  councils of two credit organizations.    After holding the shares for five years foreign shareholders  are allowed to transfer their shares to others. The transfer  abroad of the annual dividend or of the property left after a  Vietnamese credit organisation is dissolved must be made in  accordance with the Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam and  with Vietnam's regulations on the control of foreign currencies.</p>

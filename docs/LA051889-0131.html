			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> TALKS ON SENIOR CENTER  </P> <P> Sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, the City Council last week voted 3 to 0 to  pursue negotiations with a developer who plans to build a senior citizen  housing complex and retail center near Main and 5th streets.  </P> <P> C. W. Development Inc. of San Gabriel was chosen over three other firms after  more than two hours of discussion. In deciding to sign an exclusive negotiating  agreement with C. W. Development, the council rejected similar proposals from  three other developers. One of the developers had also proposed building a  157-unit hotel on the site.  </P> <P> The hotel project, proposed by Main Street Partners of San Gabriel, had been  rejected previously by the council when Councilwoman Barbara Messina,  describing it as too massive for the site, voted against it.  </P> <P> Since council members Talmage Burke and Mary Louise Bunker must abstain because  of potential conflicts of interests, three affirmative votes are necessary to  approve a project at the site. Councilmen Michael Blanco and Boyd Condie  favored the hotel project, but Messina remained opposed, questioning the  hotel's economic viability.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> A LOOK BACK AT THE ORIGINAL BLAZERMANIA  </P> <P> The images of that magical June in Oregon 13 years ago still warm the hearts of  Blazermaniacs:  </P> <P>  -- Bill Walton ripping off his jersey and hurling it into the crowd after  clinching the title against Philadelphia.  </P> <P>  -- A sea of humanity estimated at half a million swamping the team in a  victory parade up Broadway.  </P> <P>  -- Walton pouring beer on Neil Goldschmidt's head as the mayor spoke at the  ensuing celebration.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers of 1977 were Portland's first and only taste of sports  success on such a grand scale.  </P> <P> The Blazers' return to the NBA Finals this year has rekindled memories of that  sunny day when this city became the basketball capital of the world, winning a  championship that caught Oregon, as well as the rest of the league, by  surprise.  </P> <P> "The team had never had a .500 season, had never even been to the playoffs,"  Jack Ramsay, the Blazers' coach that season, said, "so to win a championship  was kind of shocking and euphoric. I think everyone just delighted in feeling  the ecstasy of it."  </P> <P> Portland was in just its seventh NBA season. Ramsay was in the first year as  head coach. He came to town and promptly promised to build his team around  Walton, the unconventional redhead whose first two seasons had been checkered  by injury and off-court controversy that surrounded his counterculture  lifestyle.  </P> <P> "I never had any controversies with Bill while he was playing," Ramsay said.  "He was a great player to coach. He was very supportive of everything I tried  to do. He played hard at practice and was an intense player in games."  </P> <P> The rest of the Portland lineup complimented Walton's exceptional abilities as  a passer and rebounder. The power forward was Maurice Lucas, "The Enforcer"  signed when the American Basketball Association dissolved. The other forward  was Bob Gross, who often was the target of Walton's perfect passes as he moved  up and down the baseline.  </P> <P> The off-guard was Lionel Hollins, in his second season with Portland. The  playmaker was Dave Twardzik, nicknamed "Pinball" for his ability to bounce  through the defense toward the basket. Twardzik, too, was an ABA leftover.  </P> <P> The bench included sharpshooting guard-forward Larry Steele, streakshooting  guard Herm Gilliam, rookie playmaker Johnny Davis and power forward Lloyd Neal,  among others.  </P> <P> But it was Walton's team.  </P> <P> "The thing that made that team so good was Bill Walton," Steele said. "Bill  Walton was a great player, and he made other people very good. He was the key  to our success."  </P> <P> "Bill was magnificent," Ramsay said. "Had he been able to continue, I think he  would have been recognized as the best center ever to play the game."  </P> <P> The team had a 49-33 regular-season record and opened the playoffs with a tough  2-1 victory over Chicago in the best-of-3 opening round series.  </P> <P> Next up was Denver. Portland won the series 4-2, even though the Nuggets had  the homecourt advantage.  </P> <P> Next up was the Los Angeles Lakers, who had survived a rugged seven-game series  with Golden State.  </P> <P> The Blazers won Game 1 on the Lakers' court, then Gilliam came off the bench to  lead Portland to a victory in Game 2. Portland returned home to win two more  and sweep its way into the Finals against Julius Erving and the Philadelphia  76ers.  </P> <P> The Finals were rough. Philadelphia won the first two on its home court. Game 2  featured a melee ignited by Lucas and Darryl Dawkins.  </P> <P> "It was a physical game and both Lucas and Dawkins were the intimidators for  their respective teams, but neither was really a very good fighter," Ramsay  said. "Dawkins threw a punch at Bob Gross earlier and hit Doug Collins, his own  teammate, right in the eye. It was right in front of our bench. I couldn't  believe it.  </P> <P> "Luke came around later and threw a haymaker kind of from the side at Dawkins."  </P> <P> The two squared off but no further punches were landed. Both were ejected and  fined $2,500 apiece.  </P> <P> "My most vivid memory was of the fight between Lucas and Dawkins," Walton said.  </P> <P> "I also remember Doctor J saying he knew all of our sets and patterns," Walton  said. "But even we didn't know what were going to do. When he said that I knew  then we had them."  </P> <P> The Blazers went on to become the second team in NBA history to come back from  a 2-0 deficit to win the title. Lucas diffused the tension by shaking hands  with Dawkins before the start of Game 3 in Portland. The Blazers won that  contest 129-107, then swamped the 76ers 130-98 in Game 4.  </P> <P> "We had a long layoff (nine days) after sweeping the Lakers and we struggled  bigtime in the first two games in Philadelphia," Walton said. "And then the  fans in Portland got us going and we won four straight."  </P> <P> The series shifted back to Philadelphia, and again Portland won 110-94. When  the Blazers returned, thousands crowded the Portland International Airport  terminal for the arrival. The players could barely fight their way through the  throng.  </P> <P> "We Win It Today," screamed the front-page headline of The Oregonian.  </P> <P> And so they did, hanging on for a 109-107 victory.  </P> <P> The city erupted. There was dancing in the streets. The next day, it seemed  like everybody showed up for the victory parade downtown. Walton, the most  valuable player in the championship series, tried to ride his bicycle, and lost  it in the confusion. It was returned the next day.  </P> <P> "It was incredible," Ramsay said. "That parade was such a spontaneous thing. To  have half a million people there on Broadway. I don't think anybody who  participated in that parade will ever forget it."  </P> <P> The Blazers thought they had built a dynasty.  </P> <P> "We thought we'd be in that role for several years," Lucas said. "We were  looking forward to winning it on a number of occasions."  </P> <P> The following season, it looked like they were right. Portland got off to a  50-10 start and was the overwhelming favorite to win a second straight title.  But Walton and Gross suffered injuries and the team never was the same again.  </P></p>

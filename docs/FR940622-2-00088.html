Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The proposed rule change consists of a change of ISCC's clearing fund formula. ISCC's responsibility to the London Stock Exchange under the linkage agreement is to pay for securities delivered. ISCC has no responsibility to complete open pending trades. ISCC's current Clearing Fund calculation therefore is based on the ISCC member's average daily gross settlement debits and takes into consideration purchases due for settlement and purchases which have failed to settle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To cover ISCC's market risk exposure, ISCC has been collecting 21/2% of the average gross settlement value over two account periods (this 21/2% reflected the calculated market risk exposure in 1986). Because trades are executed in pounds and ISCC would be required to purchase pounds to meet the settlement obligation, ISCC also has been collecting a percentage of the gross settlement value to cover the foreign exchange risk. This has amounted to .5%. Since trades currently settle on a fortnightly settlement basis, the Clearing Fund has been calculated and collected on a bi-weekly basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the London Stock Exchange moves to a ten day rolling settlement cycle on July 18, 1994, trades will settle on a daily basis ten days after trade date. ISCC will continue to be obligated to pay for securities which are delivered to members in the event that the members are unable to complete their settlement obligation. ISCC still will have market risk and foreign exchange risk, but the period of time to which ISCC will be subject to these risks will change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To adequately cover ISCC's exposure, the clearing fund deposit will be calculated and collected on a weekly basis. The formula will be based on trades which are due to settle in the week following the calculation. Calculations will be made each Tuesday, and ISCC members will be required to deposit additional amounts within three days. This process will permit ISCC to collect clearing fund deposits prior to the settlement of the transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula will take into consideration the largest daily gross debit obligation, for trades due to settle in the week following the calculation, offset by a percentage for Institutional Net Settlement Participant (``INSP'') redeliveries. The debits will be offset only partially since these items may be reclaimed by the receiver, and in such circumstance ISCC will be liable to the London Stock Exchange for the full value of the reclamation. ISCC will apply a market risk factor and foreign exchange risk factor to this debit obligation. Initially the factors will be determined as set forth below and will be reviewed annually thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

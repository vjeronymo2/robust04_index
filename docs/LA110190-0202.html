			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING HAS 2 PURPOSES  </P> <P> Asking visitors at the Matilija Environmental Science Area to recycle bottles  and cans has a practical purpose as well as an ecological one -- it means a few  more dollars to buy playground equipment.  </P> <P> The nonprofit society has seen hard times and is not yet out of the financial  woods.  </P> <P> Although its lease with the county Flood Control District is paid by the  Ventura County superintendent of schools, MESA has always taken pains to  maintain its vast acreage through admission fees. In recent years, fire, flood  and drought have complicated its mission.  </P> <P> When the Wheeler Canyon fire roared through the area in 1985, many trees and  brushy areas in the canyon were destroyed. The following year, severe rains  created massive dams of downed wood, which blocked trails and played havoc with  attendance.  </P> <P> Since then, MESA staff members, on a volunteer basis, have gradually cleared  much of the debris and this year the California Conservation Corps has  contributed about 2,000 hours to rebuilding trails, said Tia Gatica, program  director.  </P> <P> Gatica said drought conditions have added a few complications, such as  canceling the aquatic studies program and making it necessary for her to have  to haul water to the camp restrooms so the toilets can be flushed.  </P> <P> The next step for MESA's future, as Gatica sees it, is more public support. She  wants to reopen the area to Saturday family walks, offer evening theater in the  campground and sell handmade craft items.  </P> <P> But she faces a Catch-22. The organization cannot afford to pay the additional  $1,500 of liability insurance to allow the public in to spend its money. She  worries about this dilemma, but projects that a way will be found to realize  the goal, if not this year, maybe next.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, she devotes herself to the program, looks for possible grants and  hauls water.

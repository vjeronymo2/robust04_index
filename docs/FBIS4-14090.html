			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- A Persian daily Wednesday  [27 April] lauded the heroic resistance of Muslims in Gorazde  and said such a withstanding heralds a bright prospect for Islam  in the heart of Europe. The daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' urged  Muslim nations and governments to feel responsible more than  ever and assist the resisting Bosnian Muslims through any  possible means.    The daily called on hajj pilgrims to raise the issue of the  oppression of the Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs during the annual  hajj rituals. It hailed the measures taken by certain Islamic  countries, especially Iran, in recent days to pressure the UN  and supporters of the Serbs in abating the Serbs crimes in  Gorazde.    This is indicative of the fact that both Muslim nations and  governments own potentials that, if used properly and on time,  can prevent numerous crimes that the arrogant front is  committing against Muslims in various parts of the world.    The editorial in conclusion called on hajj pilgrims to try  to  find suitable and practical ways for offering economic,  political, military and psychological assistnce to the Bosnian  Muslims.</p>

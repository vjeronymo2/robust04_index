			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / BA flights may face disruption Unions yesterday forecast disruption next weekend for travellers using British Airways because of industrial action among staff, including check-in and baggage supervisory workers. Some 2,530 of the 12,000 administrative workers at BA, where about half the total are union members, voted for action short of a strike, with 1,467 in favour and 1,039 against. The dispute is over a number of issues, including changes to terms and conditions of employment. The TGWU general union said that talks with BA were scheduled for Monday, but if the issues were not resolved action would begin next weekend. BA said it was not anticipating disruption at this stage because discussions were scheduled for next week.</p>

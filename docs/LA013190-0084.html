			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT HELD IN SHOOTING OF POLICEMAN;  </P> <P> CRIME: EL MONTE OFFICER ANSWERING ROUTINE CALL ON FORGERY ATTEMPT WAS  APPARENTLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE.  </P> <P> An El Monte police officer remained in critical condition Tuesday after a  routine call to investigate a forgery attempt at a bank ended with the suspect  shooting him in the neck.  </P> <P> Donald Johnston, 35, a second-year officer, was taken to County-USC Medical  Center after the lunch-hour attack Monday at an El Monte branch of Security  Pacific National Bank.  </P> <P> About an hour after the shooting, police arrested Nguyen Lu, 27, at his  sister's home in Temple City. Nguyen, who is unemployed, was being held in Los  Angeles County Jail without bail. He is expected to be arraigned today on an  attempted murder charge.  </P> <P> "What's so shocking is that this was not the type of call where you would  expect a violent confrontation," said El Monte Sgt. Craig Sperry, adding that  it was the first shooting of a police officer in that city in more than 15  years.  </P> <P> "Officer Johnston didn't even have his gun drawn," Sperry said. "You generally  wouldn't on a call of this nature."  </P> <P> Johnston arrived at the bank, near the corner of Valley Mall and Ramona  Boulevard, about 12:30 p.m. Monday, after bank officers reported that someone  was trying to cash a $1,000 check on a closed account.  </P> <P> As Johnston stepped through the first of two glass doors at the entrance, the  suspect opened the second door, police said. They met in the vestibule.  </P> <P> Before Johnston could react, Nguyen calmly pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic  pistol at the officer, fired once, and walked out of the bank, officers said.  </P> <P> "There was no exchange," said Sperry. "He just fired at the officer, stepped  over his body and walked out."  </P> <P> It wasn't hard for police to find him. Nguyen had left his driver's license on  the bank counter. Witnesses had also jotted down the license number of his  white Toyota, which was traced to his sister's Temple City address.  </P> <P> Nguyen surrendered without incident, police said. The pistol that officers  believe was used in the attack was in the car.  </P> <P> Relatives at the neat, one-story home on La Rosa Drive were reluctant to  discuss the incident, although they did say that Nguyen is a Vietnamese refugee  who came to the United States about 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Police said that Johnston is married and has one child. His father, Loren  Johnston, retired from the El Monte Police Department in 1987 after more than  18 years on the force.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOME SAY, HEY, MAYS OF '90S PLAYS IN SEATTLE  </P> <P> How often do the realities exceed the myths, even for a legend in the making  like Ken Griffey Jr.? With the Seattle Mariners' prodigy of a center fielder --  known alternately as "The Kid," "The Natural" or just "Junior," depending upon  whose turn it is to hand out the superlatives -- the actual surpasses the  expected and the rumored regularly.  </P> <P> It's just one of many traits possessed by baseball's youngest and newest  superstar that fall into the awe-inspiring, almost-frightening category.  Griffey has become a conversation piece around the league, the player opponents  gather around the batting cage to watch and about whom scouts and executives  run up long-distance telephone bills, swapping tales of amazing exploits.  </P> <P> "I always have people around the league calling me for confirmation of  something they heard Junior did," Mariners batting coach Gene Clines said  recently. "I'll tell them it's true, and then they'll say something like: 'No  way. No one's that good.' And I'll say: 'This kid is.' ... It's nice to be  around for the start of something big."  </P> <P> Indeed, the making of a legend is something to behold. Griffey labors in  relative obscurity here, though that will soon change if the Mariners sign his  father as expected. But his exploits have demanded notice and have prompted  comparisons to a young outfielder of four decades ago who also wore No. 24 --  Willie Mays. Mariners Manager Jim Lefebvre doesn't particularly care for the  parallel, but concedes he recognizes its validity.  </P> <P> "He's a little of this, a little of that," Lefebvre said. "I like to say  there's a lot of his dad in him. Junior and Ken Griffey Sr. really are quite a  bit alike. But yeah, the Mays comparison probably has some merit, especially if  you're talking about defense."  </P> <P> And Lefebvre does. He can reel off the memorable efforts of Griffey's brief but  glittering career: There was the nearly 400-foot throw to nab Robin Yount at  third base as he tried to stretch a double into a triple, the lunging grab  against the wall in Boston to rob Wade Boggs of extra bases and the  back-to-the-plate snatch of a Rickey Henderson drive that conjured the clearest  visions of Mays.  </P> <P> And, of course, there's this season's most celebrated defensive gem -- the  breathtaking ascent over the Yankee Stadium fence to pull in a Jesse Barfield  homer-to-be. That remarkable play left the New York outfielder with hands on  hips and a disbelieving frown as he stood halfway between first and second  while Griffey trotted past him to the Seattle dugout.  </P> <P> "That's why I like to play defense," Griffey said in his fidgety, apparently  disinterested way. "It's the only chance I get to make someone else mad."  </P> <P> Plenty of American League pitchers would disagree. Griffey creates plenty of  frustration with his bat -- a black Louisville Slugger that's the same model  his father uses, except that the younger Griffey has his weapons inscribed with  "The Kid."  </P> <P> Only a broken hand in July kept Griffey from being last year's AL rookie of the  year. When he broke in he was the youngest player in the majors at 19, and  posted a .264, 16-home run, 61-RBI campaign that was less impressive  statistically than it looked to first-hand observers. His grace afield and  smooth left-handed stroke warned of the coming of an era of dominance.  </P> <P> A September skid that saw him hit .181 may have been his condensed  searching-for-himself experience, for he has returned with a vengeance this  season. Currently, Griffey is batting .306, in the league's top 10. He has 17  homers and 60 RBI, and tops the AL with 151 hits. His 43 multiple-hit games  also lead the league, and he is among the AL's top 10 in runs, total bases and  slugging percentage.  </P> <P> He led the league's batting race for nearly a month before Henderson overtook  him, and he became the second-youngest starter (to Al Kaline) in the history of  the all-star game.  </P> <P> "The sky's the limit for him," said Griffey Sr., who recently agreed to go on  the voluntarily retired list to help the Cincinnati Reds out of a roster  problem but last week was waived instead. That should enable him to join the  Mariners soon to finish out the season playing alongside his son. Last season,  the two became the first father and son to play in the major leagues at the  same time.  </P> <P> The elder Griffey makes certain to catch himself before the fatherly gushing  goes too far. "Don't tell him I said that," he continued. "He's hard enough for  the Seattle coaches to deal with already."  </P> <P> Therein lies the problem -- or perhaps a charming key to success -- with  Griffey the younger. One of the most common words used to describe him is  "difficult." Those around him are quick to caution they don't mean he's a  troublemaker or a malcontent; it's simply that Griffey is only two years  removed from high school and shows it.  </P> <P> "He's not a bad kid," his father said. "I'm certainly not trying to tell you  that. It's just that he's not a student of the game. He listens to rap songs  instead of studying pitchers. He operates on instincts and ability, and  sometimes very little else. Once he matures a little bit -- and his mother  isn't sure that day ever will come -- he'll be a very, very difficult opponent  on a baseball field."  </P> <P> These are the kinds of word-of-mouth stories that usually are found to be  greatly exaggerated: A player doesn't know who the pitchers are. He doesn't  know who the opposing batters are. He can't distinguish good hitting mechanics  from a weekend softballer's stroke. Rarely are the tales borne out, at least  not fully.  </P> <P> With Griffey, though, they're almost all true -- or at least they were a few  months ago. He admits he really didn't know who Bert Blyleven was. He's  familiar with the repertoires and tendencies of only a few AL pitchers. He  concedes he really didn't know anything about any of the Baltimore Orioles  except Cal Ripken Jr. When in doubt, he plays a straightaway center field and  uses his extraordinary athleticism to compensate for any deficiencies in  positioning.  </P> <P> "People try to make the game too complicated," he said. "You hit the ball, you  run, you go after it and catch it. You might not be able to figure out what  pitch the guy's going to throw you, but eventually he has to throw something  across the plate that I can hit. It's a simple game, really. I know what I can  do."  </P> <P> That casual approach has led him to make more than his share of head-scratching  mistakes. During a recent series here against Baltimore, he swung at a  borderline-low pitch from Pete Harnisch after Harnisch had begun the game by  throwing 11 straight balls.  </P> <P> He gets picked off and throws to the wrong base occasionally. He possesses  great speed, but has just 15 stolen bases in 25 attempts. He has drawn 55 walks  -- a respectable total but not one that reflects the careful manner he is  pitched to in virtually every at-bat.  </P> <P> He resisted when Lefebvre moved him from second to fifth in the batting order  earlier this season, although he was immediately enamored with a later switch  to third. When Lefebvre first asked him last year to show up for early batting  practice -- a standard practice on his teams -- Griffey was alarmed.  </P> <P> An M.C. Hammer tape blasting through headphones is his preferred entertainment.  He's had a sports car since he got his driver's license and an immense phone  bill for as long as he can remember, courtesy of his father's generosity and a  family closeness that leads him to call home almost every night. His  youthfulness is unabashedly intact.  </P> <P> Yet Lefebvre bristles at notions that Griffey is a wide-eyed kid acting on  reckless instinct alone. He's quick to remind that Griffey is learning the  game, and learning it in the major leagues at an age when most players are  doing the same in college or the minors.  </P> <P> The metamorphosis toward a veteran approach seems to be taking place already.  Griffey says he has begun to note patterns in the ways he's being pitched. He  doesn't live by those observations yet, but that might come. He recognizes more  opponents, even if the purpose is a pre-game handshake rather than an intricate  working knowledge of their playing styles.  </P> <P> Might he even have a handy notebook full of information on pitchers within a  few years? "Nah, that would be taking it too far, I think," he said. "I kind of  like things the way they are."  </P></p>

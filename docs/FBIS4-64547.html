			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has charged that  certain circles are trying to circumvent the parliament in  undemocratic ways. She said: Nobody should be involved in  scenarios set up to protect the damaged interests of certain  business circles.    Ciller stressed that on behalf of the people, the government  will break the chains around the economy with the same  determination it has been displaying in defeating terrorism.    Addressing a True Path Party [TPP] meeting today, Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller, the TPP leader, pointed out that the  economic problems were not caused by the present government. We  set out on our path with determination, she said, in order to  solve the problems we inherited.    The prime minister said that taking excessive loans and then  taking loans to pay the interest on the original loans was one  of the reasons for the problem. She explained that during its  last term, the ANAP [Motherland Party] government was using  3,000-percent short-term advance loans yearly and that the  public deficit was at a record level. She then discussed the  incorrect foreign exchange rate policy pursued since 1987.    [Begin Ciller recording] It is an economic rule that in  order to keep the foreign exchange rate low, you must raise  interest rates to very high levels. However, this is an  incorrect policy. If you keep the foreign exchange rate so low,  you get a lot of foreign exchange in the country. You then take  that foreign exchange, change it, buy government bonds, make a  tax-free profit on the artificially raised interest rate, and  take that money out of the country again. Those who did that  went to banks abroad, deposited their gains, and took 100  percent or 200 percent in loans. They brought those loans and  foreign exchange into the country again, changed them into  Turkish money, and bought government bonds again. They then took  their tax-free profits out of the country again. This has been  going on since 1987. This was the vicious circle we had to  break. [end recording]    Ciller explained that had the low foreign exchange rate and  high interest rate policy been pursued further, the public  sector would have collapsed in 1995. She said: We would have  had to take loans at high interest rates in order to keep the  foreign exchange rate low. The taxes would all have gone toward  paying interest. We would have reached a point in 1995 where we  would have had no money for anything else -- not for education,  not for investment, and not for the salaries of the civil  servants.    The TPP leader pointed out that the import-export deficit  was  another reason why her government had to break the vicious  circle.    [Begin Ciller recording] Our decision to break this vicious  circle was not to the liking of certain circles who used to make  that sort of deal, who had brought $12 billion into the country  in that way, and who were waiting to take it out with the  interest. In fact, those circles are now waging a major  struggle. They are traitors. I am saying this openly.  [applause] They are traitors, because if this vicious circle  is not broken, the bill will have to be paid by the people. Who  is going to pay for the interest? Who is going to pay for the  bill of this foreign exchange rate, given the large deficit  between imports and exports?    Today, the honorable leader of the Motherland Party was  caught red-handed. He was caught red-handed. [applause] Mr.  Mesut Yilmaz is saying that business circles want him to topple  this government. What business circles are these? Are they  patriotic, medium-size business circles that were not involved  in these deals, did not incur losses, and then did not come  crying for help? No, they are not. Are they small business  circles? No. Are they the villagers? No. Are they the  shopkeepers? No. Are they our workers and civil servants? No,  they are not. Who are they? They are those whose interests  were damaged. [passage omitted]    The leader of the TPP is not the leader of the happy few.  [applause] The leader of this party is not elected by a group  of people outside parliament. This party has held its  congresses. It held two congresses during the past year. It  also participated in elections. Those circles who could not  make Mesut Yilmaz prime minister, despite all the treason and  all their intensive efforts, are now trying to circumvent the  parliament in undemocratic ways. Nobody should even try, because  the TPP, which has waged a democratic struggle throughout its  history, will never allow that. [end recording]    Ciller stressed that given the composition of the  parliament,  no government can be formed without the TPP. She said that the  TPP leader was not elected by an extraparliamentary minority  group but by the people's delegates at the party congress.    [Begin Ciller recording] Nobody should declare himself above  parliament. Nobody should even try to carry out a minority  coup. Nobody should be involved in scenarios set up  undemocratically and outside parliament to establish a so-called  government of technocrats or some such thing. This will only  serve to protect the damaged interests of certain business  circles. Nobody should make false threats in order to achieve  that. [applause] [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

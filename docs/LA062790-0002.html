			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK CARDINAL O'CONNOR'S WARNING TO CATHOLIC POLITICIANS  </P> <P> Cal Thomas posits that ultimate allegiance to God supersedes allegiance to the  state ("O'Connor's Moral Clarity," Commentary, June 20). He is, of course,  speaking favorably about New York's Cardinal John O'Connor chastising Catholic  politicians who stray from the church's abortion stance.  </P> <P> Curiously, this position also validates the breaking of laws by civil rights  activists and Vietnam War resisters during the 1960s. Then many ministers  believed that it did.  </P> <P> In this land of religious pluralism, each person has the right to define God in  his or her own way, or to recognize no God. If that person finds no organized  church that fills his or her need, he can form his own church. Taken to its  ultimate, Thomas' position could lead, on the one extreme, to theocracy to  restore order, or, on the other hand, to a complete breakdown and anarchy.  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Allianz shares fall after 'sell' advice SHARES in Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, dropped 4 per cent yesterday after the research subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, advised its clients to get rid of their shares in the Munich-based insurance company. The sell recommendation from DB Research caused the shares to drop by DM79 to DM1,872 yesterday, meaning Allianz's shares have fallen by more than 7 per cent since Tuesday when the company announced its results. Allianz reported its first-ever loss on its mainstream underwriting business, its figures blighted by losses in North America and eastern Germany. Following a presentation by Allianz to stockbrokers' analysts in Munich on Wednesday, Mr Michael Drepper of DB Research concluded that Allianz's earnings per share for last year were significantly overstated and so urged the bank's clients to sell. Such a sell recommendation is still unusual for the German equity market. It prompted an immediate response from Allianz, which put out a statement defending the way it calculated its earnings for last year. DB Research told its clients that Allianz's earnings last year should more properly have been DM26 per share, less than two thirds of the DM40.85 reported on Tuesday and a 40 per cent drop from the DM43.30 reported in 1990. The analyst decided the DM576m (Dollars 388m) loss incurred by Deutsche Versicherungs - the former east German state sector insurance monopoly acquired by Allianz for DM711m - should have been booked 'above the line' and not treated as an extraordinary item which does not have any effect on earnings. Allianz retaliated by saying the losses ought to be treated as part of the cost of the acquisition. 'We took over a state monopoly where the productivity was 35 per cent of the level in the west of Germany,' Mr Diethart Breipohl, Allianz's finance director argued yesterday. 'We have to incur costs (to rationalise the business) which none of our competitors in the east have to bear. If this doesn't count as extraordinary, I don't know what does.' Yesterday's events are likely to lead to further tensions between Allianz and Deutsche Bank, the two most powerful players in the German financial services industry.</p>

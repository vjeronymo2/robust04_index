			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Role in Italian rail wages deal Sir, I refer to the article by Andrew Hill, 'Italian rail deal raises wage cost fears' (August 9). In this the author does not state that I absolutely refused to take part in the negotiations and only asked the Italian state railways to honour the agreement made two years ago between it and the drivers' union when I was not a minister. When the Italian courts, for which I have great respect, decided that the agreement was valid and ordered the state railways to pay interest on outstanding payments and legal costs, I intervened as guarantor of those rights. I am surprised that as authoritative a paper as the Financial Times did not take the trouble to try to seek my views before writing an article which could be used to political gain, which is outside the scope of your newspaper. Publio Fiori, transport minister, Ministry of Transport, Rome, Italy</p>

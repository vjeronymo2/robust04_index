			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By restricting the inmates' access to collect telephone service, the amended regulations should help substantially reduce the possibility that inmates will be able to reverse the charges or have their calls billed to a person who has no intention of paying the charges. In addition, the ITS provides increased assistance in the investigation of criminal activity, such as escape plots or plans to introduce contraband into prison.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended regulations also enable the Bureau to prevent an inmate or group of inmates from calling a specific telephone number. By doing so, the Bureau can better protect a victim, witness, or other member of the public from harassment, and can better prevent calls that pose a threat to institution security and good order or to the public. The ability to block recipient numbers also helps the Bureau prevent one inmate from calling another inmate's family, a method of intimidation or extortion between inmates. This capability is not available under the former collect call system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, by ordinarily restricting inmate calls to parties identified on the inmate's official telephone list (28 CFR 540.101(a)), the amended regulations should help reduce the possibility that inmates will use the telephone to engage in criminal activity or to harass people who do not want to receive their calls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The amended regulations and direct-dial telephone service also provide inmates with several advantages over the former collect call system. Among these advantages are the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The amended regulations should facilitate more equitable access of the telephones for all inmates, by permitting the Warden to limit the maximum length of inmate telephone calls based upon institution conditions, such as institution population or usage demand. The ITS, which can be programmed to terminate a telephone call automatically after the expiration of a certain period of time, and which permits debit-billing from the inmates' trust fund accounts, should help reduce an inmate's ability to monopolize telephones, thereby helping to ensure more equitable telephone access for all inmates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Inmates may place direct-dialed international calls. This is a particular benefit to the large percentage of the Bureau inmate population (over twenty-five percent in June 1993) who are non-United States citizens with families in other countries. Many of these inmates had difficulty communicating by telephone with their families because telephone carriers do not always process international collect calls. Some of the inmate commenters acknowledged this problem by stating that their home countries did not accept collect calls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Inmates may place direct-dialed calls to persons who cannot accept collect calls because, for example, their home telephones have been restricted by their telephone service company from receiving collect calls, or their workplaces do not accept collect calls. Similarly, inmates may call offices, such as their children's schools, which may not accept collect calls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Unlike operator-assisted collect calls, inmates making direct-dialed calls have a greater opportunity to leave a message with the person who answers the telephone or, in some cases, on the answering machine of the person called. One of the inmate commenters acknowledged this by listing several examples of instances where he may not be able to make contacts through the collect call system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The amended regulations will help assist staff in contacting inmates' families in emergency situations. Because many inmates are serving long sentences, the telephone numbers and addresses given upon initial incarceration may no longer be valid. As a result, staff have had difficulty locating next of kin for seriously ill inmates, or in other emergency situations. The inmate telephone lists required by the amended regulations will provide staff with a list of up-to-date telephone numbers for each inmate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended regulations help satisfy the above-listed correctional management objectives, which are consistent with the statutory responsibility of the Attorney General, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. 4001 and 4042, and delegated to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in 28 CFR 0.96. Paragraph (p) of Section 0.96 empowers the Director to promulgate rules governing the control and management of Federal penal and correctional institutions and providing for the classification, government, discipline, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and reformation of inmates confined within those facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

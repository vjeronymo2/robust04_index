			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GROUP OF 7 MEETS TO DISCUSS HOW TO PROP UP THE SAGGING YEN  </P> <P> Senior officials from the major capitalist nations met today in Japan to  discuss ways of propping up the sagging yen, which has pummeled the Tokyo stock  market and may impede progress on cutting the massive U.S. trade deficit.  </P> <P> Monetary sources said officials from the Group of Seven -- the United States,  Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- met at a secret  location.  </P> <P> As the G-7 talks were under way, the yen's value fell to an eight-month low as  the rate of exchange rose to 150.98 to the dollar before rebounding slightly.  </P> <P> Tokyo believes the falling yen will lead to a burst of domestic inflation, but  the prescription of higher interest rates often used by central bankers to  combat inflation and prop up a weak currency is a risky one.  </P> <P> Officials at the Bank of Japan fear a rise in Japan's discount rate from its  current 4.25% could topple the Tokyo stock market, and perhaps trigger a  worldwide stock market crash.  </P> <P> But continued yen weakness could also lower the price of Japanese exports,  undermining progress on trimming the $49-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan  at a time when relations between the two nations are particularly tense.  </P></p>

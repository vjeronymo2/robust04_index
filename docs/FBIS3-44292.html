In an interview with a XINHUA reporter, Li said: The year  1994 will be the third year since the end of the Cold War.  Generally speaking, on the one hand, the international  situation is tending toward relaxation and the world is  accelerating its pace toward multipolarization. On the other  hand, however, the world still faces many unstable factors, and  the problems related to the two major concerns -- peace and  development -- have yet to be solved.    He pointed out that Asia, especially the East Asian region,  has remained relatively stable and has been enjoying sustained  economic growth amid this turbulent world. This is an important  special characteristic of the current international situation,  and it can be expected that East Asia's position and influence  in the world will be further strengthened in the coming year, he  stated.    By the same token, he said, one can expect the further  upgrading of China's international standing and the further  expansion of its foreign relations. Speaking specifically,  remarkable development can be expected in the overall relations  between China and European countries, and as the Sino-U.S.  summit has offered an opportunity for improvement in bilateral  ties, new progress possibly will be made in Sino-U.S. relations.  Facts have shown that there are broad, common interests in the  relations between China and Western countries which form the  basis of the relations between the two sides.    Li Peng expressed his wishes on the issues of Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan. He said: As the year 1994 is coming, the  dates for the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland  are drawing nearer and nearer. No matter what happens, we are  capable of resuming the exercise of China's sovereignty over  Hong Kong as scheduled, while upholding the principle of "one  country, two systems" and the principles already laid down in  the Basic Law, and also is capable of maintaining long-term  stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong and  Macao are closely linked with the China mainland economically,  the two cities will enjoy greater economic prosperity in the  wake of the economic development of the mainland.    Peaceful reunification of the motherland is a predominant  trend and is in line with the popular will, Li added. To be  sure, some people are still attempting to fabricate "two  China's," "one China and one Taiwan," or "one country, two  governments," all of which run counter to the historical trend  and are contrary to the common aspiration and fundamental  interests of the Chinese people on both shores of the Taiwan  Strait. We hope the Taiwan authorities will place national  interests first, and will do more practical work to contribute  to the reunification and prosperity of the motherland.    Li Peng said: I believe that the vast number of Taiwan  compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and overseas  Chinese -- all of whom are the descendants of the Chinese nation  -- share a common aspiration for the prosperity of the Chinese  nation, and all of us should continue to work together to  achieve this goal in the new year.</p>

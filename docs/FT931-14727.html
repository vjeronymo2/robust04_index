			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch discourage gold business  -Week In The Markets THE GOLD market is much more scared of central bank selling and currency fluctuations than anything going on in the Middle East. So said one dealer on the London bullion market, succinctly summing up a week in which Iraq came once again under allied attack and the Dutch central bank revealed it had sold 400 tonnes of the yellow metal worth more than Dollars 4bn over the last few months. Yesterday gold was fixed in the morning at a fresh seven-year low of Dollars 327.45 a troy ounce, reflecting market concern that the Dutch sales, which were equivalent to about 20 per cent of all gold mined in the western world last year, could lead to further selling by other central banks. Between them they have 35,500 tonnes in their vaults, which represents 15 years of production from today's mines. The Dutch action did not represent a panic sale, but had been taken after several months' deliberation, according to Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'It was premeditated. It was strategic, not tactical, yet the bank sold when the price was near seven-year lows. The gold market will be asking: which bank will be next?' The market reacted to Tuesday's announcement with relief that so much gold had been quietly absorbed. The price moved above Dollars 330, but its failure to hold above that level in the face of producer selling is causing concern among chart watchers. Gold closed at Dollars 327.85 a troy ounce in London yesterday, off Dollars 1.40 on the week. The gold market is not alone in being unfazed by Wednesday's allied attack on Iraq - two years ago the mere threat of air strikes against the country was enough to drive oil prices sharply higher. On Wednesday the initial news pushed Brent crude for March delivery up 30 cents, but the market quickly retreated, and the price ended the day unchanged at Dollars 17.10 a barrel. Production disruptions in the North Sea because of the bad weather should also have been bullish for oil. Instead, this merely underlined the weakness of the market. Stocks are high, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) shows little sign of staunching supply, and demand remains depressed. The Brent price - already down Dollars 1 since the beginning of the year - could decline further to Dollars 16 a barrel before the mid-February Opec meeting, some analysts predicted. However, yesterday in late trading the March price was at Dollars 17.57, ahead 25 cents on the day and 5 cents on the week, not so much because of tension in the Gulf but because of the Middle Eastern tour next week by Mr Alirio Parra, Opec president, in a search for consensus on possible production cuts. On the London Metal Exchange copper surrendered the gains made last week, when three-month metal was at one stage close to Dollars 2,400 a tonne on the back of persistent Chinese buying. But on Monday the Chinese changed tactics and sold heavily. Speculative liquidation added to the battering, and three-month copper dropped below Dollars 2,200 a tonne. Analysts said further losses were possible, and would not rule out a move to Dollars 2,000 a tonne. Last night three-month copper closed at Dollars 2,214 a tonne, down Dollars 157 on the week. The turmoil in copper unsettled the other base metals except for aluminium, which has been supported by news of a series of smelter cuts because of power supply problems at the Bonneville Power Administration on the Pacific west coast of America. A drought in the area has forced the BPA to reduce power supplies to smelters by 25 per cent until the end of next month. There are 10 smelters in the area with a combined capacity of 1.5m tonnes, equivalent to about 10 per cent of western production. So far five have shut down annual capacity totalling about 219,000 000 tonnes. Analysts suggested that any smelters which made cuts would not restore production for at least six months because of the cost and complexity of shutting down potlines. However, Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, questioned whether the closures would be sufficient to sustain a price rally when LME stocks were at record levels. He also suggested that the cuts had already been discounted in the price. Inespal, Spain's biggest producer, yesterday announced plans to close one production line at each of two plants for a year, but the news again failed to impress the market. LME warehouse stocks yesterday rose by a further 12,500 tonnes to 1.6m tonnes. Cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,215 a tonne, up Dollars 30.5 on the week. In London's softs sector, cocoa has moved above the key Pounds 705-a-tonne level. The mood in the cocoa market appears constructive, partly on chart formations, partly on talk that Ivory Coast is already well sold, and partly on the high level of grindings reported this week. Yesterday the US fourth-quarter grind was announced up 15.3 per cent on the previous fourth quarter at 84,962 tonnes. Earlier in the week the UK fourth-quarter grind was reported 18.7 per cent ahead, while the German grind, which was expected to show a slight fall, was up a surprising 17.7 per cent. Yesterday May cocoa closed unchanged at Pounds 728, up Pounds 25 on the week, as the market consolidated its gains. However, robusta coffee yesterday lost most of the gains made earlier in the week, depressed by a sharp fall in early New York trading.  -----------------------------------      LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS     (As at Thursday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +12,500  to 1,601,325 Copper      +3,425  to   308,900 Lead           -75  to   230,050 Nickel      +1,122  to    73,968 Zinc        +1,275  to   498,050 Tin            -40  to    15,640  -----------------------------------</p>

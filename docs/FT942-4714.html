			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic joining market valued at up to Pounds 83.9m VideoLogic, the Hertfordshire-based multimedia company, is to be demerged from its parent, Avesco, the broadcasting services company, and floated on the Stock Exchange via a placing and offer valuing the company at between Pounds 70.5m and Pounds 83.9m. Avesco shareholders will receive one VideoLogic share for each Avesco share. They will also have a preferential opportunity to participate in the placing, which is expected to raise Pounds 21.5m of new money before expenses. Some Pounds 13m will be available to VideoLogic to fund research and development into improved systems for full motion video on personal computer displays. Yesterday, Mr Richard Murray, Avesco chairman, said VideoLogic had been transformed beyond recognition since it was acquired in 1989 and its potential could best be exploited through a separate listing. At the same time, Avesco announced results for the year to March 31, showing revenues 4 per cent down at Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 23.4m) while losses rose from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 7.2m. Losses per share were 9p (2.2p) and the dividend is passed. VideoLogic had sales of Pounds 9m and lost Pounds 5.6m. Its results over the past three years have been hit by VideoLogic's requirements for research funding, totalling almost Pounds 10m. Following the demerger, Avesco is expected to have sales of Pounds 15m with pre-tax profits initially of about Pounds 1m. The net asset value of the company following the demerger will be about 18.5p a share. The demerged VideoLogic's shares have not been priced. Warburgs, which is underwriting the placing, will determine a price of between 55p and 70p through book building. The difference between the new money to be raised and available to the company will be accounted for by expenses, repayment of borrowings and the repayment of debt to Avesco. Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic chairman, and Mr Anthony Maclaren, managing director, are entitled to a bonus from Avesco on demerger, but have agreed to invest an aggregate Pounds 1.2m in VideoLogic shares, representing about half the bonus after deducting Pounds 250,000 each and making allowance for taxation. Dealing in the shares will start on July 6. Yesterday Avesco's shares fell 12p to 82p.</p>

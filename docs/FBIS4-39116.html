			<p>BFN     [Text] A Georgian Information Agency correspondent has  learned from competent sources that a meeting was held in  Chkhorotsku yesterday between voters and a candidate  representing the Traditionalists' Union.    About 70 voters attended the meeting, which was addressed by  Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Traditionalists' Union. He used  offensive terms when referring to the policy of the present  government, to Eduard Shevardnadze, and to rayon police  employees, whom he called traitors because they served the  authorities.    This prompted a negative reaction from participants in the  meeting. A large proportion of them left the building in  protest following a heated argument and oral exchange. After a  short while, a group of outraged citizens moved toward the  building while the visitors were still there. In order to avoid  a serious incident, the police fired several warning shots in  the air. The chairman of the Traditionalists' Union and union  members were forced to leave the building and then the rayon.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted in connection with  the incident. An investigation is under way.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> REFUGEES FLOCK TO WEST GERMANY  </P> <P> Refugees seeking asylum, particularly Yugoslavs and Poles, are pouring into  West Germany at almost double the record rate of 1988, the government said  today.  </P> <P> An Interior Ministry statement said 34,812 asylum-seekers were registered in  the first three months of 1989, compared with 18,527 in the corresponding  period last year. A total of 103,000 arrived in 1988. About half the 11,235  people who arrived last month were Yugoslavs and Poles, followed by Turks, Sri  Lankans and Lebanese.  </P> <P> The refugee influx has led to the emergence of anti-foreigner rightist parties  in regional elections, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government has  begun a crackdown to reverse its sinking popularity.  </P></p>

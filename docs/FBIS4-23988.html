			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lagos, 20 Jun (AFP) -- A Nigerian Government  minister has openly backed opposition leader Moshood Abiola in  his claim to be the country's president, in the first such move  by a member of the military-led regime. "We should remember  that in whatever we do in this country, this nation is more than  any one of us," Planning Minister Silas Daniyan said, according  to the daily GUARDIAN newspaper on Monday [20 June]. "If Chief  Abiola thinks that he can attain his political objectives  through his present stand, we will be proud of him too," the  minister said. [passage omitted]    "We cannot easily forget June 12, it will serve as a  constant  reminder of what happened and which should not be repeated,"  Daniyan said. "I am not against June 12, it has taught us a  lesson that we should never again in this country cancel a  well-conducted and accepted election". [passage omitted]    Daniyan had been a member of Abiola's Social Democratic  Party  (SDP), which was abolished like all the other democratic  institutions in Nigeria when Abacha seized power. He qualified  his support for the June 12 election by saying that he opposed  any move that could lead to the disintegration of the nation of  some 89 million, which has already seen a bloody civil war.

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Atom smash AMERICAN physicists are lamenting the messy death of the Dollars 11bn Superconducting Super Collider. Congress killed the project last week after spending Dollars 2bn digging 15 miles of tunnel under the Texan plains for what would have been the world's most powerful atom smasher. SSC enthusiasts claim its demise could set back by a generation the search for an all-encompassing theory of matter. The view from the other side of the Atlantic is different. European scientists - while not exactly wishing the SSC dead - point out that a Pounds 1bn machine planned by Cern, the 18-nation particle physics research centre near Geneva, could answer many of the same fundamental questions far more cheaply. From outside the world of particle physics, the demise of the mother of all big science projects looks like a golden opportunity to enter a new era of global co-operation. For too long the US has insisted on having national facilities in every field of research, even when these represented costly duplication of efforts elsewhere. The Americans have sometimes made gauche gestures of international collaboration - like the belated approach to Japan for help with the SSC - while insisting on keeping control of the project firmly in their own hands. A delicate gesture must now come from Europe. The 18 science ministers who are due to meet in December for a presentation of Cern's proposed new atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider, should announce their intention to convert Cern to a global centre for particle physics research. At the same time they should invite the US and Japan to join as associate members. Tact will be essential to heal the wounded pride of American physicists and, most importantly, to convince Congress that a small portion of the money saved by axing SSC should be spent in Geneva. European governments must not give the impression that they are simply after US cash, so they can cut their own contributions to Cern. Fortunately, the congressional language terminating the SSC told the US energy department to examine 'the feasibility of using SSC assets in whole or in part in pursuit of an international high energy physics endeavour'. The most persuasive argument is that US participation in Cern will give fruitful employment to some of the 1,000 physicists who have been devoting their talents to the SSC. It is not too late for the US to make a real contribution to the new European collider; one of the two giant particle detectors planned for Texas could be installed in Geneva instead. Ironically, Cern is in practice already a global facility. One hundred Japanese and 500 Americans already use its facilities as visiting scientists supported by their own universities. The time has now come to bring their governments - and others such as Canada and Korea - formally into the Cern fold.</p>

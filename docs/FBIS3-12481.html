In a statement issued by "the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads,"  Hamas accused Abu-Lafi (27 years) of having been "an Israeli  agent." It distributed a videotape of his confessions.    The incident marks a further deterioration in the relations  between the two parties, which are members of the Damascus-based  Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat.    Hamas's official spokesman in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal has  stated that the DFLP's protest against the execution of the head  of its military organ in Gaza was strange. He told AL-HAYAH  that the videotape and the confessions of Yusuf Abu-Lafi "were  sufficient explanation." He stressed that Hamas had given the  factions allied with it, especially the DFLP, the details  pertaining to that issue. He added: "It is the general policy  of Hamas to inform the faction to which an uncovered agent  belongs of the details, and it will continue to do so." He  emphasized that "purging the Palestinian factions of agents is  one of the important programs which all factions should  cooperate with it to fulfill."    The DFLP, however, has protested the incident and described  the dead man as "a revolutionary commander and a patriotic  struggler known to the masses of the Khan Yunis camp as one of  their righteous sons." That came in a DFLP memorandum  submitted to the APF leadership during its meeting in Damascus  last Saturday requesting an end to such incidents.    Before Hamas claimed responsibility for killing Abu-Lafi,  the  DFLP in the Gaza Strip issued several statements describing  Abu-Lafi as "an honorable struggler" abducted "while performing  a struggle duty." They accused the abductors of being "agents  of the occupation authorities" and threatened revenge if he was  harmed. [passage omitted]</p>

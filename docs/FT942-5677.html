			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Property: Tenant in the driver's seat - Developers are losing out in Berlin Chancellor Helmut Kohl's dithering over setting a date for the final transfer of the government from Bonn to Berlin is dismaying property developers. The industry believes the move could usher in a period of renewed property activity, boosting prices and demand. Initially, Mr Kohl said the transfer - decided by a narrow vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in June 1991 following unification  -would take place by 1996, but the move has now been postponed to the end of the decade. On Wednesday, the cabinet agreed on where ministries would be located in Berlin. However, because of soaring costs, not all ministries will be housed in new buildings, as originally envisaged. Many ministries will be put into old buildings which housed the former imperial, Nazi and communist administrations. The finance and economics ministers will move to the building which now houses the Treuhand privatisation agency (originally the headquarters of the Luftwaffe). The chancellery will be one of the few institutions to be given a new site, close to the former Reichstag parliament building. The sharply scaled-back plan will save about DM1bn (Pounds 400m), reducing the overall cost to DM20bn. This week's decision comes as an anti-climax for Berlin's property developers, which had been expecting a bonanza in either renovation work or new constructions, but at a much earlier stage. 'We cannot wait around for Bonn to make up its mind. We just have to get on with it,' said Mr Michael Spies, manager of Tishman Speyer, a US company which is building an office and retailing complex along Friedrichstrasse, in the Mitte, the old heart of Berlin. The government's decision to make Berlin the new capital of united Germany has had a big impact on property prices in the city. When the Berlin Wall was breached in November 1989, developers rushed to the eastern part of the city. Over the next two years, prices soared. However, the government's delay in moving to Berlin has frustrated the market, leading to a price correction: office rents in prime locations, which reached a peak in 1991 of about DM120 a square metre, have fallen to between DM60 sq m and DM70 sq m, and in some areas such as Leipziger Strasse, to as low as DM45 sq m. The question today is what impact these shifts in prices will have on investors. There are two broad methods of property financing in Germany. In the west, many properties are financed by open-ended funds - dedicated investment vehicles similar to unit trusts. The properties these funds purchase usually have a relatively secure rental flow; however, the funds have few tax advantages. Closed-end funds in the east were set up by the federal government in 1991 in a bid to attract investment in property in the region. In contrast to open-ended funds, investors in closed-end funds can set off 50 per cent of their investment against tax. 'The closed-end funds were attractive to people who wanted to benefit from the tax-breaks. But investing in property in order to save tax is often a bad move, particularly if the investor does not know how the property market works (such as in the east),' said Mr Guy Barker from property agents Knight Frank and Rutley Immobilien Consulting. There are about 200 companies operating closed-end funds in the east. Of these, 30 or so are big players commanding total funds exceeding DM20bn. Property analysts argue that the real weakness of closed-end funds is that fund managers cannot always promise a guaranteed return on the investment. 'Sometimes these funds are set up without any guarantee of tenants. There are not many investors who are ready to buy buildings which are not pre-leased,' said Mr Barker. Yet with the fall of property prices by at least 25 per cent over the past two years in Berlin, property analysts believe closed-end funds' investors - including many small investors with average holdings of DM50,000 - could lose money. 'The problem for these investors will emerge over the next two years,' said Mr Frank Schaick from Immobilien Consulting in Dusseldorf. 'Many projects are still being constructed and not yet let. The key for any small investor is to opt for a fund which offers a long-term lease.' Two other factors are increasing the pressure on the closed-end funds: first, strict planning controls in east Germany; second, a surplus of land available for development in the west, which could force prices down and prompt western-based business to reasses the need to shift east. Over the past year, cities in the east have started to set up zoning districts - demarcated areas for development - and have introduced planning controls. Berlin, for instance, is limiting the issue of permits for developments on the outskirts of the city. 'The introduction of zoning means that the investor will get an idea of where to plan, and will eventually be able to get an idea of where the key catchment areas are,' said Mr Guy Duckworth, from Healey and Baker, property consultants. Those who moved in early to some parts of east Germany might now be saddled with properties which offer little return on investment because of zoning restrictions. For example, the Fundis fund, one of the biggest closed-end funds in Berlin, acquired a building without tenants or rental guarantees, along the river Spreebogen which loops around the Reichstag. Today the building is still unlet, partly because rental expectations were set too high. But an additional factor deterring prospective tenants was the tough requirements of the zoning policy. Under this policy, tenants are required to undertake activities designed to build up the zone's infrastructure: tenants at the Fundis-backed building, for instance, are obliged to complement the Fraunhofer, the state-backed research and development centre which is located nearby. The second factor putting closed-end funds under greater pressure is that for the first time since the second world war, there is generally a greater availability of developable land throughout the country, especially in the west. 'With the effects of land reclamation, mine closures and privatisation the market is shifting,' said Mr Berthold Wetteskind, chief executive officer of Deutsche Immobilien, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. The privatised railways, for example, now have large plots of land available for development. 'The scarcity of land has disappeared,' he added. Analysts believe that the cost of land could still fall, perhaps by as much as 20 per cent. With more land available in the west and with the opening up of the east, 'the tenant is now in the driver's seat', said Mr Wetteskind.</p>

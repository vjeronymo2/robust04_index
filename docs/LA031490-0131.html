			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MATER DEI'S NO. 1 AGAIN; ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SPORT  </P> <P> Two years ago, the Mater Dei High School baseball team won 21 games with a  talented outfield of Mike Basse, Larry Sutton and Jim Austin, all of whom  signed with Division I colleges.  </P> <P> Last year, Mater Dei won 22 games with an equally talented pitching staff that  featured Tony Pena (12-1) and Scott Corliss (7-2).  </P> <P> This season, Mater Dei should continue its winning ways with a stellar infield  that Coach Bob Ickes thinks could be comparable to his previous outfield and  pitching stars.  </P> <P> Mater Dei, which finished second in the county poll the past two seasons, is  the top-ranked team in The Times' preseason baseball poll.  </P> <P> 1. MATER DEI  </P> <P> Shortstop Lionel Hastings, a gifted hitter with a strong arm, is the catalyst  of the infield. Hastings has made an oral commitment to USC and Ickes thinks he  will start for the Trojans as a freshman.  </P> <P> First baseman Jim McCarthy, sidelined with injuries the past two years, finally  gets his chance to play. Doug DeJardin starts at second base and Ryan Andersen  is at third.  </P> <P> "They're all Division I prospects," Ickes said.  </P> <P> Mater Dei, 6-2 with losses to Capistrano Valley and Irvine, is batting .350 as  a team. In the recent Newport-Tustin tournament, Mater Dei scored 23 runs in  the championship game against Foothill.  </P> <P> "Year in and year out, we're going to score runs," Ickes said. "But we've never  been questionable on the mound. We don't have a No. 1 on the mound, they're all  equal. We're just hoping for consistency."  </P> <P> Pena, the county's player of the year in 1989, is now at Arizona State. Three  starters -- Jason Deitrick, Colin Gawlonski and Sean Sutton -- are vying for  the top spot in the Mater Dei rotation. Mike Ferletic is the team's top relief  pitcher.  </P> <P> "I've used eight pitchers," Ickes said. "We knew going into the season we were  undermanned, but our depth could confuse some teams if we use the right pitcher  in the right situation."  </P> <P> Despite an inexperienced pitching staff, Ickes likes his team's chances  </P> <P> "We had the same question marks in 1980 with our pitching staff, and we went  all the way (won the 4-A title) that year," he said. "You just never know."  </P> <P> 2. OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> A trio of talented left-handed pitchers -- Randy Karliner, Jim Gwaltney and  Eric Schaff -- gives Ocean View one of the best starting rotations in the  county. Karliner won eight of 11 games as a sophomore and was a first-team  all-league selection last year. Schaff was injured most of last season but is  one of the most improved players on the team.  </P> <P> Shortstop Daniel Hernandez batted .378 and was a Times' all-county selection as  a junior last year. Few can match Hernandez's defensive skills in the infield  and he is expected to attract a lot of attention from major league scouts.  </P> <P> Coach Steve Barrett thinks Scott Caringella is the best outfielder in the  Sunset League. "Pitching, pitching and more pitching will be our strength,"  Barrett said.  </P> <P> Ocean View was the runner-up in the 32-team Loara tournament last week, losing  to nationally ranked Lakewood, 9-3, in the championship game.  </P> <P> 3. KATELLA  </P> <P> Returning all-league third baseman Dennis Briggs and shortstop Jamie Vitzelio  give Katella a solid infield. Katella scored seven runs on three home runs to  beat Servite in the third-place game of the Loara tournament.  </P> <P> "Everybody from our No. 1 to No. 9 batter is hitting the ball," said Tim  McMenamin, Katella's coach. Katella has a .375 team batting average in  preseason play.  </P> <P> Briggs is batting .647 with 11 hits in 17 at-bats in five games and newcomer  Eric Boyd has been a pleasant surprise in the outfield, batting .562.  </P> <P> Danny Allen, formerly Danny Kirker, is the team's top pitcher. Allen allowed  only two earned runs in Katella's only loss to Ocean View. Catcher Jess Evans  has made a successful transition from the outfield.  </P> <P> 4. SERVITE  </P> <P> Thirteen returning varsity players, including seven starters, should help  Servite turn around a mediocre 1989 season in which the Friars finished  11-12-1. Cliff Mierendorf anchors a solid pitching staff. Shortstop Ed Crippin  and first baseman Rob Walker are among the team's top hitters.  </P> <P> Crippin batted .362 and had 11 stolen bases last season and Walker, the team's  best power hitter, batted .464 with eight doubles. Catcher Ryan Boucher is one  of the top defensive players in the county.  </P> <P> "We will produce runs with power and a good bench," said Mike McNary, Servite's  coach. "We have high hopes for a turnaround season with every starter having at  least one year of varsity experience. We could battle Mater Dei for the Angelus  League championship."  </P> <P> Servite will play at Mater Dei Saturday in the league opener.  </P> <P> 5. TUSTIN  </P> <P> The Tillers shared the Sea View League title with Estancia last year and  advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. This should be another banner  year.  </P> <P> Two-year starter Dan Baker, who struck out 100 batters in 74 innings last year,  has opened with victories over Esperanza and Mission Viejo in 1990. Two juniors  -- outfielder Shawn Green and shortstop Ben Munoz -- are the Tillers' top  hitters. Green is batting over .500 in six games.  </P> <P> Tustin scored 54 runs in four games in the Irvine tournament and was held to  less than 10 runs in only two games all summer.  </P> <P> "We're swinging the bat pretty well," said Vince Brown, who has been head coach  at Tustin for the past five seasons. "The team is batting over .350 and I have  three players hitting over .450. I think we have the makings of the best team  since I've been here."  </P> <P> 6. EDISON  </P> <P> Consistently one of the county's top programs, Edison slumped to a 9-13-2  record in 1989 after injuries to its top two pitchers. Jim Futami tore an arm  muscle in Edison's fifth league game but returns healthy.  </P> <P> Catcher Steve Thobe, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound senior, has hit three home runs in  six games and has a fine arm. Shortstop James Eidam and second baseman Rocky  Balch return.  </P> <P> Three stars on Edison's football team -- Donnie Smith, Brian Higgins and Chad  Ponegalek -- also will play key roles. Ponegalek is the team's leadoff hitter  and has good speed.  </P> <P> "We have good pitching, speed and contact hitters," said Paul Harrell, Edison  coach. "After last year, the key will be trying to keep our pitchers healthy."  </P> <P> 7. LOARA  </P> <P> After losing eight of their first 11, Loara was the surprise winner of the  Empire League last year. Joey Gaudio is the ace of a solid pitching staff and  also plays the outfield. He won four games and batted .367 last year. Catcher  Chris Hoffman is the team's best player, coming off a junior year in which he  batted .333 and struck out only four times.  </P> <P> "We have eight returners with valuable experience and four quality pitchers,"  said Rob Megill, Loara's coach. "As our pitching goes, we will go."  </P> <P> 8. LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> All-county quarterback Todd Gragnano is equally impressive throwing a baseball,  and along with outfielder Tony Napolitano, gives Los Alamitos a strong team.  </P> <P> Gragnano won four games as a junior and batted .318. Another football standout,  Brian Havens, returns after batting .370 with 19 RBIs as a junior.  </P> <P> Napolitano is one of the premier players in the county. Last season, he batted  .427 with six home runs and 26 RBIs. "Hitting will be our strength," Los  Alamitos Coach Mike Gibson said. "We don't have much team speed and our  pitching is a big question mark after Gragnano."  </P> <P> 9. EL TORO  </P> <P> Four starters who combined to win 15 games give El Toro one of the best  pitching staffs in the county. Rob Johnson won eight games; Brad Hulse won  three games, and Greg Pearce and Ryan Filbeck each won two games last season.  </P> <P> "Pitching should keep us in all games . . . hopefully the experience will pay  off," El Toro Coach Dan DeLeon said.  </P> <P> Outfielder Bo Haley, a three-year starter, is a Division I prospect and among  the county's best players. Shortstop Chris Sauritch and third baseman Scott  Sebbo both have good power.  </P> <P> 10. EL DORADO  </P> <P> It is supposed to be a rebuilding for El Dorado, which won the Southern Section  5-A division title last year. Every starter graduated from last year's team  that finished 23-8, but Coach Steve Gullotti has a good group of sophomores and  juniors who were the nucleus of the junior varsity team that finished 19-6 last  year.  </P> <P> Pitcher Andy Brazeel has won four games going into Friday's league opener with  Esperanza. El Dorado had no problems scoring runs in the Loara tournament last  week, getting 11 runs in the first inning in a 16-2 victory over Savanna.  </P> <P> "We should be strong defensively and have more-than-adequate offense," Gullotti  said. "We will need two or three pitchers to emerge if we expect to win."  </P> <P> Others teams to watch: Anaheim, Capistrano Valley, Esperanza, Estancia,  Fountain Valley, Mission Viejo, Pacifica, Santa Ana, Sunny Hills and Trabuco  Hills.  </P></p>

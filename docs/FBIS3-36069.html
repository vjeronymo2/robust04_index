Reports from Afghanistan, he said, speak of continuing  clashes between different factions. Obviously, not only does  the emerging situation run counter to the interests of the  Afghan people but poses a real threat to regional security as  well, the spokesman said.    The official says Moscow is taking necessary steps within  the  framework of the UN and during bilateral contacts with states  concerned as part of efforts to step up international help  towards a political settlement in Afghanistan.    One of the elements of Russia's Afghanistan policy is to try  to get Central Asian states involved in multilateral efforts for  normalization in that country, the spokesman said. In his  words, appropriate consultations are now under way with  Uzbekistan.    A series of reports trying to gauge Uzbekistan's actions in  connection with the Afghan crisis do not reflect Moscow's  official position, the spokesman said.</p>

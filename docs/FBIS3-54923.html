			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Government on The Move"] </F>   [Text] One of the chief events that nearly all politicians  in Russia were expecting on the eve of the new year happened  practically at the height of the festivities. The decision who  will be the occupant of the Russian White House appears finally  to have been made: The prime minister's secretariat and other  government offices have already started to move to the building  of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet.    At the same time, we learn, the economic services of the  president's administration are preparing to move into the  premises that are being vacated in Staraya Square.    The plan that is taking shape, showing the locations of the  country's supreme organs of authority, looks both familiar and  symbolic. The government is increasing the distance between  itself and the Kremlin, as if stressing thereby the trend toward  autonomy. The familiar buildings in Staraya Square are being  occupied by administrative structures whose official status is  only very vaguely delineated in existing legislation but which,  since the adoption of the Constitution, possess real power in  the country, indeed the fullest power, including the potential  to influence the government.    Essentially, the relocation of the federal authorities  symbolizes the end of the creation of the new system of state  government in Russia, predetermined by the adopted Constitution.  A system of strong apparatus authority, in which not only all  the executive structures are under the control of the  president's administration. Suffice it to recall that  approximately a month ago an administration of affairs was  formed in the administration, and it has the right to dispose of  federal property, including the buildings that house the federal  legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. Judging by  the recently published presidential edict on state service, the  president's administration also decides the fate of all federal  officials, not only government, but parliamentary and judicial  as well.    Maybe this system will play a positive role at the present  stage, in the situation connected with the results of the  parliamentary elections. But there are too many fears that it  could soon turn into a closed, self-sufficient system, intent  only on remaining in power. In that event it is not  particularly difficult to predict victory at future  parliamentary and presidential elections for forces  ideologically close to the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] or the Communists. As a voters' protest against the  recreation of an essentially administrative edict model, which  was supposed to have been eliminated once and for all following  August 1991. But the chief paradox, it seems, is that such a  victory would suit the system.    Obviously, the delay in the long-awaited presidential edict  on the reorganization of the Council of Ministers should be  viewed in this light, in the light of the fact that the new  program for the government's activities will be determined not  by the election results but by the results of the referendum,  not by the distribution of forces in parliament but by the  distribution of forces in the President's Administration's  apparatus. The objective need for a reshuffle in the government  is brought about by the results of the parliamentary elections.  But the final decision will presumably be made after the  official cause of the defeat has been found. When it has been  established that the elections were lost either because of a  split in the government, or because of a badly organized  election campaign, or because of the government's incorrect  economic policy. Essentially, though, it can be said that there  is a struggle between the leadership of the President's  Administration and the head of the government for control over  the Council of Ministers.    But since the forces in this struggle can be regarded as  approximately equal, consequently one should not really expect  any major changes in personnel in the Cabinet of Ministers. You  can be sure that that the number of vice premiers' posts will be  significantly reduced. Probably to two or three. Of course, it  is too early to talk about personalities, but there are grounds  for believing that the distribution of forces that existed  before the elections will be retained on the whole. So there is  no reason to believe that after the reshuffle the government's  activities will change significantly or, equally, that its  economic policy will change significantly.    As far as one can judge from available information, all  cadre  decisions relating to changes in the government are planned to  be made before parliament starts work. Thus presenting the  deputies with a fait accompli, as in the case of the federal  budget for 1994. It is not difficult to imagine what  parliament's reaction will be. Deprived of a building and  deprived of the right of control over government and budget,  parliament is already programed for the role of center of the  opposition to the executive.</p>

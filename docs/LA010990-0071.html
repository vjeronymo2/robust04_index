			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: A LESSON IN VIRTUE AND REWARDS ON FIRST DATE  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS  </P> <P> A young lady who works with me said she had met a wonderful middle-aged man who  so excited her that they became intimately involved on the first date -- but  only after he had shown her the town, including dinner and dancing at a very  expensive establishment.  </P> <P> However, he had to leave her apartment earlier the next morning than she did,  and after he had departed, she returned to her bedroom to find $50 in her  dresser. Her evening of joy was suddenly transformed into feelings that  bordered on outright hatred -- "How could he do something like this to me? What  kind of lady did he take me for, anyway?"  </P> <P> The next time he called, one day later, she bawled him out and refused to see  him again.  </P> <P> Another lady at work said she would have seen him again so she could punch him  in the face.  </P> <P> A third lady, the ex-spouse of a multimillionaire, responded to the two younger  ladies: "I'm old enough to be your mother, so I'm going to give you some  advice. A lady never asks for money after such a romantic evening; however,  should a gentleman offer money, she never refuses."  </P> <P> Is the third lady correct?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Third lady? Miss Manners doesn't count any ladies in this  anecdote. Neither, apparently, did the gentleman. You, at least, made a  halfhearted attempt to convince Miss Manners that the person in question was so  felled by overwhelming passion as to overcome the circumspect practices of an  otherwise respectable life.  </P> <P> Miss Manners is not saying that you were successful. The mention of the  expensive evening suggests that barter was indeed in her mind. But there seems  to have been no such effort at persuading the gentleman, who therefore drew his  own conclusions.  </P> <P> Perhaps your young colleague believes that spending the night with a  near-stranger is merely a conventional way of getting to know someone better.  In that case, this experience should teach her that the belief is far from  universal.  </P></p>

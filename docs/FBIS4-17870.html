			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Schulman] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- Traditional friendly and  goodneighbourly relations between Russia and Azerbaijan of  centuries-long standing are not subject to time-serving  considerations, Azerbaijani Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev on  visit here told a session of the Federation Council (the upper  house of the Russian parliament) on Wednesday.    According to Guliyev, the historical task of statesmen  consists in preserving these traditions.    He called on the Russian legislators to do their best to  make  friendship and mutual understanding a leit-motiv of future  relations between the two countries.    Azerbaijan takes on an important task of establishing  friendly, balanced relations with the rest of the world and with  Russia in the first place, he said.    "In this respect, our general position consists in attaching  an irreversible character to the positive development of the  interstate relations; that is, these relations should not depend  on momentary, time-serving considerations and move onward," the  Azerbaijani parliament speaker said.    Azerbaijan pays special attention to forming a legal basis  of  interstate relations, involving various fields. The supreme  law-making bodies are playing a leading part in forming such a  legal basis and in this connection he expressed hope that  Russian and Azerbaijani parliaments would do their best to put  the bilateral relations on this authoritative basis, Guliyev  said.    Guliyev described current situation in Azerbaijan as  complex,  characterized by a drop in production, destroyed economic ties,  weakness of the financial system and other acute consequences of  economic crisis.    "One might try to get out of the tight spot on one's own,  but  one would have to pay an exorbitant price for such an attempt,"  he remarked. In his opinion, therefore, it would be reasonable  for Russia and Azerbaijan to join efforts for the purpose of  exchanging help and support.    Azerbaijan attaches "great importance to Russian experience  in implementing large-scale economic reforms, to cooperation in  the field of safeguarding human rights and creating new state  structuring", he emphasized.    Guliyev also spoke at length about Armeno-Azerbaijani  conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. In his opinion, the most  important thing now is to stop the bloodshed, to put an end to  the war because this will meet the vital interests of Azerbaijan  and Armenia.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EDBERG WINS DISPUTED MATCH  </P> <P> Third-seeded Stefan Edberg won two of three tiebreakers and benefited from a  disputed lineman's call late in the match to beat unseeded Jakob Hlasek today  in the quarterfinals of the International Players Championships.  </P> <P> Edberg won 6-7 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).  </P> <P> His opponent in Friday's semifinals will be No. 15 seed Emilio Sanchez, who  beat No. 10 Martin Jaite 6-3, 6-3 today.  </P> <P> Edberg and Hlasek were tied 6-6 in the third-set tiebreaker when Hlasek hit a  forehand volley down the line and out of Edberg's reach. After a moment's  delay, the lineman called the ball out.  </P> <P> After disputing the ruling with the chair umpire, Hlasek double-faulted, then  hit a backhand shot wide to give Edberg the victory. An angry Hlasek walked  over to the lineman and shook his hand before shaking Edberg's, prompting boos  from the crowd.  </P></p>

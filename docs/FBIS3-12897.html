'Arafat will meet with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Dr.  Usamah al-Baz, director of President Mubarak's Office for  Political Affairs. He and the Egyptian officials will discuss  ways to achieve the Palestinian demands that the PLO has set as  conditions for the resumption of peace talks with Israel. The  PLO suspended its participation in these talks because of the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal said  Egypt--President Mubarak, the government, and the great  people--has been and will remain the main supporter of the Arab  and Palestinian people.    In a statement to MENA, he added that the growing support of  the Egyptian and Arab nations for the condition of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories following the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre confirms Egypt's continuing,  pioneering role in maintaining pan-Arab security.</p>

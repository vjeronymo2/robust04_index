In a verdict released yesterday, the Constitutional  Court in Karlsruhe decided that the authorities must turn a  blind eye if cannabis products are procured or imported solely  for occasional private use and if there is no danger to third  parties.    In its decision, the Second Senate failed to specify the  meaning of "small quantities" and "occasional private use," but  placed the laender under an obligation to define these terms in  order to coordinate the procedure for adopting new rules on  discontinuing criminal proceedings. So far, only  Schleswig-Holstein has defined these limits. Schleswig-Holstein  courts consider a "small quantity" to mean up to 30 grams, on  the assumption that this is a one-week supply for a single  person.    At the same time, the Constitutional Court confirmed the ban  on drugs as set down in the law on anesthetics, thus rejecting  seven appeals from German courts that had said that permitting a  limited use of drugs might not be in conformity with the  Constitution, especially because of the different way of  treating hashish and alcohol.    According to the Constitutional Court judges, the difference  in sentences that can be meted out for the misuse of hashish,  alcohol, and nicotine does not collide with the constitutional  principle of equality. The misuse of alcohol involves dangers  similar or even greater than those posed by the misuse of  hashish and marijuana, but it should be borne in mind that there  are many possible uses of alcohol, most of them not leading to a  state of intoxication, whereas in the case of cannabis products,  intoxication figures in first place. Needless to say, there is  no "right to be intoxicated."    After a long period of time, the number of drug-induced  deaths in Germany once again clearly increased in the first  quarter of the year. The Interior Ministry in Bonn said that  the number of such deaths increased from 343 to 372 against the  first quarter of 1993, an increase of 8.5 percent. The number  of first-time consumers of hard drugs went up by 16.8 percent,  reaching 2,250.</p>

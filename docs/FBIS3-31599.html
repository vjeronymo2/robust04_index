			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] [passage omitted] There is an  internal political crisis in Slovakia at the moment. [passage  omitted] Ildiko Nagy reports:    [Nagy] [passage omitted] The preparations for the big  parliamentary battle did have one beneficial outcome: The  Hungarian parliamentary parties and the Slovak opposition sat  down at last at the negotiating table. We asked Bela Bugar  [also known as Vojtech Bugar], chairman of the Hungarian  Christian Democratic Movement, about the significance of this.    [Begin recording] [Bugar] The opposition finally understood  that it is not possible to leave out of this process the views  of Slovakia's (?15) percent Hungarians, of their legitimate  representatives. They were not even aware that while they  needed the 14 votes [of the ethnic Hungarian coalition], they  merely pushed the [voting] button; they did not even coordinate  with us.    We had asked for several things. In the end, we managed to  agree that the government--that is, the government coalition,  which would function until the elections, early elections--when  it is formed, will not conduct a policy of confrontation  vis-a-vis the minorities. Those methods that it will employ in  its minority policy, it will coordinate with the recommendations  of the Council of Europe.    I know that this is not a great achievement; what is more, I  would not even call this an achievement. But on the other hand  we must also realize a number of things. One thing is that this  government, when it is formed, will be able to function for six  to eight months. Now it will not even be that long. Because it  will depend on whether we manage to agree to get the Meciar  government, let us say, to fall within a short time.    The other thing is that it is in peoples' interest, as  voting  citizens, but I think of all of us, that Meciar's government  should vanish very rapidly from the political scene. One only  has to look: They privatize about 10 firms every day, which of  course brings in large amounts of money, and one cannot say that  the decisions are taken to the advantage of the voting citizen.    Another thing is that this government cannot alter the  political method that it has shaped here in the last two years.  This [method] does not satisfy a single citizen of Slovakia.    [Nagy] Will the agreement that has just come about between  the Hungarian parties and the Slovak opposition parties be valid  even if the new coalition government does not come into being?    [Bugar] Perhaps I could put it this way: I am convinced that  after yesterday's [18 February] discussions, and if our previous  steps are taken into consideration, I think that not only Jan  Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement] and  his people, but also the other political movements--perhaps with  the exception of the Slovak National Party--will be ready for  this agreement. So, I feel that by now a system has evolved in  which we can cooperate. [end recording]</p>

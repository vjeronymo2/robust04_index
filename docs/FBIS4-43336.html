			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  called on the union members and the shop stewards to advocate  more part-time jobs in Germany. In Berlin on Tuesday [14 June],  Kohl told the 15th Regular Federal Congress of the German Trade  Union Federation (DGB) that this is a contribution to the  reduction of unemployment.    The chancellor stressed that changing one's way of thinking  continues to be the dictate of reason. The greatest challenge  is securing existing jobs and creating new ones.    Kohl paid tribute to late DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer,  calling him a "great patriot." At the same time, he offered the  new DGB chairman "talks in the near future." The DGB congress  will elect a new chairman on Tuesday afternoon. The only  candidate is Metal Union Executive Committee member Dieter  Schulte.    The 600 DGB delegates received Kohl with some hooting and  booing, but also with applause. Labor Minister Norbert Bluem,  who accompanied Kohl, was clearly hooted and booed at.    The chancellor expressed his conviction "that we will solve  the social and economic problems in the new laender." He  admitted that the adjustment of living conditions will take some  years longer than he had expected. "I demand a clear priority  regulation for investments in the new laender," even if there  are problems in the west, the Christian Democratic Union  chairman said.    Despite the incipient upswing, Kohl thinks Germany's  problems  as a business location have not been solved. The efforts to  secure one's economic power must not slacken off, he said.</p>

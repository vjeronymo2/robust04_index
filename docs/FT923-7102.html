			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Cambodia powerless to prevent plundering of its forests: The factions that are selling a nation's timber as fast as they can to raise cash ahead of planned elections ON the roads leading south from the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, the logs seem to be everywhere: heaped in timber yards, lying on the verges, stacked in lorries or rumbling along slowly, one by one, on carts drawn by water buffalo. These days there are few large trees within sight of the roads. Shrugging off the risk of landmines, Cambodian peasants have brought the hardwood logs from the hills in the distance. Timber unsuitable or too small for the sawmill is sold as firewood or baked into charcoal in roadside kilns. There is no sign here of the Cambodian 'environmental ceasefire' urgently recommended by a report prepared for the UN in April. Instead, the world's timber merchants have taken advantage of the power vacuum in Cambodia to indulge in a frenzy of deforestation all over the country. The report estimates that legal and illegal exports in 1992 will reach about 1.15m cubic metres, more than four times the probable sustainable yield of 250,000 cubic metres. It also blames deforestation for flash floods a year ago and for the siltation of rivers and lakes. 'Following the signing of the Paris peace accords in October 1991, an unprecedented period of 'asset stripping' has begun in the forestry sector that is having a potentially catastrophic effect on Cambodia's remaining forest stocks and will further aggravate on-going degradation to the resource bases of both lowland agriculture and fisheries,' the report says. Cambodia's plight is made worse by the fact that neighbouring Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, after damaging their own forests, have imposed logging bans. 'People are forced to come to Cambodia to get their logs,' says Mr Rajeev Pillay of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Phnom Penh. The loggers can count on the inability of the Vietnamese-installed, lame duck administration to enforce such laws as there are. They can also depend on the eagerness of guerrilla factions to make the most of border territory they control before they yield their authority to the UN, in accordance with the peace plan leading to elections next year. Khmer Rouge guerrillas in western Cambodia - and their foreign business partners - are among the worst offenders. 'Is there anything wrong with buying wood from Cambodia?' a Thai buyer on the border was quoted by Reuters as saying recently. 'Or do you just want us to sit idle and allow the Singaporeans and Japanese to come in and take it all before the election?' The report, prepared for the Earth Summit, identified Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and France as buyers of Cambodian timber. Nor have Cambodians failed to notice the accelerating deforestation of their homeland. The report says some refugees have been disoriented on returning home by denuded forested areas made 'as bald as a monk's head'. However, it will be difficult to translate their concern into action until an effective government is in power. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the transitional Supreme National Council, which embraces the four main Cambodian factions, emphasised the urgency of his country's environmental problems when he addressed a donors' conference in Tokyo in June. Shortly afterwards, Funcinpec, the royalist party, announced a complete logging ban in its territory, although Funcinpec officials acknowledge that their logging interests are less significant than those of other factions. 'The amount is very little compared to Phnom Penh (the Hun Sen government) and the Khmer Rouge,' said Mr Ek Sereywath. The Hun Sen administration has established an environmental committee but continues to sell timber, which is one of its few sources of income. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front has split into two factions - one civilian and one military - and the civilian leadership says it cannot stop the military officers from behaving 'like wood-eating termites' and selling trees. The Khmer Rouge, while refusing to co-operate with the UN and put its forces into cantonment areas, appears to be selling timber and gems as fast it can to increase its financial reserves. Dr Than Sina, one of Prince Sihanouk's palace advisors, says everyone is too busy with other matters to pay attention to the environment. 'The question of cantonment, the question of the Khmer Rouge, has overcast the whole issue. I think it's a matter of setting priorities for the future. I don't think anything can be done right now.' Without an effective military ceasefire in Cambodia, the chances of imposing an environmental ceasefire remain exceptionally slim.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         CAMBODIAN TIMBER EXPORTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991 (cu metres)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hun Sen government (at least 8 contracts)                   320,000 Illegal flows to Vietnam                                    250,000 Illegal flows to Thailand via Laos                          200,000 Khmer Rouge exports to Thailand (at least 5 contracts)      200,000 Funcinpec exports to Thailand (2 contracts)                 128,000 KPNLF exports to Thailand                                    50,000 Total                                                     1,148,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNICED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

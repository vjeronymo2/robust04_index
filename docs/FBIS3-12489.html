			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hebron Massacre Between Words And Action"] </F>   [Text] The international community now has a golden  opportunity to consolidate peace in the Middle East. That is,  if it knows how to settle the settlements issue swiftly and  without dilution.    Anyone who hears international reports on "terrorism" tends  to think that it is a tradition which was born Arab, lived Arab,  and is going to die Arab. It is most likely that its definition  and classification will remain so for some time.    But Barukh Goldstein and before him the perpetrator of  Rishon  LeZiyyon...through to Menahem Begin, "hero" of the King David  Hotel operation -- we do not want to make a long list -- confirm  that terrorism is not necessarily Arab. It is actually a  serious phenomenon which needs to be studied, reexamined, and  radically tackled with an open mind that does not condemn  haphazardly or use double standards.    We have heard so much about Arab "terrorism" that we are now  tired of this tone. We realize that it is actually a planned  bias designed to conceal right and the demand for it. If we are  today promised responsible international action on an ugly  massacre like the Hebron massacre, the first signs in the  Security Council have not been encouraging, as positions have --  as expected -- split between those who are content with verbal  condemnation and the advocates of practical measures.    Goldstein's crime is a state rather than an emotional  individual reaction. It is a state stemming from a political  strategy, a conditioned upbringing, and convictions which are  dangerous in their extremist and closed-mindedness and see  others' obtaining of humanly acceptable minimum rights as a  direct threat to them. In view of this situation, it is  impossible to divide a solution or camouflage a settlement.    The world has avoided tackling the problem in the occupied  territories and senior politicians have deliberately ignored  what is happening, using numerous excuses all of which cannot  paper over the cracks or convince a child. And today the  present Israeli government claims that it is not responsible for  the convulsions of radical settlers like Goldstein, whom the  Likud government supported for years. But the ruling Labor  Party will not be able to wash its hands of its responsibility  -- both during its rule before and after Likud -- for planting  scores of "security" or "religious" settlements whose residents  believe the Palestinians have no right to coexist with them.    So any compromise attempt for a settlement that does not  include a solution to the crux of the question is doomed to  failure. It is futile to talk today about containing reactions  without moving quickly to remove the settlements. Their  continuation is unacceptable politically because it recognizes  the legitimacy of occupation and its implementation and rewards  occupation by force. It is also unacceptable at the security  level because it does not guarantee any peace for unarmed  Palestinians or secure credibility for their promised "local  authority." It is also unacceptable demographically because it  is simply a population time bomb.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Councils expect poll tax arrears to last until 2000 ONE IN 12 local authorities expects to be collecting poll tax arrears into the year 2000, even though the tax will be replaced by the property-based council tax next April. Two out of five councils believe that the poll tax backlog will affect implementation of the council tax either extensively or moderately. The findings come in a previously unpublished study commissioned by the government from CSL management consultants and leaked to Mr Jack Straw, shadow local-government minister. The work was commissioned to help ensure the spread of good practice among councils in an effort to reduce the backlog before the first year of the new tax. The Department of the Environment agreed yesterday with Mr Straw's assessment that more than Pounds 1bn was uncollected from the first two years of the poll tax. 'The poll tax fiasco lives on and is likely significantly to upset the implementation of the council tax,' Mr Straw said yesterday. 'The country has already paid too dearly for the mess of the poll tax: it looks as though the council tax will replace one fiasco with another.' As councils prepare for introduction of the council tax, some Environment Department officials believe that the average bill for a household in a band D home (worth Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000 in April this year) might be more than Pounds 500. The department is clear that it is not committed to the estimate made last year by Mr Michael Heseltine, when environment secretary, of the average bill for such a household in 1991-92 being Pounds 400. Instead, ministers will rely on the tough regime for 'capping' - putting a ceiling on local government spending - to prevent bills from rising too steeply, and use a transitional-relief scheme to cut the number of households that lose extensively.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Japanese corruption probe widened Japanese public prosecutors yesterday widened their investigation into alleged corruption when they raided more than 30 homes and offices of politicians and construction company executives, Paul Abrahams writes from Tokyo. The raids followed a request by prosecutors earlier this week for the parliamentary immunity of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a former Liberal Democratic party construction minister, to be lifted so he could be arrested on charges of bribery. Mr Nakamura, whose home was among those raided, yesterday resigned from the LDP. A decision about whether his immunity should be lifted must be made by a full session of the lower house of parliament. It could give its consent today. If the request is successful, it would be the first time since 1967 that a Japanese lawmaker has been arrested while parliament was sitting. The prosecutors allege Mr Nakamura accepted a Y10m (Pounds 64,000) bribe on January 13 1992 from Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, a former vice-president of the construction company Kajima. Yesterday's raids covered the homes of Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Kajima, Mr Akira Miyazaki, the group's president, as well as Kajima's head office. The home of Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-president of Obayashi corporation, one of Japan's five biggest construction groups, was also raided. Rising long-term interest rates in Japan threaten to have an adverse impact on the economy, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the country's central bank, said yesterday, following the decision on Tuesday by the Industrial Bank of Japan to raise its long-term prime-lending rate by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent. He said the Bank of Japan had no intention of intervening.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilfredo Cordoba; from the "KL Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Salvadoran police and judicial authorities rejected  acts of impunity encouraged by the U.S. Embassy personnel who  helped U.S. Major Mike Lopez illegally leave El Salvador. Lopez  is charged with murdering Salvadoran citizen Jose Crecencion  Diaz Alvarado.    The incident took place on 20 January when Diaz Alvarado's  body was found inside a Jeep Cherokee with diplomatic license  plate No. 753. Diaz Alvarado was one of Lopez' bodyguards.    Prosecutor General Romeo Melara Granillo considers the  attitude of the Americans contradictory:    [Begin Melara recording] This is a total violation of our  laws. What is also worrying is that the United States demands  that we correctly apply justice while they violate our laws and  make a mockery of them. They demand that we uphold the law but  they violate them in cases such as this. This is what is  worrying. Regardless of whether or not this person has  diplomatic immunity he should have been processed through the  Salvadoran legal system and it should not have been handled the  way it was. [end recording]    The legal investigations are being conducted by the  Soyopango  2d Criminal Judge, who received a note from the U.S. Embassy  saying that the criminal had departed the country bound for  Panama. Nevertheless, immigration does not have his departure on  record, PNC [National Civilian Police] Director Jose Maria  Monterrey said.    [Begin recording] [Monterrey] We are exerting pressure. That  is our job and this is why we are here with the prosecutor. We  are outraged over this incident. You must realize that every  person who leaves through the airport must go through  immigration. Even in the case of the president, he sends his  passport and he enters and leaves and gets his passport stamped  as well as all members of his entourage. This applies to  everyone.    [Cordoba] Have you been able to establish who is to blame at  the airport?    [Monterrey] We do not know yet whether he left through the  airport or if he was taken out of the country some other way or  whether he left using a passport under another name. The fact  remains that several hours after the murder this major was  already in Panama. You, as a member of the media, should recall  the case of the Mexican who was involved in the cocaine robbery.  Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] immediately ordered that  he be placed in the hands of the justice system despite his  diplomatic immunity. He has been under arrest for eight or nine  months and is under the orders of a judge. [end recording]    This case will show whether the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador  practices what it preaches to the Salvadoran Government and not  allow another murder case to go unpunished.</p>

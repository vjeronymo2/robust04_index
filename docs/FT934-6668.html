			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Warning to US over tax demands The attempt by the US to seek tax exemptions in a proposed Uruguay Round accord on services is putting the whole round at risk, Mr Peter Sutherland, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday. The US wants the freedom to treat foreign services companies differently from local ones for tax purposes. Mr Sutherland told Mr Les Samuels, US Treasury assistant secretary for tax affairs, that Washington had no support and that the exemption being proposed was unacceptable to the other 114 participants in the round. The issue is now expected to go for decision to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, and the US cabinet. Mr Sutherland was reported as saying that an unlimited right to discriminate in taxing foreign services suppliers would undermine the benefits of the draft services accord in guaranteeing fair treatment for companies establishing a commercial presence abroad. The US position, announced a month ago after two years of laborious negotiations on a tax clause for services, has infuriated other countries. Some have already threatened to take similar exemptions for themselves. This would leave foreign-based services companies around the world vulnerable to tax discrimination, which would devalue any benefits they received from better access to markets. Mr Sutherland pointed out to Mr Samuels, who on Monday failed conspicuously to convince trading partners of the justice of the US position, that the tax exemption could prove 'extraordinarily counter-productive'. US companies, being the most active abroad, would be the biggest losers. The draft services text allows countries to tax foreign services suppliers differently, for instance, to combat tax avoidance, provided this does not amount to discrimination. The wording eventually adopted was supplied by the US, Mr Sutherland noted. Mr Samuels argued that the tax clause in the services agreement would upset the existing system of bilateral tax treaties, and could tie the hands of Congress in enacting new tax laws. However, no other country, including the 50 or so with double taxation agreements with the US, sees a threat to the existing system, while Mr Samuels' remarks on new legislation have only added to fears that Washington is planning tough and possibly discriminatory legislation on taxation of foreign companies. Mr Samuels has denied that the US has any discriminatory intentions. But, in that case, Mr Sutherland said yesterday, why was it asking for complete freedom to discriminate, a freedom that would also ensure that affected governments had no remedy through multilateral disputes procedures? With just three weeks to go to the Uruguay Round deadline of December 15, the issue has become urgent.</p>

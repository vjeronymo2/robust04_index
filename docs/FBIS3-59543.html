			<p>ONLY  <F P=103> 94S0106C </F> <F P=104>  Paris AIR AND COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL </F>   Language: <F P=105>French, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Business Between France </F> and Poland Is Picking Up Again"]    [Text] The two countries have just stepped up trade in the  aviation and defense fields.    Ever since the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, Poland has  been trying to revive its military connections with the Western  countries, particularly with France. New prospects are opening  up for French manufacturers today in view of Poland's desire to  join NATO. This revival of bonds has already been expressed by  partnerships between military units, such as, between the 2nd  Fighter Squadron based on Dijon and the 1st Polish Air Defense  Regiment stationed at Minsk-Mazowiecki; there have also been  trips by high-ranking military authorities or industrialists.  Now it is the turn of a delegation of equipment makers from  GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] to visit the country  presided over by Lech Walesa.    Although the French military budget is declining with barely  10&percnt; earmarked for equipment, the needs of the Polish Army  are  very great. The participation of Polish military personnel in UN  missions, side by side with Western forces, enabled them to  measure the weakness of their Soviet-produced materiel in terms  of modernity and interoperability. This calls for a major effort  since they very much want to join NATO.    Due to lack of sufficient funds, it is clear that there will  be no direct purchasing of defense materiel. Unable to purchase  Mirage 2000 aircraft as they said they would like to, the Air  Force people are content with modernizing their MiG-21 and  MiG-23 aircraft (300 units) and possibly their MiG-29 planes.  French producers, such as Thomson-CSF, Sagem [Company for  General Applications of Electricity and Mechanics], or Dassault  Electronique are particularly well-placed, even in the area of  modernizing their armored vehicles, which is also on the agenda.    In the armament field, there are good opportunities in the  Polish Navy which wants to improve the antiaircraft defenses of  its vessels by adding antiaircraft missile systems. Besides, the  Navy people want to replace their old SS-N-2 "Styx" anti-ship  missiles with "Exocet" and to procure anti-mine and  anti-submarine sonars both for their mine chasers and their  helicopters (Thomson airborne sonar). Lastly, in developing  their own antiaircraft system based on a T-72 tank chassis  christened the "Loara" (meaning Loire!), they are looking for  missiles of the Roland or Crotale type and they are negotiating  for a license with France. This system, equipped with a fire  control and electrooptical radar (to be defined), comes in two  versions: one with two 35-mm Oerlikon cannons and another with  eight antiaircraft missiles.    Above and beyond some immediate purchases, Poland's main  concern has to do with the future of its armament industry which  occupied something like 300,000 workers before the Pact  crumbled. This was an industry some of whose production centers  were working exclusively for the USSR, such as, for example, a  portion of the Mielek plant that annually turned out more than  500 An-28 [aircraft] for export. Today, it is being restructured  with something like 50&percnt; personnel cuts. But in this entire  industry, the Polish Government intends to preserve the aviation  sector. A group organized under the consortium PZL (Panstwowe  Zaklady Lotnicze) consists of 19 establishments specializing in  the license-based construction of light aircraft (trainers and  liaison aircraft), helicopters, and engines employing something  like 50,000 persons.    Along these lines, the Poles are looking for partnerships  with Western manufacturers to improve their products, to find  commercial outlets, or to get into subcontracting work. Here, we  might mention the "Dromader" crop-duster built in cooperation  with Rockwell and Pratt &amp; Whitney, or the central section of  the  wing of the ATR-72 made by PZL-Swidnik (see box) in the wake of  compensation agreements that followed the purchase of eight  ATR-42 by LOT [Polish Airlines]. They are also looking for new  engines to boost the performances of their aircraft: Larzac (in  competition with Viper) for their Iryda trainer, or the Ariel  turbine for their new SW-4 helicopter. Finally, in the  electronics field, agreements have also been signed between  Thomson-CSF and the builder of Radwar radars for the production  of IFF identification systems.  <H5>  Box </H5>   French-Polish Cooperation: Example of PZL-Swidnik    Located 160 km southwest of Warsaw, PZL-Swidnik is the  Polish  establishment that has been specializing in the development and  production of helicopters since 1953. More than 7,000 craft have  come off its assembly lines, primarily the Mi-2. Ever since the  big upheaval in 1989, the firm became a "company of the State  Treasury," that is to say, an enterprise equivalent to one of  our national companies capable of engaging in commerce according  to international rules. Its personnel force was cut from 8,000  to 5,000, although management officials "would love to reduce  the personnel force even more." Right now, its model assortment  still consists of the venerable Mi-2 which PZL-Swidnik is  rebuilding and upgrading with Allison turbines under the name of  "Kania," as well as the new "Sokol," which has had some export  success (see No. 1445), a ground-attack version of which is  being developed with the help of South Africa; then there is  also the SW-4 light helicopter which is undergoing development  and whose power plant could be farmed out to Turbomeca.    Like all of Poland's industries, the Lublin Firm is  struggling with a slack demand. This year, it will produce  barely about 30 craft. Hence, the desire to supplement  helicopter production with other activities, especially  aeronautical subcontracting or diversified products. Among these  new products, the PW-5 glider designed by the Warsaw Technology  University has turned out to be a winner. There are also less  prestigious products, such as baby carriages, machinery for  agribusiness, and vehicle trailers, more than 2,000 of which are  sold in France.    "France turned out to be the most receptive in our search  for  cooperative undertakings," confided Pavel Restak, the company's  new marketing manager. The first step was taken with the  agreement covering the manufacture of 290 elements of the  central box of the wing cell for the ATR-72, a first copy of  which has just been shipped to France. For the Polish  enterprise, this turned into a learning experience and the  application of new procedures, above all in terms of surface  treatment, quality control, as well as an in-depth  transformation of manufacturing processes.    For the French, this means orders for equipment (especially  a  three-axle milling tool capable of machining 10-m long parts),  plus plant modernizing agreements. In a more general fashion,  Aerospatiale signed a technical cooperation agreement and 105  Polish technicians have already gone through six-month training  courses at the Eurocopter plant in Marignane. PZL-Swidnik  managers, who believe that this kind of exchange is "profitable  and very beneficial," are thus in the process of transforming  the old arsenal into a modern enterprise equipped with a  500-person research office, and above all, a commercial division  that is already staffed by 60 workers.</p>

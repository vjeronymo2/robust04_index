			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the  Cypriot Government considers UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report on the renewal of the UNFICYP mandate in  Cyprus objective.    Kasoulidhis said it is important to note that Butrus-Ghali  describes occupied Cyprus as one of the most highly militarized  areas in the world in terms of the ratio between numbers of  troops and civilian population. He added that a positive point  is that the UN secretary general explicitly rejected Turkish  claims that our side creates tension along the confrontation  zone.</p>

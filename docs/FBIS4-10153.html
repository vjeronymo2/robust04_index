			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "This Is How the Opposition Views the </F> New PRI Candidate"]    [Text] Opposition candidates have reacted with diverse  opinions to the emergence of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as  substitute standard bearer for the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] to the presidency. Presidential hopefuls  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action Party (PAN);  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, of the Democratic Revolutionary  Party (PRD); Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green  Ecologist Party (PVEM); Marcela Lombardo Otero of the Popular  Socialist Party (PPS); Pablo Emilio Madero of the Mexican  Democratic Party (PDM); Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, of the  Cardenist Front for National Reconftruction Party (PFCRN);  Cecilia Soto Gonzalez of the Labor Party, and Alvaro Perez  Trevino of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM)  said the following:    Diego Fernandez de Cevallos: Ernesto Zedillo "is a  respectable and honest person who will certainly play a good  role as presidential hopeful for his party. I now have an  adversary again and will strive for the presidency."    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas: "Perhaps now more than ever, he is the  presidential candidate of continuity." Hopefully, despite how  he was chosen, "it will be a clean and straighforward election."    Jorge Gonzalez Torres: "Zedillo represents the continuity of  a sinking ship and of something that failed." The new candidate  "bases his political campaign in the image of Colosio, because  he lacks his own personality."    Marcela Lombardo: "The choice of Zedillo falls within the  same democratic trend presented by Colosio, because it follows  the same objectives and the same proposals of Colosio."    Pablo Emilio Madero: "I hope that Zedillo's participation in  the elections will be pure and clear, conforming to reality. It  is hoped he will assume the responsibility inherited from  Colosio of talking to all sectors."    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes: "Zedillo's participation will  raise the stature of the electoral race and will certainly  guarantee that it will be civilized, tolerant, and respectful of  all the candidates."    Cecilia Soto: "All the contendors deserve respect. Zedillo  will be an important contender. It is hoped he will embrace  Colosio's positions."    Alvaro Perez Trevino: "The proposals made to the people and  the political line of Ernesto Zedillo will differ substantially  from the proposals made by Luis Donaldo Colosio."</p>

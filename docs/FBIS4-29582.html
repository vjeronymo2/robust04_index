			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Proposed economic sanctions  against North Korea could affect Japan's imports of men's  clothing and food from that country, business sources said  Friday [17 June].    Japan has expressed support in principle for Washington's  draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security Council in  response to North Korea's refusal to permit unhampered  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    Aoyama Trading Co., a retailer of low-priced men's clothing,  imports suits, blazers and other clothing from North Korea for  exclusive marketing through its outlets nationwide, taking  advantage of low labor costs in that country. Japan also  imports mushrooms, crabs, shellfish and other food items from  North Korea.    Customs-cleared imports of men's clothing from North Korea  last year totaled about 9 billion yen, one-third of total  Japanese imports from that country. Mushroom imports from North  Korea last year, meanwhile, totaled 2.2 billion yen.    But an official of a major Japanese trading company, who  asked to remain anonymous, said the sanctions would have only  minimal effects on Japan's global trade. Japan-North Korea  trade last year totaled 52.1 billion yen, only 0.1 percent of  total Japanese trade.</p>

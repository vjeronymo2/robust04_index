			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister  Jozef Moravcik and other cabinet members will work towards  speeding up the process of issuing screening certificates, Jan  Carnogursky said today after a meeting of the coalition council.  Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH), was reacting to claims that one cabinet member was  "having difficulties with screening certificates." The 1991  Czechoslovak screening (or "lustration") law debars former  Communist Party officials, agents of the StB secret police and  People's Militia members from high political and economic posts  until 1996.    Carnogursky said the government did not intend to change the  screening law, adding that the government would deal with the  question of the alleged positive screening of one of its members  very soon. "The screening certificates of all members of the  government will be available within the next two weeks," said  Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament and chairman of  the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA). He  stated that new screening certificates, issued by the Slovak  Information Service so as to be incontestable, were required for  all cabinet members.    Carnogursky said he did not know which cabinet member was  said to be having problems with screening. He said the  coalition council had set up a working group that would make  recommendations on how the screening law would be implemented in  Slovakia. Both Carnogursky and Cernak confirmed today that  their candidates for the autumn parliamentary elections would  have cleared the screening process.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead LUCAS Industries, the UK-based engineering group, should produce a trading profit of Pounds 20m when it announces preliminary profits on Monday before an exceptional gain of Pounds 90m from its pension fund refund. The group is, however, expected to announce exceptional restructuring provisions of Pounds 60m. It should maintain its dividend. Body Shop International will try on Tuesday to repair some of the damage last month's profits warning did to its share price. Bringing a record of unbroken profits growth to an abrupt halt, the cosmetics' retailer said interim pre-tax profits would be not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds 9.1m) and the 0.68p dividend would be maintained. The shares fell 108p to 158p on the news and, so far, have recovered to only 170p. Investors will be particularly anxious to hear how UK sales are going. Body Shop said last month that some store sales were down between 3 and 5 per cent over the past three months. Who will end up owning Mirror Group Newspapers remains unresolved nearly a year after the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell but, despite the uncertainty, the business is still performing well. Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m for the half year when the results are announced on Tuesday. A result towards the top end is likely. Highland Distilleries, maker of The Famous Grouse, the UK's second best-selling Scotch whisky, is expected to report full year pre-tax profits on Monday virtually unchanged from last year's Pounds 28m. Lloyds Chemists, the second largest retail chemists' chain after Boots, is expected to report on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June of about Pounds 35m. The rise from Pounds 20.8m a year earlier reflects in large part the group's ambitious programme of acquisitions.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Press hits back at Menem over ban ARGENTINA'S press has attacked President Carlos Menem's plan to send a bill to Congress next week banning companies from owning more than one media outlet in each regional market. On Friday Mr Raul Burzaco, Mr Menem's press officer, criticised 'manipulation of the news by an important holding company in the federal capital' - an allusion to the mass circulation newspaper Clarin. He added that although the government respected press freedom, this 'also implies the duty of guaranteeing the plurality of information'. Mr Burzaco later added the government was considering rescuing a bankrupt newsprint company to break Clarin's and the conservative daily La Nacion's hold on the newsprint market. The statements follow Clarin's publication last week of an interview with a leading cleric who criticised the government. Commentators agree that Mr Menem has respected press freedoms and has repealed laws curbing free expression. However, they say he has also resorted to intimidation, such as cutting government advertising, in retaliation for negative press coverage. Mr Martin Granowsky, an editor of Pagina 12, a left-wing opposition newspaper, said 'it will be impossible for the government to get this bill through Congress. What Menem is trying to do is reduce the credibility of the media at a time when the courts, prosecutors, opposition parties and Congress are all questioned.' A way to reduce journalism's credibility was to show it as a monopoly that only wanted to make money. However, Mr Menem has touched a raw nerve. Recent years have seen the emergence of powerful media empires, led by the Clarin group. Their growth follows Mr Menem's lifting of restrictions on the concentration of press power when he began privatising government-owned radio and TV stations in 1989.</p>

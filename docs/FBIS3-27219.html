He added that  the academy would be streamlined and more competitive with an  incentive mechanism and elimination of the weak and promotion of  the excellent with the aim of getting rid of redundant personnel  not competent enough to undertake research work and those  showing no academic achievements for years.    The academy has an average annual turnout of nearly 400  books  on special topics, some 3,000 treatises and 400 reports on  research to be presented to the decision-making bodies and to  the public. A large number of experts and scholars well known  both at home and abroad work for this authoritative institution  known as the brain of the entire country, making contributions  to reform and opening to the outside world while at the same  time devoting themselves to the pushing forward of basic studies.    Some members of the academy, however, are not so competent  in  undertaking social science study and research even though they  may be good at other things and they produce no achievements  during their time in the academy.    Mr. Hu said he believed that the current reform and economic  build-up provided a wider scope for the social sciences and for  personnel working in the field of human study and social  science. He added that with this in mind the academy had to try  its best to make better achievements. Mr. Hu revealed that the  academy was determined to build up a streamlined social science  force of high quality. The academy will first prevent swelling  the ranks of its personnel while at the same time redundant  personnel and those who had few academic achievements in a  certain period of years will be dropped. Financial resources  and strength will be poured into the backbone research and study  carried out by elite researchers whose living and working  conditions will be improved.    The academy will also give priority to key items under the  circumstances where the appropriation for the academy is quite  stringent and must centre its resources of personnel, finance  and strength on major or significant items. The academy will  make necessary adjustments to achieve this end.</p>

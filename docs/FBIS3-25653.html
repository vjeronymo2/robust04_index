Claassen] </F>   [Text] Postmasburg Feb 23 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk  was struck by a crumpled paper flag and stick while speaking to  a crowd dominated by vociferous African National Congress [ANC]  protesters at Postdene near Postmasburg in the Northern Cape on  Wednesday. The incident went largely unnoticed.    ANC supporters had been ripping paper flags glued to wooden  sticks from National Party supporters' hands, and tearing or  crumpling them. One of these was thrown at Mr de Klerk from  behind, hitting him on the neck.    There were a few minor scuffles as security men hastily  ushered Mr de Klerk's party out of the area.    Mr de Klerk said afterwards: "One continues to be shocked by  ill-mannered and ill-directed leaders who prevent a leader from  addressing his followers.    "It is proof of a chilling fact: the ANC has lost control  over its youthful followers." He said all those who shouted and  jeered at him at Postdene were youngsters.    "I think it is high time that the Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] now focus on one of its two main tasks, namely  to prevent intimidation." The IEC's other task was to manage the  election.    Mr de Klerk said case upon case of sheer intimidation had  been brought to the attention of the IEC, with affidavits on  specific incidents, but no action had been taken as they were  "too vague". "Today I have been witness to people issued with  official ANC flags, placards and banners disrupting a legal  meeting of NP supporters."    He said if the IEC needed a witness, they were welcome to  contact him. "They have the fiscal powers and I call upon them  to use these powers."</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft in talks over sale of stake in components unit Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and industrial group, is in talks with 'at least two' potential buyers for its 47 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle components company which has been part of the group since the beginning of the century. Mr Heinrich Binder, Kolbenschmidt chief executive, said yesterday that a transaction could be concluded reasonably quickly although it was too early to comment on the identity of interested parties. He said it was likely that the buyer would purchase a further 4 per cent of the company's shares to obtain control. Kolbenschmidt has in recent years been a severe financial burden to its Frankfurt-based parent company, losing DM123m (Dollars 70.20m) in the year to last September and DM90m in 1991-92. Mr Kajo Neukirchen made it clear soon after he succeeded Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch as chief executive of Metallgesellschaft in December that the stake in Kolbenschmidt would be put up for sale. Mr Binder said the company, which produces pistons, cylinder heads, oil pumps and other components used by vehicle makers, had broken even in the first quarter of the current financial year and was likely to in the year as a whole, despite poor market conditions. He predicted further improvements as rationalisation measures took effect, saying the company would make a profit in the next financial year. The poor performance reflects the state of the German vehicle components sector where suppliers have been forced to bear the brunt of cost-cutting by the manufacturers as well as the impact of the strong D-Mark on exports. Kolbenschmidt has responded by reducing capital expenditure and implementing a cost-cutting plan as a result of which the workforce shrunk by 763 to 9,314 people last year. Extraordinary costs of DM44.9m associated with the restructuring were included in last year's losses. Mr Binder said the Metallgesellschaft crisis had not caused any direct problems for Kolbenschmidt, although the projected sale had caused uncertainty for staff and customers. Metallgesellschaft sold a 12.5 per cent parcel of shares in the company last September to Magna International, a Canadian company which is thought to be a potential purchaser of the remaining 47 per cent holding. Magna recently bought a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt's airbag-manufacturing subsidiary.</p>

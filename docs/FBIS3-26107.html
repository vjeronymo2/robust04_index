			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang] </F>   [Text] Beijing has amended its radical development  strategy for 1994 by putting emphasis on social stability. The  change, recently decided by the Chinese Communist Party's  leadership, is to avert social unrest in the face of increasing  inflationary and unemployment pressures following sweeping  reforms. The ruling party's Politburo made the decision last  month in an emergency meeting after price hikes for grain and  staple food in major cities and an expected "largest-ever" flow  of migrants this month.    The strategic amendment in socio-economic development and  reform policies received blessing from paramount leader Deng  Xiaoping, Chinese sources said yesterday. The change was made  to include "guaranteeing social stability" as development  priority and play down the emphasis on pace of economic growth  and reform.    The decision has sharply contrasted the policy and remarks  made by senior leaders last year when they were working on an  overall development, economic sources told THE HONGKONG  STANDARD. At that time, the Politburo had formulated a  three-point directive outlining the development strategy for  1994, which says "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and  speed up development". But now, the Politburo has changed it to  "seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost development and  guarantee stability" a well-informed source said.    The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability indicates  that  the authorities are to postpone many of its radical reforms and  take a more cautious step in the endeavour. The substitution of  "speeding up development" by "boosting development" also  underlines a change of mind by the leadership.    Only last year senior leaders frequently quoted an  instruction of the reclusive Mr Deng to justify a fast pace  development. The patriarch was reported to have said then that  "development is hard truth" and "slow development is not  socialism." The remark was interpreted as advocacy for a higher  development speed.    The decision will allow China to cut its growth rate to rein  in spiralling inflation. The government will suspend some  reform packages that may have fuelled price soaring for basic  products and staples and lead to large-scale unemployment. It  will re-impose price capping over the floor and grip in economic  activities, including renewing austerity program, sources said.</p>

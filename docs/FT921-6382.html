			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Longer lives incur more ailments - Health insurance HEALTH IS a hot political topic. Whichever party you believe about the state of the National Health Service, the explosion of interest in private health insurance over the last few years cannot be denied. Political questions aside, one simple factor has boosted the health insurance industry - people are living longer, and so suffering more ailments before they die. It now seems more important to protect yourself against the financial consequences of surviving a serious illness than it does to protect your family against the risks of your dying from it. The term 'health insurance' covers a number of products with differing objectives: Private medical insurance is probably the closest to what most people would understand by the term. You insure yourself against the need for treatment, and the insurer pays the bills, subject to a maximum. This is best regarded as an attractive luxury for those who can afford it. It allows choice over the timing of your treatment, which can be in a private nursing home if you wish. Policies fall into two categories. Those over 60 can take advantage of basic-rate income tax relief, paid at source to the insurer in a similar system to the Miras arrangement for tax relief on mortgage loans. Plans specially designed for the elderly exclude obviously inappropriate conditions, such as childish ailments or maternity, and can be good value. Such plans will exclude extra 'frills' such as extra cash sums while you have the treatment, and will usually only provide cover if NHS treatment is not available within a fixed period, of about six weeks. Without the tax relief - something of a political hot potato - private medical insurance is less obviously a good deal, and premiums are rising. However, many groups offer special budget policies, for a small number of common ailments, and it is worth considering these if you think that private care would be better for you. Critical illness insurance, also known as 'dread disease' cover, is a variant on life insurance. It pays you a lump sum as soon as you fall victim to a 'critical illness', defined in the first instance by the insurer and then assessed by a doctor. Normally it covers cancers, heart diseases and strokes, though many policies branch into other conditions. A critical-illness policy stands or falls on the list of illnesses covered, on which there is no agreed industry standard as yet. Be careful, for example, to avoid policies which cover double, but not single, heart-bypass operations. Also, do not take out excessive life insurance. Most policies pay out on death as well as on diagnosis of a critical illness, so you can easily find yourself paying for life cover you do not need. If your life is already covered, take out a 'stand alone' dread-disease policy. But the premiums you pay for stand-alone cover and cover including death benefits reflect the market for this form of insurance. Skandia Life charges a 30-year-old man a monthly premium of Pounds 18.71 for stand-alone cover of Pounds 100,000, and Pounds 23.41 for life cover as well. This demonstrates just how high the chances are that you will have a critical illness at some point before you die. Permanent health insurance is a misnomer - a more accurate name would be 'income replacement insurance'. It insures you against loss of income through taking time off work for health reasons. This is of most use to those who are effectively 'self-employed', such as solicitors and chartered accountants. Check with your employer to see if you already have cover through a group scheme before buying PHI for yourself. Unlike dread disease, PHI pays an income, not a lump sum. Diagnostic restrictions are more relaxed - if you are too ill to work, then you qualify for a pay-out. If you have non-life threatening ailments such as a nervous breakdown or repetitive strain injury, for example, PHI should provide an income. The price you pay varies according to the length of time you are prepared to spend off work before the insurance is triggered. If you can wait 13 weeks, cover will normally be a lot cheaper than if you want your income to start four weeks after falling ill. Also, as an industry standard, you can only take out cover for 75 per cent of your normal income, to ensure that you have an incentive to return to work. PHI can be a vital safety net, particularly for professionals. But check the previous claims record of the company before buying cover. Claims in this area can be contentious, so avoid companies with a bad record. Long-term care insurance is in its infancy, but could yet become a central part of everyone's financial plan. It defies generalisation, because no two plans on the market are identical. Some life insurers offer easy-payment packages, to be taken out just before an elderly person goes into care. These combine a growth investment, such as a personal equity plan or a with-profits bond, with an annuity to help pay the care fees while protecting the initial capital investment. More ground-breaking policies, from Aetna, Commercial Union, MGI and PPP, aim to provide insurance against the need for care, long in advance of your actually needing it. You pay regular premiums through your middle age. With little claims history to go on, it is difficult to know how good the deals are, but as medical science allows more people to enjoy an extended old age, the market for cover is likely to increase.</p>

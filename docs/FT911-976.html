			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: S Africans considering all-out bid for Etam OCEANA Investment Corporation, a vehicle for a South African retailing concern, was yesterday considering whether to mount a bid for the whole of Etam, the UK women's fashion chain, after its tender offer for 18.5 per cent of the shares was oversubscribed. Oceana, a holding company for the European interests of the Lewis family, which runs the Foschini chain in South Africa, will pay Pounds 22.3m for 12.1m shares, taking its stake in Etam to 25.1 per cent. The offer was about 11 per cent oversubscribed. Valid tenders were received for 13.4m shares, 20.5 per cent of the equity. The striking price was the maximum 185p, which values the group at Pounds 121m. Tender prices ranged from 169p to 185p and those at the top price will be scaled back. Oceana has stipulated that 185p is the maximum at which it would bid for the whole group. Yesterday Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman of Oceana and Foschini, and his son Michael were in South Africa for the annual meeting of their 700-store women's fashion group. It made pre-tax profits of R148.9m (Pounds 31.2m) on sales of R822m last year. Mr Michael Lewis, a director, said last week that Oceana wanted to avoid a hostile bid. It hoped to use the response to the tender offer to arrive at a modus vivendi with the Etam management. If it went ahead with a bid for the whole company, it would have to find about Pounds 90m more. He said Foschini could fund the acquisition from its own resources, although he did not rule out a call on British institutions. Etam said the result of the offer represented a vote of confidence in the board. It stuck by its view that 185p per share undervalued the company, and it seemed unlikely to prove amenable to any of the suggestions that Oceana might make following the return of the Lewises from South Africa at the end of this week. The shares closed up 1p at 176p.</p>

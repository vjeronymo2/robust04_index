			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Specific Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is encouraged to coordinate this rule with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of seismic and flood loads, especially with respect to foundation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attachment designs (25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements in the proposed rule for a permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foundation design have been eliminated in this final rule. However, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department continues to review the issue of adequate anchoring/foundation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems for manufactured homes, it will also review these other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are not enough DAPIA personnel in the HUD system to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and approve design changes within the time provided for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of this rule (83, 124, 136, 179).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has agreed to delay the effectiveness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new requirements for 180 days, which should allow sufficient time for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DAPIA process, as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department should consider requiring the DAPIA approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp on all pages of a manufacturer's installation instructions (48).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule continues to require that the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide installation instructions certified by a registered professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineer indicating at least one acceptable system of anchoring (24 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3280.306(b)). However, the Department will consider the suggestion to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a DAPIA approval stamp on each page of the manufacturers' installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions when developing future revisions to the Manufactured Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some explanation is needed about the effect of the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards on ``B'' letters, interpretative bulletins, and compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations (122).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new standard supersedes any portions of ``B'' letters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretative bulletins, and compliance determinations that are in conflict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the higher standards are adopted, manufacturers will prefer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to build modular homes that meet the necessary State standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers are free to channel their activities in any way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that best responds to market forces. In the development of the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact analysis, the Department has accounted for the cost of potential lost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business. To the extent that manufacturers could redirect their production to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative housing, the costs of the higher standards would be lessened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as noted above, the Department believes that the trend in State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards also will be to stricter wind standards. Therefore, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes may experience a price increase because of these standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will be affordable relative to site-built homes meeting the higher State-imposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department should prepare a brochure on hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awareness and windstorm protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the discussion on Improved Anchoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foundation Systems earlier in the preamble, the Department is reviewing what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be an appropriate consumer information disclosure requirement on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation. As part of that review, the Department may consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on the disclosure of general information relating to high winds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hurricanes, and may coordinate with FEMA on the development of a brochure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on hurricane awareness and protection for occupants of manufactured homes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Other specific comments that have become moot as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision not to proceed with changes in Wind Zone I and requirements relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a permanent foundation system are not addressed in this preamble.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Description of Changes to the Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the risk of loss of life to building occupants and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary loss of property due to Hurricane Andrew, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that it is necessary to amend the Federal Manufactured Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to raise the level of wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance standards, especially in areas subject to high winds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the Department is amending the FMHCSS to include a Basic Wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone Map that is based on the map contained in the incorporated standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88, ``Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised map contains a more concentrated area for the 100 mph wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone than was specified in the current standard or the proposed rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary between Wind Zones I and II follows the 90 mph isotach on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map, while the boundary between Wind Zones II and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III remains the 100 mph isotach indicated in the proposed rule. The design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wind speeds for high wind areas are designated as 100 mph for Wind Zone II and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 110 mph for Wind Zone III. This rule does not change the current design wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed for Wind Zone I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the revised map, this final rule enumerates the States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Territories, and local governments in which the more stringent standards will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applicable. The enumerated areas are those that the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be at least partially within the higher wind zones demarcated on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised map. The Department also will monitor local building code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and will consider adoption through rulemaking of requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes that are comparable to any more stringent requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for site-built homes by a State or local building authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current wind standard for manufactured housing is considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate because it addresses only positive (external) design wind pressures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for walls, components, windows, and cladding, without specifying that designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must take into account the effect of negative pressure (suction) on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building elements, as well as internal pressures on walls and roof/ceiling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. The formulae used in ASCE 7&hyph;88 also include other factors, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for higher uplift forces on roof eaves, ridges, overhangs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corners. These and other issues are now addressed in high wind areas by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the manufactured home structure, components, and cladding to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to resist design wind forces for Exposure C, as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

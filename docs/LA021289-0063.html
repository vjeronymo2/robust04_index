			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING A PILGRIMAGE TO COLORFUL, REMOTE CHINA  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest lure of the Xishuangbanna region is that it is so hard to  get to.  </P> <P> A remote, unspoiled corner of southwest China just above the Laos-Burma border,  the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has been officially open to  tourists since mid-1985, but only in the last 18 months have transportation and  bureaucratic restrictions improved enough to make the trip feasible.  </P> <P> The geographical remoteness, and because Xishuangbanna (pronounced  shee-shwahng-ba-na) is home to about 24 of China's 55 officially recognized  ethnic minority groups, are the two main reasons why the area is gaining in  popularity for travelers who love a challenge.  </P> <P> Han Chinese, who make up 95% of China's population, are only one-third of  Xishuangbanna's. Another third of the region's 600,000 people is the Dai ethnic  group. Hani, Bulang, Jinuo and other small groups make up the rest.  </P> <P> Xishuangbanna is quite unlike the rest of China. The ubiquitous concrete block  apartment buildings and drab shops of China's big cities are here Dai  thatched-roof homes, built on stilts to escape monsoon flooding, and lush  natural surroundings, including an estimated 5,000 varieties of tropical  plants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Groups Have Advantage  </P> <P> Most people travel to Xishuangbanna in groups. Individual travel is possible if  you're lucky enough to get onto a scheduled flight from Kunming, capital of  Hunnan Province.  </P> <P> But China's national airline, CAAC, schedules only seven flights a week on  48-seat prop jets to the area, and tour groups snap up most of those well in  advance, causing the regular flights to be canceled.  </P> <P> Individual travelers may find themselves stranded in Kunming with tickets that  are no good because the flight has been canceled, or they face the prospect of  getting to Xishuangbanna and not being able to return to Kunming. Return trips  cannot be booked in advance on domestic flights in China.  </P> <P> (Don't expect much help from Chinese officials in getting to this area. China  has long been suspicious of its minority groups, and many Chinese ask openly  why anyone would want to visit a minority area. Only after the Communists took  power in 1949 was the symbol for "dog," until then included in the written  characters for ethnic names, abolished.)  </P> <P> This uncertainty makes less intrepid travelers nervous, but for tourists  persistent or lucky enough to wade through the hassles and red tape that are  China, the rewards are great.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only for Adventurous  </P> <P> The flight from Kunming is just under one hour over the beautiful reddish-brown  Ailao and Wuliang mountains, which surround sapphire blue lakes and small  settlements. Narrow dirt roads, which from the air look like thin copper  ribbon, wind around and up the mountains.  </P> <P> The plane touches down in Simao, a warm and sunny but otherwise uninspiring  town. This is where you begin the hair-raising 3 1/2-hour bus journey to  Yunjinghong -- sometimes referred to as Jinghong, the region's capital. The  road has been paved in the last couple of years, but it is narrow and runs  along the edge of sheer cliffs.  </P> <P> Compared to the overwhelming grayness of many northern Chinese cities,  Yunjinghong is a splash of color. Dai women, wearing ankle-length pink, yellow  or red form-fitting skirts and thin cotton blouses, stroll together down  uncrowded streets.  </P> <P> Well-made wooden Dai homes, which have thatched roofs and are built on stilts  about six feet off the ground, dot the landscape. Banana and papaya trees are  heavy with fruit, even in midwinter.  </P> <P> Winter is the best time to visit, especially after a trip to sub-zero Beijing  or Harbin, home of China's ice festival. March to October is monsoon season  when the air is thick with mosquitoes. In winter the air is dry but warm, about  84 degrees in mid-afternoon, with only slightly cooler temperatures at night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hotel Alternatives  </P> <P> Most tour groups stay at the Banna Guest House in Yunsjinghong. The rooms are  drab and Spartan but clean, with showers that alternately scald and freeze you.  Mosquito nets are provided. The rates are good, 28 yuan (about $8 U.S.) a night  for a double, and the food in the restaurant is adequate if not inspiring.  </P> <P> An official of the Foreign Affairs Office of Yunnan Province was adamant that  the Banna Guest House "is the only hotel now open to foreigners," but an  adventuresome American couple traveling on their own said there are at least  two alternatives in the city.  </P> <P> One is the Dai Minority Guesthouse just outside downtown, where three or four  guests at a time are allowed to stay in a thatched-roof Dai house and eat  traditional Dai food, which Dai cooks will proudly say combines salty, sweet,  sour and bitter tastes.  </P> <P> This combination is quite good, and there are ample opportunities to sample Dai  cuisine even if you don't stay there. Rates are 2.5 yuan per bed (about 70  cents), with shared toilet and no showers. Only plywood partitions separate the  beds, so don't expect much in the way of privacy.  </P> <P> The other alternative is a small hotel on the grounds of the Tropical Cash Crop  Institute of Yunnan Province, a short bicycle ride from the center of town. No  rates were available, as most who stay there do as guests of the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patience Pays Off  </P> <P> While foreigners traveling unaccompanied by Chinese are likely to be turned  away from either of these places by suspicious hotel clerks, those with  persistence, and especially those who can speak a bit of Chinese, might be able  to talk their way in.  </P> <P> China has many strict-sounding rules about where foreigners are allowed and not  allowed to go, but many of them are made to be broken by visitors with lots of  patience and good humor. The China International Travel Service has an office  directly across from the Banna Guest House, and someone is usually there during  the day to help with accommodations.  </P> <P> Yunjinghong's downtown area is plain, with the usual drugstores peddling deer  antlers and other traditional medical remedies, as well as a few open-air  bookstores. The best place to people-watch and absorb the flavor of this mix of  cultures is the free market, held several times a week a few blocks from the  Banna Guest House.  </P> <P> The locals bring freshly slaughtered sheep and seemingly every other  conceivable animal, as well as fruits and vegetables and a few handicrafts,  such as woven handbags, to trade.  </P> <P> Each ethnic group is recognizable by the costumes the women wear every day.  Most men have adopted the loose dark green or blue jacket and pants of Han  Chinese.  </P> <P> (A note of advice: Visit the market in the morning when most business is  conducted. By afternon the smell of the unrefrigerated meat can be  overwhelming.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ethnic Cuisine  </P> <P> You can sample Dai cuisine at the Dai Nationality restaurant a short walk from  the center of town.  </P> <P> Dinner, eaten in a traditional building with low tables and short bamboo  chairs, typically consists of pork and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves, red  rice that you grab with your hands and work into a ball before eating, fried  leaves and other odd-sounding specialties, all a welcome change from typical  Chinese cooking. Dessert is a sticky but tasty rice and sugar paste wrapped in  a banana leaf.  </P> <P> Small Dai settlements are a short bicycle ride from the guest house, which  rents bikes for 1 yuan (about 27 cents) an hour. But to get an even better idea  how the Dai people live, a boat ride down the Lancang River (better known to  Westerners as the Mekong, around which much of everyday life revolves) is a  must.  </P> <P> The boat ride is like a step back in time, with boys frolicking in the water  and women washing their waist-length hair while young and old alike pan for  gold.  </P> <P> The official accompanying our group told us that it is "not convenient" (read:  not allowed) for tourists to travel down the river, and that the village is  open only to foreigners working in China or scientists with a specific reason  to be there. But again, persistence and a mild manner, combined with as much  Chinese as you can muster, are all you really need to eventually win a seat on  one of the boats.  </P> <P> The best-known holiday in Xishuangbanna is the Water-Splashing Festival, April  13-15. To mark the new year the Dai people race boats on the Mekong and shoot  fireworks, and the young Dai women splash each other with water to dispel the  diseases and misfortunes of the past year and usher in the new amid hopes for  good health, abundant crops and fine cattle.  </P> <P> Hints: Bring slide film from home. Slide film is available only in the largest  Chinese cities and is sometimes out of stock even there. Bring binoculars for  the trip down the river to get a better view of life along the banks. Bring  Dramamine or a similar medication for motion sickness. Roads here are winding  and steep, and often unpaved. Avoid overeating; food in Xishuangbanna tends to  be very rich.  </P> <P> If you are traveling on your own and have a specific scientific, educational or  job-related reason to tour Xishuangbanna, come with a letter of introduction.  This works wonders with nervous Chinese officials, who may then consider you an  official guest worthy of the best treatment.  </P> <P> Finding out anything about this area, such as customs, is difficult both  because of the language gap and because relatively little has been written  about this area of China. The only travel guide I've found with any information  about Xishuangbanna is "China: A Travel Survival Kit" (Lonely Planet: $17.95).  </P> <P> For more information: China National Tourist Office, 333 W.

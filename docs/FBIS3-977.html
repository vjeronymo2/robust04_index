The State Council, sworn in a week ago, mandated ECOMOG to  disarm all factions that took part in the four-year civil war,  including those that did not sign a peace agreement.    Detailing for the first time the disarmament underway,  ECOMOG  said in a statement that soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia  (AFL -- the armed branch of the interim government) and the  National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) had started to turn  weapons in at eight special centres around the country.    The United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), main rival of the  NPFL, had given ECOMOG the green light to start disarming its  fighters, ECOMOG added. Peacekeepers had collected 856  individual weapons, two artillery pieces, ammunition and hand  grenades, the statement said. The AFL began disarming March 8,  while the NPFL did so on March 12.    A leadership crisis caused the ULIMO to delay, but ULIMO  president Alhaji Koromah had now given the green light to begin  disarming his forces. On Saturday General Roosevelt Johnson,  ULIMO's top military leader, said he had "reconciled" with  Koromah after a crisis sparked by political and ethnic rivalry  within the organisation.    Johnson afterwards urged all the movement's fighters to  cooperate with the disarmament process.</p>

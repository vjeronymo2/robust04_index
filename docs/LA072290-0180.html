			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECORD REAL ESTATE DEALS;  </P> <P> DOCUMENTS: FOLLOWING THE PROPER PROCEDURES CAN PROTECT AN OWNER FROM FINANCIAL  LOSS.  </P> <P> A surprisingly large number of real estate documents remain unrecorded, usually  due to ignorance. Failure to record a deed, mortgage or other realty document  can cause unnecessary but often huge financial losses.  </P> <P> For example, home buyers sometimes don't record their deeds for fear the lender  will call the low interest rate mortgage if it is not assumable, the property  will be reassessed to raise the property tax, or that a pre-existing judgment  or income tax lien will attach to the property.  </P> <P> These may seem like valid reasons for not recording a deed, but the buyer  should be aware (1) an unscrupulous seller might sell the same property to  another buyer who records his deed first, (2) the seller could incur income tax  or judgment liens that will attach to the property, or worse yet, (3) the  seller might file bankruptcy.  </P> <P> When a lender such as a home seller who is helping to finance the sale receives  a mortgage and fails to record the deed, the lender could only look to the  borrower and not to the property for repayment.  </P> <P> Documents are recorded with the county recorder of deeds to give constructive  notice of the contents of the documents. Any person dealing with real estate is  presumed to know of the recorded papers affecting a specific property, such as  deeds, mortgages, liens and judgments.  </P> <P> By searching the public records, anyone can determine who owns a property and  what liens or other encumbrances affect the title. Many counties now have  computerized records.  </P> <P> The basic recording rule is "first in time is first in right." This means that  the first recorded document has priority over a later recorded document, even  if the second document to be recorded was executed earlier than the first  document recorded.  </P> <P> This priority of recording can be very critical. Suppose you loan a homeowner  $10,000 secured by what you thought would be a second mortgage on the house.  But the homeowner then borrows $20,000 from another lender, who immediately  records his mortgage before you record yours. The $20,000 lender would have a  second mortgage and because you delayed recording, you would have a third  mortgage securing your $10,000 loan. Even a one-minute difference can be  critical to determining the priority of a mortgage.  </P> <P> Virtually any document affecting real estate is eligible for recording if it is  properly notarized. Deeds, mortgages, trust deeds, leases, purchase options,  land contracts and purchase agreements are a few examples of documents eligible  for recording. My neighbor and I recently signed a notarized "fence agreement,"  which she can record.  </P> <P> But improper recording of a document against a property creates a "title  cloud," which may give rise to a lawsuit for damages due to "slander of title,"  a serious offense. For example, if a mortgage lender mistakenly records a  mortgage against your house instead of the one next door, that would be slander  of your title.  </P> <P> An unusual type of recordable document is a lis pendens, which is recorded  against a property when litigation involving its title has been filed. The lis  pendens simply warns any buyer or lender that the property title is in  litigation and that anyone dealing with the property does so subject to the  outcome of the lawsuit.  </P> <P> "Wild documents" are recorded documents that usually contain an error, thus  placing them outside the chain of title. For example, suppose Smith owns a  property but buyer Jones records a deed to him from seller Thompson. This is a  wild document because no deed was recorded from Smith to Thompson. Although  such a deed from Smith to Thompson may exist, if it was not recorded, it gave  no constructive notice, so the deed to Smith is a wild document outside the  chain of title.  </P> <P> Most property buyers and sellers don't worry about the recording laws. Whenever  they acquire a property, they make certain they receive an owner's title  insurance policy. Then if there is a recording error, the title insurer will  pay for correcting the problem.  </P> <P> Without title insurance, property titles would be in chaos. Especially when  acquiring property from friends and relatives, title insurance is vital to be  certain there are no unexpected liens or encumbrances. Not only does title  insurance insure the document as it was represented, but unexpected title risks  such as forged signatures, rights of ex-spouses, claims by missing heirs, title  claims by minors and incompetent persons, and improperly recorded instruments  also are insured. Further information on recording laws is available from a  local real estate attorney or title insurance officer.  </P></p>

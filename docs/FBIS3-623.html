Mr. Ka, who made this statement at a meeting with his Malian  counterpart Sada Samake, considered these incidents as an alert  signal that should prompt the two countries to take effective  measures to dissuade those who attempt to breed insecurity along  their common border, hence disturbing the peace and tranquility  of the border populations. After recalling the instructions  given in this regard by President Abdou Diouf during yesterday's  cabinet meeting, Djibo Ka reasserted the Senegalese Government's  determination to spare no effort in combating banditry and  insecurity along the common border.    For his part, Sada Samake, Malian territorial administration  and security minister stressed the urgent need to implement  security measures and to provide the necessary framework for  fighting the criminals. "Rigorous measures must be taken to  counter acts of vandalism by bandits who are beginning to cause  heavy losses in human lives and property," he said in particular.    Talks between the two ministers should lead to the adoption  of a new strategy to counter vandalism along the common border  of the two countries. A final communique will be issued at the  end of the talks scheduled for today. The Kidira meeting is the  second to be held by the two ministers after the one in Bakel  (east Senegal) on 13 January.</p>

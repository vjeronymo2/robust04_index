			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sophia 'Amarah in Cairo] </F>   [Text] Cairo today bid farewell to a member of the  Palestinian National Authority [PNA] formed to administer the  Palestinian autonomous areas.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th, who will be accompanied by Monte Carlo  radio in the car that will take him from the Egyptian capital to  his homeland -- where he will settle in Gaza, held a news  conference in the Cairo this morning prior to his departure.    [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Let us brush  aside the issue of your return home. What are the major  difficulties that you will confront at the start of your new  mission in Gaza?    [Sha'th] Our major difficulty will be with Israel. It lies  in the implementation of the agreement signed with the Israelis,  and the continuation of the negotiations, as provided for in the  Declaration of Principles. There are still many issues that we  and the Israelis need to work out and agree upon, including the  release of all prisoners, the opening of a safe corridor between  Gaza and Jericho, bringing the West Bank under the PNA's  authority, and the repatriation of the persons displaced in  1967. We must immediately begin efforts to settle these issues,  which were obscured by the Israeli [words indistinct].  Moreover, we must confront any problems the Israelis might  create over Jerusalem.    ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has also announced that  Palestinian border guards will soon be deployed on the Allenby  Bridge and the Rafah Border Post. He added that the  Palestinians will shortly be allowed to move freely from the  Gaza Strip to the Jericho area.    With regard to the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,  Sha'th  had the following to say:    [Sha'th] We will not allow people bearing arms to move  freely  on the street. However, we will not storm houses to seize  weapons. As we once fought the Israelis, we will not now allow  the Israelis to move freely with their weapons on streets and  roads, and to use them to open fire on the Palestinians. In the  same vein, we will not allow the Palestinians to open fire on  the Israelis. We will not allow any of us to turn into a judge,  indictor, prosecutor, and executioner. We will not allow this  to happen. There might be some collaborators with the  occupation authorities. Those who have any complaints in this  regard must head for the Palestinian police, provide evidence,  and demand a trial of those suspected of collaboration. If  everybody acts conscientiously and out of a sense of  responsibility; that is, if everybody believes in Islam, in  their leaders, in a constitution, and a host of principles, then  he or she must grant officials and leaders the opportunity to  continue the struggle in its various forms in light of what is  deemed appropriate by the current phase, taking into account  what the Muslim community deems best. I believe that the  Palestinian people now have the opportunity to achieve their  goals. If we were to fail in this, then nobody would blame us  if we return to armed struggle.    ['Amarah] On the other hand, Sha'th announced that  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the  autonomous areas next week to reside in Jericho.    In a related development, the Palestinian official affirmed  that the PNA, which pledged to donor nations to achieve  self-reliance within a year's time, is awaiting international  aid modelled on the Marshal plan launched by the United States  to aid the collapsing West European states in the wake of World  War II, rather than a redemption operation similar to that of  redeeming ruptured [word indistinct], as he put it. We will  update you on relevant developments once we arrive in Gaza  Strip. [end recording]</p>

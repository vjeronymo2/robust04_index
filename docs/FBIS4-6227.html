			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Dinh Khai on the news conference </F> given by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov in Hanoi on  15 April]    [Summary] Russian Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov, chairman of  the Russian-Vietnamese Intergovernmental Committee for Economic,  Trade, and Science and Technology Cooperation, was in Vietnam to  attend the third working session of the committee. To conclude  the working visit, Mr. Yarov held a news conference.    At the news conference, Mr. Yarov reported on the results of  the third session of the intergovernmental committee and the  visit of the delegation to the Hoa Binh Hydroelectricity Plant.  He revealed that Russia will continue its cooperation with  Vietnam in power projects; in the joint venture in oil  exploitation; in upgrading factories, including the Lao Cai  Apatite Factory; and in post and telegraphic services. The  Russian and Vietnamese sides both agreed to set up working  groups to speed up cooperation.    He also revealed that "the next working session of the  intergovernmental committee will be held in the first quarter of  1995 in Moscow, and he hoped that by then a Vietnamese  electronic assembly factory would have been set up in Moscow."    Mr. Graskov, vice chairman of the intergovernmental  committee, talked about "certain difficulties in receiving items  of merchandise that Vietnam uses to pay for its debts to the  Russian Federation. We want the goods to be in greater quantity  compared with the existing ones, more diversified, and of better  quality with more competitive prices."    He also said the "Russian side has created conditions for  Vietnamese goods to get into the Russian market, and hence we  expect similar action from the Vietnamese side, primarily to  create conditions for Russian machinery and equipment to access  the Vietnamese market."</p>

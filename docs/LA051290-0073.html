			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARSAW SCOLDS WALESA FOR HIS CRITICISM OF REFORMS  </P> <P> The Polish government scolded Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Friday for his  criticism of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's reform program, saying  "exposure of political differences does not serve the interests of the  country."  </P> <P> The remarks by government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska came a day after  Walesa attacked the government for failing to address the concerns of workers  in the Gdansk shipyard, where the Solidarity union was born in 1980.  </P> <P> The exchange was part of a growing tiff between Mazowiecki, the head of the  Solidarity-led government, and Walesa, the trade union chief, about how the  country should be governed.  </P> <P> In the southwestern industrial center of Katowice, meanwhile, 50 right-wing  activists took over the headquarters of regional Polish television and radio,  which is controlled by the Solidarity government. The protesters, members of  the nationalistic Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), walked  peacefully into the headquarters and occupied the building to press demands for  greater access by opposition groups to the media.  </P> <P> KPN leader Adam Slomka was meeting with regional governor Tadeusz Wnuk on the  matter, a KPN spokesman said in Katowice.  </P> <P> "We want to protest the monopoly of the Solidarity communistic government on  the media," the spokesman said, referring to last year's round-table  arrangement allowing the Communists to retain some posts in the government.  </P> <P> The latest tiff between Walesa and the government erupted Thursday when the  union leader supported a brief strike at the Gdansk shipyard by workers  concerned about low wages. Walesa lashed out at the government for choosing  "the wrong version" of democracy, which he said is not allowing individuals  their full liberties within the law.  </P> <P> Walesa also has demanded that Communists be ousted from positions that permit  them to control various sectors of the economy.  </P></p>

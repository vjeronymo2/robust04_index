			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation forecasts boost prices DRIVEN by more signs of easing inflationary pressures, gilts continued their recent rise, helped by a generally optimistic assessment by the Bank of England about future price trends. Yields of gilts at the 10-year maturity fell by about 20 basis points on the week to be quoted on Friday night at about 6.9 per cent. The decline at the longer end of the yield curve was even greater, partly as a result of the announcement by the Bank on Friday that there would be no gilt auction at the end of this month. That statement followed from the good progress by Threadneedle Street in selling bonds to cover the expected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement this financial year. Just four and a half months into the year the Bank has accounted for nearly 60 per cent of deficit by selling about Pounds 29bn worth of gilts. With the summer holidays in full swing, it is no wonder that Bank officials calculated they could take a rest from new gilt auctions, which recently have been held at the rate of one a month. The Bank's announcement, which came at the end of a week in which it sold more than Pounds 1.5bn of gilts through taps, triggered spiralling prices at the long end of the yield curve, leaving long-dated gilts up a net  3/4 of a point on the day. Sentiment about gilts was helped earlier in the week by the Bank's latest inflation report, which said that the Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation is unlikely to breach the government's 4 per cent ceiling in the next two years. This measure defines underlying inflation as the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index excluding mortgage payments. The generally positive views about price pressures came in a comprehensive Bank study which discussed more than 28 ways of measuring inflation. The report said: 'Many goods prices are rising more slowly than three months ago, and inflation in the service sector has fallen considerably.' The view that price pressures are likely to stay muted was supported by news that manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent lower in the three months to June than they were in the same three months a year ago. This figure compares with a fall of 3.4 per cent in the three months to May. In addition, average earnings growth across the economy slowed to an underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to June, the lowest figure for 25 years and a quarter of a percentage point lower than the figure for the 12 months to May. While encouraged by these findings, gilt investors also warmed to the tone of other UK economic data last week pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery in manufacturing. Significant manufacturing and export growth in the first half of the year has been the driving force behind the signs of economic revival after the long recession. However, gilt investors would like to see a deceleration in the recovery profile, on the grounds that this would be less likely to stimulate inflationary pressures. On this basis, the announcement that manufacturing output in June dropped by 2.1 per cent compared with May was greeted enthusiastically by many gilt market participants. This was the sharpest monthly drop since February 1988. Even though the June figure partly compensated for a big increase in output in May, it underlined the belief that manufacturers are unlikely to see the favourable trading conditions that they enjoyed in the first half of 1993 replicated in the second half. This is partly because of a slowdown in important export markets in continental Europe. A survey conducted jointly by the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a consultancy, said that manufacturing order books in six out of the 11 UK regions were in a weaker position in July than three months earlier. This supported the gloomier tone of prognostications about the sector's outlook. The level of orders in northern and north-west England, the south-east, west Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland were all worse in the current survey compared with three months earlier. However, the levels of output volumes fell over the same period only in four regions - the south-east, south-west, north-west and Wales. The survey said that inflationary pressures across the country were subdued, while the best prospects for manufacturing were in the west Midlands and Scotland.</p>

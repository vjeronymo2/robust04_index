			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HILLMAN EARNS A TRYOUT WITH JAZZ  </P> <P> Joe Hillman of Glendale was one of seven Southern California Professional  Basketball League players selected by the Utah Jazz this week to participate in  the team's preseason camp, which begins in October in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Hillman, a Hoover High graduate, was playing baseball for the Modesto A's, an  Oakland Athletics affiliate in the Class-A California League, before he was  placed on the temporary inactive list to pursue a basketball career.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted to play basketball over baseball. It's been my goal," said  Hillman, who added that he has not informed the Athletics of his decision to  give up baseball this season.  </P> <P> "(Making the cut) feels all right, but it's not going to do any good unless I  make the team. I would have been disappointed if I wasn't asked back, but the  goal isn't done yet."  </P> <P> Despite redshirting his sophomore season, Hillman, 6-foot-3, averaged 6.4  points a game in four years at Indiana. He also had a .310 career batting  average in three seasons on the school's baseball team.  </P> <P> At Hoover, he shattered all the school's scoring records, averaging 41.3 points  a game his senior season -- then the third-best average in Southern Section  history -- and finishing with 2,213 career points.  </P> <P> Tony Chieffo of Granada Hills shot a two-over-par 73 Friday to finish in sole  possession of 11th place in the 23rd Pacific Coast Golf Assn. Amateur  Championship at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Chieffo finished 14 strokes behind Texan Randy Sonnier, of who shot a  three-under 68 to finish at 285 on the 6,808-yard South Course. Bryan Pemberton  of Dublin, Calif., who plays at USC, and Robert Gomez of Las Vegas finished in  a tie for second with 72-hole totals of 287.  </P> <P> Paul Stankowski of Oxnard, second after the first round, shot a 78 to finish at  302. Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys carded a 76 and finished at 303.  </P> <P> Demetrious Phillips and Tony Davis, both of whom graduated from Antelope Valley  High in June, have made oral commitments to play basketball at Antelope Valley  College this season.  </P> <P> Phillips, a 5-11 guard, averaged a team-high 16 points a game last season and  was named to the All-Golden League team. Davis, also an all-league selection,  averaged 12 points and 10 rebounds at forward.  </P> <P> In addition, Lorna Sawyer and Theresa Toliver said that they will play  volleyball for the Marauders. Sawyer, a setter-outside hitter, was named team  MVP at Antelope Valley High last season. Toliver, a middle blocker, was named  Desert High MVP.  </P> <P> Richard Gallien of Woodland Hills coached a six-member Southern California  boys' junior tennis team to a national title Wednesday in the Intersectional  National Championships in Columbus, S.C.  </P> <P> Southern California defeated Florida, 4-3, in the final. The winning team,  which included Stanford-bound Kenny Pedroza of Ventura High, was not seeded  among the top five squads. Southern California advanced to the final by  defeating the New England states, third-seeded Texas and the three-time  champion South team, which was seeded second.  </P> <P> Gallien, 28, is the men's co-coach at Pepperdine.  </P> <P> Keith Wright, formerly of Cal State Northridge, caught two passes for 22 yards  in his professional football debut and former Poly High star Craig Ellis caught  two touchdown passes to help the Edmonton Eskimos to a 22-21 win over the  Toronto Argonauts in a Canadian Football League game Thursday night in  Edmonton.  </P> <P> It was the first official game in two years for Wright, 25, who earned  All-Western Football Conference honors with the Matadors in 1987. Wright was  declared academically ineligible at CSUN two weeks before the start of the  1988.  </P></p>

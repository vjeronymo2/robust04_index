If so, the alien shall be admitted conditionally for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien shall be notified that the alien and his or her petitioning spouse must file a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I&hyph;751) within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditional residence based on entrepreneurship.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act) or the spouse or unmarried minor child of an alien entrepreneur shall be admitted conditionally for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien shall be notified that the principal alien (entrepreneur) must file a Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I&hyph;829) within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expired conditional permanent resident alien status.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The lawful permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically terminates if the conditional basis of such status is not removed by the Service through approval of a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I&hyph;751) or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), a Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I&hyph;829). Therefore, an alien who is seeking admission as a returning resident subsequent to the second anniversary of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as provided in &sect;211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional basis of such residence has not been removed pursuant to section 216(c) or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under exclusion proceedings. However, in a case where conditional residence was based on a marriage, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and the alien may be admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I&hyph;751) is filed jointly, or by the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by the Service. In the case of an alien entrepreneur, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form I&hyph;829) is filed by the alien entrepreneur and approved by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 242_PROCEEDINGS TO DETERMINE DEPORTABILITY OF ALIENS IN THE UNITED STATES, APPREHENSION, CUSTODY, HEARING, AND APPEAL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21.

The application shall be subject to the requirements of parts 244, 245, and 249 of this chapter. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance with part 216 of the chapter. In conjunction with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration judge, if the respondent is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and believes that he or she meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of the benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an opportunity to make application therefor during the hearing. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application under this paragraph, the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 14874, April 6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the respondent of the general nature of the information in order that the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 5, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Doris Meissner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;391 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;10&hyph;Ms <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

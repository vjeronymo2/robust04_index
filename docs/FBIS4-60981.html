			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Amangeldy Akhmetalimov, </F> Gennadiy Kulagin]    [Text] Almaty, 2 May--Central Asia should become a single  and effectively functioning economic space. This was the  conclusion reached by Nursultan Nazarbayev, Askar Akayev, and  Islam Karimov, the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Uzbekistan, at their meeting on 29-30 April on the shores of  Lake Issyk-Kul that was proposed by the Kyrgyz leader, the  KazTAG news agency reported today.    Trilateral summit meetings of this kind have become a  regular  event. They had been held in Kazakhstan previously--in the  locality of Ordabasy in south Kazakhstan Oblast and also in  Kokshetau.    The main outcome of the present meeting was Kyrgyzstan's  joining the treaty on the creation of a single economic space  between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The treaty has now become  trilateral.    The presidents discussed a wide range of issues of mutual  interest and exchanged views on the current situation in Central  Asia and the CIS, as well as on a range of international  problems.    The presidents pointed out the positive trend toward  deepening economic links in the region and in the CIS as a  whole. They especially noted the importance of working out a  mechanism for implementing the treaty between Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan on the creation of a single economic  space, which represents a new level of integration for the  economies of Central Asian states at a time when obstacles to  economic interaction such as customs barriers and double  taxation continue to be removed, while at the same time currency  exchange points are opening.    The sides noted that the document is fully in accordance  with  the provisions of the treaty on the creation of an economic  union between Commonwealth countries and is open for joining by  all the states of the Commonwealth.    The need to heighten the role of institutions integrating  the  economic, cultural, and information space both within the CIS  and within Central Asia demands that dialogue at the summit  level be stepped up, the presidents said. Similar problems in  the economic and political spheres and traditional production  and social links create real preconditions for developing closer  cooperation, for significantly reducing the expenses of the  transitional period, and for relieving the difficulties brought  about by the process of forming a market economy.    They believe a number of political problems are also common  to the whole region. The potential for the peaceful and  effective cohabitation of different ethnic groups in Central  Asia should help to stabilize the ethno-regional situation.    Within the framework of the decision by Commonwealth heads  of  state to render urgent aid to Kyrgyzstan, the leaders of the  three countries discussed specific measures for eliminating the  damage that the elements have inflicted on the Republic's  economy.    Expressing satisfaction with the results of the meeting, the  presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan stressed  that the constructive and fruitful talks that had taken place  would serve "to further develop and strengthen the historic  friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between the  peoples of our fraternal countries."</p>

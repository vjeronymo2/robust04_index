			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Channel 4 seeks review of ruling Channel 4 is to seek a judicial review of a decision by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission after complaints by two former chancellors of the exchequer. The commission found that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were treated unfairly in a Channel 4 programme on monetary policy, A Brief Economic History of Our Times, made by Fulcrum Productions. The commission came to its conclusion in spite of deciding that the programme was not inaccurate in any way. It decided that the co-operation of the two Tory peers was secured on a misleading basis. The programme consisted, the commission found, of unrelieved criticism of the handling of the economy by Lord Howe and Lord Lawson. Had they known the programme makers' intentions, neither would have taken part, it said. Channel 4 said it had considered issuing libel proceedings against commission members, but this was considered unlikely to succeed because the complaints body is statutory and its members are covered by qualified privilege. Channel 4 has been told, however, that it has a case to seek judicial review of the decision on the grounds that the commission exceeded its powers. It is believed that Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were given written questions in advance by Fulcrum and also saw the extracts that were going to be used. Lord Lawson was paid Pounds 1,000 for his interview. Lord Howe did not receive a payment - apparently because he did not ask. Lord Howe also complained to Fulcrum about 'negative' clips in the programme of the main news events of the years. These included events such as the Brighton bomb and the York Minster fire, and were used by Fulcrum to remind people of what was going on apart from monetary policy. Lord Howe complained in a letter to Fulcrum about the other events and people portrayed, which included: ' . . . the Piper Alpha disaster, the unexplained cripple in a wheelchair - even the fall of the Berlin wall is made to look like an ugly riot.' The 'unexplained cripple' mentioned by Lord Howe was Professor Stephen Hawking, the physicist and author of A Brief History of Time.</p>

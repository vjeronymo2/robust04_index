			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Virgin in talks on flights from City VIRGIN Atlantic Airways said yesterday that it is negotiating with two airlines that want to use its name and colours to run flights from London City Airport. The approaches from the two unnamed airlines come after the launch earlier this year of a Virgin service between London's Gatwick airport and Athens. The twice-daily flights are due to transfer to Heathrow airport next month. The service is run by South East European Airlines, a Greek carrier, which uses the Virgin name and colours and pays a royalty on each ticket sold. Virgin said the proposed flights from City Airport would operate on the same basis. The companies Virgin is talking to would lease the aircraft, employ staff and pay all operating expenses. Virgin would train the staff and offer the companies access to its ticket reservation service and frequent-flyer programme. Virgin sales staff would sell tickets for the flights, and the aircraft would be painted in its colours. Virgin would not identify the two companies but said one was an existing operator and the other a start-up. The flights from City Airport would be to Ireland and continental Europe. The company dismissed as 'rubbish' suggestions that it might take a stake in City Airport.</p>

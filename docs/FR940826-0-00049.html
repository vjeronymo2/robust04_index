The transfer shall be subject to the following standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise described to the recipient in writing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120-calendar-day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;12.935 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Supplies and other expendable property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition.

The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;12.936 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Intangible property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data for Federal purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.934(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;12.937 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Property trust relationship. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

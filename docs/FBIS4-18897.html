			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Alliance, League Reach </F> Outline Agreement on Federalism"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Representatives of the  federalist Northern League and neo-fascist National Alliance  reached outline agreement on a formula "reconciling a  presidential republic with federalism" in a meeting Friday [8  April], party officials said.    "We agreed," said the League's Lower House whip Roberto  Maroni, "that this would be a government of complete change,  which will initiate very strong and incisive reform, rewriting  the constitution to reconcile federalism and a presidential  republic."    This was the second day of contacts between the League and  National Alliance, which, with Forza Italia and several smaller  parties, were part of the right-wing Freedom Front which scored  a victory in last month's general elections. The Freedom Front  parties are now seeking consensus on programmes to allow them to  form a government.    National Alliance and the League said they would be working  on a scheme including direct elections of the prime minister,  and reorganisation of the state along federal lines, leading to  constitutional reforms which would then be put to the public in  a referendum.    Domenico Fisichella, of National Alliance which sticks  firmly  to its line of the indivisibility of the state, said after  today's meeting that "federalism has tended, throughout history,  to unite peoples, and not to break them apart. The  counter-balance of a presidential republic is necessary,  however."    "There are two possibilities as far as a presidential  republic goes," Fisichella added. "There is the direct election  of the president of the republic, and the direct election of the  premier. This second option is the most practical," and will  provide the basis for further League-National Alliance talks, he  said.    Gianfranco Miglio, the League's ideologue, briefed  journalists on his long-term view of Italian institutions,  stressing that these ideas were not discussed in today's talks:  "With the direct election of the prime minister," he said, "the  president would lose many of his current functions... He would  be reduced to president of the constitutional court."    Miglio foresaw an end to the cabinet, which would be  replaced  by a `directorate' of representatives from the cantons into  which the country would be divided.    Miglio's League colleagues foresaw a six-month timetable for  basic constitutional changes, which would be drawn up by the  executive, then presented to parliament for its opinion before  being put before the country in a referendum.    "The era of parties running things together has come to an  end, and the governing majority will therefore make its proposal  which will then be debated in its natural place, in parliament,"  said the League's Senate whip Francesco Speroni.    "If the initiative comes from the government," said Roberto  Maroni, "then there will be none of the long-windedness which  accompanied the bi-cameral reform committee (which overhauled  electoral laws) and it will not take long to draw up a proposal  to put before the Houses."    With Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi having withdrawn  from the government-formation fray after his most recent verbal  battle with League chief Umberto Bossi, haggling over government  posts was apparently absent from today's talks.    Some mention of who will fill the premier's office was made,  it would seem: "It is up to the president of the republic to  decide on who will get a prime ministerial mandate," said  Giuseppe Tatarella of National Alliance, who was present for the  gathering, "but all signs are pointing towards Berlusconi, in  his capacity as leader of the force which came first in Italy."    And Forza Italia's chief financial expert, Antonio Martino,  looked confident about his party's future role in forging  economic policy. Commenting on 1994 forecasts presented by the  cabinet today, the economics professor said "there can be no  doubt that if our proposals are adopted, the growth in  employment and in investments, and the development rate would be  far above that predicted by the government." Forza Italia will  be back in the picture next Monday when Freedom Front allies get  together.    "This will be the first meeting in which all the parties  which consider themselves government allies will discuss  programmes," said Giuseppe Tatarella. "And from Monday on, we  will all be looking forward to decisions from President (Oscar  Luigi) Scalfaro."</p>

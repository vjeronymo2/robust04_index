			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PRO'S CALL TO ORDER;  </P> <P> ORGANIZATION: THE GOAL, SAYS AUTHOR STEPHANIE WINSTON, IS BEING ABLE TO FIND  WHAT YOU WANT TO FIND WHEN YOU WANT TO FIND IT.  </P> <P> The comforting news is that being well organized, as Stephanie Winston defines  it, does not necessarily mean being neat. Nor does it require doing things in a  regimented way. "It's a very flexible system -- you apply the basic rules of  logic and common sense to your own personal situation."  </P> <P> Furthermore, Winston says she does not regard people who are less than well  organized and tidy as having major character flaws. "You can be Mother Teresa  or Attila the Hun and be organized or disorganized -- it's not a moral issue."  </P> <P> Make no mistake: Winston, author of "Getting Organized" (Warner Books), a  bestseller that has sold more than 500,000 copies since its 1978 publication,  clearly thinks that being organized is the way to go. It is, as she defines it,  the ability to find what you want to find when you want to find it, and to do  what you want to do in a timely fashion.  </P> <P> "I think organization is an extremely important tool for just living your life  in a more effective way," she says.  </P> <P> Winston is the founder and president of the Organizing Principle, a Manhattan  consulting company. She wrote "The Organized Executive" (also published by  Warner Books) in 1983, and is now sifting through interviews with 38 corporate  executives for a new book due this spring.  </P> <P> Her business clients tend to be senior executives who pay up to $1,500 a day  for her advice. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, the health-care products company,  Winston helped Nancy Lane, head of the human-resources division, and her  secretary to develop more efficient systems for handling everything from travel  arrangements for Lane's frequent business trips to daily mail.  </P> <P> At Winston's suggestion, the secretary screened the mail, handled as much of it  herself as she could, and briefed her boss on what she had done.  </P> <P> "That way, the only paper that actually came into my hands was that which  required me to act on it," Lane says.  </P> <P> Organizing a business is not so different from organizing a household, says  Winston, who began her career by helping people at home. Almost everyone is  constitutionally capable of being well-organized, she points out in a recent  interview. Some come by it instinctively, and others have to learn it, she  says.  </P> <P> For those overwhelmed by the magnitude of certain chores, Winston suggests  breaking them down into smaller jobs. Many people are so awed by the thought of  trying to clean their closets and do the job to perfection, she says, that they  procrastinate. Winston suggests starting with one closet, spending 10 minutes  to half an hour on it two or three times a week.  </P> <P> "It may take you a month to get it done," she says, "but so what?" She also  does not rule out the extra incentive of a reward. The promise of a movie after  a particularly toilsome task, she says, can help.  </P> <P> Delegating and bartering some time-consuming or less-pleasant chores are also  possibilities. "The goal should be not necessarily to do the job, but to get it  done. I don't believe in being a martyr," Winston insists. Hiring a high school  or college student to do shopping and other errands can be a help, she says.  Groups of parents may take turns driving one another's children to various  activities. Spouses can swap home chores to accommodate likes and dislikes.  </P> <P> Friends can profitably barter, Winston says. She cites the example of two women  who are cousins and close friends. One, an accountant, keeps track of the  other's finances and pays her bills. The other, who dislikes dealing with  money, does regular grocery shopping for her friend in return.  </P> <P> To save time at home, Winston suggests, consolidate tasks. That includes  reserving a chunk of time in which to answer letters, pay bills and return  phone calls. Winston says she has "in" days for writing and phone calls and  "out" days to keep appointments and run errands. On "in" days, she often relies  on an answering machine to avoid interruptions.  </P> <P> Winston came by her expertise indirectly. As a political science graduate of  Barnard College, she took a book-publishing job editing and translating books  from French to English. After moving to free-lance editing, she decided to go  on for a Ph.D. in clinical psychology but needed a more reliable income.  </P> <P> She heard about another graduate student financing her studies by helping  people organize household moves. Since her editing experience also involved  organizing, making sure that books were logically and coherently put together,  she decided to work toward becoming a professional organizer.  </P> <P> Winston says she practices what she preaches. Sometimes she purposely lets  filing work accumulate, she says, so she can attack it for an hour or so when  she is bored or restless. "Organizing is really a lot of fun, once you get the  hang of it," she says.  </P> <P> Conceding she is not the neatest person in the world, she admits to having a  "junk chair," as she recommends in her book, on which to put clothes after a  day's wearing. She says she never lets the clothes accumulate, however, for  more than three or four days at a time. She also recommends a temporary "junk  drawer" in the kitchen for odds and ends.  </P> <P> As a recent housewarming gift for her good friends Charles and Norma Fox  Moxley, Winston reorganized their extensive book collection. The couple was  moving to a larger apartment partly because the books had taken over many of  the closets and kitchen cabinets. Winston organized the books, first  alphabetically by subject -- from history to psychology -- then by author.  </P> <P> "Just the idea of going over to a bookshelf that's well-organized makes you  much more likely to use it," says Mrs. Moxley. Winston, she notes, also helped  her reorganize her kitchen in an earlier apartment move. Rarely used utensils  and pans were stored in boxes under a numbering system that put the least-used  materials on the highest shelves.  </P> <P> Winston says the rewards of her job are many, although it usually takes a while  for clients to grasp what's required and be willing to make tough decisions.  </P> <P> "The first few hours together can be quite stressful because I'm suggesting a  whole different approach to doing things," she says. "But then, all of a sudden  -- like one of those comic books where the light bulb goes on over someone's  head -- the situation begins to change and they take over. That shift is very  exciting. I've had to tell people, 'Hey, I don't think you should throw that  away!' "  </P> <P> Winston insists that no one can be organized who does not want to be. "Desire  is key," she says, "and it has to be strong and genuine enough to overcome some  often very deeply ingrained patterns. You can never organize anyone against  their will -- never!"  </P> <P> Do clients once taught to mend their ways ever fall back into old habits?  </P> <P> Winston surveyed 40 previous clients a few years ago: Ten said it "didn't  take." Twenty said there had been improvement and a permanent level of change.  And 10 said "their lives have been changed; they are now organized people  forever."  </P></p>

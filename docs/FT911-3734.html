			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Full circle for Thatcher's nemesis  -Philip Stephens on Michael Heseltine's replacement for the poll tax BACK in 1981 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher first pushed for the abolition of domestic rates, Mr Michael Heseltine offered a simple solution to her most pressing concern. The then environment secretary told the then prime minister that if her main worry was the high bills faced by little old ladies living alone in large houses, the answer was simple. He would make local authorities give them a big discount. The rest is history. Mrs Thatcher did not take his advice. Mr Heseltine moved on and then out of the Cabinet. The prime minister solved her problem by replacing the rates with the poll tax. Mr Heseltine pushed her out of Downing Street. Today Mr Heseltine, back at environment under a new prime minister, will outline his plan to replace the poll tax with a property tax which provides a 25 per cent discount to little old ladies living alone in large houses. The important details have already emerged; and despite of talk of further consultation, the scheme will represent a firm proposal rather than an option. At first glance it looks a neat synthesis of political imperatives and economic logic, though the realistic in Whitehall are still unsure of how strong the joins are. The tax will be levied on property classified in seven bands according to capital value. Bills will be applied to households - with an assumption that they contain two adults - rather than to individuals. The poorest will be exempted entirely. The present system of grant distribution using Standard Spending Assessments will remain as will draconian 'capping' powers to prevent 'excessive' spending by local authorities. There is little talk nowadays of preserving 'local democracy'. The economic logic is there in the fact that a property tax restores some relationship between individual wealth and the size of bills. The Duke in his stately home will pay more than the dustman in his council flat. The Treasury, which has always regarded property values as a reasonable proxy for income, is satisfied. So too are the politicians who can claim this makes the tax 'fair', or at least much fairer than the poll tax. All single adults, including the famous little old lady, will get a 25 per cent discount. The political compromise reveals itself in the decision to compress and then 'cap' the increases in bills which can be applied to the different bands. The government will set the bands nationally along with strict 'multipliers' to regulate the proportion of revenue raised from properties in each category. Most importantly, the bill for a house worth, say, Pounds 1m or more in band 7 will not be more than 2.5 times higher than for the flat worth Pounds 40,000 in band 1. So the system will be progressive - about 90 per cent of households will be unaffected by the 'cap' on band 7 - but, like the present income tax structure, only up to a point. Mr Heseltine hopes this compromise will calm Tory fears that a return to any property tax would automatically create a swathe of 'losers' in the south. The Budget switch of more than Pounds 4bn of local taxation to VAT should ensure that average bills across the country should not be much more than Pounds 350 per household. The multipliers will prevent councils from loading the burden on to southern Tory voters who have benefited from the sharp rise in property values over the past decade. Bills for similar properties will not be identical across the country. A three-bedroom semi in London will typically be in a higher band that a similar house in Barnsley, so will attract a higher bill. The Treasury thinks it should - incomes are higher in London than Barnsley. But the politicians will control the size of the differential. It all looks ingenious, and ministers are convinced that it will work. This time, they insist, the Treasury is fully behind the new system. It has been tested on the computers in Great George Street as well as those in Marsham Street. There is even a fig-leaf for those still wedded to the principle that all should contribute to the cost of local services. Mr Heseltine will argue that the two-person household assumed by the tax will capture 38m of the 42m adults theoretically liable to pay the poll. There is still, though, one serious weakness. Whatever the initial level of bills, the commitment to the Uniform Business Rate means that any local tax will be highly 'geared'. A 10 per cent rise in spending beyond that allowed for in government grant would produce a 70 per cent rise in bills. More than one senior minister is convinced that the UBR cannot survive in its present form. But talk of raising the tax burden on industry is for after, not before, the general election.</p>

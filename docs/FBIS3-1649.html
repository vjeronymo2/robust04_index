Construction on most of the projects is in full swing, while  some have been completed and put into operation ahead of  schedule, according to officials with the Hebei provincial  leading group for major construction projects.    Since last July when China began to adopt macroeconomic  control measures, the province has adjusted the orientation of  its basic construction investments at the right time and made an  overall plan for key construction projects in the province to  guarantee adequate financing.    Meanwhile, Hebei has observed the guiding principle of  optimizing industrial structure and product mix in making  investment in fixed assets, speeding up development of basic  industries and the service trade, and opening wider to the  outside world and promoting technical progress in the province's  major enterprises.    In the past year, the province completed 54 billion yuan in  investment toward fixed assets, up 68 percent compared with the  previous year, according to the officials.    Construction of basic facilities and completion of technical  upgrading projects in state-owned enterprises of the province  have greatly boosted the province's production of oil, iron  ores, coal, electricity, iron and steel, chemical fertilizers,  cement and textiles.</p>

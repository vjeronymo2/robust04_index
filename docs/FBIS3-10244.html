The official, who announced last week the sale of between  15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil to Cuba per day, said the oil  exports will begin in mid-1994.    "Cuba's main partners are Mexico and Canada, and it has been  no cause for problems with the United States," Nule Amin added.    The energy and mines minister said he does not see how  Colombia "could have problems" for selling crude to the island.    He explained Colombia will sell that quantity of oil,  "barely  one third of the (Cuban) demand for oil."    He said the method of payment of these "direct" sales will  be  "at international prices, and the Cubans will pay with foreign  exchange."    Meanwhile, it was reported in Santa Fe de Bogota Cuban  exiles  in Miami would allegedly boycott Colombian products.</p>

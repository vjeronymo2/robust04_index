			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The State Commercial Inspection Bureau's Circular on </F> Issuing `Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities  Through Border Trade'--State Commercial Inspection Bureau's  Document No. 134 (1993)"]    [Text] All affiliated commercial inspection bureaus:    After a year of trial implementation, the "Inspection and  Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through  Border Trade (for Trial Implementation)" have proved basically  feasible. Some clauses have been revised in light of the present  situation. Now the "Management Methods for Import and Export  Commodities Through Border Trade" are issued to you for  implementation. Should there be problems in the course of  implementation, please report them to the state bureau.    Attached are the Management Methods for Import and Export  Commodities Through Border Trade.    The State Commercial Inspection Bureau of the PRC    22 April 1993    Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through  Border Trade:    Article 1: To develop border trade, strengthen the  inspection, assessment, and supervision of import and export  commodities, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of  all the trading parties, these management methods have been  formulated in accordance with the "PRC Inspection Methods for  Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter shortened to the  "Inspection Methods") and the "Regulations on Implementing the  PRC Inspection Methods for Import and Export Commodities"  (hereinafter shortened to the "Implementation Regulations").    Article 2: These management methods are suitable for  inspection and management of import and export commodities  through small-scale border trade, civilian border trade, joint  fair trade on borders, and local trade in border areas.    Article 3: Commercial inspection departments' inspection of  import and export commodities through border trade covers the  following categories of commodities:    1. Import and export commodities which fall under the "list  of categories of import and export commodities subject to  commercial inspection departments' inspection" as well as import  and export commodities which, as law and administrative  regulations require, must be submitted to commercial inspection  departments for inspection;    2. Carrying out health inspection of export food and  quarantine of export animal products;    3. Commodities for which border trade contracts require  inspection by commercial inspection departments;    4. Commodities for which foreign trade dealers apply for  assessment and inspection.    Article 4: Commercial inspection departments may carry out  random checks on import and export commodities which are not  listed in Clauses 1 to 3 of Article 3.    Article 5: When handling applications for inspection of  import and export commodities through border trade, commercial  inspection departments may treat each case on its merits in  light of local border trade characteristics by adopting flexible  inspection methods, providing certificates to pass, or  completing clearance procedures.    Applications for inspection must be accompanied by the  relevant contracts or agreements as proof.    Article 6: Import and export commodities through local trade  in border areas, small-scale border trade, or civilian border  trade must be inspected according to the contract provisions if  any; if contract provisions are not available or are not clear,  inspection should proceed in accordance with the standards of  the relevant exporting country. If commodities involve safety  and health, inspection should proceed according to the  regulations of the relevant importing country. Import  commodities below the necessary safety and health standards  should be prohibited from entry even if the buyer agrees to  accept the commodities.    Article 7: Commodities imported with safety quality permits  should be handled according to the "Detailed Rules on Importing  Commodities Under the Safety Quality License System."    Article 8: After a port commercial inspection department  receives notice of import commodities' arrival, it should  proceed with the inspection of the commodities if inspection at  the port is possible.    If inspection at the port is not available, the port  commercial inspection department should promptly provide a  transfer procedural document and notify the port of arrival for  inspection of the commodities.    Article 9: If a foreign trade dealer applies for the  assessment or authorizes the inspection of commodities, the  commodities should be assessed or inspected in accordance with  the standards set by the foreign trade dealer.    Article 10: Commercial inspection departments should, in  accordance with the relevant regulations, exercise management  over commodities exported with quality licenses and health  registration certificates. Border trade operational units  should purchase commodities manufactured by factories which have  obtained quality licenses or health registration certificates  issued by commercial inspection departments, and should submit  these licenses or certificates to the commercial inspection  departments in the commodities' places of origin.    Article 11: Commercial inspection departments may send  personnel to inspect, check, assess, and supervise import and  export commodities stored in regions under their jurisdiction or  to trading sites under their jurisdiction.    Article 12: Before export commodities which require  commercial inspection certificates are directly transported out  of the borders through combined railway transportation, the  commercial inspection departments in places where the  commodities are dispatched should verify that the commodities  are up to standard before issuing such commercial inspection  certificates.    For export commodities transported through combined  transportation facilities other than railways, commercial  inspection exchange certificates or release certificates should  be issued by the commercial inspection departments in the places  of dispatch; and the relevant port commercial inspection  departments should examine the exchange certificates and  complete the clearance procedures for the export commodities to  be transported out of the borders. Commodities which are proved  to be below standard cannot be exported.    Article 13: After inspection, the relevant commercial  inspection departments should stamp the words "border trade" on  the certificates issued for export commodities through border  trade. The "border trade" stamp will be standardized by the  State Commercial Inspection Bureau.    Article 14: Violations of these methods are liable to  penalties in accordance with the "Inspection Methods" and the  "Implementation Regulations." Units or individuals  manufacturing or selling counterfeit commodities will be  severely dealt with in accordance with Articles 52 and 53 of the  "Implementation Regulations."    Article 15: Commercial inspection departments will collect  charges in accordance with the relevant regulations for the work  they have done in inspecting and assessing import and export  commodities.    Article 16: In light of border trade characteristics and  local conditions, commercial inspection departments in border  areas may designate the scope of import and export commodities  for inspection and formulate methods for exercising inspection  and management.    Article 17: The State Commercial Inspection Bureau is  responsible for explaining these methods. These methods will  come into effect on 1 June 1993. The former "Inspection and  Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through  Border Trade (for trial implementation)" promulgated on 1 June  1992 are simultaneously revoked.</p>

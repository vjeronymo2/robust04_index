			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Observer: Time watch Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, occupies a red-hot seat. His task of pushing through a plan to end the Soviet crisis will test the thickness of his skin and unflappability of his demeanour, besides the depth of his sardonic wit. He confesses no great desire to stay in the post, restrained from resignation only by reluctance to waste precious time which, he says, is of the essence in saving the economy. As finance minister, Pavlov was frustrated by the procrastinations of the previous government under Nikolai Ryzhkov, which 'wasted six months in discussions'. He should be used to it. In various top posts over the last decade, he saw price reform regularly promoted to the top of the political agenda, only to be relegated again. The first reform package was prepared in the last years of Leonid Brezhnev. Price lists were printed, but the plan died along with Brezhnev because the Politburo thought successor Yuri Andropov would be blamed for it. Resurrected under Konstantin Chernenko, reform again fell prey to mortality. Exhumed under Gorbachev, new price lists also reached the printer but were pulped after a central committee thumbs-down in 1988. Last month, under Pavlov, reform was finally pushed through. It has made him as popular as a mosquito on a summer evening but at least he made it while Gorbachev was in good health.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a MAINICHI SHIMBUN interview on 1 May, Chairman  Akira Yamagishi of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation  criticized Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's stance toward the  Constitution. Kakizawa, at a news conference after his  assumption of office, expressed positive attitude toward  constitutional debates to formulate emergency legislative  arrangements and approve collective self-defense rights.  Yamagishi harshly said: "This is a very serious problem that a  man, who had been a member of the Liberal Democratic Party only  10 days before, became the foreign minister of the coalition  administration, and made irresponsible remarks. He should be  blamed." He said that this issue should be discussed at the  Budget Committee.    In addition, he noted: "The security issue can be a reason  for presenting the no-confidence motion against the cabinet.  There is a great possibility that this issue will result in the  dissolution of the House of Representatives." Moreover,  touching on the policy agreement reached among the coalition  parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan,  Yamagishi pointed out: "The agreement does not say that the  coalition parties should positively discuss this issue. Unless  he approves the agreement, it is impossible for him to join the  coalition."    With regard to the dissolution of the lower house to conduct  a general election, he predicted that, "at the earliest, it will  be conducted after the summit talks in early July." He further  said: "It is most desirable to carry out the election under the  new election system. However, if it is physically impossible,  there will be no choice but to conduct the election under the  present system."</p>

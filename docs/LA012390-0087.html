			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S POOR GET NEW CHANCE TO APPLY FOR CITY RENT SUBSIDIES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Housing Authority on Monday reopened enrollment in the popular  Section 8 rental subsidy program for the poor, and officials said response from  people hoping to qualify was light but was expected to grow as word spread.  </P> <P> Low-income people who want to be considered for a Section 8 subsidy can call a  hot line at the Housing Authority or get an application at any Housing  Authority office, city-run senior center, city library, City Council field  office or county welfare office. Some state Assembly district offices are also  participating.  </P> <P> The Housing Authority created a furor last month when it reopened the  enrollment program for the first time in three years -- but for only four days.  The short time frame caused a near-panic as more than 300,000 callers jammed  phone lines to the agency, most of them never getting through.  </P> <P> Housing officials decided to offer a second chance this month to tens of  thousands of prospective applicants who were unable to apply the first time.  </P> <P> Section 8 is a federal subsidy program that helps poor families, the elderly  and the disabled. Applicants who qualify are required to pay only 30% of their  income in rent, with the rest paid by subsidy. That represents a huge savings  for most of the poor, who in Los Angeles generally pay more than 50% of their  income to rent.  </P> <P> Steve Renahan, Section 8 director, said, "We are aiming for maximum access."  For the next two weeks, phone calls will be accepted from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Monday through Friday "to give working people a chance," he said.  </P> <P> Applicants also can clip the application out of local newspapers and mail it to  the Housing Authority, he said. All mailed applications must be postmarked on  or before Feb. 16, Renahan said.  </P> <P> People who apply will be placed on a waiting list for consideration. The order  of people on the list will be chosen by random lottery, housing officials said.  </P> <P> Hot line numbers to call are: (213) 484-1051 and (818) 787-5136. The special  TTY teletypewriter number for the deaf is (213) 252-0103.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Serbs and Croats Agree on Cease-Fire </F> With Moscow Mediating"]    [Text] On the morning of 30 March, after grueling 18-hour  talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian Government  and representatives of the self-proclaimed "Republic of Serbian  Krajina" signed a cease-fire agreement.    Russian diplomacy celebrates a new success. Without Moscow's  mediation the truce between the Serbs and Croats would probably  not have happened. The efforts over many months of Vitaliy  Churkin, President Yeltsin's special representative, have  finally borne fruit. "The agreement signed today is the first  step toward settling the conflict and normalizing Serb-Croat  relations," Churkin told journalists on the talks' completion.    The truce comes into effect at 0900 hours on 5 April. By  this time mortars and antiaircraft guns must be withdrawn 10 km  from the demarcation line, and tanks and heavy artillery must be  withdrawn 20 km. Before 8 April all Serb and Croat formations  will have retreated 1 km into their own territory, giving up  advanced positions to UN "Blue Helmets" and EU [European Union]  observers.    By signing the cease-fire agreement the Serbs and Croats  have  closed the age on a bloody period in their history when they  were in a state of war for two and a half years. As a result of  the hostilities around 10,000 people died and one-fourth of  Croatian territory is occupied by Serbs and Yugoslav Army  subunits.    The cease-fire treaty will undoubtedly make further talks  between Zagreb and "Serbian Krajina" easier, although by all  accounts they will again require Russian mediation. The main  task is to define the status of Serb areas in Croatia. As of  today the sides' positions are diametrically opposed. The  Krajina authorities are demanding separation from Croatia, but  Zagreb is not even entertaining this notion, offering Serbs  broad autonomy but as part of a united state.    The Serbian leaders' separatist sentiments are supported by  few people in the world. The vast majority of UN members  recognized Croatia with its original borders. The United  States, EU, and Russia with certain reservations are inclined  toward the settlement option proposed by Zagreb. In this  situation much will depend on Belgrade: If Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic persuades his fellow countrymen in Croatia to  compromise and not to seek separation at any price the conflict  could be finally settled, and Yugoslavia will obtain additional  grounds for demanding the lifting of sanctions.    For their part the Croatian authorities, who are interested  as never before in solving the problem as quickly as possible,  could agree to certain concessions. The truce with the Serbs  will enable the country's economy to switch back to a peacetime  track, will ensure the return of hundreds of thousands of  refugees to their homes, and will decrease social tension.  Croatia, which before the war had the fourth-highest number of  foreign tourists in Europe, will get the chance to redevelop its  tourist business, which, according to expert estimates, could  bring the country up to $5 billion a year.</p>

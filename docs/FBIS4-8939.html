			<p>BFN     [Text] The Slovak Government today discussed the statement  of some heads of district offices and former government  plenipotentiaries in which they accuse the president of grossly  offending parliamentary democracy. After thoroughly reassessing  the overall situation in the state administration, in particular  in order to ensure the implementation of tasks arising from the  law on the reorganization of local administration, the  government decided to recall 26 heads of district offices.    In addition, the government recalled Dusan Kleiman from the  post of director general of the News Agency of the Slovak  Republic [TA SR] and appointed Ivan Melichercik as the new  director. At the same time, it agreed with the proposal to  solve the economic problems of Slovak Radio and approved the  request for radio broadcasts in line with the law on the state  budget. The government authorized the Ministry of Culture to  make this request specific so that the Ministry of Finance may  provide the financing for this request.</p>

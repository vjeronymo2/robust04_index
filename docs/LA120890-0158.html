			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DECORATING ADVICE / CARLETON VARNEY;  </P> <P> PASTELS PLAY UP AN AIRY ROOM  </P> <P> Question: I want a very modern look for my living room. The floor is white  ceramic tile, and the walls are white too. The ceiling has one large skylight  and two smaller ones. There are windows on three of the walls, so the room gets  lots of light. What do you think of black-leather upholstery and a lipstick-red  rug?  </P> <P> Dorothy Sanders  </P> <P> Answer: While I like black, red and white together, I feel it was a formula  overused in the modern settings. Why not play up the light, airy quality of  your room with lucid, pastel colors of aqua, lavender and white? Instead of  lipstick red, place a white-on-white textured rug on the floor. All of the  seating can be the palest shade of lavender accented by aqua Turkish corner  pillows. Seating should be armless and sleek.  </P> <P> Q: What is your advice for preparing for the holidays?  </P> <P> Betty Ditmar  </P> <P> A: With Christmas just around the corner, it's time to start cleaning the  silver and polishing the glasses. That harried season will be here before you  know it, so here's a simple checklist of things to do before the goose is  placed on that shimmering candle-lit table.  </P> <P> What is the state of your dining room walls? Do they need repainting? Can you  find a pretty new wallpaper that will make the walls and the season more jolly?  You might consider painting your walls a rich peach color and the ceiling a  soft cream beige. A wallpaper border of peach and green garlands entwined with  peach ribbon would be the crowning touch.  </P> <P> Do any of your carpets need to be cleaned or replaced? Now is the time to get  the job done. A bright, clean carpet will light up your whole room, especially  if it's a dashing color such as emerald green or fire-engine red. Other great  color picks are forest green, delphinium blue, scarlet red and daffodil yellow.  </P> <P> Now it's time to examine window treatments. To give your dining room a lift for  the holiday, install a frilly swag and jabot treatment in the windows. A pink  and apple-green flowered print on a royal-blue background would work  particularly well here. Lined in apple green, the curtains will look smashing  against walls of pink. Frame the windows with louver shutters; this classic  window treatment is always in style.  </P> <P> Let's get to the center of attention -- the dining table. Perhaps you'll need  new white organdy place mats and napkins to give your table new life. Or  perhaps you're counting on new glassware, such as pink stemware or aqua-blue  water glasses, to add that festive touch.  </P></p>

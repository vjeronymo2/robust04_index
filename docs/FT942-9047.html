			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Machinery order pick-up adds to recovery hopes A tentative sign of Japanese economic recovery emerged yesterday with a 10.3 per cent increase in machinery orders from February to April. The improvement suggests a three-year decline in capital investment by Japanese industry is coming to an end, the government's Economic Planning Agency said. Private sector machinery orders fell by 0.2 per cent in April, compared with the same month last year, a sharp slowdown on the 8.9 per cent annualised decline reported in March. This brings the growth in orders for the first quarter of this year to 6.6 per cent, from the final three months of 1993, well above government forecasts. The agency warns it expects a sharp 13 per cent fall in the current quarter, but this does not change its view that the worst, for machinery orders, is over. The same, however, cannot be said for corporate bankruptcies, which continue to rise, according to the latest monthly check by Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency. The number of corporate collapses with debts of more than Y10m (Pounds 64,000) rose by 1.9 per cent to 1,176 last month, from April 1993, the 15th month when they have stood at above 1,000. Separately, Japan's leading companies plan to reduce the number of new recruits next spring by 18.1 per cent, according to a survey of 723 employers by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic newspaper. That will the fourth consecutive annual decline.</p>

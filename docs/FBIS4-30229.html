			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  [MOF] plans to curb growth in budget requests for fiscal 1995,  with general operating expenditures for policy implementation  being cut by 10 percent from the previous year, ministry sources  said Thursday [23 June].    As the long-overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 was finally  approved by the Diet earlier in the day, the ministry started  work on setting the ceiling for next year's budget requests from  government ministries, agencies and related sectors.    The ceiling is likely to be announced sometime in July, the  sources said.    They said the ministry expects the government's fiscal  position to remain tight next fiscal year, starting April 1,  1995, as revenues from corporate taxes are likely to decline  amid the continued recession.    The balance of government bonds, expected to top 200  trillion  yen at the end of next March, will also keep the ministry  tight-fisted, they added.    They said the ministry plans to set a 10 percent cut in  general operating spending earmarked for policy objectives from  the budget ceiling for the current fiscal year.    It will be the 12th straight annual cut in the general  operating outlays minus expenses such as personnel expenses,  investment expenditures and spending for Official Development  Assistance (ODA).    In addition, the ministry plans to curb government subsidies  and review allocations of public-works investment to avoid  criticism that it has become inflexible in budget appropriations.    Aside from the budget ceiling, the ministry wants to  circulate a request in government ministries and agencies to cut  in principle office expenses by around 10 percent each, the  sources said.    In allocating public-works investment, the ministry will put  emphasis on construction projects for housing, sewage and public  parks. But spending on projects for industrial infrastructure  will be tightened, they added.    The ministry wants to curb growth in expenditure on  public-works investment itself, but has not decided on the  matter because of opinions that such spending should be  increased to stimulate the economy.    In fiscal 1994, the budgetary ceiling on public-works  investment was increased by 5 percent from the previous year.    The ministry, meanwhile, plans to set separate-account  spending on agricultural projects in fiscal 1995, as Japan  partially lifted a rice import ban in line with the agreement in  December 1993 of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the sources  said.</p>

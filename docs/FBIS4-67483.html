			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The world would face a  constant energy shortage and serious air pollution if China were  to continue its economic growth without improving its energy  efficiency, the Japanese trade ministry warned in a report  Friday [6 May].    The report said China is generating 2.5 to 24.5 times more  carbon compounds and 2.5 to 184 times more sulfur oxides than  Japan to produce the same amount of steel, electric power,  cement, paper and pulp.    The report was compiled by the International Trade and  Industry Inspection Institute at the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry and China's State Statistical Bureau, in  cooperation with Keio University in Tokyo.    It said Japan and other industrial nations should cooperate  with China to help control air pollution.    Carbon compounds are known to contribute to global warming  and sulfur oxides are believed to cause acid rain.    The report said China depends on coal for 80 percent of its  primary energy supplies but has no system for recycling energy.    To produce the same amount, steel mills in China used 3.0  times more energy than in Japan, power utilities 1.6 times more,  cement plants 1.8 times and pulp mills 1.3 times more in the  second half of the 1980s, the report said.    Few Chinese production facilities have desulfurization  equipment and China generates 70 percent of Asia's sulfur oxides  and 40 percent of its carbon compounds, it said.</p>

These reports state that two Libyan officers and a third  person left for Jordan following the failure of this attempt and  contacted the U.S. Embassy in Amman.    The two officers escaped across Libya's borders with a  neighboring country on their way to Amman where they were joined  by a civilian who was outside Libya when the detentions that  followed the failed attempt were carried out. Two of the  escapees belong to the al-Wa'ir clan, one of the most  influential clans in the Libyan Warfalah tribe.    Libya demanded that the two officers be handed over, but the  Jordanian authorities informed it that they were not in Amman.  Actually, they had been transferred to a U.S. base in Germany  where they were subjected to intense interrogation by U.S.  agencies before being allowed to contact their friends in the  Libyan opposition.    Libya, however, has denied any connection with the  assassination of the Jordanian diplomat and has described  reports linking it with the incident as an attempt to undermine  its relations with Jordan.</p>

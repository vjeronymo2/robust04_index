The display performed by the Pyongyang school youth and  children composed of the scenes "We Will Win Because You Are  Leading Us", "The Intimate Name", "We Are Happy in His Bosom",  "Let Us Uphold Our Party" and "Singlehearted Loyalty and Filial  Piety".

Prof. of Economics Takao Kamakura of Saitama University of  Japan who is also director of the board of the International  Institute of the Chuche Idea noted that the mass gymnastic  display is a masterpiece of worldwide significance and a work  representing the times.    "We saw in the bright faces and movements of the performers  the invariable faith and will of the Korean youths who are  determined to uphold and follow His Excellency Dear Kim Chong-il  to the end," he said.    National leader of the Communist Party of Canada (M-l)  Hardial Bains stressed such wonderful work as the mass gymnastic  display of Korea can be seen nowhere in the world.    "Seeing the performers joyfully displaying their talents I  could deeply feel that Korea's children are very happy in the  bosom of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and that their future is already  promised," he said.</p>

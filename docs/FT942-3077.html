			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Thames Water Yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Thames' shares cements its position as the worst performing water company since privatisation. The shares were priced on a yield discount to the sector in 1990 but now stand at a yield premium. The miserable performance of Thames' diversification strategy is partly to blame. Including yesterday's write-off, it has invested around Pounds 170m in businesses which will do well to cover their costs this year. As Thames acknowledged yesterday, the full year dividend would have been higher had it stuck to its knitting as a utility. The cost in terms of lost management time is more difficult to quantify but potentially just as damaging. Studies commissioned by Ofwat, the industry regulator, show Thames to be among the least efficient in the sector even though it charges customers less than its peers. While the company disagrees with Ofwat's conclusions - and demonstrated admirable control of operating costs last year - it may be too late to stop the regulator setting tough efficiency targets for the second half of the decade. Unless the non-utility side is by then showing marked improvement, Thames could find itself fighting a war on two fronts.</p>

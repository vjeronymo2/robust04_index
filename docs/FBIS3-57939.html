			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the run-up to the NATO summit  due to take place in Brussels next week, the Federal Government  has once again rejected calls by Central and East European  states for speedy NATO membership. Government spokesman Dieter  Vogel told reporters today in Bonn that the term "expansion" of  NATO is "at present clearly not quite the best choice." Bonn  supports the concept of a "partnership for peace," namely, close  cooperation with those states beyond the rules of the European  Cooperation Council [as received].    The modalities of this cooperation in the security field "up  to and including joint peace missions, joint training, and joint  exercises" will be discussed in Brussels. The Federal  Government is committed to "intensifying" cooperation with the  partners of the NATO Cooperation Council "in a further-reaching  partnership for peace." It is not yet possible to name specific  schedules, criteria, and candidates for this "process." Vogel  expressed understanding for the concern of the Warsaw leadership  that Poland cannot be admitted to NATO swiftly. However, the  situation is "less dramatic" than Polish President Lech Walesa  is stating.    At the NATO summit to be held in Brussels this Monday and  Tuesday [10-11 January], the Federal Government will be  represented by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic  Party) in addition to Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian  Democratic Union). Vogel is not yet able to say whether Kohl  will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton for talks at the margins  of the summit.</p>

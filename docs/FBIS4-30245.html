			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Kim Tae-hun, director of the </F> Moscow office of KIST's Korea-Russia Science and Technology  Cooperation Center: "Plans for Applying Russian Science and  Technology"]  <H5>  [20 Apr 94 p 16] </H5>   [Text] No small efforts are being made by ROK industry and  research organizations to obtain and make use of superior  Russian technology. Kim Tae-sun, director of the Moscow office  of the Korea-Russia Science and Technology Cooperation  Center---an annex of the Korea Institute of Science and  Technology (KIST), sent articles on plans for applying the  Russian science and technology he has seen and felt on the scene  since May 1992. We present this in two installments.    One of the fields with the greatest prospects for  cooperation  with Russia is the software industry. Until now, Russia had no  fixed laws on private property. With much investment made in  facilities under these conditions, scientific and technological  cooperation carries with it many risks of various kinds. One  area which is important to us and which minimizes facility  investment is the software industry. The shortage of computers  is serious even in many of Russia's superior research  organizations. Therefore, many research centers make use of PCs  (personal computers), even if that is all they have, to conduct  applied research. As a result, much software and many  applications were developed using PCs.    Another field with prospects for cooperation, even though  less know to us, is dedicated IC (integrated circuit) design and  manufacturing technology. Unilaterally, Russian IC design and  manufacturing technology does not appear to be that superior.  Manufacturing technology in particular is lacking: it can be  said to be considerably behind Japan and the U.S. in  mass-production technology. Therefore, compared to present ROK  memory-IC manufacturing technology, Russian technology can be  said to be markedly backward.    Thinking about dedicated-IC design and manufacture, even in  Russia's present situation, it is a suitable field for  technological-cooperation with ROK industry. In Russia there are  many organizations capable of designing and manufacturing  dedicated IC. The productive capacity of most of these  organizations, however, is considerably inferior. That is,  although the semiconductor industry is not at a high level, it  has many organizations capable of small-quantity-high-variety,  dedicated-IC design and manufacturing. The present circumstances  thus provide related ROK industries with conditions favorable  for cooperation.    As a cooperative sector favorable for dedicated-IC design  and  manufacturing, it could provide good partners for many ROK  enterprises handling the manufacture of electronics-related  instruments. In particular, companies making products (for  example, medical instruments, communications instruments, and  measuring instruments) other than memory chips and similar  mass-produced items could select Russian organizations as good  partners for the dedicated-IC design and manufacture of  electronic-circuit portions of related products.    Russia produces most of the medical instruments manufactured  by advanced foreign nations. To put it another way, it can be  said to possess technology capable of manufacturing all medical  instruments. Even MRI equipment (nuclear magnetic resonance  spectrometer) is being produced and distributed. Visiting many  medical institutions in Russia, however, one can sense the  inferior medical instruments, the deterioration and lack of  facilities of most of them. This reality is the result of  Russia's overall economic difficulties.    It is also a result of the funding shortages experienced by  medical institutions because the medical system is in a  transition period, moving from free medical treatment under  socialism to medical treatment for which a fee is charged.  Russia's medical-instruments industry is also linked with the  program being conducted by the government of privatizing  military industries.    It is a well-known fact that Russia's aviation- and  space-related technology is advanced. It can be called world  class in all areas, from the design of aircraft and spacecraft  to the design and manufacture of mechanical and electronic spare  parts and new materials technology. However, because  aviation-and space-related industries are run by a policy of  large-scale investment at the national level, cooperation in  this field generally can be achieved by state support or large  enterprises. However, there are also fields among related  spare-parts industries in which cooperation can be achieved by  small and medium-sized business.    Laser-related technology too is closely associated with  Russia's advanced military industry. With the program of  conversion to civilian industry, many laser-related technologies  are being applied in laser-using industrial instruments, medical  instruments, laboratory instruments, etc. A phenomenon common to  all products made in Russia, technology for the production of  fresh commercial products is lacking. Although products are made  using superior technology, in various ways they can be said to  be inferior compared to the products of advanced foreign  nations. Therefore, if this is supplemented by ROK technology,  it has the potential for commercial success on the world market.    Through cooperation with Russia, the  communications-instruments and spare-parts sectors have  potential for making inroads into the world market, and also for  making products for sale in Russia. In May 1993, 26 prominent,  communications-industry companies entered Russia in the form of  a joint venture. Russia is producing TDX (time division  exchanges) and other telephone-switching instruments, but its  performance is very backward compared to our ROK technology.  Therefore, cooperation is possible on the sale or on-site  production of ROK products. In the case of cellular-phone,  satellite-communications, and optical-communications technology,  however, Russia is advanced, making possible varied cooperation  in ROK mobile-communications-related industrial sectors.    Other technical fields with prospects for cooperation are  the  processing-related sectors using nonferrous metals such as  aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel, sectors dealing with the  development and application of new materials, and the  machine-instrument sector. More detailed, useful information on  each sector can be obtained using the relevant reference  libraries of the Korea-Russia Science and Technological  Cooperation Center.  <H5>  [21 Apr 94 p 16] </H5>   [Text] During the last three years, there has been an  exchange between many ROK institutions (research centers,  business, universities, etc.) and Russian institutions. They  have used various methods of contact and exchange for absorbing  Russian technology and applying it to the development of  commercial products. Although some businesses have gained a  measure of success as a result, most obtained no great results,  failing in many cases.    As a result of touring various Russian research institutions  and business up to now, the author believes that it would be  more useful for ROK small and medium-sized businesses to adopt  Russian technology through a cooperative relationship. The  reason for this is that, although Russia's technological level  is high, it has insufficient linkage of this with  mass-production technology, so small-quantity-high-variety  production by small and medium-sized business would be  profitable.    Characteristic of Russian technology is a lack of  systematization of mass-production technology and concepts of  production costs. Therefore, if Russian technology is to be  introduced and applied from product design to production, there  is a high probability of running up against various difficulties  and of failure. Judging Russian technology based on finished  product alone is not a complete method either. Of course, it is  true that if a product's performance is superior, the technology  which made that product is superior. However, there are many  cases in which a products technological level is superior, even  though its performance is not. In this case, there are many  instances in which superior-performance products were simply not  made, rather than being impossible to make due to the  characteristics of Russian society and the Russian economy.    Technological cooperation with Russia must start with these  particular circumstances in mind. Most Russian technology is not  directly linked to production. It is technology with no concept  of production-cost reduction.    To a certain degree, ROK businesses have their own design  and  production technology. However, rather than cooperating in all  technology from design to production, ROK businesses should form  cooperative relationships with Russia after clearly selecting  technology we need for specific fields in which it is lacking.  Cooperative relationships can take various forms: getting  technical training by inviting superior engineers in relevant  fields; purchasing desired technology; development based on  joint research (paying Russian research institutions a research  fee, commissioning technical development); and developing  technology by setting up joint-venture research centers in  Russia.    Inviting technicians could be an effective method, depending  on the kind of technology we need. However, because there are  limitations on the number of technicians who can be invited and  on the length of their stay in Korea, this would not be  efficient in many cases.    Up to now there has been much technological cooperation  between many ROK and relevant Russian institutions in the form  of joint research.    Given Russia's present situation, however, this is one of  several considerably inefficient methods.    Joint-ventures, in the present circumstances, are considered  to enable decreased investment risk while allowing ROK  businesses to adopt Russian science and technology. Not costing  that much and an achievement of the research and development  functions urgently desired by ROK business, the establishment of  joint-venture research centers can be said to be ideal.    In special Russian circumstances, the establishment of  joint-venture research centers can be said to be very effective  for the following reasons.    First, performing research and development through joint  investment by both sides, it is possible to carry out all  processes through product development together with Russian  technicians.    Also, if a contract is concluded so that relevant Russian  institutions provide public facilities and laboratory equipment,  investment risk will be reduced by minimizing research center  set-up costs.    Besides this, use can be made of an excellent research  workforce for wages lower than those of researchers at ROK  research centers.    This technological development through the establishment of  joint-venture research centers in Russia is efficient from  various viewpoints. However, ROK companies can be said to have a  greater probability of succeeding in research and development if  they take the following into consideration.    First of all, having, to a certain degree, its own domestic  research workforce, ROK business must lead research operations  on site in Russia and must be able to domestically absorb the  technology developed. ROK business must be able to handle on its  own the commercialization process resulting from the mass  production of this technology.    Also, with the concept of carrying out research and  development, it must begin a cooperative relationship by using  approximately 10-20 percent of funding used in the domestic  research centers of ROK companies for research centers in Russia.    However, for genuine success in scientific and technological  cooperation, it must start in the concept of mutual ROK-Russian  interests.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 17 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Japan Ido Tsushin [Mobile Communications] Company  (Ido) is perplexed by new demands by the U.S. Government and  Motorola Company. The company had planned to expand the use of  Motorola systems by investing 30 billion yen over the next two  to three years, and Motorola was informed of this plan. Ido's  plan was supposed to have been used as a "trump card" in  negotiations [with the United States].    But the United States has come up with new demands,  including  increasing the number of base stations. As far as Ido is  concerned, this means even this most difficult, final choice has  been simply ignored, and Tsukada, president of the company, is  infuriarated, saying: "Motorola is entering and exiting the  arena of government-to-government negotiations as it pleases.  This is something Japanese manufacturers cannot even  contemplate."    The United States has complained from the beginning that the  service area for Motorola systems is small compared with that  for NTT [Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone] systems. While NTT  systems cover 94 percent of the population in their service  area, Motorola systems cover only about 60 percent. [sentence as  published] What the United States insists is that "as long as  the area where cellular phones can be used remains small, the  use of the phones will be slow to grow."    But Ido had thought that if its plan was implemented, the  coverage rates of the NTT systems and Motorola systems would be  about equal, and the United States "would not be able to  complain."</p>

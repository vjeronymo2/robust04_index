			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Belgians lose faith in their coalition ONLY 19 per cent of Belgians have confidence in the government, compared with 35 per cent in June, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuters reports from Brussels. Publication of the poll coincided with last-ditch talks yesterday by Belgium's shaky centre-left coalition government to avert a crisis over the 1993 budget and national reforms which could force new elections. After a weekend of talks failed to produce an agreement, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, is staking the government's survival on getting a deal this week to rein in heavy public spending and on reforms giving more autonomy to French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders. The main party in the coalition, Mr Dehaene's Flemish Christian Democrats (CVP), says the budget and state reforms have to be sorted out before its annual congress next weekend. If there is no deal by then, political analysts say the CVP's position in the coalition would be threatened.</p>

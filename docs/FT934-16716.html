			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Observer: In for a penny Far from constituting its own reward, virtue can leave you distinctly out of pocket these days, as Colin Forsyth discovered last month. Forsyth, a founder director of the insolvent insurance group London United Investments, had tried everything he could think of to chivvy the Department of Trade and Industry into finishing its investigation into LUI. Almost three years since the inspectors began their work, Forsyth got wind towards the end of September that the investigation had finally been completed. As one of the only two remaining directors, he awaited his pre-release copy for comments and suggestions with not a little interest. But nothing materialised. So he phoned the DTI yet again, to be informed that, had he been reprimanded or severely criticised in the report, he would naturally have received an early copy, gratis, so that he could make a rebuttal, or if necessary, prepare a defence in law. Since he did not fall into this category, the DTI added brightly, he would have to pay the full price, Pounds 36 a copy.</p>

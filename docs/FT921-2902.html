			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / TV lists fee set below target of broadcasters THE UK newspaper and magazine industry yesterday emerged as the winner of the year-long legal contest with the BBC and ITV over the cost of printing programme schedules for television and radio. The Copyright Tribunal yesterday set a scale of charges for printing the listings which fell well short of those demanded by broadcasters. Under the settlement BBC Enterprises and Independent Television Publishers will receive a maximum of Pounds 800,000 a year each for allowing their listings to be printed in the national and regional press. The BBC estimated it would have received about Pounds 4m a year if the tribunal had ruled in favour of its proposed rates. The ITP would have received about the same. The Newspaper Society produced a figure of Pounds 14.5m for the possible costs of the broadcasters' original rates to the newspaper and magazine industry. The tribunal ruling will be backdated to last year and increased by 4 per cent for this year and rise in line with inflation. The tribunal ruled that any publications wanting to use the listings must pay Pounds 200 for 1991 and Pounds 208 for 1992. A further charge of 0.003 pence per copy must then be met for daily listings. The BBC said: 'We are disappointed at the decision. We feel it fails to recognise the value of the BBC programme schedules. It appears that newspapers and magazines feel they have a considerable value otherwise they would not rush to produce so many supplements.' The BBC and ITP have 28 days to lodge an appeal, but a BBC spokesman said no decision had been taken yet. ITP made no comment on the ruling yesterday. The Newspaper Society welcomed the ruling. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, its director, said: 'We are delighted at this outcome. Regional and local newspapers have published daily TV listings without charge by either side for 30 years.'</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (29): A pleasant place to do business - Best cuisine in Latin America LIMA does not have a pretty reputation. A bloated population, mushrooming slums, terrorism and economic chaos have seen to that. One Peruvian commentator, writing in the mid-1980s, complained bitterly of attacks, kidnappings, rapes and murders, characteristics which, he said, had 'coincided with increasingly aggressive driving habits.' Wayward driving is still all-too obvious, but Lima itself is in many ways one of Latin America's more pleasant capitals. The phone system works, violence has abated, bureaucracy is minimal and Peruvian cuisine is often excellent. A 1960s description of Lima as an open, airy place may strike some as a little ironic of a city often enveloped in mist and pollution. Nonetheless, Lima can be an enjoyable place in which to do business. Airport: Customs formalities are fairly straightforward. No visas are required for citizens of western Europe, the US, Canada, Japan or most Latin American countries. There are no restrictions on bringing in or taking out currency. If you are staying for more than two weeks, you may be required to pay a tax (refundable on leaving the country) on electronic items. There is a Dollars 17.50 airport tax payable on international flights. A taxi from the airport can cost anything from Dollars 10-Dollars 30. Haggle. Hotels: Most business people stay in Miraflores, a coastal suburb about a 20-minute drive from downtown Lima. Now the capital's main social centre, Miraflores is spilling over with restaurants, shops and hotels. Hotels include El Condado (Alcanfores 465, tel: 443 614); Miraflores Cesar (La Paz y Diez Canseco, tel: 441 212) and Las Americas (Av. Benavides 415, tel: 459 494). All three have air conditioning, satellite TV, fax service, bars and restaurants. For longer visits you might consider one of Miraflores' many short-stay apartment blocks. The downtown Lima area has many beautiful old hotels, among them the Grand Bolivar (Union 958, tel: 276 400). Even if you do not stay here, it can be a wonderful place to have a pisco sour (Peru's national drink) on the terrace. There is also the Sheraton (Paseo de la Republica, tel: 333 320). In the off-season it is usually possible to negotiate substantial discounts. All hotels add on taxes of up to 30 per cent. Personal security: Sendero bombings are much less frequent since the capture of Abimael Guzman, although an attack on the US embassy in July demonstrates that the terrorist threat is not yet a thing of the past. President Fujimori is fond of saying that Lima is no more dangerous than Florence, London or New York - a claim somewhat negated by the number of heavily armed guards stationed outside most office buildings. Many offices require you to leave some form of picture identification at reception before entering. It is probably best to carry a driving licence or a photocopy of your passport. (One FT employee found his London Underground travel pass perfectly adequate.) As in any big city, walking around aimlessly at night is probably not a good idea. Robbery is not uncommon (robbery with violence is). But there is no need for the paranoia exhibited by some visitors. Miraflores and San Isidro are generally safe. Transport: Most large hotels have official cabs stationed outside which can be hired per trip or for the day. Hotel cars have the advantage of being a little more comfortable, safer (most have seat belts) and the driver is likely to know where he is going. But do not rule out flagging down some of the dilapidated Volkswagens which ply Lima's streets. It is useful to know the name of a landmark near to your final destination, as taxi drivers (often off-duty military or out-of-work salesmen) sometimes do not know their way around too well. Fix a price before you get in. Internal flights to the main cities are frequent, if not regular. Early morning flights tend to leave on time, but as the day wears on the timetable can slip. Leave plenty of time for connecting flights. Faucett (336 364), AeroPeru (478 333), Americana (478 662), Expresso Aereo (452 545) and AeroCondor (425 663) all run services to main provincial towns. Telephones: Peru's telephone service is probably pitched somewhere between that of Mexico and Chile. It is usually fairly easy to dial direct but line quality is sometimes poor, especially for sending data. International calls can also be made through the operator on 108. Restaurants: Peruvians boast that their cuisine is the best in Latin America, a sentiment echoed by many visitors. Hotel food is often expensive and internationalised and it is usually better to eat out. Seafood is often excellent and highly spiced. Ceviche is a cold dish of seafood, onion and hot green pepper. There is also chupe de camorones, a shrimp stew, as well as potato dishes such as causa and carapulcra. Olives are big and succulent. Coffee can also be very good - for a strong espresso coffee with milk as drunk in Europe or the US, ask for a cortado. You should also try Inca Kola at least once: a bubble-gum flavoured soft drink which is Peru's answer to its more famous international counterparts. Recommended restaurants in Miraflores include: La Trattoria for home-made pasta and imaginative salads (Manuel Bonilla 106, tel: 467 002); Rosa Nautica, built on a pier, opulent (Espigon no 4, Lima bay, tel: 470 057); Costa Verde, also with wonderful views of Pacific and good seafood (tel: 772 424); Las Tejas, a moderately priced Peruvian restaurant with good fish and chicken dishes (Diez Canseco 340, tel: 444 360). Luigi's (Benavides) is excellent for breakfast while Haiti (Diagonal) is a good place for coffee and a snack. Health: It is probably advisable to drink bottled water, although it is perfectly safe to brush your teeth with tap water. As in most developing countries, be wary of eating salads. Drinks are probably better sin hielo (without ice). Ask instead for your drink bien helada (refrigerated). Some Peruvian food is highly spiced. While most of it is perfectly safe to eat you may find your stomach reacting a little to the change of cuisine. The cholera epidemic, prevalent in 1991, has largely passed and is not likely to affect you. Weekend trips: Paracas is a coastal resort about two hours' drive from Lima. Not only does it often have sun in winter, when Lima is soaking in damp mist, but also it has a seal colony and a marine reserve. The Hotel Paracas is comfortable and has excellent food (reservations in Lima, 465 079). An hour or so beyond Paracas is the superb hotel Las Dunas, at Ica, another favourite weekend retreat for capital-dwellers, especially in winter. Enjoy sun or sand-surfing, or visit some of the local vineyards. Pisco, Peru's famous grape brandy, is made near here. You can also take a small aircraft and overfly the amazing Nazca lines. (Las Dunas - reservations in Lima, 424 180). Also available for the sports-minded is white-water rafting. Closest to Lima is in the pretty Canete valley, about two hours away. Ask a tour agency (like Lima Tours, tel: 276 624) to make reservations.</p>

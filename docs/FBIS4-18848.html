			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro </F> by unattributed correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [EXPRESSO] Information is power. Will the new  rules of openness not cause the Commission to lose power?    [Deus Pinheiro] No. What openness will do is to put an end  to the false or illegitimate power held by those who, possessing  information which they are not entitled to, use it in order to  wield improper power. This is often the case with  bureaucracies. Openness will help people understand better the  significance of the Commission's decisions and avert  arbitrariness.    [EXPRESSO] Do you believe that the Portuguese Government  should follow the same rules?    [Deus Pinheiro] I can see no objective reason why it should  not do so. It is a widespread trend. Even France, where the  Napoleonic traditions and codes were strongest, has been  increasing the openness of its administration.    [EXPRESSO] With a complex decisionmaking process, the EU  [European Union] has a limited ability to respond, because it is  very protracted. Is this not a shortcoming?    [Deus Pinheiro] It is an extremely grave shortcoming. For  instance, as regards the trade defense machinery, it could have  disastrous consequences and make it virtually ineffective.  While in the United States, that kind of machinery for  retaliation in international trade can be set in motion in  weeks, in the EU it takes 18 months. It is a concern of ours --  and mine in particular -- to reduce the too extensive  bureaucratic circulation of some documents.    [EXPRESSO] The Commission will never be effective with so  slow a response.    [Deus Pinheiro] Of course there is machinery which must be  safeguarded. The democratic nature of the process must not be  diminished in favor of efficiency, but this matter has never  been considered in a more pragmatic way. For instance,  documents continue to be transmitted mostly by the traditional  methods, when today electronic mail is a reality. Only now is  the Commission -- under pressure from me -- moving ahead with  its computer automation to a more advanced stage.    [EXPRESSO] The Commission is criticized for holding great  power without being elected....    [Deus Pinheiro] That power is not as great as people  believe. Of course it has one considerable power -- that of  initiative. The form of a decision is determined at the outset,  but it must necessarily be approved by the Council, in many  cases also by the European Parliament and in others by the  national parliaments as well. There is another power -- that of  implementation. But the Commission is overseen by the European  Parliament, and increasingly by the Council -- and, in some  cases, by the national parliaments.    [EXPRESSO] Would it not make sense to increase the European  Parliament's powers?    [Deus Pinheiro] They have been increasing. What should have  been increased is the national parliaments' powers. We can only  be close to citizens if the national institutions take part more  actively.    [EXPRESSO] Does that not not impair the ability to respond  even more?    [Deus Pinheiro] The lack of ability to respond which I  mentioned is more in the implementation than in the  decisionmaking, which must necessarily be slow. We are in a  novel organizational situation. Democratic procedure at this  stage must be the top priority. Citizens are now afraid of the  Community, following the debates on Maastricht. Without  attention to this, we will have a set of Europeans opposed to  the EU -- not because of its policies but because of its  practices.    [EXPRESSO] With the EU's enlargement, are we moving toward  an "a la carte" Europe?    [Deus Pinheiro] This can only be answered speculatively. As  the EU expands, the tendency is for it to be less solid. What  some people argue is that a hard core of those who accept all  the deepenings could emerge within a Community enlarged to over  20 countries. Countries such as Portugal -- on the periphery  and with a certain economic backwardness but with a good  political tradition, a history, and a heritage in Europe and the  world -- should be very mindful of this fact in order not to  find themselves suddenly in a situation of inferiority.    [EXPRESSO] What does being mindful mean?    [Deus Pinheiro] Carefully following all tendencies in the  direction of deepening and considering whether they suit us; for  instance, matters such as the European defense pillar, which is  taking shape with NATO's approval and the blessing of the United  States. We must ponder the costs, explain them to our  population, debate them in our parliament, and make a decision  -- preferably sooner rather than later.    [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that Portuguese troops could go and  fight for the Balkans, for instance?    [Deus Pinheiro] Common defense is one thing; it is another  when that defense includes the possibility of attacking third  parties. Here all countries must reserve for themselves the  right to decide on a case-by-case basis.    [EXPRESSO] The Portuguese population feel that their living  standard remains very far from the European average.    [Deus Pinheiro] The money which comes from the EC makes it  possible to create infrastructures, but that is not a sufficient  condition in itself. That depends on boosting the economy and  creating an entrepreneurial spirit -- a sphere in which the EC,  while being able to provide a frame of reference, no longer  interferes in the governments' policies.    [EXPRESSO] There is bewilderment in Portugal because  traditional sectors such as agriculture are casualties of  joining the EU. People are wondering what fate Brussels has in  store for Portugal.    [Deus Pinheiro] Community policy aims are no longer the  same. There was the matter of surpluses, that of prices, the  reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and, last, GATT. What  was true in 1983 is untrue in 1994. Since Portugal was already  trying to adjust to one framework and now must adjust to  another, this confuses people and hampers governments' activity  enormously. The situation is relatively stabilized. I know that  the government is concerned about this, but I do not know what  policies it is proposing for adjusting to the new environment.    [EXPRESSO] This proves that there is uncertainty about the  country's future.    [Deus Pinheiro] Uncertainty, no. Portugal has unique  conditions for success. What we must not believe is that we  will succeed through the EU's assistance or through government  resolve. Those bodies may be important, but it will be through  the Portuguese people's work, our employers' resolve and  boldness, and through our finally realizing that our thinking  must not be provincial. In Portugal, the periphery and  provincialism must be eradicated from people's minds and  parochialism from debate.    [EXPRESSO] When do you advocate the East European countries'  entry?    [Deus Pinheiro] Very rapidly. The instability in East  Europe is persisting, and the only anchor of stability is the  EU. If you ask me whether the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,  and Poland are fit to join, I do not believe so, but perhaps  they could now join pillars two and three. It would be a way to  help them join, even if the economic stage had to be left until  later.    [EXPRESSO] Will that not weaken Portugal's position in the  EU?    [Deus Pinheiro] We must not only consider the narrow context  of East Europe but also look at other areas, such as the south.  The gulf in development, capitation [as published], and living  conditions existing between the southern shore of the  Mediterranean and Europe is such as to create an increasing  source of tension with not only a political and economic basis  but also a cultural basis, which could be extremely difficult to  resolve. In that event, Portugal could find itself in the front  line, and then it will need support -- the more supportive  countries the better.    [EXPRESSO] In your opinion, is the audiovisual sector  primarily industry or culture?    [Deus Pinheiro] Both. Until a year ago, it was  essentially culture, but as I have delved into the issue, I have  realized that the audiovisual sector is totally different what  it was 10 years ago. It has become one of the industries with  the greatest economic importance and development potential.    [EXPRESSO] So are you handling the issue from an economic  viewpoint?    [Deus Pinheiro] No, always from a cultural viewpoint. This  was clear in the GATT discussions. All the countries wish to  safeguard the use of that powerful medium, based primarily on  their language, but also on their culture, tradition, and  heritage.    [EXPRESSO] But how are they to respond to U.S. competition  with so great a diversity of cultures and with necessarily small  markets?    [Deus Pinheiro] It is a great challenge for the Europeans:  In cultural terms, to safeguard these values, and, in industrial  terms, to seize an opportunity, with the changes forecast in the  near future -- this, together with the creation of an  information-based society in Europe, the so-called information  superhighways, which are not unconnected with the audiovisual  sector.    [EXPRESSO] But there will have to be state support....    [Deus Pinheiro] Yes. A whole world which existed in Europe,  linked to production and financing, has been depleted.  Recreating that atmosphere will take time.    [EXPRESSO] Will Europe have a kind of Hollywood?    [Deus Pinheiro] Europe should necessarily have several  Hollywoods.    [EXPRESSO] Your portfolio does not seem to have  characteristics as political as you wished and even announced.    [Deus Pinheiro] It does, indisputably, in political  analysis, in relations with the European Parliament, and even in  information and communication. Even the audiovisual sector has  political aspects, which only a commissioner can handle.    [EXPRESSO] So are you not disappointed with the portfolio?    [Deus Pinheiro] By no means. In the most visible aspects --  information and the audiovisual sector -- we leave work  accomplished. As far as administering those guidelines is  concerned, I no longer know whether I would have the patience do  so for five years.    [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that when there is a redistribution  of portfolios, you are not interested in keeping the same post?    [Deus Pinheiro] No. The major changes have been made or  will be made by the end of my term. After that, I feel no  vocation for day-to-day administration.    [EXPRESSO] So do you intend to stay on as commissioner  beyond this year?    [Deus Pinheiro] I have not yet decided. I will only examine  this matter with the prime minister in the summer.    [EXPRESSO] Would you like to stay on?    [Deus Pinheiro] This job has fascinating aspects and unique  moments. It has others when the struggle against bureaucracy,  routine, and certain established practices make you wonder  whether the despair at not seeing things progress is worthwhile.    [EXPRESSO] So you have moments of dejection?    [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly, especially when I feel that the  reasons why things are not progressing more quickly have nothing  to do with their substance but rather with the system's  inefficiencies, with petty personal envy, with established petty  fiefdoms.    [EXPRESSO] If you stay on, what would you like to do?    [Deus Pinheiro] There are four or five portfolios which  could be interesting, but I have not considered this matter,  either.    [EXPRESSO] What are those portfolios?    [Deus Pinheiro] I will not enter into speculation, but it  must be borne in mind that there will be more commissioners, and  hence a reorganization of the portfolios.    [EXPRESSO] There seem to be many federalists in the European  structures who, for political reasons, do not acknowledge  themselves as such. Is that the case with you?    [Deus Pinheiro] I have never acknowledged myself and do not  acknowledge myself as a federalist. I do not at all see the  possibility -- and decreasingly so -- of the European states  merging in any way into a single political entity.    [EXPRESSO] But is not federalism the only way for Europe to  survive?    [Deus Pinheiro] No. There will be policies on which we  must have a single voice. I have never minded this. In these  matters our yardstick must be: Is what is wanted good or bad  for Portugal? If it is good, it should be supported; if it is  bad, it should be rejected, irrespective of the label placed on  it.    [EXPRESSO] So do you not believe in a United States of  Europe?    [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly not. Not even in my  grandchildren's time.    [EXPRESSO] How do you view the Portuguese parties' line in  the elections to the European parliament, in which there is a  clear retreat from the European ideals?    [Deus Pinheiro] Unfortunately, I have heard a great deal of  nonsense, even from politicians with senior posts in the  parties. What must be considered, much more than potential  concepts, dangers, or ideas which may exist, is the reality and  knowing what the priorities are in Portugal. If they are our  advancement in the world, our economic growth, trying to reach  the Community average, the policies followed by the EU today are  good for Portugal.    [EXPRESSO] What about your own party's line of returning to  the traditional values of fatherland and family?    [Deus Pinheiro] Fatherland and family are essential concepts  in our society, but they must be used not in a backward-looking  perspective of nostalgia but one of progress. Otherwise, they  will have a markedly conservative, not dynamic, content.    [EXPRESSO] Whom does Portugal back as Delors' successor?    [Deus Pinheiro] I have only exchanged views superficially  and informally with the prime minister. It is not yet clear who  the candidates are.</p>

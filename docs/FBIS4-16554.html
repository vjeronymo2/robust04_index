			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Security Council and NATO will make decisions  on further actions in Bosnia on the basis of the results of  talks with the Serbian side, including today's meeting in Pale  between UN Envoy Yasushi Akashi, Russian diplomat Vitaliy  Churkin, and Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic. ITAR-TASS  has learned this from a spokesman for the NATO headquarters in  Brussels. In his words, if UN observers ask for military  support before any new political decisions are made, then NATO  aircraft will launch a necessary air strike without delays.  NATO will do this in compliance with last year's Security  Council resolution, for which Russia voted too, the NATO  spokesman stressed.</p>

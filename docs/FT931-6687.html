			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Motoring: Get a grip on wheelspin AN INCH of snow, or a muddy car park, can bring any car to a wheel-spinning standstill. A four-wheel drive is the conventional, expensive answer. A low-cost alternative is a pair of plastic Autotrax ramps, heavily toothed on both sides to grip both ground and tyre. Slip their thin ends under the drive wheels, accelerate gently and they will give enough traction to get a car going. Do not forget to go back for them - they cost about Pounds 30 a pair and will be in the shops soon. Call 0285-885-201 for details. Nothing is more difficult to fit into a car than a bicycle. For those daunted by the thought of lifting cycles on to roof-racks, Paddy Hopkirk has a universal rear cycle carrier holding up to three bikes. It can be fitted without tools (and without marking the paint) to almost any car, but must be used with a number plate or trailer board if the driver is to stay within the law. About Pounds 50 from motoring shops or call 0525-850-800.</p>

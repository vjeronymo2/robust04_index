Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, located in Berrien County, Michigan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would grant a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of Appendix J, paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50 and approve an extension of the 2-year period between the performance of Type B and C leak rate test by 150 days. Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, paragraph III.D.2.(a), states, in part, ``Type B tests, except tests for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Paragraph III.D.3., states, ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Taken together, these sections require Type B and C containment leakage tests to be performed at an interval not to exceed 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated March 9, 1994, as supplemental April 13, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption to 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, to allow the time between the performance of the required Type B and C tests to exceed the 2-year maximum by up to 150 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption is needed because compliance with paragraphs III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, would result in a unit shutdown and additional personnel radiation exposure in order to comply with the required Type B and C test frequency. The licensee last conducted the required Type B and C leak rate tests during a refueling outage in the spring of 1992. These previous leak rate tests will reach the 2-year maximum test interval imposed by Appendix J starting on May 29, 1994. The licensee's next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in August 1994. The extended interval between refueling outages is a result of an equipment problem and scheduling to avoid coincident refueling outages on both units. The exemption is requested to support the current outage schedule and to avoid the potential for an earlier reactor shutdown. If a forced outage is imposed to perform testing it would present undue hardship and cost in the form of increased radiological exposure. Furthermore, if a forced outage is imposed to perform the required testing, an additional plant shutdown and startup will be required. This action is similar to that approved for several other facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action includes exemptions from performing Type B and C tests for a maximum period of 150 days beyond the required Appendix J test intervals. As stated in 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, the purpose of the primary containment leak rate testing requirements is to ensure that leakage rates are maintained within the Technical Specification requirements and to assure that proper maintenance and repair is performed throughout the service life of the containment boundary components. The requested exemption is consistent with the intent of 10 CFR 50.12(a), in that it represents a one-time only schedular extension of short duration. The required leak tests will still be performed to assess compliance with Technical Specification requirements, albeit later, and to asure that any required maintenance or repair is performed. As noted in paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J, it was intended that the testing be performed during refueling outages or other convenient intervals. Extending the Appendix J intervals by a small amount to reach the next refueling outage will not significantly impact the integrity of the containment boundary and, therefore, will not significantly impact the consequences of an accident or transient in the unlikely event of such an occurance during the 150-day extended period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Past Unit 2 local leak rate test data have demonstrated improving leak rate test results. Although the As Found results for the 1989 and 1990 outages were 3.0 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 0.74 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , respectively, which exceeded the maximum limit of 0.6 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the 1992 As Found was 0.18 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The improved 1992 As Found result, which was a minor increase from the 1990 As Left of 0.17 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , followed several corrective actions by the licensee. The improving trend for the Type B and C testing, well below the allowable limit, provides reasonable assurance that the probability of exceeding the offsite dose rates established in 10 part 100 will not be increased by extending the current Type B and C testing for a maximum of 150 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

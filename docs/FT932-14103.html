			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Eurotunnel hits at TML over threats of delay BRITISH and French con-struction companies were yesterday accused of blackmail in threatening to delay the opening of the Channel tunnel in support of longstanding claims for extra payments. Eurotunnel, which will operate the tunnel, said delays in opening meant that it could have to raise up to a further Pounds 850m by the end of 1995. The company said the delays meant that the forecast cost until opening had risen by Pounds 300m since last autumn to Pounds 8.4bn. This compared with an original 1987 forecast of Pounds 4.8bn for the project. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, said he could not predict when the tunnel would open. This depended on the contractors' willingness to co-operate in testing and commissioning the tunnel railway, which was already largely built. The opening date has been postponed several times from the original target date of May 15 this year. Sir Alastair said: 'Only a few a weeks ago contractors accepted in negotiations that it would be possible to start running services for heavy goods vehicles from mid-January.' According to Mr Frank Cain, Eurotunnel executive responsible for construction of the project: 'Contractors now say that all services will start at the same time next June.' Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of British construction group Wimpey and joint chairman of Transmanche Link, the consortium building the project, dismissed allegations of blackmail as 'astounding nonsense'. 'Sir Alastair is well aware of the principal causes of delay, notably the many and major changes to safety and performance specifications throughout the tunnel's construction.' Delivery of railway carriages to carry cars under the Channel is halted over a claim for extra time and payments which TML says has been caused by design changes. Eurotunnel says that bridging finance will be needed to compensate for the loss of revenue caused by a delayed opening. This might be raised partly from shareholders and partly from banks. The amount of money to be provided by banks, however, is likely to be very limited. Eurotunnel planned to issue free warrants later this year which would allow its 630,000 shareholders to buy more shares in the company at an agreed price. The aim would be to generate about Pounds 200m when the warrants were exercised next year. A further Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m would need to be raised by the end of 1995. This would leave an estimated Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m to be found before the company expected to generate enough from services to cover operating costs and interest charges. This point was not expected to be reached until 1997. The final Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m could form part of a larger rights issue as Eurotunnel sought to refinance its large bank borrowings once the tunnel has opened. It is the first time Eurotunnel has indicated how much extra cash it may need to raise once the tunnel opens. The money would be in addition to the Pounds 7.3bn already raised from banks and Pounds 1.6bn from shareholders. Sir Alastair said the Channel tunnel group would not succumb to pressure from contractors, which had even more to lose from delaying the opening than Eurotunnel itself. Failing an agreement, the contractors would have to start funding construction work themselves until their claims could be settled, which could take years. Contractors will have to start paying damages after August 15 for late delivery. This could total about Pounds 200m by next June. TML is seeking an extension to the contract to prevent Eurotunnel applying for damages. Sir Alastair confirmed yesterday he was prepared to sue the UK and French governments and BR and SNCF for failing to satisfy terms of railway contracts or the concession under which Eurotunnel will operate the tunnel.

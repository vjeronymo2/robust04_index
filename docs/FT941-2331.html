			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Ex-judge to testify in Whitewater probe A former Arkansas municipal judge, who has alleged a link between President Bill Clinton and a questionable loan in the Whitewater affair, will today enter a plea bargain with Mr Robert Fiske, the prosecutor investigating the affair. Mr David Hale was to go to trial on March 28 on four felony charges unrelated to Whitewater. However, as part of his plea bargain over these charges he has agreed to testify on Mr Clinton's alleged role in Whitewater. Whitewater was the name of an Arkansas holiday development in which Mr and Mrs Clinton invested with their friends, Mr James McDougal, head of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution, and his wife Susan. Questions have been raised about the Clintons' investment and whether Mr McDougal illegally funnelled depositors' money into Whitewater and to retire a Clinton campaign debt. Mr Hale had offered last September to testify that Mr Clinton eight years ago pressured him to make a Dollars 300,000 loan to Mrs McDougal. Mr Hale then owned a company which made loans backed by the Small Business Administration. The loan to Mrs McDougal went to her small public relations company. Mr Hale alleges some of the money went to the Whitewater account. Mr Clinton has long denied exerting pressure on Mr Hale to make the loan and claims not to remember the loan at all. Justice Department lawyers rejected Mr Hale's story, However, Mr Fiske is more interested. After pleading to lesser charges, Mr Hale will be brought before the grand jury on Whitewater. Mr Hale admitted misleading the SBA about his assets to get additional federal funds.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): EC funds training initiatives MORE THAN Pounds 25m of European Community funding has been allocated to British organisations for training projects designed to help women, people with disabilities and to promote new qualifications. The three initiatives, backed by the European Social Fund, will be trans-national projects exchanging skills and training knowledge between member states. One project, Euroform, develops skills and qualifications in preparation for the single market. Mr Eric Forth, employment minister, said yesterday that Britain benefited significantly from the European Social Fund, receiving about Pounds 350m a year. Most of this was focused on training for the long-term unemployed. The new funds meant the UK could share expertise with other member states. Mr Forth said substantial interest had been shown in all three initiatives. Organisations chosen to run them included voluntary bodies, colleges and industry. Several Training and Enterprise Councils were among the successful bidders.</p>

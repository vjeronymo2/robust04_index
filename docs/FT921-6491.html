			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Algeria to get Dollars 1.5bn loans A GROUP of eight international banks, led by Credit Lyonnais, yesterday completed a Dollars 1.5bn commercial bank credit for Algeria after four months of hard negotiations with some of their 130 peers. The proceeds of this roll-over deal will help ease the repayment over five to eight years of commercial bank loans which carry no guarantees from western governments and which fall due up to March 31, 1993. The initial agreement with the eight 'core' banks reached last October has allowed Algerian banks to defer about Dollars 350m worth of principal repayments owed to commercial banks in last quarter, 1991. The accord also opens the way for a smaller disbursement of an Ecu400m (Dollars 510m) loan guarantee agreed by the European Community in autumn. It underlines lenders' willingness to do business with Algeria after cancellation of the second round of the country's first multi-party elections.</p>

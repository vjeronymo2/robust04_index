			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOLL IN UNITED DC-10 CRASH RISES TO 109  </P> <P> The death toll in the United DC-10 crash was raised to 109 today with two  people unaccounted for, and investigators reported that repair work had been  done on the plane the day before the flight.  </P> <P> City Manager Hank Sinda said at a news conference that 109 bodies had been  recovered by late Thursday.  </P> <P> Sinda reported 184 survivors from United Airlines Flight 232, which if there  are two missing persons would bring the total aboard to 295. That figure  conforms to the total reported Thursday by National Transportation Safety Board  officials. United was sticking by its previous figure of 293 people aboard.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, investigators focused on the plane's No. 2, or rear engine, which  was found to be missing its fan after the crash.  </P> <P> NTSB member Jim Burnett said the board had examined the last 20 maintenance  write-ups for the plane, including repair work done on the pneumatic system the  day before the crash. The pneumatic system affects air pressure in the engine,  air-conditioning and pressurization systems, he said.  </P> <P> "We know of no connection between the pneumatic system and anything that would  have, could have, affected the functioning of the engine," he said this morning  on NBC's "Today" show.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / NatWest aims for worldwide smart card scheme National Westminster Bank unveiled an electronic 'smart card' yesterday which it hopes customers will eventually use instead of cash. They will be able to load the Mondex card with money from cash dispensers, or telephones. NatWest, which has established a joint venture with Midland Bank and British Telecom to launch the card in the UK, wants retailers to install card-reading machines which would allow people to use Mondex for even tiny transactions. The card, which has a computer chip embedded in it, can hold a maximum of five separate currencies at a time. NatWest is now trying to recruit partners in up to 30 countries to establish Mondex internationally. Mondex will be simpler to use in shops than credit or debit cards because purchases will not be individually authorised. The bank hopes people will be attracted by not having to carry change around. It will allow consumers to transfer cash to and from bank accounts and cards using cash dispensers, or phones with card readers. They will also be able to swap money between their cards using electronic 'wallets'. It will be tested by about 30,000 consumers in Swindon, Wiltshire, in mid-1995 after BT adjusts phones in the area. NatWest said it expected the system to spread in international banking markets in the next 15 years. Mondex differs from smart card projects in Denmark and France in not requiring buyers to enter a Pin code number to authorise purchases. Cards can be electronically 'locked' to block use, but can be used like cash if unlocked. The move comes amid growing competition to establish a global smart card standard. Visa and Mastercard, the credit card companies, disclosed this week they would work together to form a common standard by next year. Many banks view smart cards as successors to credit and debit cards. Mystery of plastic cash, Page 10</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS OK UNION; LARGEST ACTION IN YEARS  </P> <P> In what was seen as a significant test of organized labor's ability to  replenish sagging membership by signing up low-wage immigrant workers,  employees of a large automobile wheel manufacturing company south of Compton  voted Thursday to affiliate with the International Assn. of Machinists.  </P> <P> The 655-403 vote in favor of union representation at American Racing Equipment  Inc. was one of the largest union representation elections held in the United  States this year, and one of the biggest in the Los Angeles area in several  years, National Labor Relations Board officials said.  </P> <P> It was also the largest manufacturing plant that labor has organized in Los  Angeles in more than two decades, according to Dave Sickler, the AFL-CIO's  regional director and one of organized labor's most fervent advocates of  organizing immigrants.  </P> <P> The workers won the right to bargain with their employer on an initial contract  -- an often contentious process that can take months or years.  </P> <P> American Racing's employees, most of them Mexican immigrants who make about $7  an hour, staged a wildcat strike last summer to protest what they said were  unsafe and uncompensated demands for faster production.  </P> <P> The three-day walkout, which ended when management agreed to a wage increase,  virtually shut down the production of aluminum wheels at the company's main  plant.  </P> <P> Longtime observers of organized labor in Southern California said a wildcat  strike by a non-union work force at a large plant was highly unusual.  </P> <P> In the wake of the walkout, the machinists union and Sickler's office assigned  an unusually large team of eight full-time organizers to solicit worker  interest in a union campaign. Workers petitioned the National Labor Relations  Board for an election.  </P> <P> Officials at American Racing Equipment, owned by Toronto-based Noranda Corp.,  declined several requests for comment during the past week. The company  operates three plants in Rancho Dominguez, a small industrial town.  </P> <P> "There are millions of other workers watching what you've done today who'll  take strength from this," Sickler told a gathering of American Racing workers  Thursday night in a union hall that machinists organizers established during  the organizing campaign. "This is a very historic day."  </P> <P> Labor officials have spent years talking about the need to recruit immigrant  workers to replace the hundreds of thousands of union members who were lost  during the 1980s because of plant closures and increased employer hostility to  unions. However, relatively few intensive efforts have targeted immigrant  workers.  </P> <P> Thursday's victory was unusual because unions have had particular trouble  winning representation elections at large companies.  </P> <P> While unions win representation elections at nearly half of all U.S. companies  with fewer than 100 workers, they win only about one-third of the time at  companies with 100 to 500 workers. The reason is often that larger companies  tend to expend significant resources, hiring anti-union consultants and  preparing videotapes for employees to watch before the vote.  </P> <P> The average union representation election involves fewer than 50 workers. Labor  has been organizing fewer than 50,000 new workers each year in the private  sector, while losing substantially more members because of plant closures and  layoffs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SUNDAY RUNNER BEATS A SUNDAY DRIVER ANY DAY  </P> <P> What disturbs me most about Melvin Durslag's column (Feb. 17) is that it  utterly misses the whole point of the L. A. Marathon. In a spectator-oriented  country where too many people are soft, unfit and unhappy with their physical  conditioning, it's a wonderful thing to see 20,000 ordinary citizens get out on  a Sunday morning to meet the challenge of a marathon.  </P> <P> In a city that has become habitually self-flagellating about all the things  that are wrong, why attack one of the few trends that counter these ills and  make people feel good about themselves and their community?  </P> <P> ED AYRES, Valencia  </P></p>

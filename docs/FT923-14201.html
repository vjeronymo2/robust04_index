Business Matters reckons that 100 smaller construction companies went into receivership during the building of Canary Wharf, most because they could not get their money from the big boys for work they had completed. The programme investigates the growing problem of late payment to sub-contractors (7.30 BBC2). If there have already been full-length profiles of Ross Perot on British television I have missed them. This Week fills the gap with a portrait of the Dallas businessman who is running neck and neck with George Bush and Bill Clinton in the race for the US presidency, though he has not even declared his candidacy (8.30 ITV). Wildlife Showcase documents the return of three dolphins, previously held in dolphinariums, to the sea off the West Indies (8.30 BBC2). In True Stories a collection of remarkable short films about life in post-communist St Petersburg, shown earlier this year on C4, is edited into a single 90-minute programme.

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Matsushita and Sony in accord MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's largest consumer electronics company, and Sony, which brought the world the Walkman, have agreed to simplify licensing procedures for their next-generation digital audio products. Matsushita will allow patents it holds of Sony's proposed Mini Disc, a miniaturised version of the compact disc, to be offered by Sony. In turn, Sony said its patents held on the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) will be available for licence to third parties through Matsushita. The move follows an agreement reached last October between Sony and Philips of the Netherlands, whereby Philips agreed to help licensing procedures for the Mini Disc, and Sony in return agreed to sell tapes for DCC through its music subsidiaries. Matsushita said while there were no immediate plans to produce each other's products, the move would simplify licensing procedures for audio hardware makers looking to manufacture either product. Patents which Matsushita currently holds on the Mini Disc, include technology which searches for tunes, and disc technology. Sony holds patents on error correction technology for the DCC. Matsushita expects to introduce the DCC to Japanese consumers later this month, and start marketing in Europe in the autumn. Sony said the Mini Disc would be available to consumers in November.</p>

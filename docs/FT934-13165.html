			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: HK convertibles find wide appeal HONG KONG companies, cashing in on the burgeoning economic appeal of China, are falling over themselves in the rush to issue convertible bonds. Wharf Holdings set the ball rolling in June with a HKDollars 400m Euroconvertible bond, since when the number of issues has mushroomed, as companies take advantage of low interest rates and a strong Hong Kong stock market. Mr Edward Cheng, finance director of Wharf, said: 'Everyone is happy. The company gets cheap finance, the shareholders don't get substantially diluted, and the international investors get exposure to Asian equities.' Two years ago, this sort of financing would have been unthinkable. Wharf's convertible has a seven-year term, so it straddles the 1997 hand-over of Hong Kong to China. This is an event which international investors have until recently viewed with profound unease. The major change has been the perception of economic growth in neighbouring China, both by Hong Kong companies and outside investors. In Hong Kong, companies have traditionally maintained low debt ratios. However, the move to raise exposure to the future sovereign nation has rapidly gathering pace as economic revolution in China is increasingly considered to be irreversible. Property developers have been the most active borrowers, having signed up land sites and infra-structural projects in China, at a time when high Hong Kong property prices have limited their access to credit lines from a nervous banking sector. For overseas investors, China was the reason for the traditionally low valuations of the Hong Kong stock market, but it has now become a major attraction at a time when the cash balances of international institutions are at record levels. US and European investors have been driven out of bonds and commercial debt in their domestic markets, so the offer of higher yielding instruments with an equity kicker into a fast growing equity market, is proving an easily saleable alternative. So far this year, Hong Kong companies have raised more than HKDollars 2.15bn through nine issues of either convertible bonds, or preference shares, and a further HKDollars 250m from a Eurobond issue. This compares with HKDollars 1.02bn raised through rights issues, and HKDollars 2.99bn through straight equity placements in the first nine months of the year, making it a substantial portion of this year's capital raising. The success of early issues is rapidly catching on. Initial issuers were blue chip property investment or development companies, such as Wharf, Amoy Properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties and Sino Land, and mainland-backed companies, such as Guangzhou Investment and Guangdong Investment. However, the latest confirmed issue is by Johnson Electric, a manufacturer of micro-motors, which is raising HKDollars 125m through a convertible bond. Two other second-line companies, Shun Tak and HKR International, have also announced plans to raise a total of HKDollars 300m: their success will indicate the depth of the potential market, and the likelihood of a far broader range of issues. In the meantime, convertible issuers are gaining a further positive side affect. Hong Kong investors are generally averse to the diluting effects of equity share placements, and they have, therefore, welcomed the availability of short-term financing to companies in exchange for long-term dilution at a much higher price  - the convertibles have switched into equity at a premium of more than 20 per cent to the current market price. The share prices of issuing companies have performed accordingly and, since the management in Hong Kong companies tends also to be the controlling shareholder, the convertible issue is becoming an increasingly beguiling formula.</p>

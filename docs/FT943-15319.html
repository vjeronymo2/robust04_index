			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Germany set to emerge from clearing smoke - The suspicion is dawning that Berti Vogts' team could do it again The German teenager looked earnestly into the camera. 'I think it would be nice,' he told viewers across the Atlantic in careful English, 'if another country won the World Cup for a change.' That was nice of him. In the US, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, English, French - even Brazilian - fans must have cringed. How they would like the chance to become bored through winning. Since 1954, Germany (or rather West Germany) have won three of the 10 World Cups; only Brazil have won as many. In that time, the Germans have been runners-up three times, third once and fourth once. The last time they failed to reach the semi-finals was in 1978 when they lost to Austria and finished third in their second-round group. The pattern is generally the same: the Germans move unspectacularly through their group matches, winning when they have to win, drawing when they do not. They ease through the early knock-out rounds and suddenly - when the smoke has cleared - there they are in the semi-finals yet again. The pattern has been repeated this time. And, with no other team producing consistently dominating performances - the Brazilians have not scored enough, the Dutch defence still looks creaky, Italy have been lucky - the suspicion is dawning that the Germans could do it again. The unconvincing manner of Germany's progress only increases that conviction. Where Italy, in the eyes of their fans, have barely scraped through, Germany have done just enough. Italy were fortunate, Germany professional. Germany are the team dubbed by one of America's Spanish-language newspapers 'the famous unknowns'. To the rest of the world they have Rudi Voller, Jurgen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthaus and eight other guys. It is not as if men like Thomas Helmer, Matthias Sammer and Martin Wagner are youngsters plucked from nowhere. They are veterans: experienced, solid, utterly unspectacular. One reason they are anonymous is that so few of them - only three of the current squad - play in Italy. Italian clubs seem to have decided that the top Germans, like their English counterparts, generally do not repay the investment or lack the flair to be worth one of the precious three foreign slots in a team. Even Matthaus, the team's most respected and most capped player, is often only noticed when hectoring the referee or when he is absent, as he was in the second half against Belgium. He thumps his long range passes like an English centre-half clearing upfield. Not for him the elegance and delicacy of a Michel Platini or a Franz Beckenbauer. It is only when the ball drops from the sky 60 metres away at the feet of a running team-mate that his accuracy and vision are revealed. Only Klinsmann, whose goals carried the team through the first round, and Thomas Hassler, who runs at defenders from mid-field, have consistently leavened the Germans' unspectacular approach with a touch of the unexpected. Voller, the hero of Germany's run to the final in 1986, is a readily identifiable character, but at 34 he is largely restricted to goal-mouth loitering, as he showed when he was recalled for the second-round game against Belgium and scored twice. Germany only beat Belgium 3-2, with the help of the referee, Kurt Roethlisberger, who has since said he should have given the Belgians a penalty. The win against Belgium followed a 3-2 escape against South Korea. One might have expected some post-match humility from Berti Vogts, the German manager. But no. 'I want to thank Rudy Voller for his performance. It was a bold decision on my part to start him, but I knew he is a great player. I thought we saw a top-class German team today,' said Vogts. The return of Voller lifted the average age of the 13 men who played against Belgium to 29 years and eight months. Age has advantages. The players are experienced and self-confident. On the other hand, their stamina is questionable, they may find it difficult to adapt - to the heat, for example  -and they all have strong opinions which they are prepared to express. The Germans led Spain 1-0 and ended up the weaker team in a 1-1 draw. They led South Korea 3-0 and then survived a late bombardment to win 3-2. They led Belgium 3-1, but allowed their opponents to stage a second-half assault. They have made no secret of the fact that they disliked the heat in Chicago and Dallas during their first-round games. But, unlike the Irish, they never turned it into an excuse for losing. For the second-round game in Chicago, temperatures fell. Even so, the pattern was repeated, the Germans losing the initiative in the second half. They can expect it to be hotter in New Jersey for the quarter-finals and semis and in the 90s if they reach the final in Pasadena. The Germans will be carrying the effect of their early matches in their ageing muscles. Players in their 30s, even if they are as fit as the Germans, recover more slowly than younger men. But Vogts is not giving Voller a rest yet. Last Monday Vogts announced his quarter-final team a week in advance, saying the side would be unchanged (with Matthaus back) against Bulgaria. Vogts has problems imposing his will on players. He lacks the natural authority of his predecessor, Franz Beckenbauer. Stefan Effenberg's obscene gesture, when substituted, may have solved one problem. Vogts immediately climbed on his high horse and used the opportunity to throw one of his most persistent public critics off the squad. But things are far from sweetness and light. There was a full and frank exchange of views at half-time in the Belgium game. Afterwards Voller said: 'It wasn't an argument with the coach. It was sort of communication. After the game everything was fine. We embraced each other.' Bulgaria are a team the Germans, and their fans, would expect to handle comfortably. Hristo Stoichkov and his equally industrious sidekick, Emil Kostadinov, will test the Germans' creaky, leaky defence, but the Bulgarians will have had two days less rest and played extra time with 10 men in the heat last Tuesday. By the end they looked shattered. Stoichkov had run himself into the ground. Yet they will be able to recall three defenders who rested on Tuesday, thanks to suspensions. If it is hot again the Germans must prove that old heads can compensate for old legs.</p>

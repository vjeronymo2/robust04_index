			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI POLITICS ERUPTS INTO RELIGIOUS-SECULAR CONFLICT;  </P> <P> CULTURE CLASH: THE DEBATE ECLIPSES THE STRUGGLE OVER PEACE TALKS WITH THE  PALESTINIANS.  </P> <P> In the midst of hard bargaining over who will lead Israel's next government, a  passionate and resentful debate has erupted over remarks by a prominent rabbi  disparaging secular Jewish culture.  </P> <P> The venom has exposed a persistent undercurrent of culture clash in Israeli  life, a struggle between those Orthodox Jews who strictly follow scriptural  doctrine and Zionists, who have traditionally made secular concerns primary.  </P> <P> So harsh was the outbreak of ill will that it has eclipsed the issue that  caused the collapse of the country's coalition government: peace with  Palestinians. In the past few days, little has been heard of such pressing  details as plans to attend peace conferences, possible agendas and negotiating  positions.  </P> <P> Instead, arguments rage over such questions as whether Jewish life has been  strengthened by the Zionist-led founding of the state or whether other-worldly  religious thinking made possible the slaughter of Jews at the hands of the  Nazis.  </P> <P> "It's an ugly scene," observed Jewish philosopher David Hartman. "It's a  competition for the soul of Jewry."  </P> <P> At heart in the debate are conflicting interpretations of Jewish history and  the role of modern Israel in it. The argument pits ultra-Orthodox leaders, who  find full identity within the bounds of the Bible, against secular Jews who  hold an expanded view of Jewishness to include modern nationhood.  </P> <P> Such a debate might seem to be academic given the minority status of the  ultra-Orthodox in Israeli politics; their parties in the Knesset, or  Parliament, hold about 10% of the seats.  </P> <P> But the open structure of Israeli politics and the inability of Israel's major  parties, Labor and Likud, to control a parliamentary majority has provided the  ultra-Orthodox parties the balance of power. In the current deadlock over  coalition-building, the ultra-Orthodox hold the key to who will be Israel's  next prime minister.  </P> <P> The rancor between the Zionists and the ultra-Orthodox exploded after a speech  Monday by Rabbi Eliezer Schach, the elderly spiritual leader of two  ultra-Orthodox parties in the Knesset, Shas (Sephardi Torah Guardians) and  Degel Hatorah (Flag of the Torah).  </P> <P> In his speech, the rabbi was expected to throw his weight behind either Labor's  Shimon Peres, or Likud's Yitzhak Shamir, the caretaker prime minister, in their  battle for power.  </P> <P> His speech was much anticipated and his followers filled a 10,000-seat  basketball arena in Tel Aviv to cheer him on. They greeted him as "king."  </P> <P> Schach refused to back Peres and appeared to provide a boost for Shamir,  although he never mentioned either name, but current events seemed not to be  the main focus of the speech. Instead, the nature of Jewish life and history  were at issue.  </P> <P> "What is the secret of Jewish survival?" Schach asked. "The secret is belief in  God and keeping the Commandments."  </P> <P> He continued: "The nation of Israel in diaspora after diaspora, through  destruction, fire and killing, with other nations standing opposite us trying  to destroy us -- yet with empty hands, it was possible to stand and we were  victorious.  </P> <P> "What is the miracle? I am a Jew and I am stronger then they. They will kill me  but my sons will remain alive."  </P> <P> Schach went on to accuse secular Jews of falling away from the faith and by  implication, undermining Jewish strength. He singled out for special censure  the kibbutzim or communal farms, an institution that is much identified with  the creation of Israel.  </P> <P> "The kibbutz members who don't know about Yom Kippur and the Sabbath and ritual  baths and who eat rabbits and pigs, do they have any connection with their  fathers? What kind of a Jew is that?" he asked.  </P> <P> The rabbi, who identifies with a Jewish tradition known broadly as the  "Lithuanian" because of its East European origins, spoke with confidence that  the secular origins of the Israeli state are being swept aside by new religious  fervor.  </P> <P> Schach's comments shocked secular politicians across the political spectrum,  prompting them for the moment to forget their rivalries. Being Zionists, the  politicians were offended by Schach's apparent downgrading of Israeli  nationalism's contribution to Jewish survival.  </P> <P> The attack on the kibbutz movement was widely viewed as a general attack on  secular life, and much offense was taken because of the role that kibbutz  farmers have played in defending Israel in wartime. Strictly Orthodox males  usually do not serve in the army.  </P> <P> Rivalry between the ultra-Orthodox and Zionists stems in part from Zionist  belief that the Judaism of strict Orthodoxy, with its emphasis on Talmudic  scholarship and preference of an enclosed society, must be abandoned to a more  open, muscular and forward-looking Judaism.  </P> <P> When Israel was founded, it was expected that the black-clad,  "Fiddler-on-the-Roof" style of Jewish life represented by the ultra-Orthodox  would disappear. In its place would arise a New Jewish Man: hoe in one hand,  rifle in the other, no longer with his nose in the Scriptures or confined to a  crowded ghetto. No more 17th-Century clothing, knee stockings, unkempt  side-locks and fur hats.  </P> <P> Ultra-Orthodox followers viewed the Zionist approach as nearly heretical. The  Zionists were abandoning the true power of the Torah, forgetting tradition, and  blending into non-Jewish culture, they believe. The foundation of the state  itself was an assimilationist move, in the strict Orthodox view, since it  copied a non-Jewish model.  </P> <P> Judaism transcends statehood, which in any case is supposed to be the construct  of the Messiah, not of men, according to these believers; the state will come  when the rule of the Torah is accepted by all.  </P> <P> Despite the clear division between the ultra-Orthodox and the Zionists, both  Labor and Likud, each of them Zionist parties, are continuing efforts to woo  the religious parties. The goal is to break a deadlock in Parliament and give  one or the other a ruling majority.  </P></p>

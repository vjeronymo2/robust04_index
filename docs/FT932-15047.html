			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Lyonnaise annual profits tumble 67.5% to FFr379m LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, one of France's largest industrial groups, yesterday announced a sharp fall in net profits of 67.5 per cent to just FFr379m (Dollars 71m) last year from FFr1.17bn in 1991. The company also said it was considering the flotation of Dumez, its troubled construction subsidiary. Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, described 1992 as an 'unfavourable' year for the group's public sector building interests, 'dreadful' for property, and 'good' for its service sector activities, which include water and energy. 'We will do everything we can to ensure that 1993 will be better than 1992,' he said, 'but the economic environment is so uncertain that no company chairman can be very accurate in their forecasts.' Mr Monod announced the appointment of Mr Guy de Panafieu as deputy chairman and head of its construction and property interests, leaving him well-placed to take over as chairman. Mr de Panafieu, 50, succeeds Mr Jean-Paul Payrare, former head of Dumez, who left last summer, apparently after a row with Mr Monod. Dumez was one of Lyonnaise's main problems last year. The company has been badly affected by the downturn in the European construction sector. Mr Monod said he hoped to recapitalise Dumez before the end of this year and may eventually float it on the stock market. Lyonnaise is also considering plans to float M6, its television station. In the meantime, it intends to raise around FFr2bn in cash this year by selling peripheral interests, including its minority stake in Havas, the French media group, and its German radio interests. The group managed to increase overall sales to FFr90.4bn in 1992 from FFr87.5bn in 1991. It also mustered a slight increase in operating profits to FFr2.69bn from FFr2.59bn. However, it was hit by an exceptional loss of FFr198m, against a FFr428m credit. It was also forced to raise provisions to FFr13bn from FFr10.5bn. Lyonnaise, which has held its 1992 dividend at FFr10, saw sales increase in its service interests to FFr32.9bn in 1992 from FFr28.9bn in 1991, although profits slipped to FFr1.65bn from FFr1.78bn. By contrast, the construction division posted static sales of FFr45.9bn and made a loss of FFr461m. The worst area was property, where sales fell to FFr11.6bn from FFr13.5bn.</p>

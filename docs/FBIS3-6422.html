			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The North and the South of Korea held the seventh  round of working-level contacts for the exchange of special  envoys at Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom this  morning. However, as the North side again put forward the issue  of announcing a joint communique, no progress has been made in  spite of a compromising plan put forward by our side. If the  two sides fail to settle the procedural matters for the exchange  of special envoys at today's contact, it appears clear that the  realization of an exchange of special envoys before 21 March  will be impossible.    Reporter Kim Chong-chin reports from the secretariat of the  North-South talks.    [Begin Kim recording] It is likely that the seventh  North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special  envoys will end without noticeable progress.    The North and the South Korea have been holding a  working-level contact in Tongilgak in the North side area of  Panmunjom from 1000 [0100 GMT]. However, as the North side  again put forward the issue of announcing a joint communique  which it raised during the sixth contact, the talks are  undergoing difficulties.    In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean  delegation, said that the North side's withdrawal of its  four-point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making  step and that the South side should accept without fail the  proposal for announcing a joint communique which states that the  North and the South agree on the principle of exchanging special  envoys.    Furthermore, the North side showed a strong [kanghan]  position that it will not concede even slightly [hanchiui  yangbodo hoyonghaji anketta] on any of the three points  concerning the missions of special envoys, the sequence of  visits, and itineraries which the North and the South showed  differences on in their last contact. The North side urged our  side to accept all of this, thus showing a more rigid attitude  than in the last contact.    To this, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior delegate, said  that  the North side should withdraw such unnecessary proposals as  announcing a joint communique, in consideration of the urgency  resulting from the lack of time for exchanging special envoys  before 21 March, and urged the North side to settle procedural  matters for the exchange of special envoys.    Delegate Song put forward a compromising plan which  stipulates the issue of achieving national reunification based  on the three- point principles of independence, peace, and great  national unity, which includes the missions of the special  envoys, as well as the principle of great unity of the whole  country and national independence proposed additionally by the  North.    In addition, Delegate Song revealed a position willing to  consider the timing of an exchange of special envoys after 21  March when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are  scheduled, on the condition that North Korea-U.S. talks be  postponed. However, he failed to secure any change in the North  Korean attitude.    In the event that the North and the South Korea fail to  settle the procedural matters for the exchanging special envoys  at today's contact, it is clear that the exchange of special  envoys before 21 March will not be possible.    Meanwhile, prior to the talks, the delegates from both sides  talked about North Korean folk wrestling, which was broadcast by  KBS television network recently. However, such conversation  ended earlier than usual, revealing an initial atmosphere of  stiffness. [end recording]</p>

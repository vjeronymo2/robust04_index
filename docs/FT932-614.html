			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Children's entertainment park The P&amp;O company BOVIS INTERNATIONAL has won a Pounds 45m construction management contract for the LEGO Park project on the site of the former Windsor Safari Park in Berkshire for LEGO World A/S, the Danish family firm which was founded 60 years ago. Work will start on the development soon with completion due in December 1995. The LEGO park is scheduled to open to the public for Easter 1996, subject to planning permission. Situated on a 142 acre site, the park will cater for up to 1.2m visitors a year and employ up to 600 staff. The leisure attractions are intended for children rather than teenagers and adults, so the park will be small enough not to be exhausting yet large enough to entertain children for a day-long visit. Designed in sympathy with the local Green Belt requirements and the adjacent site of special interest, the park will feature five main activity areas interspersed with landscaped walks and special water features. In the centre of the park will be Miniland, an area where LEGO models set in miniature landscapes will represent the towns, villages and famous landmarks of many countries around the world. The models, usually to 1:20 scale, will be enhanced with vehicles, figures and sound effects representing state of the art animation technology. Other areas include an Explorium (where children can build and programme their own models), themed areas, indoor shows, ride-in cars, boat rides, nature trails and lots of play tables where children can create their own ideas from piles of bricks. Construction begins early in 1994.</p>

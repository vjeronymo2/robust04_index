			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Multitrust net asset value rises to 48.6p Net asset value per share of Multitrust increased from 33.2p to 48.6p over the 12 months to June 30. At end-December 1992 the value was 35.25p. For the year to end-June basic earnings per share were 2.17p (1.5p) and available revenue increased from Pounds 65,124 to Pounds 93,972. The proposed final dividend of 1.2p makes a 2.7p (2.5p) total. Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman, said that having seen the increased value that could be attributed to a company by an acquisition, he would be 'forced to consider any serious proposals that appeared to be capable of giving significant added value to all shareholders'.</p>

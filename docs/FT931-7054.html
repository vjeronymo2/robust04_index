			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / People: Henderson moved at Alexon The campaign to get women into commanding positions in British publicly quoted companies has sufferred a setback with the latest reshuffle at Alexon, the clothing company, where Ruth Henderson has been stripped of her chief executive's title. Ruth Henderson became chief executive in June 1991 when Alexon demerged from Claremont Garments, the Marks and Spencer supplier. However, following a reorganisation of board responsibilities Henderson has been named joint chief operating officer. Alexon says this is not a demotion for her, although it does mark promotion for the joint holder of the title, Peter Ridsdale. Neither has had a salary change. In 1991-92, Henderson earned more than Pounds 160,000. Since a decline set in in Alexon's performance - it has warned of a Pounds 1m pre-tax loss in 1992-93 - there has been speculation about Henderson's position. One source close to the company said it was no more accurate to portray the decline as her fault than to praise her for the previous good performance. It was hoped that a side effect of the announcement would be that the company would no longer 'suffer the high-profile problem of having a woman chief executive'. Henderson will concentrate on product and merchandising; Ridsdale - who came from the Burton Group in September 1991 - will focus on marketing and retail. The group has recently relaunched its two main brands: Alexon womenswear and Dash leisurewear. The share price, which peaked at 444p about 18 months ago, closed unchanged at 80p yesterday. A few quoted companies have female managing directors; two reported results yesterday - Frank Usher and Honeysuckle Group, both USM-quoted fashion companies.</p>

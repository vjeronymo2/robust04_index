			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bar wars hit Foster'sfigures A profits slide in Foster's, the Australian brewer which owns the Courage drinks group, led to a sell-off among domestic beer stocks yesterday, though they later recovered on the view that some of the selling may have been overdone. Analysts had expected Courage to produce flat profits at worse, but it fell 17 per cent. The brewer is the first of the industry leaders to include figures for the crucial December sales period. While the market has been fretting about a retail price war among bars and pubs, one analyst said the Foster figures showed an intensifying of the wholesale battle between brewers. 'Margin pressure on both fronts would be very worrying,' he said. However, some in the market believe the brewery bears have gone too far, and late yesterday there was talk of one leading broker preparing to turn positive on selected stocks. After the initial hit yesterday, most shares rallied. Bass fell 10, but recovered to close at 516p, down a net 3. Whitbread slid 10 to 534p, after 530p, while Allied Lyons fell 7 to 612p. Fosters was steady at 61 1/2 p. Grand Metropolitan gained 7 to 443p with one broker recommending a switch out of Guinness, off 5 at 517p.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Risk management problems increase Shield losses Problems with its risk management business and a short-lived diversification into computer hardware left Shield Group with increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.24m for the year to end-March, against Pounds 425,000. Mr Norman Mazure, chairman, said that conflicting market signals had adversely affected the risk management business of Stickley Kent, its auctioneer and property insolvency offshoot. In addition, the personal computer market, which it entered in December last year through the purchase of Kamco Computers, experienced considerable commercial pressures. As a result 'margins were heavily reduced and sales fell,' he said. The hardware activity is to sold and full provisions have been made in the accounts for the year. A software operation, set up at the time of the Kamco purchase, also incurred losses. Spending on this has been curbed and the future of the business was under review. On prospects, Mr Mazure said that the company had returned to property dealing and development and these had realised small profits since the end of the year. Group turnover rose from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 3.44m; operating losses widened from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 988,000. There were Pounds 250,000 of provisions this time. Losses per share came out much higher at 18.8p against 3.7p.</p>

As the Vice-Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission in  Turkmenistan Alexander Dodonov has told Interfax, the referendum  can be regarded as valid since by 10:00 local time more than  76% of the electorate cast their ballots. By preliminary  returns from the commission, of the 1.95 Mn registered  constituents, 1.93 Mn (98.9%) voted by noon local time.    Although the final returns won't be known until Sunday's  morning, even today it's clear that President Niyazov will stay  in office for the next five years.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EIP must establish procedures for quantifying emissions reductions arising from sources that shut down or curtail production. A State may not take credit for such emissions reductions as part of an EIP if the same reductions have already received credit in the SIP's attainment or RFP demonstrations. For example, SIP demonstrations may include assumptions about equipment turnover rates and normal operating levels which may already credit some assumed rate of source shutdowns and curtailments. Credit also cannot be taken for shutdowns or curtailments that do not result in a decrease in an area's aggregate emissions. Changes in emissions at one source may merely increase emissions at another. For example, if one retail operation goes out of business, the total level of retail business will not necessarily change. Instead, customers may shift their business to other merchants in the area. The effect on aggregate emissions of such ``demand shifting'' will depend upon the nature of the business, and should be considered in the design of the EIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An EIP also must establish procedures for quantifying emissions from sources with uneven emission patterns due to batch, seasonal or cyclical operations. The appropriate procedure for handling these expected fluctuations in emissions will depend in part on the emissions averaging time upon which the EIP is based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA recognizes that the development of quantitative procedures for mobile sources can present significant challenges. Such procedures must consider, as appropriate, the factors which will affect or determine the level of participation in a transportation program, as well as how much and where vehicles are driven. Such procedures should clearly address how double-counting will be avoided across various mobile source programs (e.g., not double-counting I/M program reductions in quantifying credits from an accelerated vehicle scrappage program). Any assumptions or models which States may use to predict behavioral modifications as a result of the implementation of an economic incentive strategy must be presented as support information with the EIP submittal. The EPA views the development of sound incentive-based mobile source programs as an opportunity for the design of better, more rigorous tools for accounting for and encouraging mobile source emissions reductions beyond those required by traditional programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules allow for long-term averaging, while requiring that States make statistical showings that any such averaging is consistent with applicable RACT, RFP, and short-term NAAQS. Any State that wishes to use long-term averaging must include, with the plan revision submittal, a statistical showing that the aggregate effect of the specified averaging time is consistent with attaining the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS and satisfying applicable RFP requirements on the basis of typical summer day emissions; and, if applicable, a statistical showing that aggregate daily emissions from all affected sources covered by a Federal RACT requirement (net of any RACT/non-RACT trades) are no greater than the aggregate daily emissions from such sources that would result from the implementation of all applicable source-specific RACT requirements (see paragraph IV.D.2.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Monitoring, Recordkeeping and Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each affected source in an EIP must comply with requirements imposed by the program, and must implement the MRR procedures necessary to assure compliance with such requirements and to provide State and Federal enforceability. Requirements imposed by an EIP could include meeting mass emissions limits (either directly or through trading marketable permits), paying an emission fee, using specified products or procedures, providing product content labeling, or other measures specified by the program. Thus, the final rules allow for a wide range of alternative MRR procedures that provide sufficiently reliable and timely information for determining compliance. Criteria to be considered in the development of such procedures include representativeness, accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency, and timeliness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All source-specific program requirements must be structured in such a way that both inspectors and facility owners can judge the compliance status of a facility at any time, or, in the case of long-term emissions limits, at the end of the compliance period. This will require an authoritative, reliable repository of all relevant information at each facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

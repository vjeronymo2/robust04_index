			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Their Majesties King Husayn and Queen Nur were  on hand to greet the passengers of two Jordanian Royal Air Force  planes upon their return from Yemen today. Details in the  following report by Kassab Samawi from Amman airport:    [Begin recording] [Samawi] Their Majesties King Husayn and  Queen Nur were on hand to welcome back Jordanian nationals, who  returned to the homeland aboard transport planes of the  Jordanian Royal Air Force. There were around 300 men, women,  and children aboard the C-130's, plus a number of Arabs and  foreigners, that made a nonstop six-hour flight from Sanaa  Airport to Amman across Saudi Arabian airspace. [passage  omitted]    How was the journey and how did you go about bringing the  Jordanian nationals from Yemen?    [Unidentified pilot] Thanks be to God, we were instructed by  his majesty the king to fly to Yemen to fly home the Jordanian  nationals there. We set up the necessary arrangements,  including preparing the planes, and obtaining the requisite  clearances to overfly other countries. Thanks to God, we took  off for Sanaa this morning where we touched down at around 1000  Amman time. The situation was not exactly comfortable. When we  touched down the Jordanian ambassador and the military attache  were on hand to greet us. All the arrangements were excellent.  We had the passengers get on board fairly quickly so we could  take off as soon as possible, given the potential risks in view  of the current state of affairs in Yemen. [passage omitted]    [Samawi] Your Majesty the King: Yemen's crisis has always  been on your mind and you have always sought to keep the  situation from becoming as it is now. As you receive returning  Jordanians, would you care to comment on the developments in  Yemen?    [Husayn] I cannot express how saddened and pained I am over  what is happening, measured against our expectations for the  reconciliation that we sought to bring about. We call on God to  spare Yemen further devastation and safeguard the country's  national unity. I hope Yemen's current troubles will give way  to a happier era for the country and all our brothers there.    [Samawi] Is there anything that Jordan can do at this point  in time to arrest the deterioration in sisterly Yemen?    [Husayn] We will do what we can. A medical team travelled  to Yemen with the planes that flew there to pick up Jordanians  from Sanaa. We hope this unnecessary bloodletting will stop.    [Samawi] Thank you, Your Majesty.    [Husayn] Thank you.    [Samawi] A number of wounded from the two opposing sides are  now receiving medical treatment at the al-Husayn Medical Center  in Amman. [end recording]</p>

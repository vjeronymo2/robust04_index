			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: The elusive value of a brain Sir, Observer's 'Head Count' article (May 3) reminds me of the following story: A man in need of a brain transplant goes to the surgeon for a consultation. The surgeon advises him that he can have a surveyor's brain for Pounds 15,000, a lawyer's brain for Pounds 30,000 or, best of all, an economist's brain for Pounds 60,000. 'Pounds 60,000] Why so much?' asks the patient. 'Well,' says the surgeon, 'an economist's brain is as good as new - it's never been used.'

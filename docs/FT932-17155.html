			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Four nations to enforce no-fly zone in Bosnia US, BRITISH, French and possibly Dutch aircraft are expected to assume the task of enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia after the UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday night. Nato officials said ambassadors of the 16 allies would meet shortly, possibly today, to approve detailed plans. These are expected to involve initially between 50 and 100 aircraft. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, lambasted the UN resolution, warning it would fuel further violence. 'It is a catastrophic mistake which will lead to escalation,' he said. If there is a Third World War, the responsibility will fall on those who pushed the resolution.' The long-debated resolution to enforce the ban, which was tabled by the UN last October, will take effect in seven days. To enforce the ban, the US is expected to rely on fighters from the carrier Theodore Roosevelt - 30 F/A-18 Hornets of the US Navy and US Marine Corps and 10 F-14 Tomcats in fighter and reconnaissance versions. The ship also carries 14 A-6 bombers, but these would not be used under current terms of the UN resolution, which precludes attacks on ground targets except in self-defence. Britain is likely to send a squadron of Tornado F3 fighters specially assigned to 'out-of-area' operations. Currently based at Leeming in North Yorkshire, the aircraft would operate from southern Italy. Britain also has eight Sea Harrier fighters aboard HMS Ark Royal in the Adriatic. Mr Jonathan Aitken, British defence procurement minister, said Britain was 'in principle' ready to contribute aircraft, but gave no details. France was believed to be preparing to send Mirage 2000 fighters to join the operation, although it does not belong to the alliance's military command structure. The Netherlands has also offered to deploy a squadron of F-16 fighters. Nato is expected to run the operation through tactical headquarters at Vicenza in Italy. The operation will be co-ordinated by Nato AWACS high-flying radar aircraft, already monitoring the airspace of the former Yugoslavia. The enforcement plan follows about 500 violations of the flying ban, mainly by Serb helicopters. In mid-March, the UN reported that Serbs had used light aircraft for bombing raids near the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. Britain and France have been reluctant to back up the no-fly ban with force, considering that enforcement might be more trouble than it was worth. Concern focuses on possible reprisals against UN troops, as well as the difficulty of employing fast jets against helicopters, which can use mountainous terrain for cover. UN aid officials were at odds with Bosnian Serbs over help for the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica. The UN accused the Serbs of breaking a promise to let food convoys reach the town. The Serbs said they would allow access only for empty trucks to evacuate its inhabitants.</p>

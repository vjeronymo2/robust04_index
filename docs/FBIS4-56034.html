			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "sad": "Budget Deficit '94"] </F>   [Text]According to the Finance Ministry's public debt  department, this year's budget deficit will most probably be in  the range of 70 to 75 trillion zlotys, and not 83 trillion as  the Budget Law states.    The budget was designed on the assumption that interest  rates  on the National Bank of Poland's [NBP] refinancing credit will  be 28 percent on the average.    "We know already at this point that it is not going to be  the  case," Piotr Dziewulski, director of the Finance Ministry's  department of public debt, told journalists yesterday. A higher  refinancing rate means that the cost of servicing the debt  (meaning repayment of interest rates on bonds and discounts on  Treasury bonds) will increase the budget.    On the other hand, the Budget Law clearly limits the cost of  servicing the debt -- it cannot exceed 73.8 trillion zlotys. So  if budget revenue does not rise fast enough to be able to  finance the higher costs of servicing the debt, then the budget  deficit will have to be lower than was assumed up to now.  Otherwise, the cost of servicing the debt would have to go over  the 73.8 trillion-zloty mark, but that would require an earlier  amendment of the Budget Law.    According to Director Dziewulski, instead of the 83 trillion  zlotys planned in the Budget Law, the actual deficit may be  between 70 and 75 trillion zlotys.    "I think that the average interest rate on NBP's refinancing  credit will be 33 percent in 1994. I am assuming optimistically  that NBP will conduct another reduction at the end of the year,"  Director Dziewulski added.    As of 18 May, 37.5 percent of the maximum allowed amount of  the debt (73.8 trillion zlotys) was devoted from the budget for  servicing the debt, whereas by the same date, budget revenue  constituted 33.3 percent of the planned amounts for the entire  year (for budget expenditures, the figure was 31.6 percent).</p>

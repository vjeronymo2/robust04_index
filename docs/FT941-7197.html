			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Imperial Life posts 56% rise Imperial Life Assurance Co of Canada, controlled by the Desjardin financial services group, improved 1993 net profit to CDollars 28.8m (USDollars 21.5m) from CDollars 18.4m in 1992, reflecting stronger contributions from Canada and Britain, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Worldwide premium income totalled CDollars 685m, down 5 per cent mainly because of lower individual annuity sales in Canada and lower sales volumes in the UK.</p>

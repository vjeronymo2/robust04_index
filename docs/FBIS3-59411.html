			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on country's national debt and credit </F> strategy: "The National Debt: Between the Strategy of  Indebtedness and the Indebtedness Imputed to Unprofitable  Activities"]    [Text]  <H5>  There Should Be Legislation on the National Debt </H5>   Expressed in lei, at the current exchange rate of  almost 1,000 lei to the dollar, the credits which have been  incurred are up to somewhere over 4,000 billion; if we add the  accrued interest to this figure, the total amount exceeds 6,500  billion lei. If we also figure in the current domestic national  debt, together with the projected budget deficit for the current  year, we will have reached a total debt of approximately 7,500  billion lei by year's end. This poses the problem of where we  will get the resources to repay this money, since the majority  of the credits have been earmarked for consumption, which means  that they are not producing anything. The situation would be  different if these sums were utilized productively, in which  case repayment could be made from the value which would be newly  created as a result of the utilization of the productive  capacities in question.    In the report concerning the economic and financial  situation  of the country during the first six months of this year, which  the Ministry of Finance presented to the government, a separate  chapter is devoted to the national debt. This concept has been  brought back into currency after having been abandoned during  the communist period. The first reference to this term was made  over 100 years ago, in 1865. Romania has had national debt  during the whole period since then, with the only difference  being that this fact was no longer acknowledged during the past  45 years.    At present, despite the fact that people talk many times  about the Romanian state's national debt, the country lacks a  general framework of regulations concerning methods for  constituting it. For this reason, we believe that it is of the  utmost importance for the bill to be passed which has already  been submitted to Parliament by the Ministry of Finance; at the  present time, this bill is being discussed by the committees of  the legislative forum. According to the provisions of this bill,  the national debt represents the sum total of pecuniary  obligations incurred by the state through domestic and foreign  loans, in its own name or guaranteed by it abroad.    As you can see, the state can procure the necessary  financial  resources both on the domestic market and from abroad. In other  words, the national debt has a domestic and a foreign character.  The loans incurred on the domestic market can be utilized to  cover some needs generated by the existence of a budget deficit,  temporary cash shortfalls, public expenditures of national  interest, and the refinancing of the national debt. The foreign  portion of the national debt can be constituted as a consequence  of the medium- and long-term loans that have been contracted  directly or by commercial companies, self-governing public-works  administrations, and local public authorities with state  guarantees. These loans are for the realization of economic  development, recovery, and adjustment programs, for objectives  and actions in the public interest, and for the creation and  maintenance of the foreign-currency reserve, but also for the  cancelling out of the effects of calamities.    The loans taken out by the state appear as an understanding  between, on the one hand, a physical or juridical person and, on  the other hand, the state, through which the former consents to  make a sum of money available to the state, in the form of  reserves, for a fixed period. At the time a loan is taken out,  the state sets the date repayment is due, which can be closer or  further off in time, depending on certain conditions. The loans  are effected through the issuance of transferrable securities:  bonds, annuity deeds, and other government certificates. For  example, if the borrower is the central bank, treasury notes are  issued. These public certificates ensure the holders of a  certain counter-benefit, in the form of interest, gains, or  other material advantages, besides the repayment of the amount  that was borrowed.  <H5>  The Figures Show the Debt Statistics </H5>   The medium- and long-term credits contracted by the Romanian  state as of of 30 June 1993 amounted to the sum of $4,339.9  million, of which $2,869.8 million were incurred directly by the  state (66.1 percent) and $1,470.1 million were contracted by  economic agencies (33.9 percent). Out of the total foreign  credits incurred and guaranteed by the state, $2,827.3 million  have been drawn on. Out of the value of the foreign credits  contracted directly by the state, $2,605.9 million are earmarked  for consumption, which represents 90.8 percent of the incurred  debt; the remaining $263.9 million (9.2 percent) are earmarked  for development.    The domestic portion of the national debt as of the same  date  of 30 June 1993 was 482.7 billion lei and consists of: the  financing of the state budget deficit for the year 199 [as  published] (32.9 billion lei), the bank loan to cover the  domestic portion of the national debt, which has been created  through the state's taking over the losses and the nonperforming  credits of the state-financed economic agents as stipulated by  Law 7/1992 (155.9 billion lei), the state budget deficit for the  year 1992 (261.3 billion), the loan for the financing of the  expenditures which revert to the Romanian side from the  intergovernmental Convention concerning the collaboration on the  construction of the Krivoi-Rog Industrial Complex (21.5  billion), and the loan incurred through the issuance of  government bonds for the financing of the state budget deficit  for the years 1991 and 1992 (11.1 billion lei).    I should explain several terms so that we can better  understand these figures. Thus, incurred credits are understood  to mean the sum total of the credits contracted by Romania,  while credits drawn on mean the amounts which have already been  utilized. The mathematical difference between the two represents  the value of the foreign credits which our country has a right  to use, but which are frozen due to our failure to fulfill some  contractual clauses. A third term that is used is the service of  the national debt, which is, in the opinion of many specialists,  the best measure of a country's debt. A country's debt includes  the payments owed for the repayment of the national debt, which  represent the installments falling due, but also the interest  payments and any possible commissions.  <H5>  One Government, One Compensation -- Until When? </H5>   As one can see, one part of the domestic portion of the  national debt is constituted through the state's absorbing the  losses of some economic agents, of the unprofitable ones. In  other words, the ordinary citizen is compelled to pay the bill  for the inefficiency of companies that, since they are treated  with leniency, consider it normal to operate with losses, for  which they can in no way be blamed. They think that the state  will probably take care of them no matter what! And it would  seem that they are right, when the Executive, not finding (or  not wanting to find) an alternative, is scheming up a new  so-called compensation, by means of which the arrears will once  again be absorbed into the national debt.    Is this how people wish the much-trumpeted financial  discipline to be enthroned? We doubt that the IMF experts, who  are expected in Bucharest this week, will agree with this way of  thinking. Or, probably, the government is waiting for those  experts to leave so that in the end, once the agreement has been  signed at last, it can finally act undisturbed. If the other  previous experiments were not sufficient proof that this  solution (which treats the effects and not the causes) leads  nowhere except to a new financial freeze, as has already been  demonstrated, then the same thing will be tried again, based on  the principle of one government, one compensation. Until when,  however?    Where have we found the resources to finance this debt up to  now? In the case of the domestic loans, one part was paid off  through the agency of the National Bank, by resorting to the  printing of money. This has led to the growth of the currency  mass which is in circulation, without any quid pro quo in the  way of commodities and services, and it has led to the reduction  in buying power of our money and to the increase in prices. And  we still ask ourselves what the source of the inflation was!    In the case of the loans contracted at the banks and by  public offerings, since the state is obliged to pay those loans  back at their nominal value, the amount the state owes will have  been seriously eroded by inflation by the due date. This means  that in real terms the obligation will have been liquidated.    All that notwithstanding, the foreign credits contracted  from  various international bodies have the greatest weight. Unlike  domestic debts, they labor under the disadvantage of being  expressed in dollars. This means that they are constantly being  revalued through the depreciation of the exchange rate, so that  they actually keep pace with inflation. Expressed in lei, at the  current exchange rate of almost 1,000 lei to the dollar, the  credits which have been incurred are up to somewhere over 4,000  billion; if we add the accrued interest to this figure, the  total amount exceeds 6,500 billion lei. If we also figure in the  current domestic national debt together with the projected  budget deficit for the current year, we will have reached a  total debt of approximately 7,500 billion lei by year's end.  This poses the problem of where we will get the resources to  repay this money, since the majority of the credits have been  earmarked for consumption, which means that they are not  producing anything. The situation would be different if these  sums were utilized productively, in which case repayment could  be made from the value that would be newly created as a result  of the utilization of the productive capacities in question. But  due to the fact that the first installments will be due starting  in 1995, this question does not yet trouble government circles.  They are probably working on the premise that, by that point,  others will be called on to pull the chestnuts out of the fire.</p>

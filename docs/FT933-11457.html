			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Ford and Chrysler rise strongly on upturn in US car sales TWO OF the 'Big Three' US car manufacturers - Ford Motor and Chrysler - yesterday reported strong increases in second quarter profits. This was powered by a gradual recovery in the US economy and by gains in market share at the expense of Japanese rivals. Ford announced that earnings had doubled to Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m), or Dollars 1.43 a share, from Dollars 387m, or 70 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Chrysler's income nearly quadrupled from Dollars 178m, or 54 cents a share, to Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.86 a share. Ford's figures were in line with market expectations and its shares rose Dollars  3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange to close at Dollars 52. Chrysler's results disappointed the market and its shares dipped Dollars 2 1/8 to close at 42 5/8 . General Motors, the largest US vehicle company which is going through a severe restructuring, will report its results today. Analysts are expecting it to announce earnings of around Dollars 800m, compared with a loss of Dollars 703m a year ago. The three companies have been helped by a gradual improvement in US vehicle sales, though both GM and Ford, which have big operations in Europe, have suffered from the sharp slowdown in continental economies, particularly Germany. Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, said yesterday: 'I'm not sure we have seen the bottom there (in Europe) yet.' In the US market, the three companies have also benefited from an enhancement of their product mix. Higher-value vehicles have accounted for a larger proportion of sales.

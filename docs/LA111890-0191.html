			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY IS THE BIGGEST LOSER IN MEXICO STATE ELECTION  </P> <P> What if they gave an election and nobody came? Or what if they gave an election  and nobody believed in it? To a degree, both of those things happened last  Sunday, when only about 30% of registered voters cast ballots in the state of  Mexico.  </P> <P> The election for mayors and a legislature in the state of Mexico -- and another  in the state of Hidalgo on the same day -- was to test the political  modernization promised by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the  credibility of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled  Mexico for more than 60 years.  </P> <P> The PRI has claimed a landslide in Mexico state, apparently winning all but  four of 121 mayoralties and the entire 34-seat legislature. Partial official  returns issued Friday were confirming the PRI figures. Results in Hidalgo were  equally lopsided.  </P> <P> Opposition parties on the left and right charge that the PRI resorted to  massive fraud. The conservative National Action Party and the leftist  Democratic Revolutionary Party are calling for large portions of the vote to be  annulled. In Mexico state, National Action has challenged results in 1,000 of  4,293 polling places, while the Democratic Revolutionary Party has challenged  4,000.  </P> <P> But what may have been more significant than the alleged fraud in the outcome  of Sunday's election is the fact that the vast majority of registered voters  avoided the polls -- and most of those apparently belonged to the opposition.  </P> <P> The PRI received only slightly more votes than it did in the 1988 presidential  campaign, when leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won in the state of Mexico by  a wide margin.  </P> <P> But nearly 1 million people who voted for Cardenas in 1988 did not vote this  time, and National Action received at least 160,000 fewer votes. The ruling  party did not win those people over -- they simply stayed home.  </P> <P> The reason, according to non-voters interviewed on election day, was a lack of  confidence in the electoral process.  </P> <P> "No matter who you vote for, the PRI always wins," one typical non-voter said.  "They'll never respect the vote."  </P> <P> Many Cardenas supporters believe that he won the election nationwide and that  the government stole the presidency for Salinas.  </P> <P> PRI officials acknowledge a credibility problem but assert that their party won  the Mexico state election fair and square with a vigorous campaign. Indeed, the  ruling party did launch an elaborate campaign to identify its supporters block  by block, woo its opposition in key areas and get out the vote on election day.  </P> <P> But the PRI also was buoyed by unfair advantages that it enjoys as the  government party. The government pumped $92 million into Mexico state through  its Solidarity public works program, which was closely identified with the PRI.  The Solidarity logo is red, white and green, the colors of the PRI and of the  Mexican flag.  </P> <P> PRI officials say they never used Solidarity as part of the campaign, but even  at the party's closing rally in the municipality of Naucalpan, Solidarity was a  prominently featured slogan.  </P> <P> In another example, government and pro-government television ran frequent  advertisements for the PRI, but no opposition ads were to be seen.  </P> <P> The opposition charges that the PRI was more than advantaged. Among the  charges:  </P> <P> * That it issued multiple voting cards to PRI supporters, allowing them to vote  more than once.  </P> <P> * That its detailed analysis of voters in the 1988 election was used to "shave"  opposition supporters from the registration rolls.  </P> <P> * That election officials took registration cards away from opposition  supporters during the two months before the vote and failed to issue them new  ones.  </P> <P> * That they "intimidated" the opposition, threatening to withdraw tortilla and  milk subsidies and other government benefits.  </P> <P> PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio admitted that there may have been  "irregularities" in about 100 polling places in Mexico state on election day,  but he said that was not enough to change the results of the election.  </P> <P> "In the state of Mexico, we prepared conscientiously. We won with organization  and work. . . . We learned our lesson in 1988," Colosio said.  </P> <P> For years, the PRI called itself the party of the majority. It often claimed  election victories with 75% to 90% of the vote, and in 1976, PRI candidate Jose  Lopez Portillo ran for president unopposed. Several times when National Action  challenged the PRI at the state and local level, the government was accused of  stealing the race.  </P> <P> The ruling party was stunned by the 1988 presidential election, which Salinas  officially won with 50.3% of the vote -- the lowest ever for a PRI candidate.  When he took office, Salinas vowed to see Mexico into an era of truly  competitive multi-party politics, what he called political modernization.  </P> <P> Soon after, the government acknowledged defeat to the National Action Party in  the governor's race in Baja California, but elections in Michoacan, Guerrero  and Coahuila states were fraught with charges of fraud.  </P> <P> Now, once again in Mexico, the PRI won the vote but failed to win the  credibility it sought. The PRI won the state vote with about 17% of the 4.3  million registered voters -- hardly a sweeping mandate.  </P> <P> The opposition, on the other hand, also suffered a devastating setback. Not  only did their parties fail to achieve power, but they also failed to persuade  their supporters to vote. In the end, public distrust hurt the opposition more  than it hurt the PRI, which had the resources to get out its supporters.  </P> <P> Cardenas, who ran on a coalition ticket in 1988, showed that he has not yet  converted his Democratic Revolutionary Party into a force strong enough to  mobilize its members. National Action, which is 50 years old, says fraud kept  it from victory in Naucalpan, the state's wealthiest municipality where they  had strong support.  </P> <P> Last week, the dispute over election results in the town of Chinconcuac led to  a confrontation between PRI and Democratic Revolutionary Party supporters that  left nine injured, six of them with gunshot wounds.  </P> <P> In the end, political observers say, the biggest loser in the Mexico state  election is not any single party, but the development of democracy in Mexico.  </P> <P> "My impression is that these were neither free nor fair elections," said  attorney Jose Agustine Ortiz Pinquetti, who observed the Mexico state vote for  a new watchdog group called Council for Democracy.  </P> <P> "Much of the fraud was on the border between legal and illegal. But what's  clear is that there is no will on the part of the government to move toward a  democracy. The will is to restore the old system," he said. "This is a blow not  just for the opposition, but for democracy. If the opposition loses its base,  the system will not tend to become more democratic."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRIO SONNERIE'S EAR-OPENER AT MUSEUM  </P> <P> The concert Wednesday by the Trio Sonnerie in the Bing Theater of the County  Museum of Art seemed intended primarily to show off a new instrument: the  violin.  </P> <P> Not some recent, lab-developed electronic marvel but the hand- crafted wooden,  four-stringed model that has been playing a central role in the development  both of musical form and virtuoso performance for nearly four centuries.  </P> <P> What differentiated Wednesday's program even from most period-performance  concerts was that Trio Sonnerie -- violinist Monica Huggett, viola da gamba  player Sarah Cunningham, harpsichordist Mitzi Meyerson -- offered works not  from the 18th Century, but less familiar repertory from the middle- and  late-17th, when composers throughout Europe were frenziedly exploiting the  instrument's (and the performer's) technical and expressive potential.  </P> <P> The composers involved read less like a Who's Who than a "Who?": Giovanni  Battista Fontana, Thomas Baltzar, J.H. Schmelzer. Buxtehude and Biber seemed  like old friends under the circumstances.  </P> <P> With the exception of two relatively formal sonatas by Buxtehude, the works  offered proved exceedingly free in form and tonality -- call them sets of  variations or improvisations, each demanding the virtuosity which Huggett  unfailingly supplied.  </P> <P> The British violinist is a central, influential (as teacher and performer)  figure in today's search for authenticity. But she is no dessicated didact.  </P> <P> Huggett's playing projects tremendous rhythmic vitality and technical aplomb in  addition to scholarship. Her work on Wednesday should have laid to rest any  lingering suspicion that those who can, play modern instruments; those who  can't, seek refuge in scholarship. Huggett's remarkably pure intonation on her  gut-strung fiddle is a marvel in itself, sufficient to shame many a performer  on the intonationally more reliable, metal-strung modern instrument.  </P> <P> The program also included two works not involving the violin: a soporific gamba  suite by one Sieur de Machy (his dates, to quote the program booklet, are  "?-?"), elegantly presented by Cunningham, and a digitally dazzling, stylish  performance by harpsichordist Meyerson of some fascinating, at times agonizedly  chromatic variations from Buxtehude's "La Capricciosa."  </P></p>

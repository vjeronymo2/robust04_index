Momir Zec of the  Bosnian Serb Army assessed that the decision to allow opening of  the Tuzla Airfield "was a good move by the military and  political leadership" of the Bosnian Serb state, the Republic of  Serbia (R.S.) [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], as "the announced NATO  threats were being removed" in this way.    The Russian forces, which will control the airfield at this  northeastern Bosnian town under Moslem control, will prevent its  possible abuse, said Col. Zec to the R.S. news agency SRNA  Thursday.    The accord on opening the airfield at Tuzla was [word  indistinct] Tuesday during the talks of R.S. President Radovan  Karadzic with Russian ranking officials in Moscow.    The Bosnian Serbs accepted for the Tuzla airfield to be  opened for humanitarian aid on condition Russian monitors carry  out control as the Serb side feared the airfield could be used  for bringing in arms and military equipment to the Bosnian  Moslems.    U.N. Undersecretary for Peace Operations Kofi Annan said  recently that the U.N. planned the opening of the Tuzla  airfield for March 7 in an operation which could involve also  NATO air support, while French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  recently threatned the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they  prevented the opening of the airfield.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Deric Henderson, Joe Quinn, Moira Whittle, </F> Jackie Burdon, Peter Woodman, and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS  ASSOCIATION News]    [Excerpt] Twenty-nine people, including elite members of  the RUC's [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special Branch, Army  officers and Northern Ireland Office officials died tonight when  an Army helicopter crashed into a hillside in a remote part  western Scotland.    Police said the Chinook helicopter came down in thick fog  while on route from RAF Aldergrove in Belfast to a security  conference at an Army base at Fort George, Inverness. There  were no survivors in the crash which happened at around 6 pm,  approximately 700 yards from a lighthouse on The Mull of  Kintyre. The RAF said the dead included four crewmen and 25 VIP  passengers.    Strathclyde chief constable Leslie Sharp told a midnight  news  conference in Glasgow that the dead passengers included 10 top  RUC men, nine Army officers and six senior officials from the  Northern Ireland Office.    At least six of the dead were men in charge of the secret  war  against the IRA in Northern Ireland. They are believed to  include RUC officers up to and above the rank of chief  superintendent.    Mr Sharp said all 29 bodies had been found and were removed  from the crash site, about to a temporary mortuary at  Machrihanish just up the coast. "At this time there are no  reasons whatsoever to suspect that we are dealing with anything  other than a terribly tragic accident," he added.    Some of the dead men would have had access to the most  sensitive intelligence in the fight against the IRA and would  have been regularly travellers to Britain to update forces on  the mainland. One was said to be particularly wellknown in  London and was due to retire soon.    Both the lighthouse keeper and a woman out walking heard the  impact of the 51ft twin-rotar aircraft on the windswept hillside  and reported seeing a fireball.    Five Navy and RAF Sea King helicopters, local fire crews and  lifeboatmen, coastguards, medical crews from Glasgow and  specialist RAF mountain rescue teams all converged on the scene,  10 miles from Campbeltown, but there were no lives left to be  saved.    Wreckage on the ground was reported soon after impact but  the  search for survivors was hampered by the same thick fog which  experts suspect may have caused the crash. At some points  visibility was cut to 10ft.    Colleagues of the RUC men tonight said they were stunned.  "The force is devastated," said one. "It seems the upper echelon  of the Special Branch is missing. We can't believe this has  happened."    No names of the 29 dead were being released until relatives  had been informed.    One RUC officer said: "These people were right at the heart  of intelligence. These were the men who made the Special Branch  tick. It's a devastating blow. It's impossible to explain such a  loss. Everybody is reeling." One of the dead RUC men was in  charge of the Special Branch's source handling unit -- the team  which monitored the flow of vital information supplied by the  IRA's informers all over Northern Ireland. The officer added:  "This is a grievous blow which can't be underestimated. The  place is in a state of shock and bewilderment. All these guys  had their finger on the pulse. They knew everything."    Whitehall sources were giving no details of the precise  nature of the Fort George conference, but it seems to have been  intended to deal with military and police strategy in the war  against terrorism in Northern Ireland. Fort George is a base  for the Royal Scots. The conference was being staged there  simply because it is a large base with plenty of rooms and  facilities -- and in an out-of-the-way and secure location,  military sources said.    Both John Major and his Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  were being kept informed on developments tonight. An MoD  [Ministry of Defense] spokesman said armed forces minister  Jeremy Hanley would fly from London to Machrihanish in the  morning to visit the crash site and talk to members of the  emergency services.    The wreckage was strewn over one square mile of remote  hilltop, 30 minutes' drive from Campbeltown, the nearest  settlement and an air exclusion zone was put in place tonight.    Earlier, neither police nor the RAF would give casualty  breakdowns but one rescue source said: "The guys are working in  the wreckage to get bodies -- it's as grim as that. The debris  has been strewn over a huge area and everyone is there --  police, military personnel, everyone. The weather is still  appalling -- fog, rain and high wind."    Captain Donald Black, of the Campbeltown Lifeboat Services,  said the scene suggested the helicopter had hit the ground and  then skidded, or cartwheeled for a distance. Aviation fuel had  also spilled and caught fire in the heather.    Tonight in Glasgow, Mr Sharp said first impressions  indicated  that bad weather had caused the Chinook to hit the hill and said  locals remembered many similar crashes during the Second World  War. But he stressed that the cause of the crash had still to be  determined "and this will obviously take some time." [passage  omitted]</p>

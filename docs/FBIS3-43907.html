After President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos had  failed Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's 1994 economic  program, Prime Minister Marcolino Moco went to Parliament to  inform it that the government would not be able to present this  year's program of action by 20 January. Gustavo Costa, our  correspondent in the Angolan capital, provides the details:    [Begin Costa recording] Yesterday, Prime Minister Marcolino  Moco met with the MPLA deputies to the National Assembly to  explain the government's inability to produce its 1994 program  by 20 January. Instead, the Angolan prime minister presented a  set of guidelines for the drawing up of new governing strategies  and of the next state budget, under the watchful eye of  Parliament, which intends to exert rigorous control over the  implementation of the deadlines mentioned in the government  program. The new outlines for the drawing up of the government  program are now receiving great care, particularly in view of  the fact that President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has rejected the  program devised by Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro.    Some journalists feel that the Angolan head of state had no  option but dismiss the finance minister's program, which  proposed the continuation of the work done in 1993, even though  many voices from various sectors have described administrative  methods in use as the main culprits for the erosion of the  Angolan economy.    Concerning the economic management style chosen by Finance  Minister Carneiro [words indistinct] generating a wave of  popular dissatisfaction that has been reflected in the paralysis  of the industrial (?sector), the companies' lack of capital, the  despair of Angolan entrepreneurs on the verge of bankruptcy, the  lack of credibility of the banking system, an almost obscene  [word indistinct] of foreign exchange rates, an extremely high  inflation rate that encourages frightening levels of corruption,  and promoting more and more crime, as well as uncontrolled and  spiralling discontent.    In view of this scenario, the Angolan head of state had no  option but order a new government program from Pedro Morais,  secretary of state for planning. The keynote of that program  should be liberalization, to allow President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos to garner dividends from the talks he will personally  direct when an Angolan team attends the Paris Club meeting  scheduled for February. Even though there has been no  announcement concerning Finance Minister Emanuel Carneiro's  dismissal, the fact that the Angolan head of state rejected his  program considerably undermines the role of the Finance  Ministry. The expectation is that [words indistinct] the  country's catastrophic financial situation [words indistinct]  structural readjustment [words indistinct] management of the  Angolan economy so that [words indistinct] the foreign debt as a  means to convince financiers to open their purses and grant new  loans.

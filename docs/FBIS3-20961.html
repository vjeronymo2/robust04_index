But that will not prevent Peugeot from  supplying diesel engines to Honda. Early next year, the Japanese  manufacturer is expected to offer a diesel version of its  mid-range Concerto sedan, the mechanical equipment of which will  come from Tremery (Moselle). A cousin of the British Rover 200  and 400, which already use that engine, the Concerto will be  reserved to the French market. Sales are expected to reach 3,500  units in 1994. Early this year, however, Honda started designing  a clean diesel engine.</p>

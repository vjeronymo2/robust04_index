			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Observer: In the air Mind you, even Dinkins's PR is out-marzipanned by the puffers of a block of serviced flats Britain's newly formed Heritage Trust partnership hopes to be allowed to build in green-belt Surrey. As if it wasn't a schmaltzy enough idea to house the flats in the first British castle to be built for 60 years, the publicity blurb kicks off with a poem beginning: What spires are these amongst the trees, Is Camelot to Cobham come?' Whatever answer King Arthur and his rotary club might have given, the project is of concern to present royalty. While the partnership believes its Pointers Castle is of such merit as to rise above the green-belt planning rules, Prince Charles might think differently. For, if built, it will be in sight of the landscape gardens at Painshill Park of which he is patron. The castle's designer Paul Nadhar, who claims it accords with the Prince's book A Vision of Britain, says he has been kept informed of the project. 'Regrettably, he hasn't at this stage shown an active interest,' Nadhar adds.</p>

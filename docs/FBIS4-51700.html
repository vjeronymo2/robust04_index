			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F> spokesman; dated 2 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. It has been reported that a peace march was  made to the Bavel region last Saturday and that two or three  marchers were shot dead. This report hinted at the National  Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] as being responsible for the  incident.    The NADK spokesman would like to emphasize that the NADK had  nothing to do with this peace march. In fact:    1. The NADK did not know the starting point nor destination  of this march.    2. The situation in the western part of the town of  Battambang is marked by the fact that the communist Vietnamese,  their puppets, and their allies' puppets have been launching  fierce and continuous operations against the national resistance  forces and people, thus causing inestimable damage and endless  misery to the villages and people in this region.    3. The NADK would like to emphasize that anyone who wants to  find the culprit in the peace march incident should look at the  evildoers, that is, the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, and  their allies and puppets who have kindled the war together and  are continuing to kindle the flames of war which has burned and  ruined Cambodia, the Cambodian people, Buddhism, temples, and  monasteries for 15 years now. By now, half of Cambodia is  becoming another Kampuchea Kraom.    To cite Lord Buddha, all these atheists are the ones who  have  committed all kinds of evil deeds, especially killing and  stealing. The Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian nation and  people are the victims, victims who have suffered untold misery  and not been allowed even to protect themselves. They have  jointly attacked and accused us in an unjust, inhuman, arrogant,  and brutal manner in line with their evil nature as demons who  like to suck human blood.    4. Questions: Who does not know that the communist  Vietnamese have installed their puppets to serve as a  smokescreen for the communist Vietnamese to continue their  aggression and occupation of Cambodia? Who does not know that  the allies have integrated their puppets with the communist  Vietnamese puppets since July 1993 in order to continue fueling  the Vietnamese war to kill the nation, people, and resistance  forces? In Lord Buddha's moral precept, who has done all these  evil deeds? In the way of the world, who have been the  aggressors against the Cambodian nation and people for the past  15 years?    From these few questions, people can clearly see without any  delusion what is white and what is black.    [Signed] NADK spokesman    [Dated] 2 May 1994</p>

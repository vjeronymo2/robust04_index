			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLASSICAL MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> REQUIEM SUFFERS IN MOVE TO CONCERT HALL  </P> <P> Although Gabriel Faure's Requiem is a staple of church choirs, it is less  frequently performed in the concert hall. With the combined resources of the  San Diego Symphony and the La Jolla Civic-University Chorus at his disposal,  music director Yoav Talmi did not make a convincing case for extracting the  devotional work from its customary stained-glass surroundings.  </P> <P> To be sure, there were some rewarding moments in Friday night's concert at  Copley Symphony Hall. In the quiet opening movements, the highly disciplined  chorus floated its dulcet, well-blanced sonorities, and the orchestra's lower  strings sympathetically indulged the work's intimate counterpoint. Talmi's  approach to the work stressed its reflective side, although the orchestra  provided a wider range of emotions when asked.  </P> <P> Soprano Sivan Rotem brought vocal purity to her "Pie Jesu" solo, but her  brittle, studied phrasing muted her contribution. In his crucial solos,  baritone Hector Vasquez displayed abundant vocal assurance. His musical virtues  -- graceful phrasing, natural declamation, and above all a sense of conviction  about the meaning of the text -- included everything the chorus failed to  achieve. The 78-voice chorus, trained by resident conductor David Chase, sang  cool, precise syllables and monochromatic phrases that sounded as if all  expression had been eliminated by crafty computer engineering.  </P> <P> Just because Faure did not include the apocalyptic "Dies Irae" text does not  mean he eliminated the drama from his Requiem. The composer subtly worked drama  and urgency into the musical fabric, expressing it in sudden dynamic explosions  and unexpected modulations, the same technique he employed in his esteemed art  songs. But when Talmi asked for an ardent forte, for example, at the "Hosanna"  in the "Sanctus," their pallid response was all too easily overpowered by the  orchestra.  </P> <P> The Requiem performance was dedicated to Zoltan Rozsnyai, the former symphony  music director who died last month, and to conductor and composer Leonard  Bernstein, who died last week.  </P> <P> Talmi preceded the Requiem with three shorter French works. Berlioz's highly  pictorial "Royal Hunt and Tempest" from his opera "Les Troyens" received an  appropriately atmospheric treatment. But in Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin,"  mannered articulations and uneven tempos marred this usually charming  program-opener. The orchestra offered a festive, light-hearted run through  Berlioz's "Le Corsaire" Overture, giving the concert's first half the rousing  ending denied by the ethereal final strains of the Requiem.  </P></p>

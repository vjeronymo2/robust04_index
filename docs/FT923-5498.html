			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Grade attacks BBC managers MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, made a strong attack on the governors and senior management of the BBC at the 17th Edinburgh Television festival last night. Mr Grade, a former controller of BBC 1 who joined Channel 4 in January 1988, accused the BBC of adopting 'a pseudo-Leninist style of management which relies on the exercise of central control' to the detriment of programme planning and production values. He singled out the funding of the corporation as the most important issue facing it. The government funds the BBC by means of a compulsory licence fee  -currently Pounds 80 annually for a colour television. The BBC's charter and licence to broadcast, granted by the government, comes up for renewal at the end of 1996. Describing the licence fee as 'in danger of becoming a dwindling asset', Mr Grade said: 'The BBC seems prepared to pay too high a price in return for the charter renewal . . . The present regime at the BBC has, mistakenly, adopted a strategy which says there is no alternative to the licence fee therefore they will do whatever it takes to secure it. 'They are putting in long-term jeopardy the very institution they are fighting to protect.' Mr Grade said he supported the continuation of the licence fee. The BBC 'was never meant to be a business' but was established as 'a centre of excellence in broadcasting'. He accused BBC governors of having adopted a 'policy of appeasement' in the face of the 'terrible battering it has taken from the government over the last 10 years'. Mr Grade argued that the BBC is a public service and must be sufficiently funded to maintain its reputation for quality broadcasting. 'If you put the BBC into competition for revenue, it ceases to be a public service.'</p>

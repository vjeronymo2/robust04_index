			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Volvo swings back to the black VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle group, returned a profit (after financial items) of SKr1.5bn for 1991 after incurring a loss of SKr327m in 1990. It is holding the dividend at SKr15.50 a share. The return to profit was due to income from Volvo's shareholdings in the French vehicle group Renault and the Swedish pharmaceutical and food company Procordia, and the sale of shares in Saga Petroleum, the Norwegian oil company. Profits after financial items, however, dropped by 28 per cent if restructuring costs of SKr2.4bn are excluded from the 1990 results. There was an an operating loss of 1.16bn against a profit of SKr567m in 1990. Car division losses grew to SKr1.7bn from SKr855m. The bus division also had a loss of SKr152m against a profit of SKr67m in 1990, while marine and industrial engines had a deficit of SKr84m against a profit of SKr69m. The truck group made a profit of SKr788m, a 44 per cent fall. Aerospace was the only division to improve, with earnings of SKr128m against SKr43m. Sales fell by 7 per cent to SKr77.2bn as the recession kets. Net earnings from associates totalled SKr1.2bn once a loss of SKr510m was deducted from Volvo's other corporate holdings, including its stake in Nedcar, the Dutch auto joint venture. Renault contributed SKr561 to earnings and Procordia SKr1.16bn. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault's car division and 45 per cent of the Renault truck group, while it holds 43 per cent of Procordia's voting rights. The sale of shares gained SKr2bn for Volvo, with the sale of the Saga Petroleum securities providing SKr1.43bn. Mr Christer Zetterberg, chief executive, said fortunes may now be improving, with a small operating profit of SKr88m posted in the fourth quarter of 1991 following five consecutive quarters of losses, including a deficit of SKr697m in last year's third quarter. Sales in the last quarter of 1991 rose 19 per cent to SKr21.6bn from the preceding quarter, but were only 4 per cent above sales a year earlier.</p>

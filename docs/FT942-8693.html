			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Observer: Party pals The death of John Smith has not quelled talk of a leadership crisis in the Tory party. Michael Heseltine's odds have lengthened sharply and Kenneth Clarke's reputation remains in the doldrums. Indeed, the prospect of young Tony Blair taking Labour into the next election has added to the Tory turmoil. Current wisdom has it that if Labour opts for Blair, then Michael Portillo's chances will be greatly improved. Portillo is three weeks younger than Blair and he has served in the cabinet, for what that's worth. But another name is now being floated by MPs on the centre-left of the party who can't abide Portillo's Euro-scepticism. Stephen Dorrell, 42, tipped to enter the cabinet in the summer reshuffle, is being promoted as the man most likely to beat the fresh-faced Blair. Only problem is that most voters would find it hard to distinguish one ex-public schoolboy from the other. The social democrat Blair and the One-Nation Tory Dorrell tend to agree with each other more often than they do with rivals in their own parties.</p>

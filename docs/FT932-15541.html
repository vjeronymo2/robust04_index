			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Banks face severe losses on property: Shortfall of Pounds 8bn on loans in south-east estimated BANKS FACE a potential shortfall of more than Pounds 8bn on loans made for office property in London and the south-east, says a report. Estimates by St Quintin, a firm of chartered surveyors, illustrate the severity of the banks' property losses, which resulted from the sharp rise in bank lending to the property sector in the late 1980s and the subsequent collapse in commercial property val-ues. The firm believes that the Pounds 24.6bn of loans to London and south-east offices may be secured on property worth just Pounds 16.4bn. In the central London office sector, the worst-hit part of the market, loans of Pounds 10.8bn may be supported by assets worth only Pounds 6.4bn. Mr Peter Damesick, a director of St Quintin, said the banks' losses might not, however, be as large as the gap between the value of a loan and the underlying asset. In some cases the loans are guaranteed by other assets. Moreover, property values may have risen by the time a loan matures. Mr Damesick said: 'The shortfall between asset values and outstanding debts can be expected to narrow as currently vacant buildings are gradually let and values generally improve over the medium term.' The report estimates that the Pounds 37.9bn of loans extended to the entire UK commercial property sector is secured against property that has fallen in value from Pounds 50.5bn to Pounds 31bn during the past four years. The value of bank-financed property in the industrial and provincial office markets has not, in aggregate, fallen below the outstanding debt. The report says that one result of the fall in asset values to just more than 80 per cent of the total debt is that institutional investors have less to fear from the apparent debt mountain than is sometimes assumed. Moreover, the quality of much of the bank-financed property stock is not of institutional quality. 'Institutional investors have less to fear from the apparent debt mountain than often assumed . . . The debt 'mountain' is, in part, a mirage,' the report says. It warns that the banks' unwillingness to make new loans to the property industry could hold back the sector's recovery. 'Further reductions in bank lending could inflict additional wounds on the market and help to hold back values,' it says. Between the beginning of 1987 and May 1991 loans to property companies rose from just less than Pounds 10bn to Pounds 40.7bn. This figure fell to Pounds 37.9bn last November. Including debt extended to the construction industry, the total lent to the property sector is Pounds 53.4bn. Bank Finance in the Property Sector: Debt Mountain or Mirage?

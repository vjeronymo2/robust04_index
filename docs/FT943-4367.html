			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / CBI chief launches attack on Treasury Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, last night launched an extraordinary attack on the Treasury for allegedly attempting to undermine the government's competitiveness white paper produced earlier this year by the Department of Trade and Industry. Speaking at the annual dinner of the Scottish CBI in Glasgow, Mr Davies said that the white paper 'demonstrated the need for business advice and support services both at home and abroad, at least as good as those available to companies in competitor countries'. That meant upgrading the services for small businesses at home and export support activity abroad. 'Yet the ink was scarcely dry on the competitiveness white paper setting out this strategy, and offering business a new partnership with government, before the Treasury began to throw the basis of the policy into question,' he said. It is understood that Mr Davies was referring to the plans of Mr Michael Portillo, the former Treasury chief secretary, to slash the DTI budget. These plans, when leaked during the summer, caused a major political row, not least because Mr Portillo appeared to be talking down to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Last night Mr Heseltine was in Glasgow to hear Mr Davies savage his tormentors. He refused to be drawn, saying he was confident that the white paper represented the policy of the whole government.</p>

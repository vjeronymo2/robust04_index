			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Mateus Ngonhamo, joint commander of </F> the Supreme Command of the FADM, by Lourenco Jossias on 12  April; place not given]    [Text] [Jossias] General, could you tell us what are the  duties of FADM [Mozambique Defense Armed Forces]?    [Ngonhamo] Well, there are various duties because, as in any  country in the world, its infrastructures ought to be defended  and independence ought to be upheld. Those are the duties of  the FADM: to defend independence and Mozambique's sovereignty  and territorial integrity.    [Jossias] What sort of an army will we have in our country?  Will it be an army for purely defensive operations or will it  also be geared toward attacking -- an internationalist army?    [Ngonhamo] Right now, your question has many answers. It is  our desire to have a professional and nonpartisan army with  defensive and offensive capabilities. If we create an army only  with a defensive responsibility, our task would not be complete.  Like I said earlier, we want to defend Mozambique's territorial  integrity and that is accomplished in different ways. We can  defend ourselves from any aggression by a neighboring country or  any power.    That could be a defensive action, but within this context we  can have offensive actions. So, I can say that the army we are  preparing right now ought to be practically and technically  offensive and defensive.    [Jossias] General, you once said any of Mozambique's  neighbors posed a threat. Do you still believe that and if so  why?    [Ngonhamo] I see things from different angles. My reading is  very simple. When I speak of a threat from neighboring  countries, I speak as a Mozambican who is inside his country. I  see Mozambique as an independent and sovereign country -- a  country with economic potential -- and not as a country that is  the property of a party, such as the one in power today.    I have referred to threats -- and I will continue to  reiterate that we ought to be ready -- because today's friend  could be tomorrow's enemy. If today there are countries with  ties of friendship to Mozambique, it is because they are friends  with the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party, which is  in power. Our country is under a democratic regime and tomorrow  any other party could win the elections, but it may not have  ties of friendship with those countries. That can create  problems. Let us look at the situation in some countries right  now.    Today, the South African problem is a threat to Mozambique.  One does not yet know what the situation will be there.  Mandela, De Klerk, or any other party could win. One does not  know what the future has in store for South Africa. Here in  Maputo I am seeing the answer to my assertion that those  countries pose a threat to Mozambique. South African refugees  have begun to arrive in Mozambique, fearing the war there, and  there are people already leaving South Africa for Portugal and  other countries. That creates a very difficult situation for  us. It is not only a military threat, but an economic one as  well. If Mozambique is to have refugees again, and the same  situation that we had with the ANC in the past, the same  situation that we had with the Zimbabweans fighting against the  colonial system in Rhodesia, it will be a threat to us and our  stability. We, the FADM, will be ready to help, whatever the  need.    We could speak of a country as small as Swaziland, where the  situation is also not very clear. Their lives evolve around a  monarchy, but one day a madman may surface and wish to change  the situation, as in Lesotho, and he could expel the king and  establish a system that might not conform with ours and with our  lives in Mozambique.    We could even speak of Botswana, where the situation is very  calm. But that should not please every Mozambican, because one  day some sort of crisis might flare up.    When one sets fire to cotton with a match, the fire and  smoke  will not be noticeable immediately. Cotton first burns from the  inside, and the flames only begin afterward. There are many  internal problems in Botswana about wish I cannot comment.  There are refugees from different countries there. It is a  threat that can surface at any moment.    Zimbabwe is even a more serious and open threat. Zimbabwe's  economic dependence on Mozambique might not please some  Zimbabweans. It is not a good situation for us. If Mugabe today  accepts that economic subordination and dependence, it is  because he has access to the sea. One day, any other party  might come to power in Zimbabwe and say that that dependence  should stop, and that it should control the access to the sea by  trying to integrate Mozambican territory into Zimbabwe.    Zambia also has its problems. Today it is a democratic  country. President Chiluba was democratically elected, but there  are corruption problems there, and the government has been  accused of not resolving the economic problems and of not  creating stability. As Zambia's neighbors, we ought to be  worried. As soldiers we are always on standby, and we ought to  be ready to defend ourselves against any dangerous situation and  instability.    With Tanzania we have historic problems, we have blood  ties. As you know, Mozambicans waged the independence war from  Tanzania. There are Mozambicans in that country. There are  people of mixed blood. Mozambicans have left children in  Tanzania, and today some are here and others are there. There  has always been a rapprochement. That is still the case today.  For instance, there are many Mozambicans who are entering  Nampula, Zambezia, and Niassa alleging that they are looking for  their parents because they were born in Tanzania during the war.  Because life is difficult, they need their parents.    It is problems like these that affect Mozambique. To date  politicians do not believe that the situation exists.    These are the aspects upon which I based myself when I said  that all of Mozambique's neighboring countries pose a threat to  us. There are other issues which I cannot disclose because of  their far- reaching and secret nature, and which we can only  deal with within the general staff of the FADM. I have just  referred to the tip of the iceberg.    [Jossias] Turning to the formation of the FADM. In your  opinion, who is responsible for the present delays?    [Ngonhamo] Well, that is a delicate situation. I have been  involved with the formation of the new army since the very  beginning and I feel that in fact there are delays in a number  of sectors. All sectors that affect the formation of the FADM  are linked to logistics. There are financial problems. I do  not know whether there is any authorized person in the Ministry  of Finance or in the FADM logistics. It is in those sectors  where we can find those responsible for the delays in the  formation of the army.    It is the Mozambican state that is responsible for the  finances and logistics of the FADM. With the support of other  countries, the responsibility of restoring training centers  rests on the shoulders of the state and the government. The  latest example about this slowness was the ship that was  supposed to carry the uniforms. It was a joke that so far has  not been explained.    We expected the ship on 15 March, but it only arrived on 12  April. It sailed from Portugal to South Africa where containers  were transferred to another ship. On its way to Maputo the ship  was rerouted to Beira. These are very difficult and complicated  situations that we cannot understand.    We in the CCFADMM [Joint Commission for the Formation of the  Mozambique Defense Armed Forces] suggested that the government  should use cargo aircraft to ferry at least part of the  consignment for the first battalions still to be trained, while  the remainder of the uniforms could be sent by ship to shorten  the delay. In fact, those problems are the responsibility of  the government and the government should shoulder them.    [Jossias] We know that during the training at Nyanga the  British instructors refused to let the national flag be raised.  Now the same situation has arisen at training centers in  Mozambique. What is the FADM Supreme Command's position about  this matter?    [Ngonhamo] Maybe people have not been properly informed. In  fact I would like to clarify what has happened or is happening.  We are the FADM and the Mozambican army. We recognize the flag  of the Republic of Mozambique. What happens is that there are  two flags in the country: the flag of the ruling Frelimo Party  and the state flag. We recognize the state flag that will be  raised at all barracks and at every FADM center, and even at our  command post, the Garden, the flag of the Republic of Mozambique  will be raised, except for the party flag because then it would  be necessary to get hold of the flags of the country's parties  and raise them at barracks and training centers. Actually, we  have been issuing military cards carrying the Republic of  Mozambique seal.    [Jossias] But was there such a problem at Nyanga or not?    [Ngonhamo] Well, that issue was not carefully studied and  clarified. The British and the Zimbabweans did not refuse to  have the flag. They were awaiting orders from Mozambique to  know whether they could raise the flag. There was no time in  view of the speed with which the program was implemented. The  course ended before we could address the situation. If for  instance a program involving the FADM is to be carried out in  any neighboring country, the Republic of Mozambique flag will be  raised without any problem.    [Jossias] The FADM salary plan has just been approved.  General, are you happy with the plan?    [Ngonhamo] I am happy and agree with the salary scale. I  took part in the discussions with the Frelimo government over  that issue. Moreover, the finance minister informed the sides  that 80 contos for a trooper was what the Mozambique Government  can afford right now. The government's capacity can only go that  far. I do not think there is any other alternative. I think  that the matter might not be closed because the new government  emerging from the elections will, at our request, analyze the  situation to see whether the soldiers' salaries can be increased  because their pay does not correspond to the current cost of  living. The metical has been devaluing all the time. The FADM  soldiers will accept those salaries, and we as commanders will  explain to them the reasons for their pay, as well as the  capacity of the Mozambique Government.    [Jossias] We are now going to ask you a personal question.  How do you differentiate Renamo's General Ngonhamo and FADM's  General Ngonhamo?    [Ngonhamo] Yes, there is indeed a difference. First, when I  was a Renamo general, I had my instructions and my beliefs were  different from those I now have as an FADM officer. Even the  uniforms and stripes were different. My views are apolitical at  this stage, and I am wearing an FADM uniform. The work I do is  no longer for the benefit of the party but, rather, for the  benefit of the people. I have nothing to do with any party.  Let them have their political clashes, let them have their  differences. My task at this juncture is to protect the  country's borders and guarantee security. I am a different man.  I have changed.    [Jossias] You have often come out publicly making political  statements that reflect Renamo's views. To what extent to do  such statements help the cause of national reconciliation?    [Ngonhamo] I can refute such allegations, which I regard as  unfounded and arising from the poor understanding shown by some  people, notably journalists with certain government newspapers.  I could ask any journalist to point out which sentences in my  statements he or she perceives to be of a political nature.  What is at stake here is not the political statements but,  rather, the underlying reasons for such statements. I am a  military officer, not a politician. I do not like to shove  problems under the carpet. I like to indicate clearly what the  problems are. The problem is that those people who are affected  by my statements then think they are political statements. Let  me cast a look back at the speech I made at the close of the  first training course. That speech caused controversy and even  SAVANA came out saying that it had been a political statement.  That is not true, though.    I said that we had very difficult work on our hands and that  we were facing financial problems which the government was very  slow to address. I also noted that that problem could affect  training, that our forces might not be operational prior to the  holding of elections, and that the government appears to develop  an allergy when money matters come up. This is something that I  would like to reiterate even now, because it is the truth.    I am very happy with the cooperation of Frelimo officers  helping us train the army. They are good and they cooperate in  everything as long as money is not involved. When money matters  come up, something gives and they do not cooperate. They want  to use the country's money as though it were a favor or a gift  and that is no way to go about it. We have experienced that  problem even within the supreme command. I have discussed this  matter with Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo and we are having  problems. The statements made by the Joint Commission for the  Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, CCFADM, at our  meetings do not correspond with the reality on the ground.  Despite the fact that our office at the Garden has nothing  inside, the government team to the CCFADM has already publicly  stated that conditions are in place for people to work. That is  a lie. That place has no conditions and people cannot work  there. That is a money-related problem.    We, for instance, are senior commanding officers but we have  no houses. We have no cars, but they say that cars have already  been ordered. I have already had talks with the government team  and told them that there is no need to wait for vehicles to be  ordered from France or wherever else. You can buy vehicles here  in Maputo or in South Africa. So that our work can get off the  ground, let us start working with these vehicles and then we can  also use the other vehicles that are supposed to be coming from  France.    For example, I have said in this interview today that the  government must carry the blame for delays in the training of  the new army. Many people will see that statement as a  political one. Yet, it is not. When I said that all the present  government can pay soldiers is 80 contos per month and that we  will take up this matter with the new government that emerges  from elections, many people will have interpreted it as a  political statement. Yet, I was saying the truth. That is the  situation. This government says it cannot give more and we are  going to work with the next government in a bid to secure better  conditions for our soldiers. This is the reality, pure and  simple.    [Jossias] Will you remain head of the Renamo team to the  CCFADM or is that position incompatible with your new duties?    [Ngonhamo] For working reasons, that matter is being looked  at within Renamo. Because there is a lot of work to be done,  the joint commission needs to make many trips to various parts  of the country. The new army led by us also has an office and a  general staff. We are always having to respond to reports and  messages about the deployment of troops. Now, we are going to  have the first battalion of special forces and it winds up its  training within the next two weeks. That involves a lot of work  and it requires separation so that a new work routine can be  created in this new area. It is an issue that is being  analyzed. Furthermore, it does not look very good if the same  person is a colored on one hand and a black on the other.  [sentence as printed] A person should have one race only.    [Jossias] You do agree, though, that this is one issue that  must definitely be clarified?    [Ngonhamo] Of course I agree, and it will be clarified as  soon as possible.    [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: you are working with two generals  who used to be your enemies. I would like to know how you  relate to them and with whom you feel more at ease.    [Ngonhamo] I feel at ease with both. I also feel at ease  with all those generals who are not involved in these  commissions or in carrying out these tasks. When I work with  them, I am working with Mozambicans. Obviously, some present  wrong ideas, but that is not a serious problem because I have  managed to analyze things calmly. One can communicate with me,  and there is really no problem. What is more, there is no  reason for separation from the Frelimo generals because, to my  mind, we were separated during the war and now we are together.  If we are on an equal footing with them today, it is because  work has been done to achieve it.    [Jossias] In an interview he granted this newspaper  recently,  General Mabote said that the war waged by Renamo was not a  guerrilla war but, rather, pure terrorism. Given that you were  one of Renamo's principal strategists, how do view the war waged  by your movement?    [Ngonhamo] I did read the interview granted by Gen.  Sebastiao  Mabote. First, Mr. Mabote said that in this country there had  been only one guerrilla war for independence and that what had  followed had been terrorism. He thereby clearly suggested that  Renamo had been responsible for the terrorism. Second, he  implied that there is no general more intelligent than he within  Frelimo, his party.    I do not believe that he was too aware of what he was  saying,  or perhaps he said it for some particular reason. What he said  was not true because ours was not a terrorist war. Had it been  so, it would not have received so much support from the people.  A terrorist cannot administer a territory. A terrorist cannot  change the situation within a country, or the traditional  symbols of government.    I do confirm that vehicles were burned and that people were  killed during the war. Responsibility for those deaths must not  be laid at Renamo's door. Obviously, we have to admit that  Renamo bullets did claim innocent lives during the war. Gen.  Mabote said that Renamo killed civilians. He also said he had  been trained in Soviet academies and suggested he was very  intelligent. I can only regret that the Soviets should have  trained him poorly.    First, one thing I know as a soldier is that barbed wire  should be used to fence in any military barracks. Those were  not the instructions given by Gen. Mabote concerning Popular  Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, FPLM, barracks. There,  he used people as human shields around the barracks and those  people were caught in the fire and killed when there were  attacks. It was not Renamo that put people around its barracks.  Those were orders issued by Frelimo and by Gen. Mabote, who was  the FPLM's chief of the General Staff.    As for Mr. Mabote's comments about burned vehicles, I would  like the Mozambican people to answer that charge. Frelimo  forcibly took vehicles from their owners to put them in convoys  to carry Frelimo war materiel and soldiers so they could launch  military offensives against Renamo. Obviously, vehicles that  were part of convoys were ambushed and burned. There are  Mozambicans who are still claiming compensation for those  losses. It was not Renamo that commandeered those vehicles for  its military convoys.    Third, Frelimo soldiers forced civilians to join their  military convoys. They used to say that it was for security  purposes, so they could travel between Beira and Machipanda,  from Maputo to Beira, or from Maputo to Namaacha, Ressano  Garcia, and Ponta do Ouro. Those vehicles were ambushed and  after a few shots the soldiers would flee and the civilians were  left to die. It was not Renamo that did that. Civilians who  misbehaved and went about on their own were punished and  detained. Those actions were the fruit of Gen. Mabote's  intelligence, who was the FPLM's chief of the General Staff. I  do think that he had some special motive for saying those things.    [Jossias] As commander of the new army, do you think that  Gen. Mabote would be fit to serve in the new army now being  formed?    [Ngonhamo] All people are welcome and can serve in the FADM  forces. Whether or not they have experience or ability, we are  going to train them. There will be no problem about that.    [Jossias] He also said that the young generals should  refrain from making political statements. Do you agree with him?    [Ngonhamo] I agree with him, but unfortunately he  contradicts  himself in that interview. First, when he compares guerrilla  warfare and terrorism, his idea promptly loses validity. He has  gone so far as to say that generals who make political  statements are illiterate. In saying so, he is making a  political, rather than a military, statement. If, however, he  was serious when he said that, then we are in agreement, because  our view is that soldiers should not make political statements  because they are not politicians.    Obviously, there are statements which, by virtue of our  work,  end up as political statements, even though that is not our  intention. We must defend our work, our interests with the  politicians. We are handicapped and we need the collaboration  of politicians to be able to walk. We must report the problems  and difficulties we come up against when we deal with  politicians, but when we do so they think we are fighting them.    We can suppose that the Frelimo government will lose the  upcoming elections and a new government will be elected. I can  guarantee you that the new government will come in for the same  treatment from us. That is how it has to be. We are going to  apply pressure on the government to always seek to improve the  conditions of the military. This is why I have said we will be  touching again on this matter of salaries with the new  government. If Frelimo wins, then we will have new meetings to  try to negotiate the salaries of military personnel. That is  not a matter of making politics but, rather, of working with  politicians.    [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo: do you think it will be possible to  create a regional army in which the FADM forces will take part?    [Ngonhamo] The situation in southern Africa does not suggest  that any conditions are in place for the existence of a force of  that kind. My belief is that such a force will be possible at a  later stage, when there is greater stability and a more  thoughtful approach to things. I cannot limit the development  of such things. At this juncture, such a proposition is  difficult because the situation in our region is not  particularly good and all countries are full of problems. What  is more, those are political problems that affect even the  soldiers. However, such a plan will be possible if democracies  are allowed to grow more solid and if there is lasting peace.  At this point, there is mistrust even among countries, which  makes the implementation of such a plan very difficult.    [Jossias] Kindly tell us whether work is under way to  reintegrate Renamo's generals into the new army.    [Ngonhamo] Yes, that work is under way. There are positions  in the new army, and we are going to share those positions.  There are areas where half of the men will be former government  army officers and the other half will be made up of former  Renamo officers. They come together and that is what is called  a unified army. The fact that positions are being divided must  not be viewed as divisions along party lines. That was the way  we found to integrate soldiers in the new army. From the  infantry up to the special forces, half of the men will come  from the government and the other half from Renamo.    [Jossias] Very little is known about you. Who is, in fact,  Gen. Ngonhamo?    [Ngonhamo] My name is Mateus Ngonhamo. I was born on 15  August 1963, and I shall be turning 31 this year. I am still  unmarried, but I dating someone and I hope to marry. I come  from a family of traditional rulers, and my father is a bishop  with the Zionist Church.    I was born in the area of Dombe, in Manica Province's  Sussundenga District. My first schooling was at the Catholic  mission in Dombe. That was where I completed my primary  schooling, with the help of the nuns. Then I moved to Chimoio,  where I did the first two years of secondary school, after which  I joined the Agrarian Institute, where I did the second year of  the agriculture course. In 1978, I left school and joined  Renamo.    [Jossias] Why did you leave school?    [Ngonhamo] I made that decision because of a problem  connected with my studies. My name came up on a list saying  that I should conclude my course in Cuba, in the company of  other colleagues, my cousins included. We accepted that because  we knew this was a matter of responding to the country's needs.    However, I could not help asking myself one question: Those  names came up on one day, I was supposed to have my medical  check-up the next day, and the following day we would all be  leaving for Cuba. I wanted to say goodbye to my parents, who  lived some 300 or 400 km from Chimoio. I could not leave  without telling my parents where I was going. It was not  possible. There were others who felt like me, who could not go  without saying farewell to their relatives. It would not be a  good thing to leave without saying anything to the family.  There were eight of us who felt that way, and we did not go to  Cuba on the date that had been set.    We stayed and the situation became very difficult. There  were witch hunts, various problems, and there was the risk that  we might be expelled from the institute. We were reactionaries  and we lacked discipline. I told my father that I did not want  to study any more. I wanted to leave my studies and get back  home to make a decision.    I went to my village and explained everything to my father.  I told him that I was leaving and that I might come around some  day. I had already been in contact with Renamo men, even at that  stage. I asked them to come to my house so my father could see  and believe that I would be joining them. They arrived there in  the morning and I introduced them to my father. We prepared  breakfast for them and then we left for the jungle.    When I went there, I trained as a soldier, like the others  did. After undergoing training, I received a weapon and I  started working as a Renamo private. I did a course as section  chief, after which I did another to become platoon commander.  That was the organization we had in our guerrilla army.    On 15 September 1981, Renamo made me a one-star general and  I  started working in various provinces. I worked in Inhambane,  Manica, Sofala, Tete, Zambezia, and Nampula. After completing  another course in 1986, I was promoted to two-star general.    I worked on various fronts. I went to Niassa and Nampula,  and I became a lieutenant general in 1990. Then I came to the  Southern Front and worked here as Southern Front commander and  coordinator. I was commander for Maputo, Inhambane, and Gaza  Provinces.    When the General Peace Accord was about to be signed, I  returned to Maringue and stayed there until I was appointed head  of the Renamo team to the CCFADM.    [Jossias] What is your area of expertise, after failing in  your agricultural studies?    [Ngonhamo] I have specialized in infantry, light and heavy  artillery, and military intelligence.    [Jossias] Is military intelligence counterintelligence?    [Ngonhamo] No. Military intelligence is not  counterintelligence. I have also specialized as a military  cadres instructor. Those were various duties I had to fulfill  during the war.    [Jossias] Did you go about on foot in the provinces you have  mentioned?    [Ngonhamo] That is right. We did not have vehicles. I  remember quite well that in 1982 I went on foot from Mabote (in  Inhambane Province) to Gorongosa. It was a long march that took  us 94 days. I have also traveled on foot both ways bet?een  Gorongosa and Zambezia, and Nampula and Niassa.    When I left Gorongosa now, I went to Chibuto on foot. It was  always like that. We had no transportation.    [Jossias] Gen. Ngonhamo, did you never undergo military  training outside the country?    [Ngonhamo] Well, I have been abroad on several occasions to  do some courses, but most of my training was done inside the  country. I have been to South Africa. In 1984, I was with the  Renamo team that tried to negotiate an accord with Frelimo.    [Jossias] Why did that accord fail?    [Ngonhamo] It failed because Frelimo's knowledge about  Renamo was very scant. Samora Machel did not know Renamo well  and was always given wrong information. That is yet another  thing I would like to say about Gen. Mabote. He misled  President Samora Machel a great deal. He always gave him the  wrong information, even about the military situation, and he  knew little about Renamo.    Samora always believed that Renamo would end with the  signing  of the Nkomati Accord. He thought that Renamo survived thanks  to South African support. That was far from correct: Renamo  did not die out with the Nkomati Accord. In fact, it increased  its operations. Samora was also misled when he was told that it  was no solution to negotiate with Renamo because Renamo lacked  intelligence and that it had neither politicians nor military  figures. That was what prompted Samora to outline the program  of the talks to get Renamo to integrate into Frelimo, to offer  an amnesty to Renamo. That was no good.    Jacinto Veloso headed the Frelimo team to the talks. That  team included [Member of Parliament] Sergio Vieira; [Labor  Minister] Hunguana; [former adviser to Samora Machel] Fernando  Honwana; Hama Thai, who is now the Mozambique Armed Forces chief  of General Staff, but who was in the Air Force at the time; and  others.    Their only message was amnesty. They had no alternative in  their baggage. So we told them: "We are the ones who should be  granting you amnesty, not the other way around." So, the talks  flopped and we continued with the war.    When we went to Rome, Frelimo already an idea about what the  talks should focus on. There was negotiation in Rome. There  were ploys, but they no longer viewed the matter as they had  done in 1984.    [Jossias] One could say that you became a general when you  were still very young.    [Ngonhamo] Yes, but I think that was due to my military  skills. Perhaps I was a good soldier.</p>

In the newscast we will show the part that refers to  the massacre in Sarajevo [5 February] and Russia's  interpretation of NATO's decision. The interview will be shown  in full in the Svet Danas program today.    [Begin Churkin recording, in Russian with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that it is almost certain  that this was not done by the Serbs, because, as a rule, if this  were the Serbs, the experts who were investigating this case  would have quickly come up with such conclusions.    It is necessary to demilitarize the area around Sarajevo. We  envisage this as a two-way operation that does not apply to the  Serbs alone, but also to the Muslims. Therefore, I think the  international community will understand that not only this  bloody wound of Sarajevo would begin to heal, but, in our view,  better conditions would be created for a better political  solution.    Therefore, the events that should happen in Sarajevo, its  demilitarization, are in the interest of both the Serbs  themselves and those who favor a political solution.</p>

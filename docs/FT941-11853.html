			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Better part of valour: Nato should discriminate between central Europe and central Asia Three weeks ago in Brussels the leaders of the Atlantic alliance de-clared that they 'expect and would welcome Nato expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east as part of an evolutionary process'. But they neither set a timetable nor named any potential new members. Instead the alliance, like some belle dame of Arthurian legend, invited her suitors to enrol in a new order of knights, to be called 'Partnership for Peace' (PFP), and to prove themselves by deeds of valour and chivalry. Each knightmust propose exploits of his own choosing for the alliance's approval. Some knights will offer to host grand tournaments, or 'exercises', on their ancestral lands. Others will send young squires to ride behind Nato's seasoned champions and receive instruction in knightly conduct. Others, from the far north, will show off their prowess in peacekeeping. And some will redesign their crossbows and lances to meet Nato specifications. (Those who offer to re-equip Nato's own arsenals at low cost, however, may meet a rather cool reception.) Which of these exploits, if any, will win the lady's fair hand? She is not saying. In the best traditions of romance, the knight must be sustained in his ordeal by blind devotion to his chosen damsel, not by any certainty of reward. At first sight, the new Partnership is but the old NACC (North Atlantic Co-operation Council) writ large. One anomaly has been removed, in that PFP is open to formerly neutral and non-aligned European countries as well as to Nato's former adversaries. Otherwise it is hard to see what can be done under the new heading that could not have been done under the old. PFP, for all the grand rhetoric it has been wrapped in, is transparently a device for gaining time, for postponing invidious choices. No doubt it is true that would-be Nato members in central Europe are not yet 'ready' for membership. That is, their forces are not equipped or trained for service in the integrated Nato command. The political and strategic implications of stationing allied forces on their territory have not been fully considered. Their democracy may be in some respects imperfect and fragile. Some of them have unresolved minority problems, which may render them vulnerable to subversion or embroil them in conflict with their neighbours. But to suggest that all those problems have to be resolved before a political decision about membership can be taken is to rewrite the history of Nato itself. Few if any of the present members would have qualified by those standards in 1949. The l eaders of that time, infused with a stronger sense of urgency and purpose than their successors today, took the political decision first. They resolved, in theNorth Atlantic Treaty, 'to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security'. They agreed that an armed attack against one of their countries should be considered an attack against them all, and that if such an attack occurred each of them would assist the party attacked 'bytaking . . . such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force'. Only later did they take specific military measures, including the creation of the integrated command, to deal with what they saw as a specific military threat. The treaty provided a framework within which to do that. Similarly if Nato were expanded now there would be time for its members, old and new, to sit down together and make a cool, rational assessment of the threats theyface, and to devise an effective strategy for countering those threats. The newmembers would no longer suspect the old ones of minimising the threat in order to avoid taking on new commitments; and the old members would no longer suspect the new ones of maximising it in order to bounce them into a guarantee, since they would already have given one. The only serious argument against admitting new members to Nato now is the one given by US President Bill Clinton in Brussels on January 9. It would be wrong, he said, 'to draw a new line between east and west that could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation'. While it might be comforting for those included, it would increase thesense of isolation or alienation among those excluded. This applies not only toRussia, but perhaps even more forcefully to other ex-Soviet republics, which would see themselves thereby consigned to a de facto Russian sphere of influence. Ukraine in particular, while sharing the strong sense of insecurity that makes its western neighbours clamour for Nato membership, is quite explicit about its hopes that they will not succeed, since it knows it has virtually no chance of following suit. Certainly 'drawing a line' should not mean renouncing allinterest in the area beyond it. The principles of the UN charter would still apply, and no one should imagine that acts of aggression against other ex-Soviet republics by Russia, or any other power, would not have very serious consequencesfor that power's relations with the west. But western determination to defend the new-won freedom of central Europe should be of a different order. The countries of central Europe have already been identified, by last year's Copenhagen summit, as future members of the European Union. It should be clear that those countries are now part of the west, and that Russia will never again be allowed to turn them into satellites against their will, no matter how future relations between Russia and the west turn out.</p>

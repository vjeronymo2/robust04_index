			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPARE FOR BARE-ROOT ROSE PLANTING SEASON  </P> <P> New bare-root roses will be out in another month, so start preparing now.  </P> <P> If this is your first try at roses, select a sunny spot with enough room for  several bushes. The impact of beautiful roses is even more dramatic when  planted in mass.  </P> <P> If you already have roses, you might want to remove old bushes that are worn  out. Generous spacing between the plants will aid air circulation. Proper  spacing depends on the growth habit and climate. Consult a California Certified  Nurseryman at your local garden center. Get the soil ready by working in  liberal amounts of organic matter and fertilizer.  </P></p>

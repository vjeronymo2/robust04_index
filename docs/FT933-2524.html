			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Two senators in trouble not to run for re-election US PARTY managers are relieved at the decisions of Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican, and Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, not to seek re-election next year. Each man won 56 per cent support in his last election, in 1988, but both have been tainted by financial scandal. They were likely to be challenged in their own parties and neither was given much chance for next November. These early retirements are causing analysts to rethink their calculations on the prospects for both parties in 1994. The Democratic majority in the Senate is 56:44. Of the 34 senators whose terms are to expire in January 1995, 21 are Democrats and only 13 Republicans, giving the opposition a sporting chance of winning back control of the Senate, lost in 1986. Besides Mr Durenberger, two other Republican senators have announced their intention to retire: Mr Jack Danforth of Missouri, whose seat is thought likely to go to former Governor John Ashcroft, and Mr Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, whose departure clears the way for Mr Dick Cheney, President George Bush's defence secretary, or Mrs Lynne Cheney, his wife, to return to Washington. On the Democratic side, Mr Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio is retiring, opening a race expected to be fierce.</p>

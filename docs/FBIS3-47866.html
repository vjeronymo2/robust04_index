			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan and the United States are in a deadlock over  the framework trade talks. Although it has been customary for  bilateral negotiations to remain entangled up to the eleventh  hour in the past, virtually no progress has been made this time  between the two nations ever since they agreed on the basic  framework of the trade talks last July. Settlement must be made  in talks on four individual trade sectors -- automobiles and  auto parts, government procurement of telecommunications  equipment, government procurement of medical equipment, and  insurance services -- before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit  meeting, but the Japanese and U.S. Governments remain at odds at  the very outset. The trade talks seem to have entered a tunnel  with no light visible on the other end yet, due to the  cumulative effects of such factors as the differences in trade  policies between the two nations, accumulated mutual distrust,  and the stagnant Japanese economy.  <H5>  "Numerical Targets" Have Become Barrier </H5>   "The United States and Japan see the world differently."  Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for international economic  affairs at the U.S. Commerce Department, made this comment to  describe the extent of the bilateral trade dispute. He visited  Japan last week to talk with Japanese officials on automobiles  and auto parts.    The "argument over numerical targets" has been the greatest  barrier to talks over the four individual trade sectors. The  United States has asserted that "although we do not ask that  Japan guarantee a certain share of its market to foreign  products, it is necessary to set up a criteria to determine  whether progress has been made in market opening." On the other  hand, Japan has objected that "nothing that will be linked to  setting numerical targets would be accepted in any form  whatsoever."    The United States has complained that "the Japanese  Government has distorted U.S. assertions." However, it is  certain that at the current trade negotiations, the  administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, which advocates a  results-oriented policy as a pillar of U.S. diplomacy toward  Japan, has stressed the need to reach "an agreement that will  lead to concrete results." In response to criticism that this  would lead to "managed trade," the United States argues that  "what is necessary to open up the Japanese market, which is by  far the most closed among the major industrialized nations, is  not managed trade, but rather a policy to crush managed trade."  <H5>  Arguing Over Past Cases </H5>   It is widely believed that when the Clinton administration  hammered out the new framework trade talks last year, it  designed it taking into consideration the bilateral  semiconductor agreement and the action program on auto parts.  The semiconductor agreement encompassed the "hopes" of U.S.  industrial circles which expected that "foreign semiconductor  makers should gain a 20-percent share of the Japanese market by  the end of 1992." The action program which was put together  during former U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in  early 1992 called for "voluntary target goals" on the part of  Japanese automakers who vowed "to increase procurement of U.S.  auto parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994."    A high-ranking U.S. Government official has said: "Since  target goals were achieved in accordance with the semiconductor  agreement, it was possible to avoid a further worsening of trade  friction between the United States and Japan. This should have  been to the advantage of Japan, too. We wonder why the Japanese  are now taking such an inflexible attitude."    Concerning the two precedents, however, a Japanese  negotiator, taking a completely opposite view, has referred to  them as having taught Japan a lesson, saying: "We yielded under  U.S. pressure, ending up with a price to pay in the future."  With the collapse of the cold war structure and the successful  conclusion of GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks  (Uruguay Round), Japan has taken the opportunity to try to shift  its trade policy from a completely U.S.-oriented approach to  that focusing on GATT. A senior official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] has said agitatedly:  "The European Union (EU) and Asian nations are paying much  attention to how Japan handles the trade issues with the United  States. We must not make inadvertent concessions here."    Mutual distrust between Japanese and the U.S. Government  officials in charge of the trade talks has been another factor  causing the negotiations to be stalled. Joan E. Spero, U.S.  under secretary of state for economic, business, and  agricultural affairs, who visited Japan last week apart from  Under Secretary of Commerce Garten, complained: "Japanese  bureaucrats specialize on defense, judo style. They are trying  to keep dragging on the talks." The United States has begun to  suspect that Japanese Government ministries and agencies are  trying to put off negotiations on market access itself by taking  advantage of the dispute over numerical targets.    In response, Japan has irately retorted: "U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor and other U.S. officials have  started to refer to Japanese automakers' voluntary target goals  of purchasing $19 billion worth of U.S. auto parts as a  `Japanese pledge.' There can be no negotiations if they intend  to push through with such an inconsiderate interpretation."  <H5>  Narrowing of Competitiveness Has Impact </H5>   Concerning automobiles and auto parts, the narrowing of  competitiveness between Japanese and U.S. makers has also cast a  shadow on the trade talks.    So far, the Japan-U.S. automobile friction has been settled  under a formula where "the strong Japanese industry has given  due consideration to the ailing U.S. industry." The voluntary  export restraint regarding passenger vehicles that has been  continued since 1981 is a classic example. Osamu Watanabe,  chief of MITI's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau,  reflects that the action program under which Japan vowed to  purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts was "a product of  affluence."    Now, however, the Japanese automobile industry cannot afford  to carry out such plans. Sluggish domestic demand and steady  yen appreciation have caused automakers' profits to decline  considerably. Since U.S. automakers have successfully improved  the quality of their products, the gap in competitiveness  between Japanese and U.S. automakers is rapidly narrowing. In  contrast to the Japanese automobile industry, the U.S.  automobile industry has rapidly reaped profits, supported by a  recovering domestic economy. The U.S. "Big Three" automakers  recorded a total profit of $4.7 billion in the period from  January to September 1993.    As a result, there is strong dissatisfaction in some  quarters  of MITI, which is in charge of the trade talks, complaining that  "the U.S. Government has not accurately grasped the current  situation concerning the automobile industries of both nations."    Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then prime minister, unfolded his  critical argument against managed trade during talks with  President Clinton last April. With this as a starting point,  Japan has been determined more than ever to "assert itself"  since the outset of negotiations on the basic framework of new  trade talks. The agreement made during the Japan-U.S. summit  meeting last July was ambiguous, and all it did was to put off  the problems. In that sense, Japan and the United States have  been continuously at odds for nine months already.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (2): A middle-class gap - The former Soviet empire has inherited an outmoded feudal system which is proving a difficult starting point for a modern, free-enterprise economy / The Communist Legacy NO ECONOMIST has described the problem of converting communist societies to capitalism better than Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president. 'It is like trying to make a fish out of fish soup,' he once observed. But that is the kind of inchoate broth that the peoples of the former Soviet empire inherited from decades of an all too successful experiment in Stalinist social engineering. For most of the 20th Century the Soviet world was sealed off from the rapid technological change which created unprecedented wealth and transformed the social and institutional structures of capitalist societies. Instead of an expanding, self-confident, property-owning middle class, the Soviet model re-created outmoded feudal relationships. At the heart of the economic problems confronting the new post-communist governments is the lack of a middle class and the economic and other institutions and attitudes connected with it. The all-powerful party state was served by varying ranks of propertyless state serfs. Instead of a naturally evolving middle class, the Soviet system left behind the nomenklatura. This party-selected, and therefore dependent, elite managed the system and ran the militarised command economy. In the name of the party its servants eliminated or subverted pre-existing political, civil, religious and economic institutions, perverting memory and re-writing history as they did so. It is hardly surprising under these unpromising circumstances that the task of building capitalism is proving more complicated than those who had little previous awareness of communist regimes thought, especially in the first flush of enthusiasm which accompanied the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet state. The surprise is the extent of transformation already achieved in central Europe, where the Soviet system was in place for only 45 years, and the determination with which market reformers are pressing ahead, in spite of growing opposition from the old managerial and other elites, in Russia and other Soviet republics where even the memory of capitalism had been largely eliminated. The problems caused by the lack of a middle and entrepreneurial class help to explain why privatisation is at the heart of macro-economic strategies throughout the former Soviet empire. The crucial sub-text of this mechanism to transfer ownership from an amorphous state to private individuals and companies, or foreign investors, is the consequent creation of an entrepreneurial and proprietorial class with a stake in stability, and a willingness to take decisions and bear responsibility. Given the virtual absence of private capital, and the destruction of savings through hyper-inflation, the privatisation process has perforce been unconventional and imaginative. It is not easy to build capitalism without capital. Hence the introduction of unprecedented coupon mass-privatisation schemes pioneered by Czechoslovakia and Poland and watched with intense interest by others, especially Russia and other newly-independent ex-Soviet republics. The pacemakers of reform are the central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland which were relatively developed capitalist societies in the inter-war period. They all have association agreements with the European Community and are striving to fulfil the requirements for full-fledged EC entry by the turn of the century. Czechoslovakia was on a par with Germany before the war, while Poland managed to retain most of its agriculture in private hands and thus kept a large, albeit disadvantaged, capitalist sector alive throughout the communist period. Individual Poles also became black market traders on a large scale and this entrepreneurial talent helped Poland to privatise the former lumbering state distribution system with extraordinary speed after the communist regime collapsed. The most difficult task of re-education is faced by the newly-independent former Soviet states. They were all part of an authoritarian, centralised empire before they became involuntary 'builders of socialism' for over seven decades. Some, like Ukraine or Belarus, are having to build an independent state for the first time. Others, like Georgia and Armenia, are resuscitating ancient kingdoms submerged for centuries. This state-building process is taking place in parallel with the reconstruction of economic ties on a market-orientated basis. It has to cope with the distortions left behind by the artificial, politically motivated integration of the former all-Union economy. The penchant for building giant plants capable of supplying the entire Soviet market from one or two factories, and receiving their inputs from similar plants elsewhere in this far-flung empire, has made all the new states dangerously vulnerable to supply disruptions. Throughout this huge area extending over half of Europe and half of Asia fledgling businessmen and politicians are having to learn basic economic concepts such as private property, the law of supply and demand, marginal utility, rent, cost and profit and amortisation. Fundamental capitalist institutions such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, building societies, accountancy firms, advertising and marketing companies existed only in a primitive form, if at all, and are having to be created from the ground up. The unprecedented scale of the task is such that most of the effort and the resources will have to come from those involved. Capital and know-how injections are only forthcoming on a large scale in the specific and untypical German case. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the specially created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), have all made revealing studies and geared up to give modest financial backing and technical support in key sectors. But the main objective of the new regimes is to attract foreign equity investment from companies prepared to inject their managerial skills and integrate their new subsidiaries into their existing international operations. Until now little more than Dollars 5bn of equity capital has been invested in the entire region since the old system collapsed in 1989, a tiny fraction of the overall capital flows into south-east Asia or Latin America. But this is only the beginning of a long process of development which will fundamentally condition the shape of the 21st Century global economy.</p>

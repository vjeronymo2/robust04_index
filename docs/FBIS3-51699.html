The move took cabinet ministers by surprise and left Premier  Sir John Swan not only with a vacant cabinet post, but without a  government leader in the Senate (upper house), where Senator  Winfield had steered the government agenda since 1992.    But a cabinet shuffle is unlikely, political sources say.    Environment Minister Gerald Simons is the logical choice as  government leader in the Senate, while Senator Grant Gibbons is  a strong bet to join the cabinet, possibly as minister of  technology, the sources report.    The management portfolio would either be assumed by the new  minister or handed to an existing minister.    An announcement from the premier is expected within days.    While giving up his other posts, Senator Winfield 40, will  keep the seat he has held in the upper house since 1987.    Having managed successful United Bermuda Party campaigns in  1983, 1985 and 1989, he is also expected to remain one of Sir  John's political advisers.    "It's one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made,"  Senator Winfield said of his resignation, which was discussed  with the premier on Monday and submitted when cabinet met this  week.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Concern over French recession puts franc under pressure THE FRENCH franc came under heavy selling pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday amid growing concern about the depth of the French recession and renewed investor confidence in the D-Mark. The franc fell sharply against the German currency, dropping nearly 2 centimes at one stage, after the country's official statistics agency issued a gloomy forecast for French economic growth this year. It finished the day in London at FFr3.395 against the D-Mark, but slipped further in late trading in New York to FFr3.3979. The Bank of France did not intervene in the foreign exchange markets to support the currency. But dealers said that France's membership of the ERM was undermining its ability to bring interest rates down to levels that would stimulate an economic recovery. Some analysts said that, as a result of this, the currency was on the verge of more turbulence in the ERM. The trigger for yesterday's selling of the French currency was a report from Insee, the official statistics agency, which forecast that gross domestic product would fall by 0.7 per cent this year and that the unemployment rate would rise from 11.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent by December. These were gloomier than government predictions earlier this month which forecast a 0.4 per cent contraction in GDP in 1993. At the same time, French political leaders appeared to voice concern that the country could not lower interest rates to stimulate an economic recovery because of the country's membership of the ERM and the need to shadow German monetary policy. Market analysts also said that the franc had been unsettled by comments by Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. Mr Juppe, attending the summit of the G7 industrialised nations, said yesterday that France and Germany 'can go further in lowering interest rates'. France has been able to push its money market rates more than  1/2 a percentage point below German levels in recent months. But the Bank of France's cut in interest rates last week, immediately after the Bundesbank eased monetary policy, was deemed too hasty by some investors. Currencies, Page 31</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW POWER OF TV ADVERTISERS;  </P> <P> THE INCREASING CLOUT OF SPONSORS HAS BEEN SEEN MORE AND MORE THIS SEASON AS  'OBJECTIONABLE' SHOWS MAKE SOME HIT LISTS  </P> <P> When Dave Boylan received an elaborately wrapped package in his mail last  December, he assumed that one of his business associates had sent him a  Christmas present. As vice president and general manager of the ABC-affiliated  television station serving Winston-Salem, N.C., Boylan often receives small  gifts from the companies selling him the syndicated programs that WGHP-TV airs,  such as "Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" and "House Party."  </P> <P> "What I expected to be a box of candy was in fact a videotape from Geraldo  Rivera," recalls Boylan, whose station airs the controversial talk show host's  "Geraldo" every weekday at 10 a.m. "It was essentially Geraldo's statement that  he realized he had probably created topics last November that were too hot and  too exploitable, and that he would seek a different course."  </P> <P> At issue was a monthlong series of shows on topless doughnut shop operators,  battered lesbians and similar topics. Calculated to boost Rivera's audience  during a key ratings sweeps period, the sex-themed programs backfired badly:  Not only did they prompt complaints from outraged viewers and nervous station  managers, but they also caused several major advertisers to move "Geraldo" to  the top of their so-called hit lists -- internal rankings of "objectionable"  shows in which companies do not want their commercials to appear.  </P> <P> These hit lists have begun to shape today's syndicated TV programming and, to a  lesser extent, prime-time network fare.  </P> <P> Rivera's aggressive, winter-long battle against defections by sponsors,  stations and viewers is symptomatic of an acute sensitivity to controversial  content this season that has already contributed to the cancellation of some TV  shows and the overhaul of others. Changes implemented over the last several  months by the producers of "Geraldo" and other reality-based series have helped  assure their survival for at least another season, but other syndicators have  abandoned the genre altogether in favor of more advertiser-friendly game shows,  situation comedies and talk programs.  </P> <P> "I've been selling national TV advertising for 10 years and right now there is  significantly more sensitivity to programing on the part of clients and their  ad agencies than I've ever seen," observes Clark Morehouse, the executive  spearheading the "Geraldo" makeover for Tribune Entertainment Co., the show's  Chicago-based distributor.  </P> <P> Advertiser hit lists are nothing new. Since the inception of television,  sponsors have maintained "don't buy" policies involving programs with which,  for a wide variety of reasons, they want nothing to do.  </P> <P> Often the reasons are entirely benign. "Campbell's wouldn't want an ad for its  tomato soup to air after a bloody stabbing," points out Stephen Battaglio,  associate editor of Adweek magazine. "No advertiser wants its spot to run next  to material that might tarnish the image of its product."  </P> <P> Today's hit lists, however, have swollen to include some of TV's highest-rated  syndicated series and several popular network shows, including  "thirtysomething," "China Beach" and "Dallas." These programs are being  rejected as much for their themes, style and tone as for specific  product-related content.  </P> <P> While there is no unanimous opinion on why advertisers have become so wary of  potentially offensive programming, industry executives interviewed by The Times  suggest that sponsors have been sensitized by a combination of events and  circumstances. Some say today's soft economy and cluttered media environment  have prompted companies to seek wholesome product images that will be  acceptable to a wider spectrum of viewers and, theoretically, yield more sales.  Others feel advertisers are simply trying to avoid the unwanted publicity that  came their way amid last year's debates over the propriety of "Married . . .  With Children," "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," "Favorite Son" and other  boundary-pushing shows.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt that (society) has been in a more conservative mode since the  late '70s," says Marc Feidelson, senior vice president and media director for  Dailey &amp; Associates, a Los Angeles ad agency. As a result, he says, "things  that are sensationalistic get put on a hit list."  </P> <P> The nation's conservatism has fueled the campaigns of self-appointed TV  watchdogs, many of whom are now directing publicity campaigns and economic  boycotts against advertisers who appear on shows they consider excessively  violent, sexual, profane or "un-Christian."  </P> <P> "I am very much against the Don Wildmons and Terry Rakoltas of the world,"  declares Chuck Bachrach, senior vice president of Western International Media,  in a reference to the most prominent advocates of tamer programming. "But big  advertisers are so afraid of their letter-writing campaigns that they sometimes  don't think it's worth the effort to fight (such activists), even if there is a  big rating at stake."  </P> <P> What bothers one advertiser may not concern another, however, and most shows  are able to find replacements when a would-be sponsor backs away -- provided  they aren't on too many hit lists and have decent ratings.  </P> <P> Still, this season, more than any in recent memory, audience size often seemed  irrelevant to a sponsor's pull-out decision. "A Current Affair," for example,  turned up at the head of a hit list prepared by the New York-based consulting  firm Telerep and published last February in the trade weekly Electronic Media.  Although the tabloid series is among the most-watched syndicated shows in  America, "A Current Affair" was being "resisted" by 94 potential sponsors on  the Telerep list.  </P> <P> Telerep President Steve Herson confirmed authenticity of the document in  published reports but did not return telephone calls from The Times asking  about its preparation. Herson told Electronic Media that the list, which he  referred to as an internal document to help the company's sales force, was  compiled by polling buyers of national TV ad time and cross-checking their  responses with Broadcast Advertising Reports, a statistical index of commercial  usage.  </P> <P> Distributed to Telerep clients in January, the index of "sponsor resistance"  claimed 92 advertisers were staying away from "Inside Edition," another  syndicated tabloid, and 91 were avoiding "Geraldo."  </P> <P> Just how many millions of dollars programmers are losing to hit lists is a  matter of conjecture, but knowledgeable sources at Tribune Entertainment  estimate that the series has lost as much as $4 million a month because of  depressed national ad rates. They acknowledge that several key stations have  either preempted objectionable segments, moved the series to less lucrative  time slots or declined to renew their contracts.  </P> <P> Officials representing other tabloid shows concede they have suffered similar  losses but insist, like Tribune, that there are plenty of stations and  advertisers eager to replace defectors.  </P> <P> But other program suppliers are getting the message. "If anyone came in during  the last few months and spent five minutes trying to sell me a series, four  minutes was spent telling me how advertiser-friendly the product was," laughs  one station manager looking to replace "Geraldo" with two game shows.  </P> <P> Not all objections concern the syndicated fare appearing outside prime time.  </P> <P> Cropping up on several hit lists, including Telerep's, are Fox's "Married . . .  With Children," CBS' "Rescue 911," NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and ABC's  "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> The latter series was conspicuously avoided by several major advertisers  earlier this season when co-producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick included  a scene in which two homosexual male characters were shown having an intimate  conversation in bed.  </P> <P> ABC lost an estimated $1.5 million on the episode, even though the network had  persuaded Herskovitz and Zwick to tone down the scene, which originally had the  two men kissing.  </P> <P> "I felt the way the network handled that segment was very supportive," says  Herskovitz, reserving his considerable wrath for timid corporations that he  believes now pull their commercials at the slightest hint of controversy.  </P> <P> "Even if you're selling soap, I think you have to be mindful of the effects of  such actions," he sighs, likening today's skittish sponsors to the national  book-sellers refusing to display Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" for fear of  upsetting Islamic fundamentalists. "There is a real danger of TV taking a giant  30-year step backward to the time when advertisers controlled the content of  programs."  </P> <P> A few weeks after "thirtysomething's" bedroom scene aired, ABC faced similar  advertiser resistance to a made-for-TV biography about Rock Hudson that made no  secret of the late actor's homosexuality.  </P> <P> "(Advertisers) do not want to be involved, and rightly so, in controversy or  controversial themes," explains Alfred R. Schneider, vice president of policy  and standards for Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "They certainly do not want to be the  subject of boycotts or customer dissatisfaction." He insists, however, that  advertisers are never allowed to override the "independent judgments" of ABC  censors about what is appropriate for broadcast.  </P> <P> Earlier this season, CBS apologized to General Motors for some sexually  suggestive moments in an episode of its "Wiseguy" series. The scene, which CBS  spokesman George Schweitzer now admits "may have gotten a tad too steamy,"  prompted a phone conversation between the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a long-time  critic of CBS programing through his Christian Leaders for Responsible  Television (CLeaR-TV), and John McNulty, GM's vice president of public  relations. Wildmon's complaint was followed by a barrage of letters from  CLeaR-TV supporters to GM Chairman Roger B. Smith.  </P> <P> McNulty, explaining that a single offended viewer may represent a loss of car  sales for years to come, later announced a revamp of its pre-screening policies  aimed at insuring that a similar slip-up never happens again.  </P> <P> Like most major advertisers, the auto maker will continue to pay an outside  agency to review advance tapes of every entertainment program in which its  commercials are scheduled to appear. In an unprecedented move, it has also  stationed a GM unit manager in the screening company's New York office to make  sure ads are pulled from any shows "that may gratuitously exploit sex and  violence, dishonor religions or racial groups, or present one-sided treatment  of controversial issues."  </P> <P> "Last year," McNulty points out, "General Motors withdrew 67 commercials from  programs judged unacceptable. Nevertheless, there were isolated incidents  where, because those who screened our programs were unfamiliar with our  policies, GM advertising did appear where it should not have."  </P> <P> Lorraine Antoniello, vice president of Advertising Information Services, a New  York-based company that scrutinizes virtually every prime-time network program  on behalf of 50 major ad agencies and their clients, says the most sensitive  areas continue to be sex, violence, profanity, drugs, alcohol and religion.  "They're concerned about all those things," she confirms, "plus controversial  issues, of course. Shows that deal with abortion and stuff like that."  </P> <P> Antoniello disputes claims that her screeners have been placed in the effective  role of censors.  </P> <P> "All of our clients assess our pre-screening reports and do what they like,"  she says. "We never contact the network people directly. We never have and I  don't ever expect we will."  </P> <P> One reason General Motors and other major advertisers are reluctant to appear  within reality-based syndicated shows, according to Antoniello, is the  difficulty in obtaining copies of episodes far enough in advance to make  judgments about their content. Although steps are being taken to address the  problem, some programs cannot even tell advertisers what the topic of their  shows will be from one day to the next.  </P> <P> "Almost everybody has an episodic rule," explains John Mandel, senior vice  president and director of national broadcasts for the Grey Advertising agency  in New York. "If we can't pre-screen it or tell them what the topic is, some  clients just won't run in the show."  </P> <P> One tabloid series, "A Current Affair," has made a concession to advertisers by  scheduling at least one "soft" episode each week, carefully structured so as  not to offend sponsors, viewers or station managers.  </P> <P> "We bear in mind the needs of our station clients first and then the  advertisers in the way we formulate decisions with respect to program content,"  explains Michael Lambert, the Los Angeles-based president of domestic  syndication for 20th Century Fox Television Corp., which distributes "A Current  Affair." Lambert insists that the hit lists controversy "hasn't affected our  clearances or bottom-line yet, but we are concerned about it because we see it  on the horizon."  </P> <P> "We are doing internal research and sales research to make sure that we are  being sensitive to the concerns," he continues. "But we want to be very careful  so that we don't become a mouthpiece for any advertiser and that we maintain  our First Amendment privileges."  </P> <P> "I got rid of the baby killers and sleazy sexual deviants," explains Westin,  now a King World vice president. "We've adopted 'the clean air act of the '90s'  as our credo."  </P> <P> Paramount, meanwhile, has denied reports that the recent cancellation of two of  its syndicated shows, "Friday the 13th: The Series" and "War of the Worlds,"  was a result of advertiser resistance. The studio says it pulled the plug on  the programs because of lackluster ratings and because sufficient "Friday the  13th" episodes had been produced to insure its future in syndication. But an  anti-violence advocacy group believes otherwise.  </P> <P> "Our national protest campaign convinced more than 30 national advertisers to  reduce or eliminate their advertising in 'Friday the 13th' and 'Freddy's  Nightmares' (a syndicated Warner Bros. series)," declares David Boyd, director  of public affairs for the National Coalition on Television Violence. According  to Boyd, the Illinois-based group began writing protest letters last summer to  sponsors of the two shows, citing excessive violence, gratuitous sex and  Satanistic overtones.  </P> <P> "We've chosen to avoid 'Friday the 13th' and 'Freddy's Nightmares,' " confirms  Lt. Col. David Fredrikson, assistant director of accession policy for the U.S.  Defense Department, which had been running recruitment ads on the two shows.  "They deliver a very good audience for us of career-oriented, 18-year-old males  . . . (but) we are also concerned about what our name and image appears next  to. We share the same concerns as the coalition does, and we don't want our  image associated with one of Satanic culture and Satanism. I imagine if 'Cosby'  had a Satanic theme we'd pull our ads from that show as well."  </P> <P> Asked to estimate how many protests his office had received concerning "Friday  the 13th," Fredrikson guessed the volume average at "maybe one letter every  couple of weeks."  </P> <P> Patricia Bevilacqua, who pulled ads from the same series on behalf of  SmithKline Beecham Consumer Brands, said fewer than a hundred letters prompted  her decision.  </P> <P> "If there are a substantial group of people who are offended (by a program),  then certainly we're going to look into it," she explains, adding that her firm  was spending "a considerable amount of money" on "Friday the 13th" and  "Freddy's Nightmares" to promote sales of its Vivirin, Oxy-10 and Oxy-Cler  health products. A review of several episodes led SmithKline Beecham to  withdraw from the two shows because of concerns about Satanism, profanity, sex  and violence, she says.  </P> <P> "These programs were really not something we wanted to be on," she says. "It is  true to some extent that (the pull-out) was because of NCTV's campaign."  </P> <P> Despite NCTV's apparent success with some advertisers, the group now regarded  as the most influential advocate of toned-down programming is the Rev.  Wildmon's Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, which he co-directs  with the Rev. Billy Melvin of Wheaton, Ill.  </P> <P> "We have sensitized the corporate world," says Melvin, who also serves as  executive director of the National Association of Evangelicals. "We've made  them aware of the problem, and I think they're responding."  </P> <P> CLeaR-TV "does not have a hit list of shows," Melvin insists. "A series can be  fairly good one time and be very bad the next."  </P> <P> But Melvin concedes that his organization does maintain a "hit list" of  advertisers whom CLeaR-TV regards as supporters of "bad" programming.  </P> <P> "These companies have been playing games with the American public by telling  viewers they wouldn't support offensive programs and doing just the opposite,"  says Melvin. "We feel it's time that they be held accountable for that kind of  shabby procedure."  </P> <P> CLeaR-TV launched a formal consumer boycott of Mennen and Clorox last July to  protest the broadcast advertising choices those firms made last May. Sources at  both companies contend that the boycott has had absolutely no economic effect  on their operations. Clorox, in fact, reports sales increases of more than 11%  over the past nine months. But just 10 days ago, CleaR-TV called off the  boycott against Clorox because it said the company had reduced its sponsorship  of objectionable programming by two-thirds and had assured CLeaR-TV that it  would continue to avoid such programs in the future.  </P> <P> David L. Goodman, vice president of public affairs at Clorox, says that the  boycott had not prompted the company to toughen its existing advertising  guidelines -- which prohibit purchasing time on any program that contains  graphic or gratuitous sex or violence, disparages any ethnic or religious  groups, treats individuals in a disparaging manner or glorifies the use of  drugs or alcohol. But Goodman admits that the action by CLeaR-TV caused Clorox  to conclude that the company occasionally had been lax in enforcing those  guidelines, and the company now supplements the screening of programs by an  outside agency with previews by its own employees.  </P> <P> "We are responding not so much to the group, but to its members," Goodman said.  "When we receive letters from families that say, 'We love and have always used  your products, and our parents and our grandparents used your products, but  we're not going to buy your products anymore because you are associated with  this kind of television show,' we respond to that."  </P> <P> Both Melvin and Wildmon claim several other major corporations now discuss  their prime-time advertising decisions directly with CLeaR-TV, although they  will not divulge any names. The organizers of CLeaR-TV, who consider themselves  guardians against "un-Christian" programming, are pleased with this response.  </P> <P> "We started going to the sponsors (with programing complaints) because, very  frankly, we were not making any progress in dealing with the producers and  networks themselves," Melvin explains. "When we went to the sponsors, we got  results."  </P> <P> Programming executives at the three major networks have all publicly conceded  that they paid closer attention to content this season than last, blaming last  season's excesses on everything from the writers' strike to cutbacks in the  number of staff censors. Each network now asks producers to forward to them  rough cuts of any programs that could ruffle advertiser feathers, and some  sponsors now get to look at made-for-TV movies six weeks or more before air  time.  </P> <P> At the so-called fourth network, Fox executives declined to discuss advertiser  hit lists on the record, but one official privately conceded that Fox is  keeping a closer eye on the content of its shows, which are singled out more  often than any appearing on ABC, CBS and NBC.  </P> <P> The 36-page Telerep hit list, for example, counts 40 advertisers "resisting"  placement on "Married . . . With Children," four times the number avoiding  "thirtysomething." Other shunned Fox shows include "America's Most Wanted" (46  advertisers), "21 Jump Street" (12), "Cops" (24), "The Reporters" (19), "The  Tracey Ullman Show" (13), "The Simpsons" (11) and "Alien Nation" (10).  </P> <P> "Viewers like this kind of programming and obviously they don't find it  offensive or they wouldn't watch it," says Mike Levinton, vice president and  director of programming for New York-based Blair Television. "Yet the  advertisers are afraid to go into these things because of the controversy they  create. I find some paradoxes there."  </P> <P> So do broadcasters. But many find themselves in a crunch. There has been a  significant downturn in national TV advertising in general. Sales have been  soft for the past year and show signs of even more softening.  </P> <P> "When your cash-flow was growing at 12 to 15% a year," says Dave Boylan of  WGHP-TV, "it may have been OK to ignore some advertiser who didn't want to buy  time on 'The Gong Show.' But now, when cash-flow and operating profits are not  growing at nearly those rates for many of us (in the TV industry), we're  willing to pay more attention to complaints."  </P></p>

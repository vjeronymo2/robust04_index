			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Excerpt] Amman -- The government of Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali is moving ahead with its policy of  removing legal and bureaucratic obstacles that stand in the face  of new investors who wish to enter the previously protected  sectors of the Jordanian economy, Minister of Trade and Industry  Rima Khalaf said during a business luncheon with journalists and  writers Saturday.    The minister said that the government's controversial  amendments to the insurance law was the first step in that  direction, and that this particular sector was chosen because it  was the only one that was "legally protected" against the entry  of new companies and investors.    Other sectors, the minister said, have become restricted  "not  because of legislative protection" but because the issuance of  licences for new investors was a "dual responsibility" shared by  the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the concerned government  department or ministry which often has its own considerations  and protection policies.    "The problem is that some of the industries which were  protected in the years before 1988 were accorded protection  against local competition and not only foreign competition," Ms.  Khalaf said, adding that the government would gradually ease the  restrictions and will terminate protection contracts when they  expire.    "The policy of this government is openness. On the  industrial level competition is the basis of our economy," Ms.  Khalaf said, adding that Jordan should reach a point where "the  market decides what stays and what goes."    "The banking sector, for example, was restricted because of  Central Bank regulations and not because of trade and industry  laws," Ms. Khalaf pointed out in response to a specific question  on that sector.

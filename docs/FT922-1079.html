			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: Knock, knock To go into receivership once during a recession might be regarded as a misfortune; to do so twice begins to look like carelessness. But such has been the fate of Knobs and Knockers, the bizarrely-named retailer of brassy household accessories, which yesterday called in receivers for the second time in as many years. The company first collapsed in May 1991 but was resuscitated a month later through a management buy-out led by Geoffrey Davy, former chief executive of BhS. Although the receiver has immediately closed 19 of the 52 shops, he is hopeful of selling the business as a going concern. The company's 50 remaining employees are no doubt hoping for third time lucky.</p>

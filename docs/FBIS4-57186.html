			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Candelaria Rodriguez and Jose Antonio Roman] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 9 May -- This evening,  the state government pledged to compensate cattlemen and rural  producers by paying 4,500 new pesos for each of the 21,220  hectares in the area of the conflict. The amount represents a  "rental payment" that covers from January to 31 October this  year, based on the terms of the peace accord.    The sum will serve as compensation for the effects of the  armed rebellion without involving a sale of land. This measure,  it was said, responds to proposals made by Chiapas livestock  producers.    The agreement signed this evening between the cattlemen's  leaders and Governor Javier Lopez Moreno includes private land  and ejidos and deals with damages to the land so far. They  agreed that the arrangement will be reviewed upon its conclusion  from the perspective of the peace accord that is currently under  negotiation.    Following a march by cattlemen from Altamirano, Las  Margaritas, and Ocosingo Municipalities to demand that state and  federal authorities comply with the agreements signed 20 days  ago in the presence of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,  Governor Lopez Moreno decided to meet the protesters' demands  with an allotment from the state's own funds.    The state official signed the agreement with cattlemen  leaders Jorge Constantino Kanter and Jose Francisco Lopez  Ardines, who agreed that landowners will receive 4,500 new pesos  for land that cannot be tilled because it is within the area  involved in the conflict. The figure will be multiplied by 12  percent annually for the 225 estates fully registered in the  area. The payment to these estates "is like a rental payment  for those affected between 1 January and today and for  subsequent months."    Fidel Culebro Trejo, president of the state's Rural  Producers Federation, said the agreement does not involve any  land sales. He added: "It is like a rental payment on the  land's value."    The following individuals signed the agreement on the state  government's behalf: Jaime Mantecon Solis of the Rural  Development and Ecology Secretariat; Rodolfo Ulloa Flores,  general government secretary; Nestor Aguirre of the Agrarian  Reform Secretariat; and Carlos Arroyo Rincon, assistant  Agricultural and Water Resources Secretariat delegate, among  other authorities.    To implement the agreement, the state government pledged to  establish offices in the municipal capitals of Ocosingo,  Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. The offices will register each  of the estates located within the zone involved in the conflict  once the requested stipulations have been met.    Rural producers must submit requests to the governor for  inclusion in the program, which begins tomorrow, at offices that  will accept applications between 11 and 31 May. These offices  will only register affected estates in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and  Las Margaritas Municipalities.    State authorities will forgive, through the Finance  Secretariat and on this occasion and for this zone only, taxes  levied on the issuance of a tax clearance certificate. State  officials will perform the appropriate analysis as soon as the  requested documents arrive so they can immediately proceed with  the payment.    The Rural Development and Ecology Secretariat will be  responsible for establishing the aforementioned registry  offices. Enrique Moscoso Thomas, who has been named the program  coordinator, will verify that the work is carried out  expeditiously and without creating problems for owners and state  officials.    Referring to land occupations, the agreement states that "we  will abide by the 60-day deadline specified in the agreement  made with the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations  (CEOIC) in Mexico City."    Once occupied lands are recovered, evaluations will be made  to see that damages are repaired within the state government's  normal programs. Once an agreement is signed between the  parties, rural cattlemen and producers will reportedly vacate  the city's civic square and downtown area, which they closed off  throughout the day. The demonstrators will reportedly return to  their communities this evening.</p>

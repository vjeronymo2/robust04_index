			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peak as overseas buyers appear A SUDDEN shift towards optimism on interest rates both in Germany and the UK drove the London stock market confidently to new all-time highs. Shares opened strongly in response to the overnight 45-point rise in the Dow Industrial Average, and drew further encouragement later from an optimistic review of the domestic economy in the UK Treasury's latest monthly report. Attention is now focused on this morning's meeting at the Bundesbank. The appearance of a few Continental European institutional buyers in London yesterday morning caused UK strategists to think again about prospects for a cut in German interest rates ahead of the French elections. At best, the market was ahead by nearly 40 points on the FT-SE 100 scale. Gains were trimmed at mid-session, when the Bundesbank said it would not hold a press conference after today's policy meeting, but UK shares rose again when Wall Street, after some hesitation, turned higher in the new session. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 36.3 points up at 2,918.6. The previous intra-day peak of 2,900.1 was broken early but then lost again, in spite of another strong opening in stock index futures. Trading volume increased strongly to a Seaq total of 710.3m shares from the 573.3m recorded on Tuesday. The presence of the big institutions was confirmed by the focus on the FT-SE 100 list; trade in non-Footsie shares dipped to some 59 per cent of the Seaq total from the average 62 per cent of recent sessions. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also at a new peak of 3,077.9, a gain of 27.9, and traders said that private investors appeared to have regained their confidence. The previous peak of 3,051.4 on the FT-SE Mid 250 was reached on February 8. The re-adjustment in views on German interest rate prospects was by no means absolute; City strategists rated the chances of a significant cut in German rates as 'no more than 50-50'. But some analysts believed that the UK market had turned too strongly negative on this point in the previous session. Further gains in sterling encouraged hopes that overseas funds may now be ready to buy UK equities. On the domestic front, expectations of a cut in UK base rates around Budget day benefited from some encouraging hints on the economy. Disclosure by the Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, that sales of new homes has risen by a fifth so far this year was later followed by the Treasury's encouraging monetary report. This indicated that shop sales are rising, house prices falling less sharply and overall activity improving. The market has also been helped by the satisfactory tone of trading results from major companies over the past fortnight. The banking sector responded well yesterday to the report from Midland, now part of Hongkong Banking, but a question mark still hangs over today's trading and dividend statement from Barclays. Traders admitted to having been caught out by the sudden rebound in the stock market. Marketmakers had begun to move towards balanced trading books ahead of the Budget and were short of stock. The final minutes of trading brought some hints that a rights issue was planned for this morning.</p>

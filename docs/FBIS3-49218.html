			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by fr: "The Slovak Republic Exceeded the Clearing </F> Account Margin"]    [Text] Prague--The deficit of Slovakia on the clearing  account for trade with the Czech Republic reached the amount of  169.39 million ECU's on 31 December 1993. Hence, the margin set  by the payments agreement (130 million ECU's) has been overdrawn  for the first time since this method of financing of the trade  between the Czech and the Slovak Republics was introduced.    Interest of 10 percent is due on the amount by which the  margin was overdrawn, and, according to the payment agreement,  the debtor must cover this amount in convertible currency within  15 days. Otherwise, the penalty interest is raised to 15  percent. The Czech National Bank has not planned talks with the  Slovak side so far because the debtor should cover the margin  excess practically automatically, Jan Vit, vice governor of the  Czech National Bank told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday in this  respect.    The Czech National Bank is conducting a so-called annulment  of the old lot and its transfer to the new lot at the end of  each month. In December, the old lot shows a deficit in Slovak  payments in the amount of 46.78 million ECU's, and, on the new  lot, the Czech Republic had a surplus of 122.13 million ECU's.  The old lot records in the 1 to 1 ratio all payments for trade  prior to the currency separation; the new lot records payments  for trading after this date.</p>

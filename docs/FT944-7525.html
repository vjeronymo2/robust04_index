			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: A familiar barren Landscape - Theatre In his poetic, haunting, and seldom seen masterwork Landscape, Harold Pinter strips drama to its most enigmatic essence. The two characters, Duff and Beth, sit at either ends of a kitchen table, without ever rising. Nothing happens but talk; they seem never to hear each other; she never addresses him. The play, new in 1968, lasts only 40 minutes. We, listening, are baffled - and, finally, heartbroken. For heartbreak is part of the subject of this beautiful play. Duff sits mainly in profile to us, leaning forwards to keep his hands on the table, like a Cezanne card-player. Beth sits facing us, hands folded in her lap, like Cezanne's mother. Man and woman: Pinter has distilled the age-old tensions between the two sexes so potently that the tragic division of gender has never seemed less bridgeable. The mysteries of the play lie in the dichotomies between what she says and what he says. Beth sits there motionless. It is possible that she is in a coma or trance; certainly Duff addresses her as such. Yet the wonderful irony of the play is that her thoughts dwell entirely in sensuous contemplation of the lyrical past, while his thoughts ramble tensely. He is prose, she poetry. He talks of mundane facts, she of delicate feeling. He thinks about only home and work, she about would-be children and art. He speaks of sex as struggle, she as intimacy. And, though she speaks frequently of 'he' and 'him', it is by no means clear if she is referring to Duff; we wonder about their (ex-?)employer Mr Sykes. It is Duff who gives us most clues: we learn that he once told her of his infidelity to her, we learn that she once, at some other time, broke down by hammering at the gong. The clinching clue, I believe, to the identity of her lover lies in the word 'grave'. More important, however, and nearest to the play's title, are her words on the principles of light and shade in drawing. Or, rather, light and shadow. Pinter extracts beautiful nuance from the latter word. 'Shadow is deprivation of light . . . Sometimes the cause of the shadow cannot be found. But I always bore in mind the basic principles of drawing. So that I never lost track. Or heart.' Much more deserves to be said not only about this play but also about the performance it is being given, under Pinter's own direction, by Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm at the Cottesloe. This is the staging that was the greatest revelation of the Pinter Festival at Dublin's Gate Theatre in May; even without the festival's other five plays, it is marvellous to have it here. I am now more aware of the moments when Beth and Duff seem to draw near to each other in thought, and of the weight of grief that hangs over him. But the slightest nuance here - the slightest turn of a head, the connection of two consonants, the beat of her eyelids, the silence in the air - is full of meaning. In repertory at the Cottesloe Theatre, South Bank.</p>

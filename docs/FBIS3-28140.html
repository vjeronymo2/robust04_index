After 30 years of unit building, growth, combat, and  glorious  victory led by the glorious Communist Party of Vietnam,  solicitously cared for by esteemed Uncle Ho and helped and  assisted by the people, various generations of cadres,  combatants, and civilian national defense employees of the  regiment have constantly developed the character and glorious  tradition of the Vietnam People's Army as well as the tradition  of the heroic Vietnamese Air Force. They have always remained  united and singleminded and have resourcefully and bravely  overcome all difficulties, hardships, and tough ordeals.    They are noted for having invented many wise and audacious  combat tactics and for having defeated the enemy right from the  first battle, shooting down many of their modern airplanes and  scoring countless outstanding combat expoits during aerial  battles, thus contributing duly to the causes of national  liberation and unification and of building a socialist  Vietnamese fatherland.    In whatever conditions, junctures, and situations the cadres  and combatants of the regiment have always strived to display  the lofty qualities of Uncle Ho's soldiers. The regiment  therefore deserves the title of Heroic Unit of the People's  Armed Forces and the many other lofty awards given to it by the  state and the Armed Forces.    I would like to avail myself of this opportuniry to commend  the regiment for the many achievements it has scored over the  past 30 years.    I wish you, comrades, good health and more outstanding  achievements in the new revolutionary stage so as to eternally  deserve the trust and love of the party, the people, and the  Armed Forces.    My cordial and determined-to-win salutations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak  has affirmed that no draft law on housing has so far been  finalized and that the housing minister's statements in this  regard are merely a viewpoints, all of which are still under  study.    The president pointed out that when a final version of this  law is reached, it will be presented to the public for  discussion. It will be discussed in all institutions, because it  is an issue that concerns the broad mass of citizens.    Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif made this statement  after President Mubarak's meeting with the media men on the 11th  anniversary of such meetings. This meeting lasted for over 3  hours. [passage omitted]    Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that after the  meeting, President Mubarak answered questions posed by prominent  writers, thinkers, and media men. AL-WAFD Chief Editor Jamal  Badawi asked a question about Sudan. [passage omitted]    President Mubarak answered the question by affirming that it  is only natural for relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese  people to be good and that the two peoples have known throughout  history that they are linked till eternity. [passage omitted]    The president noted the various successive stands of the  Sudanese regime in international forums. It has attempted to  encourage certain attitudes not commensurate with the standard  of relations between the two countries, such as when the  Sudanese delegation recently objected to Egypt's membership in  the East Africa Trade Organization at a time when Egypt had  refrained from playing any role in supporting the decision to  place Sudan on the list of states harboring terrorism.    The information minister clarified that President Mubarak  pointed out the false reports published in some Arab newspapers  that cited Sudanese newspapers. These reports claimed that Egypt  has dispatched forces amounting to 10,000 soldiers to the  Hala'ib area. The president questioned Egypt's incentives in  sending troops there and who it would be fighting. He said that  Egypt will not fight the Sudanese people; it has no motive to do  so. We care a great deal about the Sudanese people, he added.    The president added that provocative attempts will not  affect  us. We need to be patient and feel comfortable that Egypt's  security is in safe hands. [passage omitted]    The information minister said that during this meeting,  writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan discussed the interviews with  repentant terrorists recently broadcast on television. He  affirmed that this is a good move on the part of the television,  but said that there are fears regarding guarantees of the actual  repentance of these terrorists and whether they will return to  terrorism.    President Mubarak said: I can set your minds at ease  regarding the issue of repentant terrorists. We need to be very  cautious in creating conditions for repentance while keeping  alert and following up. We ask our returning sons to follow the  right path and join the nation. [passage omitted]    The information minister said President Mubarak highlighted  the strong links between foreign and internal action. He  stressed that had it not been for Egypt's international  relations, no external support for Egypt's economic reform would  have come. International support for our causes would not have  come, be it support for the economy, politics, technology or  trade cooperation, or the opening of markets to Egyptian  products.    The president also noted that there are external issues that  demand our attention, whether in Arab and Islamic circles or on  the worldwide level. He used the example of Sudan and the  events in Yemen, as well as the Somali crisis. He explained  that these issues are linked to events inside Egypt and to the  homeland's security.    The president also gave the example of Egypt's African role,  which prompts us to intervene to resolve African differences and  use its influence in creating an atmosphere of peace among the  African states.    Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak referred to the  importance of international relations, which have played a role  in establishing peace. Mubarak pointed out that peace means  stability of the region and that this stability affects domestic  policy and cannot be separated from it. He said that the issue  is not merely stability and the establishment of any peace, but  peace must be based on the right, justice, and legitimate rights.    President Mubarak explained the developments of the  Palestinian- Israeli contacts which preceded the signing of the  Declaration of Principles, the contacts between Egypt and Israel  over the issue, and the subsequent negotiations between the  Palestinians and Israelis in Oslo. He touched on the obstacles  that faced the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations throughout the  talks and Egypt's role in reconciling their views. He noted the  efforts that were necessary up until the latest agreement was  signed. He also referred to the details and differences over  the size of Jericho and Gaza that arose before the signing of  the agreement. He noted that the differences continued until  early in the morning of the signing and that differences also  arose during the signing. He explained that a solution to the  crisis was reached through an agreement to continue the  negotiations over the size of Gaza and Jericho, which was signed  by the cosponsors of the peace process and Egypt. [passage  omitted]    Responding to a question by writer Zakariya Nil on party  plurality and the lengths to which it might go, in light of  Algeria's experience, President Mubarak said that this is one of  the issues on the national dialogue agenda, noting that certain  people may propose forming new parties. He said: My view is  that we do not want to divide the people into parties, as this  would divert us from our main goal of serving the people and  improving their standard of living. We do not want to engage in  partisan disputes that may divert us from our devotion to these  major goals and interests. He said: I want to stress that  there are parties that play a political and democratic role, but  other parties have confined their role to publishing a newspaper  that spreads rumors and casts doubt on the national performance.  He said that the regime in Egypt is stable and will not be  affected by certain personal actions. He said: I hope that  through national dialogue we will be able to reach acceptable  and logical decisions. He added: Certain people may interpret  this as going over the head of the national dialogue, but I have  a right to express my views.    In response to a question on the drafting committee and the  time needed to prepare for the national dialogue, President  Mubarak said that the dialogue will result in recommendations  not decisions. He said: When we determine that the  recommendations serve the interests of society, we will turn  them into decisions. The decisions should be consistent with  the people's interests in the present and future. He noted that  the recommendations will be forwarded to the parties  concerned--legislative, administrative, or executive bodies such  the cabinet--for decisions. He noted that he envisions that the  drafting committee will complete its work in June and that the  dialogue will have a time limit so that it will achieve its  goals and not become mere talk and one-upmanship.    Answering a question on protecting the Nile's waters from  pollution in the wake of the dumping of large numbers of human  bodies in the Rwanda lakes, one of the sources of the Nile  River, President Mubarak affirmed that the Health Ministry is  dealing with this issue and that the water is regularly and  strictly analyzed to ensure it is safe to use.    Responding to a question on the Yemeni problem, President  Mubarak stressed that unity must not be imposed by force but by  polling the people and sounding out their feelings. He said  that the use of force to impose unity is wrong. He called for  halting the war, disengaging the combatants, and trying to bring  the views of the two parties closer together. He pointed out  that this is the best solution for the situation. He said that  no one can impose unity by force; we have our own experience in  this regard. He noted that if military force had been used to  impose Syrian-Egyptian unity, it would have had negative  repercussions and torn asunder the relations between the  Egyptian and Syrian peoples. He said that leader Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir was wise when he made his decision to stop the use  of military force. [passage omitted]</p>

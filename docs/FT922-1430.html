			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Appeal against sentence fails MR ANDREW KIMMINS, the jailed head of the failed Blade Group of futures and equities dealers, yesterday lost an appeal against his 30-month prison sentence for fraudulent trading. Mr Kimmins, 33, had sought a reduction in his jail term. But Mr Justice Simon Brown, sitting in the Court of Appeal with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, and Mr Justice Roch, said the sentence already fully reflected the mitigation in the case. Mr Kimmins of Henley on Thames was jailed on March 5 after admitting two counts of fraudulent trading between 1986 and 1988. He was alleged to have 'recklessly' carried on the activities of his Blade Securities and Blade Investment companies when he knew they could not survive without outside help. The net loss to investors was put at Pounds 1.6m. His counsel, Mr Philip Singer, said yesterday lax accounting and bad investment advice had contributed to the group's failure.</p>

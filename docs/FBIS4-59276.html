			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn to units of the Palestinian National </F> Security Forces during an inspection visit in Ghawr Nimrin on 11  May -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Brother youths: In the name of Jordan and  Jordanians, in the name of all the kinsfolk, I am pleased to  meet with you at these moment while you are preparing to move to  your fraternal, dear, and cherished homeland. On behalf of  everyone, and in my name, I convey to you all love,  appreciation, and pride. [applause] [crowd shouts: One people,  not two peoples; long live King Husayn]    We hope you will convey to the kinsfolk and beloved ones in  the West Bank and in the Gaza of Hashim all love, appreciation,  and pride in their legendary and heroic steadfastness and in  their adherence to both the land and right. We pray to God the  almighty that these measures are the beginning of the path of  regaining the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people on  their national soil.    I hope that one thing is not absent from the mind of any of  you, that is, I am here personally, and all your kinsfolk and  brothers are from you and for you. We do not have any greed or  ambition except to see our brothers and kinsfolk in Palestine  free on their national soil, living a dignified life, which is  their right. [crowd applauds, shouts: "Long live His Majesty  King Husayn"]    In addition to this, we are for you to the best of our  capabilities and resources. We are dealing with your  leadership, the PLO leadership, the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian Arab people [applause] in  accordance with the will of both this people and the Arab nation  shown in 1974. We will continue to proceed on this line. All  of you live in our hearts and deep in our conscience.    We, here in Jordan, are for the one who will leave his  kinsfolk to carry out his new tasks because his kinsfolk are  ours and our beloved ones. You are also our kinsfolk, and  Jordan, with everything in it, is your kinsfolk. [applause]  [crowd shouts: Long live King Husayn; one people, not two  peoples]    Concluding, we wish all of you success in their service and  sacrifices. We also hope that you will be up to the level of  the hopes of the kinsfolk whom you will meet in the West Bank,  Gaza, and the remainder of the dear occupied Palestinian Arab  territory. It is a great duty. However, with God's help and  through everyone's resolve and awareness, you will perfectly  carry out your duty. God the almighty is the one who grants  success and sponsors the march. Greetings. [applause] [crowd  shouts: Long live His Majesty King Husayn]    Be reassured that we here are one cohesive family.  Consequently, we all are members of one family in terms of the  past, present, and future, and also in confronting all  circumstances and possibilities. If you please now, allow me to  shake hands with you, one by one.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOT SAYS IT WITH FLOWERS; SOVIETS AGAIN GET NO SCENT  </P> <P> As flower deliveries go, it was spectacular.  </P> <P> A light plane swooped from the Soviet sky without warning and dropped off  flowers for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at an airport near Turkey before  zipping back across the frontier, Soviet media said Thursday.  </P> <P> Clearly, at least some Soviets have gained a sense of humor since a 19-year-old  West German youth buzzed the Kremlin and landed his Cessna on Red Square before  startled KGB guards in May, 1988.  </P> <P> That young man, Mathias Rust, spent 14 months in a Soviet prison after the  photo of his plane in front of St. Basil's Cathedral made front pages around  the world. Soviet authorities fired their defense minister and air defense  chief after Rust flew from Finland to a landing in Moscow undetected.  </P> <P> The latest incident was reported in a mocking article in Izvestia under the  headline, "Rust Number Two?"  </P> <P> Izvestia and Tass, quoting the labor newspaper Trud, said that on June 9, a  Cessna sneaked into Soviet airspace undetected by flying barely 600 feet above  the mountainous southern border with Turkey.  </P> <P> It touched down at the Batumi municipal airport for less than 40 seconds, just  long enough to drop off a bouquet of carnations, greetings for Gorbachev, and a  $20 bill.  </P> <P> "We Germans are very grateful to him," said the note to Gorbachev. The author  signed the note, "Hans Schneider."  </P> <P> The Ministry of Defense said air defenses "did not act," Izvestia reported.  </P> <P> "Translating this into simple language, we dare to say this means they failed  to notice him," the newspaper concluded. "Thank God, the second Rust had enough  tact not to land at a military base!"  </P> <P> Trud said that border guards and air defenders failed to coordinate their  actions. It said helicopters should have pursued the plane.  </P> <P> "After all, he is still a violator, even though he has an excellent sense of  humor," Trud said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Orchid fanciers will find many plant varieties and hundreds of blooms at the  South Coast Botanic Garden today from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. as the South Bay  Orchid Society concludes its 10th annual fall show. Prize-winning plants --  chosen by judges for such attributes as bloom and color -- will be on display,  and orchid nurseries will sell blooming plants and seedlings.  </P> <P> Show chairman James Weiss said the show -- which drew 2,000 people last year --  gives orchid growers "an opportunity to bring in blooming plants and have a lot  of people admire them." Orchid society members will be on hand to answer  questions, and there will be videos on orchid culture.  </P> <P> Weiss said growing orchids is a popular and challenging hobby: "They're not  difficult to grow, but they are demanding" in their requirements for water,  feeding, humidity and warmth. Some orchid varieties also require patience. "It  can be four to eight years before you see the first bloom," Weiss said.  </P> <P> The botanic garden is located at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd. on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula. Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and students and 75  cents for children 5 to 12. GERALD FARIS  </P></p>

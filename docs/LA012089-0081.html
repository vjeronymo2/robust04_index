			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> ESCAPEE BACK AFTER 8 YEARS  </P> <P> A convicted robber who had escaped from the California Men's Colony in San Luis  Obispo eight years ago turned himself in because he wants to "start fresh,"  prison officials said. The fugitive, Dennis L. Wedge, 31, had escaped in 1981  after serving one year of a six-year sentence for a robbery committed in San  Bernardino, Associate Warden Gail Lewis said. After showing up at the Central  California prison, he told officials he has "led a crime-free life" in another  state since his escape and wants "to clear things up and start fresh," Lewis  said. She said Wedge would be charged with escape.  </P></p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Observer: Absent friends Where will you be on the day French voters decide Europe's future? If you follow the example of the community's ruling elite, you will be at least 3,000 miles away. The twelve's finance ministers and central bankers - expected to calm the chaos on the financial markets if the French deliver a Gaullist snub to Maastricht - will be in Washington for the IMF's annual jamboree. The pals from the EC's foreign ministries will be just up the road in New York attending the general assembly of the United Nations when the votes are counted on September 20. Presumably they'll be able to spare a few moments from the cocktails to assure us that Europe is safe in their hands.</p>

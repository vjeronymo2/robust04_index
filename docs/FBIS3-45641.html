This leader said: Over the past two years, China has made  certain achievements in implementing the strategy of market  diversification in the field of international economic relations  and trade. On the whole, however, our trade is still confined  to a small number of developed countries and regions. While  preserving and developing existing markets, we must strive to  open up new markets to ensure a bigger market area and leeway  while spreading out risk for China's opening up and the  development of its international economic relations and trade.    It is necessary to continue the effort to improve the  product  mix. Eight years ago, we proposed accomplishing two changes in  the product mix, specifically, the move from the dominance of  primary products to that of manufactured products and the change  from primary processing of manufactured products to deep  processing of manufactured products. The first change has been  realized, but there is still a long way to go to reach the  second. We must make energetic efforts to develop  export-oriented machinery, electrical products, and packaging  plants that are highly competitive on the international market,  are processed on a deep level, have high added value, and  demonstrate good export potential. The State Council has  decided to establish an import and export credit bank, through  which the state will give special support to the export of those  items in terms of credit funds. It is also possible to consider  using methods such as offshore financing to support the export  of capital goods.    It is necessary to carry forward the principle of  emphasizing  quality. This year, efforts shall continue to be concentrated  on punishing the manufacturers and sellers of sham and shoddy  commodities. The quality factor should be viewed as reflecting  our national reputation and the quality of the people and as  connected to the image of our socialist system and reform and  opening up. All departments related to scientific research and  development, production, foreign trade, customs, and commodity  inspection shall cooperate fully with each other, shall make  substantial efforts to strengthen quality control and  supervision, and shall strive to make marked improvements in the  quality of export commodities this year.</p>

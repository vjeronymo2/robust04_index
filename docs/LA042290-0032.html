			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR DISCIPLINE  </P> <P> I applaud your efforts to enhance the quality of medicine by publishing the  medical disciplinary actions taken by the Medical Board of California during  the period of Aug. 1, through Nov. 30, 1989 (Part B, April 12).  </P> <P> While we will continue to advocate to ensure that physicians are afforded due  process and that reporting is fair and consistent, the Los Angeles County  Medical Assn. also recognizes that it is in everyone's best interest that the  highest standards of medical care be maintained. I hope that The Times' efforts  will help ensure that quality and I will watch for future publications with  interest.  </P> <P> CHARLES B. McELWEE, M.D.  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Medical Assn.  </P></p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (20): US reception remains cool - Chinese stocks on Wall Street still lack appeal American consumer goods from burgers to fizzy drinks may be all the rage in China, but not all things Chinese can be assured an equally warm reception in US markets, as company and regulatory officials have learnt to their cost this year. US shareholders have broadly cold-shouldered mainland stock trading on Wall Street and the so-called N share. The N share is a recently introduced category of security offered to investors in the US, Europe and Asia, and its reception has prompted the Chinese regulatory authorities to look instead at facilitating dual primary listings - as achieved by Shanghai Petrochemical and its sponsors Merrill Lynch Hong Kong and Peregrine Capital last year. This would enable companies to widen their investor base with a US listing, while at the same time recognising that the bulk of demand, for now, will be in Hong Kong. In 1993, the first year of overseas listings, all nine selected companies headed across the border for Hong Kong. This year, however, the Chinese authorities elected to send five of the 22-strong second batch to New York. For the companies concerned, this was initially seen as good news: compared with Hong Kong, price/earnings ratios tend to be higher and there is a perceived prestige premium attached to a US listing. Until the introduction of N shares, which began with Shandong Huaneng, a power company, four mainland companies were listed on the New York Stock Exchange: Brilliance China, China Tire, Ek Chor Motorcycle and Shanghai Petrochemical. In October, Huaneng Power, an associate company, became the sixth US listed mainland company. Trading in Shanghai Petrochemical, one of the first batch of N shares, demonstrates the relative inactivity of China shares in the US vis a vis Hong Kong, where most activity takes place. Around four times the volume of Shanghai Petrochemical shares are traded in Hong Kong as in New York, although 70 per cent of the stock was first issued in the US. Bankers attribute this to Hong Kong's greater awareness of - and familiarity with - the China market, as well as an its enhanced level of news about the country, plus research coverage. Most recently, the lacklustre American appetite for Chinese shares has been highlighted by the decision by Shandong International Power Development (SIPD) to delay its listing while it monitors the performance of shares in the two power companies which recently hit Wall Street. SIPD last month called a halt on its HKDollars 2.7bn listing in the colony, and planned issue of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), in response to the US performance of Shandong Huaneng and Huaneng Power International. Poor performances wrought by market conditions have been exacerbated in the Chinese power sector by a dearth of desperately-needed foreign funds for development. Shandong Huaneng has seen the price of its ADRs slump about 23 per cent from the issue price of USDollars 14.25 on August 4 to about USDollars 11.25. Huaneng Power International has also seen its share price fall on Wall Street since its October 6 debut, despite cutting the share price 27 per cent to USDollars 20 from USDollars 27.50, the top price mooted in the preliminary listing prospectus. In response to this, regulatory authorities are seeking to eliminate the barriers to dual primary listings. If measures can be developed in time, it is possible two of China's biggest overseas listings now earmarked for New York may be able to dovetail with a Hong Kong offering. These are the two airline companies: China Southern Airlines, being brought to market by Goldman Sachs; and China Eastern Airways, arranged by Morgan Stanley. The challenge has been swiftly picked up by the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's securities watchdog. The colony's regulators are eager to enhance Hong Kong's international reputation and obtain the extra business generated by offering a secondary market in New York listed China companies. However, facilitating dual primary listings means overcoming mechanical problems such as those which arise, for example, because of the different subscription systems used in the US and Hong Kong. Issues to be resolved include who has jurisdiction in a simultaneous US-Hong Kong listing; prospectus differences - in the US an initial 'red herring' document is printed without prices while, in Hong Kong, prices are typically included. Another issue is the underwriters' role in price stabilisation, following a new listing.</p>

The Red Cross is hoping to obtain a formal UN ban on the  development and production of laser weapons. They are silent  and invisible weapons. A person does not know that a laser is  being aimed at him and has no time to prepare himself and  somehow protect himself.    Laser weapons are an object of desire for all armies'  generals. Several attempts to provide themselves with the combat  lasers featured in science fiction novels have been dashed  against the immutable laws of physics. In order to make a laser  beam capable of burning through something it must be focused:  This is impossible at long distances because of the law of  diffraction. But it is also impossible to kill enemy soldiers or  destroy his armored vehicles at short distances using modern  lasers. So far lasers have found a use in high-precision  weapons guidance systems.    According to information available to the Red Cross, a new  generation of lasers could soon enter Western armies' arsenals.  At a 1km radius such a weapon, Red Cross specialists claim,  could permanently blind a person. One of the aims is to blind  aircrew. The Geneva committee also fears that portable and  easy-to-use combat lasers could fall into the hands of  terrorists.    The demand to stop the development of laser weapons will  make  life difficult not only for the United States but also for  Russia, which has overtaken the West in the development of  lasers for terrestrial and space use. Millions of what were  then noninflationary rubles went on attempts to develop lasers  to destroy satellites and ballistic missiles in space.    Tracked laser guns were developed by the "Luch" central  design bureau and then the "Astrofizika" science and production  association, which was led by Nikolay Ustinov, son of Dmitriy  Ustinov, Central Committee secretary for the military industry  and later defense minister. In 20 years 200 million rubles were  spent and a dozen vulnerable tracked monsters which had no  chance on the battlefield were constructed.    Under Gorbachev work to improve the monster was halted.  According to IZVESTIYA reports work was recently resumed.  Possibly the generals are unable to abandon their long-standing  dream. Maybe physics research is not standing still and there  will be new opportunities to decrease the dimensions of combat  lasers and make them cheaper. Their task is to disable the  enemy's optical guidance instruments and blind operators. When  enemy positions are illuminated by a laser beam the electronic  optical guidance systems (of an aircraft, missile launcher,  tank, artillery piece, or firearm) will themselves focus this  beam and be disabled. If at this moment the operator is looking  through the guidance instrument's eyepiece he will lose his  sight.</p>

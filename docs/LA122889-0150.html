			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: CYPRESS COLLEGE AND ENVIRONS: FOCUS;  </P> <P> FROM COWS TO COLLEGE CAMPUS  </P> <P> When Ventura Cornejo purchased a new home on Lime Avenue in Cypress in 1962,  the area surrounding the development consisted mostly of farmland and cow  pastures.  </P> <P> Cypress College, now the focal point of Cornejo's neighborhood, would not be  built for another four years. For a while then, the Cornejo family could enjoy  the quiet rural life.  </P> <P> "Orange Avenue and Valley View Street were just little two-lane country roads  back then," he says. "We used to complain about the smell coming from the dairy  farms. But when the area started to develop and all the traffic started coming  in, we decided the cows weren't so bad after all."  </P> <P> The dairies and farmland are now long gone, of course. In their place is a  bustling suburb of housing and commercial developments.  </P> <P> Still, despite the change, Cornejo and his wife, Lilly, have no immediate plans  to leave the neighborhood that has been their home for so many years.  </P> <P> "We raised five children here," said Cornejo, a real estate agent who serves on  the local school board. "All my kids went to Christine Swain school just a few  blocks away, and now two of my grandkids go there too."  </P> <P> The school, at 5851 Newman St., was named for Christine Swain, who was head  librarian at the Cypress Branch Library from 1959 to 1984. Swain, who is  retired and still lives in Cypress, organized an after-school tutoring program  for local children and served on the Cypress School District Board of Trustees  for 30 years. This year, there are 407 pupils enrolled in grades kindergarten  through six at Swain.  </P> <P> Newman is also the street where William C. Horan and a roommate rented a small  two-bedroom home in 1966 for $55 a month while he was attending Cypress  College. "My roommate and I split the rent, so each of us paid only $27.50. I  was going to school on GI Bill funds, and that helped me stretch my money a  little further. I was in pretty good shape," he said.  </P> <P> Horan was one of the 1,966 students who enrolled for the first semester at a  campus that existed only on blueprints just 74 days before it opened. Known as  "The Instant Campus," Cypress College originally consisted of 18 prefabricated  temporary structures that took only a few months to put up. The gymnasium,  classrooms and administrative offices were all in temporary buildings; the  permanent structures were built over a period of about 15 years on the 112-acre  site.  </P> <P> Horan, now a lawyer living in Huntington Beach, had transferred from another  community college and needed only 12 units to complete an associate of arts  degree. He completed them all in that semester, making him the school's first  graduate -- the valedictorian in a graduating class of one.  </P> <P> Today, more than 13,257 students attend day and evening classes there.  </P> <P> The modern and elegantly landscaped campus, and a number of its individual  buildings, has received awards from architectural and educational associations.  Two of its more notable features are the colorful abstract wall sculpture by  Orange County artist Sergio O'Cadiz that forms the facade of the library  building, and the 115-foot campanile that can be seen for miles from almost any  direction.  </P> <P> The design for the entire project is the work of William Blurock &amp;  Associates of Newport Beach and Caudill-Rowlett-Scott of Houston, Tex. -- the  same team that, in the mid-'80s, designed the Orange County Performing Arts  Center.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 5,316  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +9.0%  </P> <P> Median Age: 30.7  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 68%  </P> <P> Latino: 23%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 8%  </P> <P> By sex and age: In hundreds  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 30.4 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 31.0 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $12,960  </P> <P> Median household: $36,289  </P> <P> Average household: $38,221  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 29%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,000: 43%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 20%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 5%  </P> <P> $100,000 and more: 3%  </P></p>

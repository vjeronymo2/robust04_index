			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Brent Walker documents 'missing' Accountants investigating the finances of Brent Walker received no supporting documentation for transactions alleged to be responsible for boosting the property and leisure group's profits, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Mr Michael Oldham, a Touche Ross accountant, told the court that he was one of a team appointed by the group's bankers in October 1990 to investigate and report on the financial state of the Brent Walker group. The team's inquiries were separate from those carried out by the Serious Fraud Office at about the same time. Mr Oldham asked for documentation about two Pounds 4.5m payments by Brent Walker to a Tunisian bank, but was told by Mr George Walker, the group's former chairman and chief executive, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, its former finance director, that these records had gone missing, he said. The two Pounds 4.5m payments were part of the attempt to conceal the profit-boosting, it was alleged. Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the accounts of the Brent Walker group. The prosecution alleges that the two men conspired to inflate the company's profits by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987. The trial continues today.</p>

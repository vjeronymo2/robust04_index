			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EC-Poland free trade pact hits car import snag EC complaints that Poland plans to discriminate in favour of imports from certain Community car-makers are threatening to delay implementation next week of a EC-Poland free trade pact, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. Member states were supposed to approve the accord at yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers, but France raised objections to Poland's plan to divide its quota of duty-free car imports between General Motors, Fiat and Volkswagen only. EC diplomats will discuss the problem in Brussels today. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry and internal market commissioner, said the legal services of the Commission and Council of Ministers agreed the Polish action infringed non-discrimination clauses in the accord. A French official said Paris wanted to ensure the clauses were observed, not take reciprocal action against Polish car exports to the EC. The agreement was signed last year, but at the end of last month, the Polish ministry of foreign economic relations said the quota of 30,000 passenger cars which could be imported free of duty from the EC would be split between Fiat, GM and Volkswagen as a reward for their promises of investment with Polish partners. But Mr Bangemann said member states were unanimous the move was discriminatory.</p>

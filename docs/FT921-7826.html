			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Bundeswehr set for radical reduction THE German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for a radical restructuring of its armed forces, cutting overall numbers from 495,000 to 370,000, restricting the call-up, and creating a new rapid reaction force. At the same time the government agreed that it was 'politically necessary' to amend the constitution with a 'clarification' to enable the armed forces to serve outside the Nato area in future. The new deal for the Bundeswehr was presented yesterday to the cabinet by Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defence minister, as the transformation of the existing armed forces into a 'training and mobilisation army'. The plan centres on the creation of a rapid reaction force at the heart of the Bundeswehr, involving seven brigades kept on a high state of readiness. In the army itself, the number of divisions will be reduced 48 existing brigades will be disbanded. The air force's Alpha Jet fighter bomber will be taken out of service, while the navy will be reduced from 180 to 90 'seaborne units'. In the civilian ranks of the defence ministry, 46,000 jobs will be done away with. Overall, the restructuring is intended to produce savings of DM43.7bn (Pounds 15.1bn) between now and 2004, Mr Stoltenberg told parliament. What the restructuring plan does not decide is the future of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) which is being developed jointly with Britain, Italy and Spain. The DM12bn earmarked for the aircraft remains in the medium-term defence budget. A decision will only be taken on the project later this year. Middle-ranking officers from all the Western European Union member states attended a working seminar in Bonn yesterday at which Germany and France spelt out their plans to create a new 'European defence corps'. As yet, however, the idea remains a purely Franco-German initiative aimed at the future expansion of the present Franco-German brigade into the nucleus of a future European force.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Down at Papa Paul's the joint is jumping A jungle of arc-lit freight yards and chemical storage tanks on the Mississippi at Baton Rouge; walls of leafless trees rising from the black water along the causeway in the Atchafalaya Swamp; hunters' pick-up trucks parked in the mist by the roadside. There is not much to see on a dark winter's morning on the highway west of New Orleans, writes Nicholas Woodsworth. Driving, I wonder why anyone bothers with such refinements as guns and hounds in Louisiana: there are opossums and racoons, muskrats and skunks, squirrels and porcupines squashed flat on the roads. At Eunice, in Prairie Cajun county, a sign - 'Links' - brings me to a halt at a gas station on the edge of town. 'Seven-course breakfast?' asks the man behind the till. For people passing through Eunice early on a Saturday morning, a seven-course breakfast is a link of Cajun boudin sausage and a six-pack of beer to go. Where are they going? To Fred's, in Mamou. I am on my way to Fred's, too, but decide to stick to a single course. Back in the car, the sausage is hot  -so spiced and fiery that I can feel my breath flaring out of my nostrils. I run back - blessed relief - for at least part of the remaining menu. Mamou is small but still I manage to get lost in its broad, flat grid of shacks and straggling bungalows and end up in front of Bett's Seafood Store. Eventually, back on Sixth Street, I see the sign I am looking for: 'Fred's Lounge - Cajun Music Capital of the World - Laissez les Bons Temps Rouler'. Can you actually translate 'Let the good times roll' in such literal fashion? In Mamou, on a Saturday morning, you can do almost anything you like. All the windows in Fred's are blacked out. Inside, 9am looks to me like 9pm. It is not just the lack of daylight; it is the cigarette smoke, the blinking neon beer signs hanging on pink walls, the packed crowds swilling Bud and vodka-and-7, the jukebox with the sign above saying 'No standing on the jukebox'. It is the couples locked in a fast-moving two-step that has them careening around the miniature dance floor like billiard balls. It is Donald Thibedeau and his band, Cajun Fever, pumping and scraping away in the corner for all they are worth. Fred's, as the saying goes, is an institution. Quite what kind of institution I am not sure, but Fred's has been letting rip early Saturday morning, week in and week out, for more than 30 years. Fred died not very long ago but his wife, Tante Sue, hosts an equally exuberant gathering. Its stated purpose is a live weekend broadcast by KKPI 1050 - the Voice of Cajun Country, a radio station down the road in Ville Platte. The real reason, though, is that Cajuns like to get together and laissez les bons temps rouler. The earlier they start, the further they roll. A plump man in a moustache and cowboy shirt is standing in front of Don Thibedeau's microphone and doing a little radio advertising between sets. He is reading the ads in French. My French is all right. But 'Charlie's Meat Market' and 'Goodyear Tyres' and 'live bait' and 'Cajun hot sauce' are the only phases I understand. The rest is a French so twisted by 300 years of emigration that not even the French understand what is being said. Tiny Tante Sue - who, with blue-rinsed hair, imitation pearl necklace and large-framed spectacles, looks like my grandmother - seems no more impressed than I. Swigging from a half-pint bottle of bourbon, she nudges the plump man away from the microphone, calls for Donald Thibedeau, and lets go a great whoop. As accordion, guitar, violin, steel pedal guitar and drums break into another rambunctious two-step, she jitterbugs off across the dance floor to grab a man. My grandmother might sometimes feel like acting that way, but I do not believe she ever has. All those packed into Fred's are wearing their finest cowboy boots, their cleanest baseball caps. It is, after all, the social occasion of the week, and rice fields, crawfish ponds, tractor repair shops and other workaday places are left far behind. I meet James and Anetta, who began dancing here in their teens and are still dancing here in their middle age. 'This is the same bar I grew up in - place hasn't changed at all', James tells me. 'Not even the people have changed.' Watching Tante Sue and others in their 60s, 70s and 80s bopping about and playing the fool, I realise he is right: these old people are just young people in disguise. Cajuns have the knack of staying young for life. I am not sure that I do. The morning wears on and the pace begins to tell. Two-stepping is tough. By noon, when everyone - including Tante Sue and the entire staff - piles out of Fred's, only to pile into Casanova's next door for the afternoon dance, I have had enough. I wander over to Jeff's Diner for the blue plate special: pork roast and potatoes, rice with gravy, snap peas, cake with bright pink icing for dessert. My fork is bent, my plate is plastic, but this is honest food for honest folk. Afternoon, and I am sitting on a doorstep in the pale winter sun with 70-year-old Pascal Fusilier, drinker, dancer, Cajun folklorist and columnist for the Mamou Acadian Press. Pascal is telling me about the decline and revival of Cajun culture. His generation, he says, saw great changes: the banning of French in schools; the passing of a subsistence economy with the discovery of oil; the opening up of remote swamp and bayou with the building of roads. When he was young, Cajun was a dirty word, a near-defunct culture. What brought it back? He points across Sixth Street to Fred's Lounge. 'Music', he says. 'We may forget how to speak French one day, but we'll never forget how to sing it.' Midnight in Mamou, and it is bitterly cold. Fred's is closed and most of white Mamou fast asleep. Black Mamou, though, is just waking up. Down on the edge of town, Papa Paul's dance hall is shaking, rattling and rolling as the wooden-plank floor begins to bounce beneath the rhythmic tread of dancing Creole feet. I am a bit nervous as I stand at the bar. I am the only white in the place. 'Kinda rough down there', they told me in Fred's. 'Papa Paul packs a pistol'. It was not just some Mamou tongue-twister: here is stern-looking Papa Paul at the cash register, a revolver in a holster at his hip. But everything turns out fine. The music is wonderful. Like Cajun music, Zydeco, the music of rural black Louisiana, is accordion-driven and usually sung in French. But it is music with soul, with spice, with Caribbean flavour. Indeed, Pooky and the Heartbreakers make Donald Thibedeau and Cajun Fever sound like hayseeds. Certainly, Pooky's music is too subtle for me to dance to. I did passably well at Fred's, but at Papa Paul's I step all over the feet of the young woman who is kind (and foolish) enough to dance with me. Two hours of Zydeco and I pack it in. It is exhausting. I lie in bed in the dilapidated hotel across from Fred's, but cannot sleep. It is freezing. There is a gas heater in the room, a vast, primitive thing that looks like a pre-industrial revolution experiment, all monstrous valves and knobs and stopcocks. It is useless. I cannot turn on the light, the room is too ugly. The wooden floor is painted grey, the peeling wallpaper brown, the bedspread the same pink as Fred's walls and Jeff's cake. And so I lie and, to the rhythm of remembered pieces, tap my toes against the metal bedstead and think of Mamou, Louisiana. Drive to the right place and you will find all sorts of things on a dark winter's morning on the highway west of New Orleans. Nicholas Woodsworth flew to New Orleans with Continental Airlines.</p>

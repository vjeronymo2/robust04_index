			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Wang seeks protection from creditors and cuts 5,000 jobs WANG Laboratories, the US company which wrought a revolution in office life by inventing computerised word processing, yesterday filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. In a last-ditch effort to survive, Wang plans to make about 5,000 employees redundant during the next 30 days - reducing its already shrunken workforce to about 8,000. Mr Richard Miller, chairman, said Wang's aim was to focus on the service business and the development and sale of software, and to shrink manufacturing operations. The objective, he said, was to become 'a smaller, more focused and more competitive company, with revenues of about Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 729m), compared with Dollars 1.9bn now'. Wang will, however, continue with the final assembly of its VS minicomputers, and sell computers made by others, including International Business Machines. At a press conference in Massachusetts, Mr Miller admitted that the company had even considered a Chapter 7 filing - which would have meant a liquidation of the company's assets. But he said: 'I don't think breaking up and selling the pieces of the company is in anyone's interests.' With sale or merger avenues exhausted, he said the company would attempt to draw up a business plan within weeks under bankruptcy court protection. The company's future has been uncertain for several years. It was founded in 1951 by Dr An Wang, a Chinese immigrant, and was successful throughout the 1970s with its proprietary minicomputer systems. As chip technology developed, however, Wang reacted slowly to the changes, and losses and debts started to mount. Wang negotiated a marketing and development alliance with IBM a year ago, with the larger company providing some funding for Wang. Mr Miller said yesterday he remained pleased with the relationship, and sales of IBM equipment by Wang salestaff were 'building'. Restructuring costs, however, compounded the financial problems, with the result that total debt at March 31 reached Dollars 540m - more than 10 times the company's 1991 net worth. The company yesterday announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 139.2m in the year to June 30, with a Dollars 116.3m deficit in the final quarter. This compares with a Dollars 385.5m loss in the previous 12 months, and was struck after restructuring costs and other one-off items of Dollars 51.9m (Dollars 22.8m). Revenues last year were Dollars 1.9bn (Dollars 2.09bn). Wang shares returned from suspension yesterday afternoon, and closed another 3/8 lower at 3/8. Alan Cane writes: Wang's UK subsidiary, which employs some 720 people, said yesterday it was not affected in the short term by its parent's bankruptcy. Chapter 11 provisions had no authority in Britain. The company said customers would still be supported. Lex, Page 16 American dream, Page 17</p>

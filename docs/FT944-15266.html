			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Citicorp makes quarterly record after lower taxes Citicorp vaulted to the top of the profitability league of big US commercial banks yesterday with record quarterly profits. The results were powered by strong advances in all parts of Citicorp's business, with none of the nasty surprises which have hampered the group's earnings in recent years. 'It has been a long time since we have had all the cylinders working together,' said Mr Tom Jones, Citicorp's most senior financial officer. The return on capital jumped to 22 per cent compared with 16 per cent a year before. The group's results were flattered by a lower effective tax rate, which at 34 per cent, down from 37 per cent, added around Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) to after-tax earnings. However even without this, Citicorp's profits beat most forecasts, lifting its shares Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 44 during the morning. While most other US commercial banks face the prospect of slow growth in domestic markets, Citicorp has benefitted from its large presence overseas, particularly in consumer banking. One result was that the bank's net interest margin - the average return it makes on its assets - rose during the latest period, at a time when other US banks are seeing margins fall. The net interest margin reached 4.37 per cent in the third quarter, up from 3.97 per cent in the same period a year before. Overall, Citicorp said after-tax income jumped to Dollars 894m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, from Dollars 528m, or 97 cents a share, the year before. Two factors underpinning this performance were a rebound in trading revenues after a dismal first half of the year and a sharp fall in its loan loss provisions. Trading income reached Dollars 287m, more than the Dollars 230m of the first two quarters combined. The provision for bad debts fell from Dollars 625m a year ago to Dollars 436m. 'This is the point of the credit cycle where we are at the low end (in terms of provisions),' said Mr Jones. He added that the bank remained wary about growth in its loans business. Commercial lending was only 2 per cent higher than a year before, while consumer loans were up 8 per cent. Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of Wells Fargo, the West Coast bank which also reported earnings yesterday, echoed this caution. Net earnings at Wells Fargo jumped 32 per cent. Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan and Wells Fargo all exceeded market expectations with third-quarter figures announced yesterday. US bank results, Page 31</p>

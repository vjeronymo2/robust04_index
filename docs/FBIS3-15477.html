			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin  believes that insufficient understanding of the importance of  the needs of the Army and of its role in society today is the  key to the conflict between the Finance Ministry and the Defense  Ministry over the budget. Kokoshin believes that, on the one  hand, a decreased defense order may bring about the collapse of  major manufacturers of defense products and negatively affect  the 15 million people employed by the military industrial  complex. On the other hand, a strong army is a guarantor of  success in implementing economic and political reforms today.  Though we do not have any external enemies any longer, the  Armed Forces now have a direct effect--albeit not immediately  obvious for ordinary people--on the social and economic  situation in the country by preserving a certain, though  fragile, balance in local conflicts in Tajikistan and the  Caucasian region.    [Begin Kokoshin recording] There is a danger of these  conflicts expanding and getting out of control, of their gradual  transformation into large-scale wars. Of course, the intensity  may vary at different stages, but they would have the most  negative effect on the internal stability in Russia. Should we  fail to keep in check the situation in those countries, imagine  what would happen if Russia were flooded by millions of  refugees. [end recording]    Kokoshin asserts that the Defense Ministry is not being  excessive in its demands, asking only for those resources that  would ensure the healthy operation of the Armed Forces and the  fulfillment of the defense order that has already been approved.  Incidentally, 70 percent of the expenditures are being  allocated for social needs. Social unrest among the military may  upset stability of the state itself.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fair balance Sir, I read with surprise A C Grayling's book review 'Balancing Terry Maher's books' (September 10/11). Is Mr Grayling certain that he looked at a balance sheet on Terry Maher? Accounting convention suggests that he has been looking at Terry Maher's profit and loss account or bank statements instead. The credit side of a balance sheet is normally associated with liabilities and the debit side with assets, therefore I would expect the memorable events of Terry Maher's life to date to be recorded as assets at net book value on the debit side of his balance sheet and the less memorable events as liabilities at face value on the credit side.

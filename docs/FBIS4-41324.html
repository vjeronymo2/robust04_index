			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Polishchuk] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- A mission representing the  United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation  opened its doors for work in the russian capital on Thursday.  "Our dreams have become a reality," UNESCO Director-General  Federico Mayor announced at the opening ceremony of the bureau.  "The opening of this mission became possible as a result of the  desire and determination of the Russian Government and the  UNESCO secretariat. It will permit the two sides to cooperate  more quickly and effectively," he said.    "Russia now occupies a most-important place in world  events,"  Mayor continued. "And our cooperation with it has developed  wonderfully in the past several years. We have a bunch of joint  initiatives, among which it would be worthwhile to note those  projects concerning the Russian state library, the Bolshoy  theatre, and the Hermitage," the director-general said.    "Our organisation's mission is first of all to preserve  peace," Mayor declared. "Despite the fact that the Cold War is  a thing of the past, our main goal on the eve of the XXI century  is to abolish poverty and forever put an end to wars."</p>

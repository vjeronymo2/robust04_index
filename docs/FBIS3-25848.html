The F-15I jet fighter is another model of the F-15E, which  McDonnell Douglas builds especially for Israel. Many consider  the F-15E the most advanced fighter in the world today.    Ben-'Ami said purchasing the F-15I fighters will improve the  "qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force.    Rabin's decision has put an end to the fierce two-year  competition between McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, with  McDonnell Douglas Company eventually winning the $2 billion  contract. According to the contract, the jet fighters will be  delivered to Israel by the end of 1997.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Textile trade pulls wool over eyes of consumers THE label on the dark grey Chinese-made men's suit claimed 'pure new wool,' and bore the International Wool Secretariat's symbol of quality, the Woolmark. Analysis showed the suit to be 68.1 per cent polyester. The label on a made-in-China sweater combined the pure wool symbol with the equally famous Lacoste crocodile and the slogan 'pure cotton.' The fake marks are the tip of an iceberg of Chinese abuse of international trademarks, licences, copyright and patents, which has angered businessmen and traders and earlier this year invited the threat of US trade sanctions. Alerted to the Woolmark abuse, the International Wool Secretariat began collecting evidence and at a press conference in Beijing warned of tough action against the culprits. Most are small township and rural enterprises in the freewheeling southern and eastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong and Hebei, where enterprising private manufacturers are producing fake wines, fake watches, fake bicycles and falsely labelled garments. Manufacturers bring in a suit from Taiwan or Hong Kong, pull it to pieces and remake it, down to its Made in Hong Kong label and the Hong Kong licence or serial number. Rolls of appropriate labels are available in city markets. In Tianjin the IWS found stick-on Woolmarks which attached to a suit could double its price. The Ministry of Textile Industry said the market was full of fakes and it could do nothing, but the Chinese Patent Agency, faced with mounting criticism abroad of China's abuse of registered trademarks, took action. Some private stores in Beijing's main shopping street have been fined, but fines are too small to be a deterrent.</p>

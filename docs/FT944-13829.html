			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Hothouse treatment or a spell in overalls? - Fast-track development programmes for high-flyers may need some rethinking Are managements doing enough to identify and develop the people who may end up leading their organisations? A new study suggests that fast-track programmes for high-flyers could benefit from a little more thought. What GHN, the career management consultant, calls a future top manager appears from the research to be typically something of an idealistic beast who, rather than needing hothouse treatment, would benefit far more from a bit of corporate 'national service' in overalls on the production line. The report compared the views of 204 personnel directors and managers with those of 103 men and women, aged between 27 and 35, identified by management or their peers as high-flyers. All worked in companies with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 80m. The report concluded that high-flyers needed to be brought down to earth. They understood little of what was needed of them and their self-image differed markedly from how they were perceived by personnel directors. Both groups agreed that three important qualities for potential top managers were leadership, communications skills and strategic thinking. However, the personnel directors rated several other skills or qualities as equally important such as intelligence, entrepreneurial ability and presentational skills. The high-flyers did not mark these highly. The groups disagreed widely over how much help or guidance the high-flyers needed, particularly in interpersonal skills. More than two-thirds of the personnel directors said that young managers needed to develop their skills in managing teams or subordinates, interpersonal relationships, communication and achieving flexibility in management style. In contrast, less than half of the future top managers said they needed help in managing people and the proportions admitting they needed guidance in developing other skills were lower still - fewer than a third were worried about communication and only a fifth thought they needed to develop more flexible management styles or interpersonal relationships. The high-flyers appeared more motivated by pay than their personnel chiefs thought they should be, although both groups agreed that job satisfaction was important for retaining loyalty and maintaining performance. Another finding was that women appeared to be getting a raw deal. Those questioned were not getting the breadth of training opportunities given to their male counterparts. One problem with the fast-track or hothouse approach is that inevitably some people will fall by the wayside. Equally there will be people in an organisation - the quiet workers who started as secretaries or clerical assistants on the assembly line - who are not identified in the selection process. What then happens when the high-flyer gets to the top of the tree aged 39 3/4 ? How long will he or she stay there and what will they do when they leave? GHN says the high-flyers should be shown how to take responsibility for their own careers and to protect their future employment prospects. Rover, the car maker, seems to have understood the danger of promoting ill-prepared managers. Each graduate must work for a time on the assembly line to help them understand the production process. The GHN report concludes that development of high-flyers needs greater preparation and scope. 'MBAs and traditional training techniques have their place, but they only represent one aspect of a person's development,' said Susan Bloch, a GHN consultant. 'Much greater emphasis is needed on broader management skills, including communications and interpersonal relationships which the survey asserts are positively received when delivered through coaching and mentoring.'

Employment Conditions Abroad, the trade association which provides international pay and cost-of-living statistics to help its member companies fix local and expatriate pay packages in different parts of the world, has just published its annual executive pay comparison. The graph on the right shows that, in terms of what a salary can buy, Hong Kong has leap-frogged Switzerland and Germany in the past year to head the league. The big movers have been Hong Kong and Singapore, reflecting executive pay awards in both countries which have moved upwards well ahead of inflation rates. Hong Kong companies are finding they have to pay high salaries to retain their best managers who may be tempted to leave for countries such as Canada to try to obtain a second passport. High pay is also needed to lure back those who have already acquired dual citizenship. Singapore's pay rates have been responding to the knock-on effect of companies seeking to expand their operations in response to pressures in Hong Kong. As well as earning high gross salaries, Hong Kong executives also have the benefits of a marginal tax rate of 15 per cent.

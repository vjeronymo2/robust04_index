			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOOK ON SIMI VALLEY DOCUMENTS CITY'S RISE  </P> <P> When the Lone Ranger heartily exclaimed "Hi-Yo Silver!" it was away into the  Simi Hills that he galloped.  </P> <P> When Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang "Happy Trails to You," it was in the Santa  Susana Mountains that they clip-clopped along.  </P> <P> These are some of the tidbits that Simi Valley resident and free-lance writer  Linda Aleahmad has included in her recently published book, "Simi Valley:  Toward New Horizons. An Illustrated History."  </P> <P> The book documents Simi Valley's rise from a small farming community to a  modern business center, one that next year will see the opening of the Ronald  Reagan Presidential Library.  </P> <P> "Simi Valley has a very special quality all its own," said Aleahmad, who spent  the past 18 months researching and writing the book. "There are over 100,000  people here, but it still has a small town feel to it."  </P> <P> Several pages in Aleahmad's book are devoted to Simi Valley's rich movie-making  history. Since 1937, the rock-studded hills at the eastern end of the city have  served as a backdrop for thousands of shoot-'em-up Westerns.  </P> <P> The book makes particular mention of the movie ranch once owned by the late  Hollywood stuntman Ray (Crash) Corrigan. Although the ranch, known as  Corriganville, was destroyed in a fire in 1965, efforts are now under way to  rebuild it.  </P> <P> Aleahmad, a member of the Simi Valley Historical Society who has lived in Simi  Valley for 20 years, said she does not consider her book to be a strict  historical account of the area. "I don't think I would call it a history book,"  she said. "It's more of an overview of the development of the valley."  </P> <P> The book, which will be distributed nationwide, was published by  Chatsworth-based Windsor Publications in cooperation with the Simi Valley  Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yan Meifu (0917 2734 4395): "Some Thoughts on </F> Economic Rewards and Penalties in Family Planning Work in a  Market Economy"]    [Excerpts]  Reexamining the Role of Economic Rewards and Penalties in  China's Population Control    Facts in the last 20 years prove that economic rewards and  penalties have played a very important role in China's family  planning. Their effect was decisive particularly among workers  in the cities, and it can be said that family planning work was  more effective in the cities than the rural areas because the  role and efficacy of economic rewards and penalties are  inseparable. For a long period of time, whenever one analyzed  why the urban birth rate was more effectively controlled than  rural birth rate, one often assumed that it was because urban  population had a higher educational and cultural level or better  access to social services, rather than forthrightly recognizing  that economic rewards and penalties were the most important  reason, and that penalties were much more effective when applied  in the cities than the rural areas. But those were the facts.    During the 1970-80s, the effectiveness of economic rewards  and penalties in family planning among urban workers could not  be duplicated in the rural areas: urban workers who violated  family planning rules were fined, denied bonuses, deprived of  wage increase, demoted or even discharged. These penalties were  aimed at the "life line" of workers at that time. One can just  imagine in the era when the necessities of life depended on the  coupons issued, the difficulties a worker faced if he lost his  "iron rice bowl" and had to support an extra mouth at home; one  can therefore easily appreciate why disobeying the system at  that time was out of the question, and why urban workers,  regardless of their desire for more children, did not dare give  birth to more of them. According to a survey of women with  one-child certificates in Beijing, their desired number of  children was two.[.sup]1[/] In point of fact, under this  reward-penalty system, workers in the cities were faced not with  a balancing between rewards and penalties, but with a cruel  choice between "existence" and "reproduction." Under normal  circumstances, man would not give up "living" for "reproducing."    In the urban areas, this forceful and effective system was  relied upon to control the reproductive behavior of workers.  From a long range perspective of population control, this type  of control was very beneficial and necessary. Psychology  recognizes that modifying man's reproductive behavior can help  change man's idea toward reproduction. After a suitable  reproductive behavior is developed and fortified, people would  change their idea of reproduction and family and, in the end,  when they see the various benefits to limiting family size, they  would consciously practice family planning. Among urban  populations today, the consensus is not to have more children,  and some people even do not want any children, suggesting that a  close relationship indeed exists between the former forceful and  effective reward-penalty system and the subsequent change of  reproductive behavior.    In the rural areas, economic penalties in family planning  never did carry the same degree of threat as in the cities.  This is because the context in which economic penalties were  applied was entirely different: peasants were not wage earners,  they had no bonuses to withhold or wages to cut, and they were  not afraid to be fired; they were responsible only for farming a  few mu of land and keeping up their own shelters, and the basic  principle of the socialist system itself limited the  applicability of economic rewards and penalties in rural areas.  Peasants who exceeded their birth quota could not be driven  from the field they were responsible for farming; this explained  why in the years when China's family planning work was  proceeding smoothly, the rural birth rate was much higher than  the urban birth rate. Data based on one percent sample of the  1987 population survey shows that the average number of births  for all Chinese women age 15-64 was 1.87, but 2.44 in the rural  areas; and that the overall rural birth rate was 2.6, while the  urban birth rate was 1.3. But this is only one aspect of the  problem, for we should recognize that since family planning has  been in effect, the rural birth rate has actually declined by a  large margin, and that economic rewards and penalties did play  an important role in the decline. This was because of the fact  that for over a decade, economic penalties for excess births  could deprive a rural family of a large part of its income for  the whole year, putting the family in straitened circumstances  and even poverty. This was not entirely without mental pressure  on families that exceeded their birth quota; they could not  calmly overlook the economic penalty imposed. According to a  study of villages in Hebei by Zhou Ping et al.,[.sup]2[/] if  peasants with single children (whether boys or girls) could  choose one of the following economic rewards if they agreed not  to have the second child -- additional land, wavier of  collective labor, or access to employment -- 57.3 percent, 56  percent and 68 percent respectively agreed; but if the penalty  for having the second child involved money or land, the  proportion of peasants that agreed not to have the second child  dropped from 71 percent (without any penalty) to 12.7 percent.  The investigators concluded therefore that to control births in  the rural areas, a light penalty is better than no penalty, and  a heavy penalty better than a light one. [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Difficulties Involved in Economic Penalties and Rewards in </H5> Family Planning    In recent years, following the growth of rural commercial  production enlivening the rural as well as urban economies, and  particularly with the rise of a market economy, the  reward-penalty system in family planning, which hitherto played  an important role in controlling population increase, has run  into difficulties.    To begin with, the single-child reward has lost its  psychological effect in the rural areas. One reason is the  measly reward. The "single-child subsidy" of several yuan per  month, unchanged for a decade or more, has only symbolic meaning  today and no effect whatsoever on peasants' reproductive  behavior. Another reason is that economic rewards in rural areas  were never conscientiously applied. Economic rewards such as  doubling the land allotment for home construction, planting  vegetables and grain, or priority for school admission and  promises of some other types of economic support, all of these  have become "open lies." Peasants neither believed nor were  they interested in these rewards. The writer personally learned  from a survey that a peasant named Zhang from Yaojia hamlet,  Chengbei village in Linsui county of Sichuan Province, was the  only one in that hamlet to respond positively that year to the  family planning appeal and therefore awarded the "one-child  certificate." When his child was 12 years old and he still had  not received a single fen of the "single child living subsidy,"  he petitioned the village authorities and after making repeated  requests for more than a year, he was given 300 yuan after  discount and deduction. As for an extra allotment of land for  his own use growing vegetables or building his house, he  received no response despite inquiries. On the other hand,  other families with multiple-births actually received several  more times his share of land which they had since celebrated  bountiful harvests. When the reward-penalty system loses its  credibility, families with single children are discouraged and  couples planning on having only one child also become  disheartened. In rural areas in China, many child-bearing age  couples would rather pay the penalties and have more than one  child, than accept the reward for having only one child.  Peasants cannot be blamed for these kinds of results. The  reward and penalty system, which encourages peasants to practice  family planning, limit the number of children and focus on the  quality of children, has reached the point of practically zero  effectiveness.    Furthermore, the reward-penalty system in rural areas today  no longer carries the same clout, and peasants who exceed the  birth quota are not at all afraid of the penalty, whether they  have money to pay for it or not. The market economy has changed  the former autarkic state of things in rural areas where eggs  were bartered for salt and oil, and peasants income has since  risen by a large margin; several hundreds or even thousands of  yuan in penalty would no longer put many peasants in straitened  circumstances or poverty, and they can come up with the money.  Today, many excess-birth families in the rural areas invariably  give birth only after consultations with parents and spouses and  with the required penalty money in hand; therefore, imposing a  fine on these newly rich peasants for excess birth amounts to no  more than "pulling one hair of a cow," having no effect at all  on their well being. To this group of peasants, the right to  give birth has become a market commodity. In the context of  family planning, such a viewpoint is wordless condemnation or  bitter satire of the policy. And in another ironic twist, even  poor peasant households are not afraid of the penalty, they dare  give birth because they don't have any money anyway to pay the  fine. This is another aspect of the difficulties the family  planning reward-penalty system finds in the rural areas today.    Peasants who have no money to pay the fine have no reason to  be afraid of any penalty; this group of poor peasants in fact is  a product of the developing market economy. When penalty is  imposed on these peasants for breaking the family planning  rules, they would invariably resort to tactics of "running wild,  cheating, denying, or running away." Relying on such tactics,  some having no qualm or fear of excess birth would, in complete  equanimity, simply say that "having no money to pay, [I'd] have  a life instead"; some would move [their possessions] to homes of  friends and relatives so that the cadre inspector, seeing they  hardly have a wok to cook in, could not in good conscience levy  the fine; some would delay paying the fine, offering up a few  yuan every six months, saying all the right things, and after  three or four years, stop paying altogether; others would  threaten their neighbors and create a scene in the village so  the people dare not reveal that their poverty was make-believe;  still others would utilize their relationships with friends and  relatives to obtain their share of land for growing vegetables  and building houses; and finally there are those who would  simply move away and disappear completely. All these make it  almost impossible for the planning reward-penalty system to  fulfill its role.    Turning to the urban areas, because the businesses need to  transform their operating system and enter into market  competition, they need to completely reform the system of  employment; with the "iron rice bowl" no longer intact, and a  system of wages and bonuses set up in replacement, workers and  enterprises have room to maneuver, and workers are free to move  in response to market demands. Therefore, the penalty in the  reward-penalty system which used to get workers "by the throat"  as it were, no longer carries that threat, and family planning  effectiveness correspondingly declines, and the at-one-time most  effective reward-penalty system now finds itself mired in  difficulties.    We should not treat lightly the fact that effectiveness of  the family planning reward-penalty system has diminished in a  market economy, because to do so can revive the workers' desire  for two or more children and, in time, lead to a backlash  against family planning in the cities. This is particularly  true for townships and villages below the county level. [passage  omitted]  Footnotes:    1. WENHUI BAO, 11 July, 1991    2.

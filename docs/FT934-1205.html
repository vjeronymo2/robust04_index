			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Paris to host Mideast talks Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation were set to resume talks in Paris today in an effort to break the deadlock over implementation of their peace accord. The meeting, announced yesterday by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, comes after the apparent failure of talks in Norway at the weekend. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said he could not confirm that talks would take place in Paris but Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said on Israel television that the two teams would meet again shortly. He said this showed that 'both sides believe we can bridge the differences'. Israeli officials said there was still dispute over who should control the borders of the Gaza-Jericho area, which will fall under Palestinian self-rule once Israeli troops complete a withdrawal. The officials said the Palestinians had presented a proposal for Palestinian control of the borders but with an international presence to stop arms cross-ing into Gaza-Jericho and with Israel exercising remote-controlled electronic supervision. Israel rejected the proposal and stood behind its refusal to concede control over the borders, which it sees as a matter of external security left exclusively to Israel under the peace agreement. Israel says it will allow a Palestinian presence at the borders but will not relinquish its veto over the right of entry into the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On the second sticking point - the size of the Jericho area - officials said there had been some progress and the Palestinians had scaled down demands; requesting an area of 200 sq km after an earlier call for 345 sq km. Israel has so far offered 27 sq km. However, Mr Jan Egeland, Norwegian deputy foreign minister who hosted the Norway talks, said both sides had made progress and had won compromise proposals. In Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the Norway talks had been neither a failure nor a success and said his summit meeting with Mr Arafat, scheduled for this week, would be delayed unless firm progress was made between the two sides. In Oslo yesterday, Palestinian economic officials met the World Bank and international donors to raise funds for a Palestinian police force. Palestinian officials said the World Bank had estimated Dollars 96m (Pounds 64.4m) would be needed to fund a 15,000-strong police force for the first year.</p>

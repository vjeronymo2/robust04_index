Sources at a national metallurgical working conference which  opened here today said that China is preparing to achieve the  target through enhancing technical renovations in major iron and  steel mills. More effort will be put into the expansion of  continuous casting, and the development of new technology and  new products.    Last year China produced 76 million tons of rolled steel, up  13.5 percent compared with the output of the previous year.

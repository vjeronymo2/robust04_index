TV Echo, founded and  operated by eight local enthusiasts, beamed its first six-hour broadcast, which  included programs on the Solidarity movement, street interviews with locals and  reports on price rises, to a potential audience of up to 1 million people. It  also relayed two hours of foreign satellite programs. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

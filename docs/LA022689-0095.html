			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUARDS ATTACKED AT JUVENILE HALL; 8 CRIPS ESCAPE  </P> <P> Eight gang members escaped from a maximum-security juvenile detention facility  in Downey after they overpowered two guards, tied them with bed sheets and  locked them in a closet early Saturday, authorities said.  </P> <P> The inmates, members of a Crips street gang from the Watts area, beat two  guards at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall and used the guards' keys to flee the  facility, said Sgt. Mark Dryer of the Downey Police Deparment.  </P> <P> Timothy Aitken, 23, a guard at the county-run facility, was attacked by at  least six youths when he was escorting an inmate back to a dormitory cell after  a trip to the bathroom at 3:45 a.m., said Shirley Gray, superintendent of the  facility.  </P> <P> One of the youths grabbed Aitken in a "bear hug" while five others hit him with  their fists, Dryer said. Fellow guard Troy Cole, 31, heard the disturbance and  went to help Aitken but was knocked unconscious, he said. All guards at the  facility are unarmed.  </P> <P> "One was just overpowered by sheer numbers, and the other was hit over the head  by an object believed to be a chair," Dryer said.  </P> <P> The youths then locked the guards in a utility closet, removed tables and  chairs from the dormitory and stacked them up to scale a 20-foot concrete wall  that surrounds the facility, Gray said. Two other youths who witnessed the  attack apparently used the opportunity to escape as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Were Gone'  </P> <P> Other guards saw the youths scaling the wall but could not prevent them from  escaping. "By the time they got there, they were gone," Gray said, adding that  the youths left a trail of footprints leading away from the facility. "(The  guards) also heard dogs barking in the neighborhood," she said.  </P> <P> Officials at the facility contacted sheriff's deputies and police from Downey,  South Gate and other cities to search for the youths. At 6 p.m. Saturday, one  of the eight, a 17-year-old youth, returned to the facility accompanied by  several family members. He gave authorities no information about the other  teen-agers.  </P> <P> By Saturday afternoon, four of the youths had already contacted relatives and  parole officers by telephone, Gray said. One apparently had second thoughts  about the escape.  </P> <P> "He called his uncle and told him he was distraught by what he had done," Gray  said, adding that the uncle said he was certain his nephew would turn himself  in.  </P> <P> Cole and Aitken were discovered in the closet by their fellow guards more than  an hour later, Gray said. Cole was treated for facial cuts at Downey Community  Hospital and released. Aitken was not injured.  </P> <P> Gray said the escapees are 14 to 17 years old and had been arrested for  offenses that include burglary and possession and sale of drugs.  </P> <P> The escape was only one of a series of gang-related attacks late Friday and  Saturday that left two men dead.  </P> <P> Late Friday, a Huntington Park man was killed by rival gang members who hit him  with a car and dragged him underneath for 200 yards.  </P> <P> Luis Chavez, 21, described by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as a "known  gang member," was standing at Gage Avenue and Loma Vista Place in Bell at about  10:30 p.m. when a sedan and light-colored pickup truck approached with an  unknown number of men, Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said.  </P> <P> After a short argument, Chavez escaped from the group, running south on Loma  Vista Place, Wehner said.  </P> <P> "The suspects got back in their vehicles, caught up with him and he was struck  by the car and dragged approximately 200 yards," Wehner said. Chavez was  pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, another alleged gang member, Jose Leon, 18, was killed and two  fellow gang members wounded in a drive-by shooting on 42nd Street near Long  Beach Avenue in South Los Angeles at about 8:30 p.m., Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Leon, shot in the stomach and torso, died at California Hospital. The other  victims, a 17-year-old male and Juan Lamas, 19, were in stable condition at  County-USC Medical Center, police said.  </P> <P> Saturday's escape at Los Padrinos was the first at the facility since 1987,  Gray said. Los Padrinos is one of three juvenile detention facilities operated  by the county. Similar facilities are in Sylmar and Lincoln Heights.  </P> <P> Los Padrinos houses 580 inmates, most of whom are awaiting criminal court  proceedings. Gray said the facility has a capacity of 410 youths but that the  overcrowding has not led to serious safety problems.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Atizapan, near Mexico City, was the center of a search for evidence linking the  drug-smuggling cult blamed for 13 ritual killings near the U.S. border with  other slayings in the capital, the government newspaper El Nacional reported.  The paper said the Mexico City killings took place over the last two years but  did not say how many people died. It said the attorney general's office, which  handles anti-drug efforts, had been asked to assist in the case. The cult's  suburban "safe house" and two apartments in Mexico City were raided four days  after police in Matamoros, 550 miles to the north, found 13 mutilated bodies  buried on a ranch.  </P></p>

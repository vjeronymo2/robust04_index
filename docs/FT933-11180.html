			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Freeman falls to Pounds 357,000 A DECLINE in profits from French operations and a loss in its Spanish offshoot left Freeman Group, the USM- quoted insulation, distribution and fabrication specialist, with pre-tax profits down from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 357,000 in the six months to June 30. Mr Euan English, chairman, said, however, that adverse short-term trading conditions should not cloud what the board believed to be encouraging prospects for the medium term. The results, in accordance with FRS 3, included exceptional income of Pounds 147,000 relating to the release of provision for expenses on discontinued operations. Turnover rose to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 28m), while interest rose to Pounds 373,000 (Pounds 282,000) mainly as a result of the cost of financing the Spanish subsidiary acquired last August. Earnings were 4.1p (4.9p) and the interim dividend is again 2p.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Poles apart Poland has stumbled into an impasse in its attempts to form a government, thanks not least to the constitution which hands the job of inviting someone to assemble the next one to President Lech Walesa. He long since announced he'd ask the winning party to give him three names from which to choose. But he's still waiting for them, even though the elections 11 days ago produced a winner in the Left Democratic Alliance - SLD for short - which has agreed with the Polish Peasant party or PSL not only on forming a coalition, but also apparently on who should head the cabinet. While the SLD wants to meet Walesa to advise him of the choice, he has decided to stand on his dignity. Hence he's insisting that the meeting cannot take place until he is handed the three names he originally requested. In response, the parties are digging in too, with the SLD playing down the delay by saying it is continuing discussions with the PSL on a common programme. But cracks seem to be appearing in the agreement - with the PSL accusing the post-communist economists of being over- attached to liberal, free-market doctrines. So who knows? Does Walesa hope the two parties will break apart before they get to meet him?</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil soars 12 per cent Renewed optimism over former economy minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy spurred stock prices 12.1 per cent higher in heavy trading on the Sao Paulo bourse. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares closed 2,176 up at 20,085. Turnover was high at Cr430.1bn (Dollars 262.2m). Analysts said the congressional approval late on Wednesday of a key presidential decree creating Brazil's single price index (URV) and the possibility of new support from former president Jose Sarney were seen as helping Mr Cardoso's candidacy. Mr Sarney still had not decided what to do after a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday virtually blocked him from running for the presidency. But analysts said there was a great chance he would support Mr Cardoso. Brazilian stocks dropped sharply over recent weeks after opinion polls showed leftist candidade Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had extended his lead to 41 per cent, against 17 per cent for Mr Cardoso.</p>

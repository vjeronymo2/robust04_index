			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Leyland DAF startsrecruiting workers LEYLAND DAF has started re-cruiting production workers for the first time in two years, in a sign that the UK commercial vehicle industry's worst slump for 50 years may be ending. This move by one of the UK's two biggest truck makers will add to hopes that the UK economy may be poised for an upturn after a recession that started in the second half of 1990. Expectations about an upturn were fed by Thursday's lower-than-expected rise in unemployment. They have also bolstered trading on the London stock market: in five trading days since the general election the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares has put on more than 200 points. The rally ran out of steam on Thursday when the index closed 1.6 off at 2,638.6. Leyland DAF's recruitment move coincides with the release of statistics showing total UK commercial vehicle output up more than 40 per cent last month compared with March 1991. Exports showed strong growth. The statistics, published jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Office of Information, show that car output rose 8.44 per cent in March compared with the corresponding month a year before. Leyland DAF's main rivals have yet to follow its recruitment move, which is a modest one. It is taking on 60 people - increasing the shop-floor workforce to just under 700. The recruits will be given three-month contracts as a precaution against signs of recovery petering out. Nonetheless the Lancashire-based manufacturer, which is competing with Iveco Ford for leadership of the UK truck market, said that the economy should benefit from a 'stable period' after the general election. Demand from other European countries, notably Germany, has boosted Leyland DAF's truck sales. Output is running 10 per cent higher than a year ago and is expected to rise by a further 10 per cent in the immediate future. For the UK as a whole, total commercial vehicle output in March, at 29,058, was 40.74 per cent higher than the same month a year ago when the figure was 20,647. First-quarter output was 15.09 per cent above the previous year's period at 66,708, from 57,963. Output for export in March was 78.22 per cent higher at 16,567, and for the quarter 44.71 per cent up at 39,196. Recovery hopes rise, Page 3</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] has asked Alioune Blondin Beye, special  representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, to use his  good offices to ensure that the weapons coming from Russia, and  detected in England, do not arrive in Angolan ports. Unofficial  British sources said the day before yesterday that the United  Kingdom's sea authorities on 8 January detained a ship carrying  war materiel coming from Russia on its way to Angola. The  United Kingdom's law stipulates that all controlled material,  such as weapons, passing through its territorial waters obtain  export permits.</p>

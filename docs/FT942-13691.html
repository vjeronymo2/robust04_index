			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Baillie Nippon share issue Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon, an investment trust specialising in smaller Japanese companies, is seeking between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m new capital through a conversion share issue, writes Bethan Hutton. The issue will be by way of a placing and open offer to existing share and warrant holders, rather than a full public offer. After conversion, new warrants with a longer life than existing warrants will be attached to the new ordinary shares. Demand for Japanese investment trusts is currently strong so shares in Shin Nippon are trading at a premium to net asset value. This makes a new issue relatively attractive.</p>

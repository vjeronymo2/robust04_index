			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY TO PROVIDE 10-ACRE SITE FOR ABUSED-CHILDREN CENTER  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors agreed Wednesday to provide a 10-acre,  county-owned Kearny Mesa site to a private group to build a $15-million center  to care for abused children.  </P> <P> The staggering rise in child abuse in recent years spurred the five supervisors  to unanimously support a public/private partnership proposed by the nonprofit  Child Abuse Prevention Foundation.  </P> <P> Under the joint venture, the foundation will raise funds for the center's  construction. But, once built, the center will be turned over to the county,  which will then own and operate it.  </P> <P> If the foundation can't raise the initial $15 million, however, the project  could be scrubbed.  </P> <P> Jennifer Vanica, the foundation's executive director, said the proposed 130-bed  center will provide emergency shelter, counseling and prevention services. Fund  raising will start soon, she said.  </P> <P> Over the next two to three months, the foundation and the county's department  of social services will determine the specific services the center will  provide, its design and its operating costs. Though plans are still sketchy,  Vanica hopes to have the new center in partial operation by 1993.  </P> <P> "Very seldom does the private sector come to us and say they'd like to build  something for us," Supervisor Susan Golding said. "We have to take advantage of  such opportunities.  </P> <P> "This center will be able to care for those children who are afraid and  fearful," she said. "It will allow them to become normal, healthy, functioning  children of our society, and it gives their parents a chance, too. It can help  educate parents who may not know how to take care of their children."  </P> <P> Foundation statistics show that the number of referrals to the county's child  protective services department escalated to 45,800 cases in 1987 from 11,500 in  1982 -- a 300% increase. Although growing public awareness and increased  attempts to fight child abuse account for much of the increase, Vanica said the  rise in drug use, population growth and poverty also contribute to the problem.  </P> <P> Supervisor Leon Williams said he recognizes the need for a comprehensive care  center, but said he is concerned about the county's ability to maintain and  operate it once completed.  </P> <P> But the center's supporters said the foundation plans to establish a $3-million  endowment and sponsor continuing fund-raisers to help pay for operational  costs.  </P> <P> In addition, Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative officer, said the  bulk of operating costs for such centers is provided by state and federal  money.  </P> <P> The annual operating cost of the 20-bed Hillcrest Receiving Home, the county's  sole existing shelter, is $1.78 million, but the county pays only 10% of that.  When completed, the center will replace the Hillcrest facility, Hickey added.  </P></p>

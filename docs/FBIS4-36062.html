			<p>BFN     [Text] Little Aden, Yemen, June 5 (AFP) -- Northern  warplanes firing a missile blew up two vast oil storage tanks  during a raid on Aden's refinery on Sunday [5 June], officials  said.    A 25,000 tonnes container of crude oil burst into flames  after northern warplanes launched an air-to-ground missile,  setting fire to the neighbouring tank, refinery director Fadl  Haydar told AFP.    Firemen aided by volunteers used foam to try to contain  towering flames in a desperate bid to stop the blaze spreading  to the four neighbouring tanks.    Haydar warned the whole plant "could be set alight if we  don't extinguish the fire quickly."    Hundreds of people living nearby fled their homes in panic  as  waves of intense heat and smoke radiated from the burning tanks.    "It's hell, it's hell," shouted one lorry driver, heading  east away from the scene with his family towards the southern  stronghold of Aden.    A southern military spokesman said fire "broke out in a fuel  storage tank at the refinery," which is about 10 kilometers (six  miles) from the center of the southern stronghold of Aden after  the northern air raid.    Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the  others escaped, he said without specifying how many took part in  the attack.    The facility, which refines some 140,000 barrels a day, is  the largest in Yemen and the only one supplying southern troops  who have been locked in a grim battle with northern rivals since  May 5.    Haydar said the refinery's other installations had not been  touched and there had not been any casualties.    A southern military spokesman denounced it as a "cowardly"  raid and a "flagrant challenge" to the UN Security Council  resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the month-old  war.    It is the third attack in a week on the refinery. The two  others missed their target and wounded about 10 people in  neighbouring districts.    Meanwhile in Aden queues quickly formed at petrol stations  as  residents learnt of the attack in a statement broadcast by  southern leaders.    Neither side in the war which has pitted troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southerners who back 'Ali  Salim al-Bid has respected the UN's ceasefire call adopted  Wednesday.</p>

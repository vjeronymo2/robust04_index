Total output reached 1.3 million tons last year, up 60  percent over 1992. This accounts for one-seventh of the  country's total and lifts the province as the second largest  apple grower.    Most parts of Shaanxi are situated on the loess plateau,  which is blessed by ample sunshine and has wide difference in  temperature between day and night. The location and the climate  make the site ideal for apple growing.    Since 1984, more than 20 counties have been converted into  apple growing centers. The acreage soared from the 123,500  acres in 1985 to around 823,500 acres last year. Quality stock  make up over 80 percent of all the fruit trees planted.    Some counties have set up factories to produce apple juice  for other countries.    The development of the fruit orchards has greatly helped  farmers to improve their lives. Most of the apple growers now  live in newly-built brick-and-wood houses instead of the earth  caves where they used to dwell. Eight out of ten families own  TV sets and 70 percent of homes have motorcycles and tractors.    The income from the apples enabled the local people to  increase input in grain production too.</p>

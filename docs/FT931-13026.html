			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Sears closes the book on US mail-order catalogue SEARS ROEBUCK yesterday closed the book on its mail-order catalogue, a distinctive part of American life for a century and the foundation of the company's retail business. The end of the catalogue business was announced as part of a restructuring which will also result in the closure or disposal of 150 stores and the loss of 16,000 full-time and 34,000 part-time jobs. Sears will take a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) after-tax charge against earnings for the fourth quarter of 1992. 'The catalogue is our heritage, it's how Sears started,' Mr Arthur Martinez, who came from Saks Fifth Avenue last October to run Sears' troubled merchandise division, said yesterday. 'However, we have concluded we cannot improve our market position or achieve an acceptable return fast enough or with sufficient certainty to justify remaining in the business.' The catalogue has lost between Dollars 135m and Dollars 175m annually during the past three years, despite circulating to 14m households and pulling in sales revenues of about Dollars 3.3bn. It traced its roots to 1887, when Richard Warren Sears, a former telegraph agent with the Minneapolis and St Louis Railway, published his first circular selling watches and jewellery. By 1896, when the Sears general merchandise catalogue was launched, his publication had expanded to 532 pages and offered products from clothing to baby carriages. For many decades, the business prospered, becoming a mainstay for isolated farming communities in the midwestern US. Sears moved into 'main street' retailing in the 1920s, building up a chain of more than 800 department stores. The combined catalogue and high street operations made Sears the largest US retailer in the US until the late 1980s. Recently, however, Sears has faced mounting pressure from lower-cost rivals  -discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart and the warehouse clubs. In response, Sears has announced a series of restructuring measures, aimed at lowering costs and improving efficiency. Overall, 40,000 Sears jobs have been shed since 1990, although the retailer still employs some 350,000 people. Sears, based in Chicago, said that the latest overhaul, which will take a year to implement, should improve after-tax profits by about Dollars 300m a year. It has four major elements: Closure of the catalogue operation, based in Skokie, a Chicago suburb. This move accounts for Dollars 800m of the Dollars 1.7bn restructuring charge. Sears will, however, retain its profitable 'direct response' business, which is a more streamlined form of mail order. Closure of 113 of Sears' smaller retail outlets, plus disposal of its 35 Pinstripes Petites women's speciality stores. Further job cuts, through an accelerated consolidation of various administrative functions, plus a voluntary early retirement incentive programme. The 'repositioning' of major merchandise lines and service support operations. For example, the Sears Tire and Auto Centers will focus on tyre and battery sales and end certain other services, such as tune-ups. The Dollars 1.7bn restructuring charge will be accompanied by Dollars 200m write-down of real estate held by Homart, a property development subsidiary, and a Dollars 1.9bn non-cash charge resulting from the change in US accounting policy for non-pension retirement benefits.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker Jose De Venecia yesterday expressed  predicted increased trade between the Philippines and the  People's Republic of China following an agreement to establish  consulates in both countries. [sentence as published]    The Chinese government agreed to set up a consulate in Cebu  and for the Philippines to set up its own consulate in Xiamen  City during a visit to Beijing by Filipino legislators led by De  Venecia.    De Venecia said the Philippines would be the first country  to  be allowed to set up a consulate in the southern part of China  since 14 consulates were closed down in 1949 during the takeover  of the Communist Party.    De Venecia, together with Rep. Antonio Cuenco, Victor Ortega  and Roque Ablan, held talks with President Jiang Zemin, Speaker  Qiao Chi and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and  leaders from the Inner Mongolia, Shanghai and Xiamen.    "We expect tens of thousands of mainland Chinese tourist to  come to the Philippines because of the improving standard of  living in southern China resulting from the area's annual growth  of 20 to 30 percent -- which is the highest in the world," de  Venecia said.</p>

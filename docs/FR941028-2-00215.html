			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Glossary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This glossary contains many of the terms used in the guidelines, as well as others that are encountered frequently by persons who implement TB infection-control programs. The definitions given are not dictionary definitions but are those most applicable to usage relating to TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acid-fast bacilli (AFB): Bacteria that retain certain dyes after being washed in an acid solution. Most acid-fast organisms are mycobacteria. When AFB are seen on a stained smear of sputum or other clinical specimen, a diagnosis of TB should be suspected; however, the diagnosis of TB is not confirmed until a culture is grown and identified as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adherence: Refers to the behavior of patients when they follow all aspects of the treatment regimen as prescribed by the medical provider, and also refers to the behavior of HCWs and employers when they follow all guidelines pertaining to infection control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aerosol: The droplet nuclei that are expelled by an infectious person (e.g., by coughing or sneezing); these droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air and can transmit M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to other persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIA: The American Institute of Architects, a professional body that develops standards for building ventilation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air changes: The ratio of the volume of air flowing through a space in a certain period of time (i.e., the airflow rate) to the volume of that space (i.e., the room volume); this ratio is usually expressed as the number of air changes per hour (ACH).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air mixing: The degree to which air supplied to a room mixes with the air already in the room, usually expressed as a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> mixing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> factor. This factor varies from 1 (for perfect mixing) to 10 (for poor mixing), and it is used as a multiplier to determine the actual airflow required (i.e., the recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the actual ACH required). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alveoli: The small air sacs in the lungs that lie at the end of the bronchial tree; the site where carbon dioxide in the blood is replaced by oxygen from the lungs and where TB infection usually begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anergy; The inability of a person to react to skin-test antigens (even if the person is infected with the organisms tested) because of immunosuppression.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anteroom: A small room leading from a corridor into an isolation room; this room can act as an airlock, preventing the escape of contaminants from the isolation room into the corridor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area: A structural unit (e.g., a hospital ward or laboratory) or functional unit (e.g., an internal medicine service) in which HCWs provide services to and share air with a specific patient population or work with clinical specimens that may contain viable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> organisms. The risk for exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in a given area depends on the prevalence of TB in the population served and the characteristics of the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASHRAE: The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., a professional body that develops standards for building ventilation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asymptomatic: Without symptoms, or producing no symptoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bacillus of Calmette and Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine: A TB vaccine used in many parts of the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BACTEC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : One of the most often used radiometric methods for detecting the early growth of mycobacteria in culture. It provides rapid growth (in 7&hyph;14 days) and rapid drug-susceptibility testing (in 5&hyph;6 days). When BACTEC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is used with rapid species identification methods,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> can be identified within 10&hyph;14 days of specimen collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Booster phenomenon: A phenomenon in which some persons (especially older adults) who are skin tested many years after infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have a negative reaction to an initial skin test, followed by a positive reaction to a subsequent skin test. The second (i.e., positive) reaction is caused by a boosted immune response. Two-step testing is used to distinguish new infections from boosted reactions (see Two-step testing).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bronchoscopy: A procedure for examining the respiratory tract that requires inserting an instrument (a bronchoscope) through the mouth or nose and into the trachea. The procedure can be used to obtain diagnostic specimens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Capreomycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily for the treatment of drug-resistant TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cavity: A hole in the lung resulting from the destruction of pulmonary tissue by TB or other pulmonary infections or conditions. TB patients who have cavities in their lungs are referred to as having cavitary disease, and they are often more infectious than TB patients without cavitary disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemotherapy: Treatment of an infection or disease by means of oral or injectable drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cluster: Two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within a 3-month period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational group, and epidemiologic evidence suggests occupational (nosocomial) transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contact: A person who has shared the same air with a person who has infectious TB for a sufficient amount of time to allow possible transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversion, PPD: See PPD test conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Culture: The process of growing bacteria in the laboratory so that organisms can be identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cycloserine: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for treating drug-resistant TB.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

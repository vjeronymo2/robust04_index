			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Risk at Lloyd's BLIGHTED LIVES, dashed hopes, wrecked health and happiness: after any great boom comes the reckoning. The boom at Lloyd's in the 1980s was proportionately as great, in terms of reckless overcapacity, as in any of the world's financial markets. The tragedies are those of gullible people sucked into a bubble. Lloyd's victims feel a special bitterness. Membership of the society was too often offered as a privilege of friendship, not a commercial investment. The bitterness of this legacy, and the litigation to which it has given rise, is one of Lloyd's most pressing problems. Unless it is resolved, it poisons the market's chances of building on the sharp recovery in the underlying conditions of business reported at yesterday's AGM. It will prevent the large-scale influx of new capital, probably in a corporate, limited-liability form, on which Lloyd's future depends. The losses of the worst-hit groups of syndicates, those where Names have the best chance of making a legal case against the former managers, run to at least Pounds 1.8bn. Where can the money be found to settle these claims out of court? One possible source is the funds available in the E&amp;O syndicates - the insurers who would bear the cost of any proven misconduct by managers - which for these syndicates are put at Pounds 700m-Pounds 900m. The E&amp;O insurers would obviously seek to avoid paying out this much, and a contribution from Lloyd's central funds would also be necessary. The Lloyd's management appears to be hoping to keep any such contribution, effectively a levy on the general membership, below Pounds 100m. So the chances of a settlement revolve around how much the E&amp;O insurers can be pushed into paying, how much more Lloyd's is prepared to pay from central funds, and the proportion of the losses which the Names are to bear. This crude arithmetic suggests that a deal to pay, say, 50p in every pound of these syndicates' losses is just about achievable, if the Names can be persuaded to settle for such a figure. If they cannot, or if the funds run short even at this level, Lloyd's may find itself pressed to re-examine the options it has fiercely rejected - levying an extra entry fee on would-be corporate investors; or borrowing against future profits to pay off past losses. The stakes are high. Without a solution, Lloyd's may be unable to trade its way back to prosperity and a secure future. Lloyd's deserves the best efforts of its managers and members in the crucial phase of negotiations over the settlement that lie ahead. Meanwhile, down in the Caribbean, the hurricane season is starting. A string of natural disasters, depleting the market's capital, would greatly hamper the task of finding the money for a settlement. The odds are very finely balanced.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Cathedrals share Pounds 4m for repairs English Heritage yesterday announced grants totalling more than Pounds 4m for 43 cathedrals to help pay for urgent repair and conservation work. The two largest grants, each of Pounds 500,000, go to Salisbury cathedral and the Roman Catholic cathedral in Liverpool. In Salisbury the cash will be used for conservation of the west front and on the stonework, lead roof and windows. In Liverpool it will form part of Pounds 1.5m to be spent over the next three years on roof repairs and waterproofing. Ely, Lincoln and Gloucester cathedrals are to receive Pounds 250,000, Pounds 225,000 and Pounds 224,000 respectively. English Heritage has been supporting cathedrals for three years and has given grants totalling Pounds 15m to 54 of England's 61 cathedrals. Three cathedrals are offered grants for the first time. These are Newcastle (Pounds 25,000), Southwark (Pounds 20,000) and Sheffield's Roman Catholic cathedral (Pounds 70,000). Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, has made the Liverpool Roman Catholic cathedral a Grade II listed building. He described the tent-shaped structure as 'an imaginative work of 1960s architecture'. The cathedral - affectionately known in Liverpool as 'Paddy's Wigwam' - was designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd and built between 1962 and 1967. Mr Brooke said its 'striking shape and elegant lantern tower have come to be recognised as an entirely successful addition to the Liverpool skyline'.</p>

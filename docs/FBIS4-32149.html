			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 17 (BTA) -- "Mass privatization will  get off the ground and whoever tries to hinder it is bound to  lose. I do not believe that the president will be the one to  stand in its way," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after his  meeting with President Zhelyu Zhelev today. They talked about  mass privatization and the Privatization Act for an hour. In  the last few days, the president has been holding consultations  with experts, law-makers, and representatives of the private  business and the public sector on the Privatization Act  amendments providing for mass privatization. The president is  expected to decide whether to impose a suspensory veto on the  act by June 23.    Asked if Dr. Zhelev was going to veto the act, Dr. Berov  said  that it was up to the president to decide, adding that the  balance was hardly tipped that way. "Referring the act back to  parliament will be a losing move and I do not believe that the  president will do it," Prime Minister Berov emphasized. In his  view, those who advised the president against mass privatization  were guided by self-seeking interests.    "In addition to the implementing regulations, the  Privatization Act should be complemented with an act on the  investment privatization funds," Prof. Berov said. However, he  doubts that the incumbent parliament will have time to adopt  such legislation. He said that all issues arising in connection  with the Mass Privatization Act will be regulated by decrees and  ordinances. According to Prof. Berov, the list of the 500  enterprises subject to privatization is not final and can always  be corrected, but it serves as a basis one can proceed from.    "I have been mandated by this parliament to work until the  end of September and do a certain job, and that is what I am  doing. If the application of the Privatization Act is delayed,  then parliament will have its say," Prime Minister Berov said  when asked if he would resign in case of a presidential  suspensory veto on the Privatization Act. "Parliament should  either revote the act or accept the veto," he said.</p>

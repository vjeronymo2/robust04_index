			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING / CALIFORNIA CUP;  </P> <P> CONSISTENCY PUTS CHANCE IN THE LEAD  </P> <P> Davis Pillsbury's Holua and Bob Doughty's Evolution won the first two races  Friday, but Dennis Durgan steered Bob McNulty's defending champion Chance to  consistent second- and third-place finishes to lead the 28th California Cup for  ultralight 70s off Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> There are two more races today and one Sunday on windward-leeward courses of  various lengths.  </P> <P> Twelve boats are competing in the sixth year the Cal Cup has been staged  exclusively for the sleds.  </P> <P> Winds had been strong all week, a condition that favored Mitch Rouse's Taxi  Dancer, which placed first on corrected time in the Transpac last year. But in  breezes fading from only 10 knots to four Friday, the Reichell/Pugh 68, with Ed  Lorence at the helm upwind, could manage only a fifth and a third.  </P> <P> In Friday's first race of three laps and 18 miles, Bill Menninger steered the  Santa Cruz 70 Holua past Ed McDowell's Grand Illusion on the downwind finishing  leg to win by 1 minute 18 seconds.  </P> <P> As the winds lightened, the second race was shortened to two laps and eight  miles. Doughty, a Los Angeles furniture dealer, was on port tack at the first  windward mark and had to yield right of way and duck behind the lead boats.  Then he came from sixth place and passed Chance on the last leg to win by 13  seconds.  </P> <P> The fleet split into two flights on the first day. Seven boats were still  competitive, but the other five -- including 1985 winner Kathmandu and '87  winner Ole (then Citius) -- appeared out of the running.  </P> <P> Two-time winner Blondie, purchased by Long Beach businessman Peter Tong only  two weeks ago, was in sixth place.

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Dorling Kindersley The stock market lathered itself into such excitement about Dorling Kindersley's prospects that the scale of its disappointment has been correspondingly great. After last year's flotation, the group's shares shot up to a peak rating of 35 times historic earnings. An attractive illustrated books business combined with the multi-media appeal of its trading association with Microsoft made Dorling Kindersley a market darling. Now, a second profits warning in as many weeks and the abrupt departure of its managing director has dented that image. The present inability to quantify the scale of the distribution difficulties at Tiptree adds a real edge of nervousness given that 20 per cent of its sales go through the business. New problems at its educational business indicate another worry. Against that, the company's potential in multi-media remains intact and the appointment of Microsoft's business development director to its board helps shore up confidence. But how well the management resolves the dispute with Tiptree may provide a good test of its competence to exploit opportunities elsewhere.</p>

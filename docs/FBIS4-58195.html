			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman -- Fatah Central Committee member Hani  al-Hasan has called for the establishment of a  Jordanian-Palestinian popular front formed from the popular  political bodies, forces, and personalities in order to contain  the dangers of the Oslo Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to  develop a common understanding among all the influential forces  in the society.    Addressing a symposium organized by the International and  Islamic Studies and Information Center, moderated by Bilal  al-Tall, head of the center, in the presence of the secretaries  general of the parties, al-Hasan added: We are on the threshold  of a new and serious stage, especially since it was agreed in  Bucharest that meetings would begin on 3 May and that an  agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides would be  signed on 5 May regardless of the outstanding problems. The  signing will be accompanied by the entry into Gaza and Jericho  of a 6,000-strong Palestinian police force and 500 civilians who  will work in various departments. Al-Hasan described the entry  of the Palestinian police force as a fireworks display.    He called for concentrated efforts during the next phase to  confront and find an alternative to the Israeli strategy,  especially since Israel is currently undergoing political,  security, and economic difficulties.

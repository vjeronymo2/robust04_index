			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY  </P> <P> In response to "Germany Needs to Face This Honestly" (editorial, Oct. 5):  </P> <P> Newly unified Germany is an easy target for potshots these days. In addition to  already existing nervousness about its past, the (German Economics Minister  Helmut) Haussmann report has brought to light recent involvement in supplying  Iraq with materials or aid for the production of chemical, biological and  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The editorial also points an accusing finger at France and the Soviet Union.  Our own contributions to international armament and greed are written off  lamely with, "Americans may also have helped."  </P> <P> Granted, Germany's actions in this area are reprehensible. But when did our own  greed become more ethical than Germany's? America's capacity to condemn others  from a position of moral outrage while maintaining a marvelous amnesia  concerning our own past actions is one of our most grievous national  characteristics.  </P> <P> Honesty? Greed? Physician, heal thyself!  </P> <P> ANNE HORMANN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Spanish rally on better inflation figures SPANISH government bonds rallied on news of better-than-expected inflation figures and indications that the government will start issuing short-dated paper next month. The CPI rose 0.3 per cent in July and by 5.2 per cent year-on-year, well below expectations. The 10-year government bond opened with a yield of 12.24 per cent and ended the day at 12.12 per cent. In Portugal, news that the central bank will lift all controls on capital movements by the end of 1992 was seen as giving encouragement to the Portuguese debt market. The Bank of Portugal said all remaining limits on capital movements would be lifted in three steps between August 31 and December 31. It said non-resident investors would be allowed to resume trading in floating interest rate bonds (FIPs) from October 31. Foreigners invested heavily in FIPs, which carried coupon rates of over 19 per cent at the time the central bank banned non-residents from buying them on July 5 1991. AUSTRALIAN government bonds continued to tumble yesterday due to the combination of the Australian dollar's weakness, concern about the Budget on August 18, and disappointment that interest rates are unlikely to be cut further. Turnover on the Sydney Futures Exchange reached a record level at 213,000 contracts, including a record 47,000 lots of the 10-year bond futures contract and a near-record of 63,000 lots of the three-year bond futures contract. The 10-year bond future fell from 91.64 at the opening to a low of 91.42 before recovering to trade at 91.58 in London time. In the cash market, the 10 per cent October 2002 bond ended the day yielding 8.51 per cent, against 8.36 per cent at Wednesday's close. AFTER a mixed bag of economic reports had left US Treasury prices unmoved in morning trading, the long end of the market fell sharply mid-afternoon under the weight of the new supply. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down one full point at 107 3/32 , yielding 7.397 per cent. In contrast, the two-year note was only down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to carry a yield of 4.149 per cent. The day's economic news was inconclusive. Bond market sentiment was buoyed by the 0.1 per cent rise in July consumer prices, while the bigger-than-expected 0.5 per cent gain in last month's retail sales was offset by the downward revision in the June sales data to show a 0.3 per cent fall. Weekly jobless claims fell more than anticipated, but the figures were distorted by special factors such as the shutdowns at General Motors' plants. The only other influence on the market yesterday was the afternoon sale of Dollars 10bn in 30-year bonds. Although the auction went well, a lack of a buying after the sale, and concern about the impact of the new supply on prices, left bonds sharply lower at the long end. HOPES of a cut in interest rates helped to buoy Japanese government bonds. Although dealers noted some selling of 10-year bonds early in the day, they said prices picked up later as investors bought at the lower levels. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 4.92 per cent and closed at 4.90 per cent. UK government bond prices slipped back on sterling weakness and funding concerns despite in spite of the release of favourable economic news. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.13 to 96.09, while the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 dropped  9/32 to 114 5/16 . The fall in prices was held in check by good average earnings figures which showed a fall from 6.25 per cent in May to 6.0 per cent in June. SCANDINAVIA'S government bond markets suffered sharp price falls with political uncertainty hitting the Danish market while funding concerns helped to push up Swedish bond yields, The Danish 8 per cent bond due 2003 dropped from 90.50 to 89.80 on fears that a general election could be called shortly, but the bond market later recouped its losses to close little changed on the day. The Swedish 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 opened with a yield of 10.15 per cent, and ended the day yielding 10.37 per cent.</p>

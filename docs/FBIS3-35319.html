The public relations office of the Voice and Vision  organization reports that Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, chief of this  organization, gave a speech at a gathering of public relations  managers in the Voice and Vision organization, in which he  announced the above. He said: The question of cable networks was  not raised in the way it was discussed in the press. In an  agreement with the Ministry of Guidance, the Voice and Vision  organization announced that if films made by that ministry are  produced in accordance with the Voice and Vision organization's  broadcast rules and criteria, this organization will broadcast  the films on national and province center networks.    He noted: The goal in doing this is to occupy the free time  of the people, and especially those who are unable to buy video  equipment.    Hashemi discussed the responsibility of the public relations  office of the Voice and Vision organization. He said: The Voice  and Vision organization is not understood by the general public  because of the complexity and variety of its work and  activities. Many people do not know about the problems of radio  and television programming. For this reason, to show these  complexities, the public relations office of the Voice and  Vision organization must set up production programs in order to  take effective steps to make better contact with its audience.    Mohsenian Rad, a university professor, also spoke at this  meeting on the role and place of public relations in society. He  said: Public relations must try to create a positive outlook in  society and it must oppose negative outlooks.    He said that the success of a desirable public relations  office depends on increasing the knowledge and information of  the individuals in that public relations office on a daily basis.</p>

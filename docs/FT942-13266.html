			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Arts: Impressionism - back to basics / At the Grand Palais, William Packer finds the 1859 Paris Salon artists committed to realism The closer one looks into the origins of anything the more ambiguous they become, and the further back they go. Where should we look for the origins of Impressionism? To the landscape and genre realism of the Dutch 17th century? Certainly: and to the English 18th and early 19th centuries, Gainsborough and Wilson, Constable and Turner? Indeed: and to late Titian? Perhaps: and what about Rembrandt? Yes, if Courbet is to be considered in such a context. And the Spanish connection, from Velasquez to Goya? Of course, if Manet is to have anything to do with it. But these are profound questions, that bespeak a whole ramification of art-historical possibility. Whatever its implications, the splendid exhibition at the Grand Palais addresses itself to a narrower period and more immediate antecedents. This Origins of Impressionism is an exhibition of French painting set in a French context, and one moreover that continues ensemble the remarkable series by which the Reunion des musees nationaux, these 15 years past, has been giving us definitive retrospective studies of the Impressionist and post-Impressionist masters, one by one. The starting point is the Salon of 1859 at which, of the future major figures, only the young Pissarro was to be found. Ten years on and they were all showing there, Monet and Manet, Renoir and Degas, almost as a matter of course. The Salon indeed supplied the constant critical context for the art of the period. The only pity is that more has not been made of it as an actual presence: for the paintings taken to stand for it in 1859, which include Bouguereau, Puvis de Chavannes, Corot, Delacroix, a pre-Raphaelitesque Jules Breton and a magnificent large Daubigny riverscape, are done with perfunctorily in the first two rooms. Even so, the point is well made and two related myths usefully exploded: that, though the Salon may have had its good years and its bad ('no explosion: nothing of unknown genius' grumbled Baudelaire of 1859), it was never entirely hostile to the young or controversial; and nor were the young themselves averse to taking their chances of selection. And how close these young painters were, in their several ways, to the more general preoccupations of the day; and, as yet, how far from Impressionism. Here we follow those interests through the 1860s, set out together in successive galleries: history painting, with its admixture of symbolism; realism; the nude; the portrait; the still-life; the landscape; the incidents of the everyday. The borders between these categories, of course, are never sealed nor even clear, the cross-overs and mutual intrusions constant and instinctive. Degas gives us a scene of medieval atrocity as conscientious in its detail as any pre-Raphaelite, yet in the very pose of its nudes, it anticipates the figure studies of his later years. The Manet of 'the Angels at the tomb of Christ' is as dramatic in its presentation as a Caravaggio and, in the figure of Christ himself, as confrontationally realist in its nudity as his own 'Olympia'. This last, indeed, so provoked Courbet by her brazen, matter-of-fact nakedness, that he replied with his own more suitably symbolic version of the reclining and ecstatic woman, la Femme au perroquet. Manet replied in his turn with his own 'Woman with a Parrot', though now a full-length portrait of a young woman in a long white morning-gown, standing by her pet's perch. All three are shown, altogether a most satisfying if ill-tempered exchange of masterpieces. The question of realism lies at the heart of it all. Yet in what does that realism consist and to what degree should it be tempered? Is it the symbolic realism of Degas' Spartan boys and girls of 1860, or is it the no less symbolic but plein air realism of Bazille's young men at their bathing party of 1869? Is the truth of modern life rather the boats and light dancing on the water at la Grenouillere, of Renoir and Monet in 1869, or that of Degas' darkly ambiguous interior, le Viol, of the same year? At the end of the decade we find Courbet still committed to realism in its social aspect, with his poor village woman in the snow, with her child and goat and bundle of firewood. And there beside it is Monet's magpie sitting on the gate, and the image simply of farm and field and hedgerow in the snow, all pink and blue and violet shadow. This is an exhibition full of wonderful, ravishing things. But set out as it is, and quite rightly so, neither by chronology nor by artist but in thematic groups, it raises a question it can hardly answer. Here was the modern painting of the day, and young artists who knew each other and even worked together, but were clearly doing different things. Realism and symbolism, yes: and the formal portrait and the nude, and the landscape and the genre scene: but Impressionism? Not quite yet: indeed, the more we look into it, the more we wonder whether there was ever to be any such thing at all.

The ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY said the plan contains 50  cooperative items including the exchange of military leaders and  experts, joint military maneuvers and training exercises as well  as opportunities for Russian officers to visit NATO states for  advanced studies in military academies there.    The NATO delegation arrived in Moscow on Thursday [27  January] and both sides have held talks on how to find a  solution to the crises in hot-spot areas amongst countries who  are members of the commonwealth of independent states.    The delegation said NATO will provide aid to Russian  peacekeepers in these areas, but will not become directly  involved in peacekeeping action by deploying forces.    NATO maintains, however, that Russia's peacekeeping  operations in the trouble areas of the former Soviet Union  should be under the control of the United Nations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has no information as to  the whereabouts and plans of ex-President Richard Nixon who came  to the Russian capital for a visit.    As a high-ranking American diplomat told INTERFAX, the  embassy does not monitor private visits. The ex-president came  to Russia in a purely personal capacity. He has no contacts  with the embassy; he has not informed it of his movements or  further plans, the diplomat said.    As INTERFAX learned from the travel agency Connect servicing  Nixon's visit, the ex-president will stay in Moscow till about  March 16th.    According to a member of the agency directly concerned with  the high-ranking guest, his arrival in Moscow is in no way  connected with Big Politics or business. Richard Nixon simply  likes to visit Russia, meet with Russian people and to see the  changes in the country. His present trip to Moscow is neither  the first nor the last, he said.    The North-American Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry  told INTERFAX that the ministry has nothing to do with Nixon's  visit to Moscow.    "The Russian Foreign Ministry would have monitored the  ex-president's visit, had the American embassy been in charge of  it" a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX's  correspondent.    According to him, the visit is of "a purely scientific  nature". "Nixon's ties with the Carnegie Foundation and with the  Fund for Democracy are well known. Evidently the former  American president is on a visit in Moscow in connection with  these organizations," he said.    Another Russian diplomat interviewed by Interfax's  correspondent has a different point of view. "As a retired  politician Nixon may allow himself what officials from the  Clinton Administration cannot afford. He has already conferred  with the Communist leader, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and with the  former Vice-President, Aleksandr Rutskoy. Nixon makes no secret  of his intention to meet with the Liberal Democratic Party  leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. All this reflects a striving to  "sound out the situation," if not "build bridges," and to  clarify what the Russian opposition is like, and whether it is  capable of coming to power eventually," he said.</p>

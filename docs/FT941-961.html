			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Iberia's deal with Argentina blocked An Argentine federal judge has ordered the government not to proceed with an agreement, signed 10 days ago with Iberia, Spain's national airline, to settle their dispute over Aerolneas Argentinas, the flag carrier. Judge Oscar Garzon Funes accepted an appeal from the leftist Frente Grande opposition party that the settlement was against the national interest because it handed the airline to a foreign government. Mr Javier Salas, Iberia's president, and Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, had agreed to let Iberia raise its stake in Aerolneas to 85 from 30 per cent after pumping the equivalent of Dollars 500m (Pounds 334m) in fresh capital into the company. The government said it would appeal against the judge's decision. It might demanding a ruling by the Supreme Court, where most of the judges were appointed by the privatising President Carlos Menem. The deal also called for the abolition of the Argentine air force's profitable ground-handling monopoly at the country's airports. This has led to strong objections by the Defence Ministry. Iberia says it could save Dollars 20m a year by servicing its aircraft. The handling charge for a Boeing 747 in Buenos Aires is Dollars 4,000, compared with Dollars 1,400 in Santiago, Chile. Iberia and the government have been bickering over loss-making Aerolneas since it was privatised in November 1990. The government had to take back part of the airline in 1992 to prevent its collapse. It rejected Iberia's demand last year that it contribute to the capital injection.</p>

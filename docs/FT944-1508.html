			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Private housing starts 'falter' Private housing starts are set for a year-end total of 156,000 compared with 141,200 last year but there are signs that strong growth in private starts in the first six months of the year has tapered off, largely because of higher interest rates and tax. A survey by the House Builders Federation's said new house prices weakened in recent months, while new home site visitors and net reservations  - agreed sales on which a deposit has been paid  - remained stagnant. A separate survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will today confirm that market activity has declined since spring. Mr Peter Miller, residential property spokesman for the institution, described November as another slow and frustrating month for the housing market. Only two sectors, country houses and more exclusive homes in London, are performing. Mr Miller said there was a shortage of properties for sale and potential purchasers were not looking at anything they consider overpriced. Both surveys are pessimistic about next year. The institution said the number of sales was unlikely to rise significantly, but prices could increase in line with inflation. Mr John Stewart, managing editor of the federation's Housing Market Report, expected slower growth in private housing starts and a modest sales rise. He believed that builders' expectation of a better market in 1996 could translate into stronger growth in starts towards the end of next year.</p>

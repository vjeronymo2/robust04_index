			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Bosnian factions gather for peace talks in Geneva THE MAIN protagonists in the Bosnian civil war will meet in Geneva today to resume peace talks on the republic's division along ethnic lines and a possible end to the 16-month conflict. The talks will centre on peace proposals which Lord Owen, the international mediator, has called a 'painful compromise'. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Croatian counterpart, have eagerly backed proposals which would result in a three-way partition of the republic along ethnic lines. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has rejected their proposal to create a loose confederation on the grounds that it would be tantamount to the carve-up of Bosnia by force and would eventually lead to the annexation of much of the country to neighbouring Serbia and Croatia. Before leaving the Bosnian capital, Mr Izetbegovic revealed a glimmer of hope for the results of the Geneva talks: 'I am going to Geneva with hope but with fear. But I am firmly resolved to break the cycle of killing and suffering. If this chances exists, we'll find it this time,' he said. Mr Izetbegovic is expected to propose a federation comprised of several provinces. The Bosnian delegation to the Geneva talks is designed to reflect his calls to preserve the republic as a united, multi-ethnic state. Comprised of Moslems, Croats and Serbs, it covers the spectrum of political parties. Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will today also attend the talks, which are chaired by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the European Community and United Nations envoys respectively. The negotiations, which will remain in session until a political solution is found, were postponed twice last week because of Serb attacks on government strongholds. While attention was focused on the tightening Serb noose around the Bosnian capital, Serb forces widened their strategic land corridor at Brcko in north-east Bosnia. In the event of a partition, Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to give Moslems, the biggest ethnic group, access at Brcko, to the River Sava to the north, and to the Croatian Adriatic port of Ploce, to the west. But the Serbian advance on Brcko has now made the realisation of this offer even more unlikely. The Serbs control all the key rivers in Bosnia except for the Neretva, which is mostly controlled by the Croats.</p>

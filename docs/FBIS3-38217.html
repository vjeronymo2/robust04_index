			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaques Delors, president of the Commission </F> of the European Union, by Jacek Safuta in Brussels; date not  given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Safuta] The treaties on the association of Poland  and Hungary with the European Community come into force on 1  February. Some people say this is too little, too late.  Shouldn't one take another step now both in the economic and in  the political area?    [Delors -- in French with superimposed Polish translation]  Most certainly yes in the political area. You are worried, and  so am I, about stability in Europe, not only in your countries  but in the whole of Europe. That is why, since the fall of the  Berlin Wall, I have always been a supporter of closer political  links, which would enable us to exchange opinions and which  would make proper work possible in order to eliminate everything  which threatens peace, freedom, and mutual understanding between  nations.    However, when it comes to the economic area, I often think  about this, and I do not regret the path we have chosen, that is  the path of gradual rapprochement, so that your economies can  adapt to modern economic management at the lowest possible cost.    [Safuta] Prime Minister Pawlak is coming to Brussels [2-3  February]. What topics would you like to discuss with him?  What questions would you like to ask him?    [Delors] He will be my guest. I shall fit in with the agenda  he chooses, naturally. Apart from that, I am eager to find out  how he assesses the process of modernization of Polish economy,  how he assesses the internal situation in your country and how  he sees the future of Europe. Well, the list of topics will be  very long and the meeting will certainly be very interesting, at  least for me.</p>

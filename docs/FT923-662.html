			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Sex, ice and videoed beer FOSTER'S LAGER, the UK's number two brand, has produced and paid for cinema advertisements which are devoted mostly to another product. The first 40 seconds of the 60-second advertisements, now running in London cinemas, are devoted to Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The two brands are owned by different companies. The advertisements appear to contravene what has been regarded as a basic law of brand-image advertising - to get your product noticed early and often.

Mr Jeff Dale, marketing controller for Foster's, said: 'We needed to hit people between the eyes'. Foster's spends Pounds 16.5m annually on marketing the brand in the UK. Its joint advertisement with Haagen-Dazs will run in cinemas until Christmas. 'The Foster's drinker is a person who shows a no-worries attitude to life,' said Mr Dale. 'We show the drinker in a no-worries situation. The good thing about cinema advertising is that you have a captive audience of 18-to-35-year-old drinkers.' Haagen-Dazs is happy with its free advertising: 'It's important in terms of setting the scene that people do believe for 40 seconds that it really is a Haagen-Dazs ad, and the consequence is that we get a free show,' said Mr Justin King, managing director of Haagen-Dazs UK. 'Spoof ads as a genre are well-understood by the UK consumer.'</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / People: David Cairns to leave Accounting Standards David Cairns is to retire as secretary general of the International Accounting Standards Committee next March, after ten years in the job. His departure, which came as a surprise to many within the accounting world, will coincide with a period of great change for the organisation. Cairns, 47, said yesterday that he had decided he wanted to try a different job after a decade and to leave while he was still enjoying his work. He said he had no specific plans on what he would be doing next, although he hoped to use the skills gained in international accounting, perhaps as a consultant to a firm or multinational company. By the time of his departure, the committee will have completed both a restructuring and its comparability and improvements project which was designed to reduce the number of alternative types of financial reporting.</p>

This situation, which is in itself unpleasant for  any leader--specially since neither group has a stable majority  in society--is aggravated for Yeltsin by the fact that he is  politically dependent on both parties and cannot break with  either of them.    The Russia's Choice team which united around Gaydar and the  political group which associates with it and which formerly  originated in Democratic Russia are, as before, the president's  main political base. These people formerly brought him to power,  supported him in all cataclysms and shaped the reform ideology.  Who means what by "reforms" in our country may be disputed, but  no active politician would today risk declaring that he is not a  supporter of them, even if he has an affection for "nonmonetary  methods." Abandoning the reforms would mean closing the lid on  one's political career, and all leaders without exception, the  communists included, are well aware of this. In this sense it  may be said that reform ideology has acquired official status,  as formerly did Bolshevik ideology. Essentially, only  Zhirinovskiy permits himself not to swear by reform since he is  the sole active politician who has his own ideology.    A paradoxical situation has come about: The party that was  the founder of state ideology is in opposition to the executive.  But neither the government nor the president here can "snatch"  from Choice the monopoly of progressist vocabulary, which  belongs to it by virtue of historical factors. Choice has the  opportunity to blackmail a politician of any level with the  stigma of "backsliding from the reforms," which it is  practically impossible to wash off. But it is not only this fact  that makes Yeltsin dependent on Gaydar's team.    For the president the symbols of the Gaydar-Fedorov economic  policy are not only the domestic ideological base but also a  calling card for the West. It is far from obvious that the West  will accept a Russian president "bolstered" by the government  that Chernomyrdin has formed with the same willingness for  cooperation with which it accepted the president's policy as set  forth by Gaydar and Fedorov. When it comes to money, creditors  prefer to know for what they are being asked to fork out, and  explaining to Western bankers what is meant by "nonmonetarist  methods" will not, evidently, be easy. In addition, they could  always solicit the opinion of the former members of the Russian  Government with whom they have become accustomed to dealing in  the past two years.    There is, in addition, the personal predilections factor.  Burbulis, Poltoranin, Gaydar, Filatov, Filippov--these are  people with whom Yeltsin worked in the closest contact for  several years and to whom he has grown accustomed. Finally,  against the background of the disorder, lack of organization,  and squabbling in the democratic milieu Russia's Choice, granted  all its internal heterogeneousness, remains, perhaps, the sole  political current with a more or less solid structure. As yet,  there is no one among the bloc's leaders who might constitute  real competition for Boris Yeltsin at future presidential  elections.    On the other hand, Viktor Chernomyrdin's positions on the  Russian political Olympus continue to strengthen. The  exceptionally abrupt opposition character of that same Russia's  Choice and the support for the new government by a majority of  the State Duma are, in particular, contributing to this. In  addition, significant forces in the West that have tied their  financial and political position to the Russian reforms have an  interest in the impression of the notorious "staying the  course," whatever this might mean, being sustained in public  opinion--specially since the Chernomyrdin government was formed  fully in accordance with both legislation and the results of the  expression of the public's pleasure. To which, incidentally, the  vagueness of the wording of which the premier is culpable when  talking about his future intentions contributes perfectly.    All these and certain other factors are causing Viktor  Chernomyrdin to become an increasingly independent and strong  political figure, whose legitimacy is no longer based on the  authority of the president who nominated him but on an entirely  different base. The ingredients of this base are the support of  the power ministries and the solitariness and even a certain  harassment of the ministerial cabinet by public opinion  contributing to the development of a spirit of the corporate  identity and consolidation of members of the government around  the leader and also the dependence on the executive of a  president who lacks a majority in parliament.    In addition, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who just a year ago was a  passing and quite incidental candidate for the office of  premier, is increasingly laying claim to the position of  Yeltsin's main rival at the future presidential elections,  although he is comporting himself with pronounced loyalty. The  abolition of the office of vice president has not, it would  seem, permitted a fundamental solution of the problem of  internal competition: Now the premier is "racking up points"  among his electorate at a furious pace.    Although the presidential elections are still a long way  off,  the president will, possibly, have to make his choice in the  very near future: The interests of the two groupings are  clashing increasingly powerfully. Viktor Chernomyrdin is  interested in Boris Yeltsin continuing to maneuver for as long  as possible, and Gaydar's team, in Yeltsin disavowing  Chernomyrdin as soon as possible and restoring the former  alliance with Choice. It is significant that, as the date of the  presidential elections approaches, the polarity of these  interests will, most likely, change--Viktor Chernomyrdin could  prove interested in the present president being responsible for  the difficulties of the market reform.</p>

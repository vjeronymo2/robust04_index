			<p>BFN     [Text] India has made contingency plans to airlift its  nationals from South Africa if the need arose. The step comes  amid the uncertain political situation in South Africa and the  recent violence in the black homeland in Bophuthatswana, where  the houses of three Indian nationals were razed to the ground.  Indian consular spokesman Thettalil Seetharam appealed to  Indian nationals residing in South Africa to register with the  newly-established consulate. Mr. Seetharam said appropriate  steps would be taken if South African Indians were affected by  the violence.</p>

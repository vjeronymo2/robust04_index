Guinness shares plunged 32 to 427p in hectic selling that saw volume jump to a hefty 17m as analysts cut their forecasts. Lehman Brothers, a long term bull of the stock, was one of the day's big sellers after it downgraded its recommendation from a buy to a hold for the first time in four years. It reduced its full year profits estimate sharply, going from Pounds 953m to Pounds 890m.

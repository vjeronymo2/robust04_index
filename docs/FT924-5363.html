			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Campaign for Brazil Indians hit by cuts CUTS in public spending are threatening the survival of Brazil's indigenous Indians, the president of the government agency for Indian rights warned yesterday. Mr Sidney Possuelo, president of the Funai agency, said in London that his organisation had been paralysed by a 90 per cent funding cut, and could no longer campaign effectively for Brazil's estimated 250,000 Indians. The cuts put in jeopardy a programme to demarcate Indian reserves, which Funai must legally complete by November 1993. Mr Possuelo said the agency had received only 6 per cent of the estimated Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) cost of the project. Only 197 reserves had been demarcated so far. 'We will not be able to reach our targets,' he said. Demarcation of Indian areas is necessary to prevent intrusion by wildcat miners, who bring disease, and developers. Funai's power to defend Indian tribes is also being threatened by a bill in Congress backed by the powerful anti-Indian lobby of forestry and mineral exploration companies. The bill, if passed, would severely reduce Funai's control over demarcation. 'They are trying to devalue the presence of Indian people in their own land,' said Mr Possuelo.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Foster's questioned over fall in share price THE Australian Stock Exchange yesterday approached directors of Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian-based international brewer, over the recent sharp fall in the company's share price. The shares fell from ADollars 1.82 (USDollars 1.31) on August 10 to a low point for the year of ADollars 1.65 on August 14, before recovering yesterday to ADollars 1.70, on speculation centred on Foster's June year earnings statement, due next month. Investors have knocked Foster's shares down from a year high of ADollars 2.11, recorded in early June, on fears that the company may announce large asset write-downs and perhaps be forced to bolster its capital with a share issue. The stock exchange asked if Foster's directors believed the company's earnings would vary by more than 15 per cent over last year and whether it would record any material abnormal or extraordinary items. Foster's directors have until midday today - Australian time - to reply. The share slide also follows Foster's largest shareholder, International Brewing Holdings, being put into receivership and the apparent lapsing of a merger proposal from rival beer group, SA Brewing Holdings. The receivership means a 32 per cent stake parcel in Foster's is for sale, although the receivers have stated they are prepared to be patient.</p>

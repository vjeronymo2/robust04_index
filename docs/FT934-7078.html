			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Trading company counter-sues SIB Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate, is counter-suing the Securities and Investments Board which earlier this year launched a legal action to restore Pounds 4m to the company's pension fund. Melton Medes on Friday launched its own legal action alleging that the SIB had wrongfully disclosed information acquired during an inquiry into the handling of pension fund assets. Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman of Melton Medes, yesterday claimed the disclosure had cost him Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m. The SIB refused to comment on the writ, although it said it intended to continue pursuing its own legal action. The basis of Mr Puri's allegation is that the SIB gave information to plaintiffs in a separate court case which cast doubt on his claims of a pension fund surplus. Mr Puri is involved in two separate legal actions. The first, launched by beneficiaries of the pension fund last year, claims damages of more than Pounds 7m. It alleges that Mr Puri and Mr James Philpott, Melton Medes' chief executive, improperly handled funds regarding a loan from the pension fund to Melton Medes' subsidiaries. The second case was brought by the SIB in July this year seeking damages of more than Pounds 4m. It alleges that Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts repeatedly breached rules of Imro, the self-regulating body for fund managers, in handling pension fund assets. Mr Puri alleges that the SIB informed the beneficiaries in the first court action that Kidsons Impey, auditors of Melton Medes Pension Trustees, planned to review their report on the fund's 1990 accounts. In the event, says Melton Medes, the auditors decided 'not to add any qualification to their report, but the damage had been done'. Mr Marcus Rutherford, of solicitors DJ Freeman, representing Melton Medes, said the alleged disclosure was a violation of section 179 of the Financial Services Act 1986.</p>

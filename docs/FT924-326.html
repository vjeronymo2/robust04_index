			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Rao defends takeover of Ayodhya site MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday defended his government's decision to acquire the disputed holy site at Ayodhya, northern India, saying that two separate trusts would be charged with building a temple and a mosque there. The Faizabad district administration yesterday allowed Hindu pilgrims to worship at a makeshift temple built by militants after they destroyed the 400-year Babri mosque on December 6, prompting countrywide riots which left more than 1,200 dead. The decision to take over the disputed site, and then empower the local authorities to decide whether or not to permit worship, has been criticised by opposition parties and Moslem leaders. The Babri Masjid Movement Co-ordination Committee said the district authorities' decision to allow worship of the idols while a lawsuit on behalf of the Hindu community was under hearing by the Allahabad High Court 'amounted to granting legitimacy to an act of vandalism and to a flagrant contempt of the court'. The Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, welcomed the decision to allow worship but said trusts to build the temple were 'no conclusive solution'.</p>

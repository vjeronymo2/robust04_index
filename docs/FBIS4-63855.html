The NBB told INTERFAX that it had made the decision "in view  of the amount of time it is taking to unify the monetary systems  of Russia and Belarus and the fact that the current state of  confusion regarding payments cannot be allowed to continue."  According to the NBB decision, all accounting in Belarus will  be carried out only in the payment coupons until the monetary  union officially takes place and all commercial organizations  must convert their assets from Russian rubles to "zaichiki" at  the official NBB exchange rate (10.5 to the Russian rubles on 24  May) within the shortest period of time.

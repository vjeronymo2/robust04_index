			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 13, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas expressed grave concern about the extent of  smuggling through Lithuanian territory.    At a meeting of the coordinative group for struggle against  organized crime and corruption Tuesday [12 April], Brazauskas  said criminals are able to freely cross the country's borders  and to smuggle goods.    The president said the introduction of stickers for sealing  legally imported liquor and tobacco products was "a farce"  because the stickers can be easily forged. "Enough defaming  Lithuania," Brazauskas said.    The meeting, devoted to smuggling problems, was attended by  the leadership of the parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries  of Defense and Justice, National Security Service, the Customs  Department, the Border Defense Service, as well as officials  from Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Interior.    The meeting's participants said liquor and tobacco are  currently the principal contraband goods, but metals, drugs,  weapons, radioactive substances and even helicopters and planes  are smuggled, as well.    Officials attributed the unsuccessful struggle against  smugglers to imperfection of the legislation regulating  activities of customs and border services. The meeting's  participants also pointed to the lack of employees and the  absence of a unified information network.    Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the National Security Service,  emphasized that corruption "has reached such an extent in our  society that we are starting to be known as barbarians."    President Brazauskas promised to work out recommendatory  "formulas" for the institutions concerned and to hear reports  about the work done at the next meeting.</p>

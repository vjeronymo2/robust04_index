			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN REPORTS FOOD EXTORTION CASES SPREAD  </P> <P> New cases of baby food tampering were reported today across England as well as  in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and three babies were treated by doctors after  eating food tainted by extortionists, officials said.  </P> <P> Newspaper reports said that food companies had paid $850,000 to extortionists  and that the extortionists were demanding another $1.7 million.  </P> <P> The Daily Telegraph said police believe that a gang that extorted $85,000 from  a large supermarket chain this year is responsible. Scotland Yard refused  comment on the reports.  </P> <P> Parents today reported finding glass, pins, needles and caustic soda in jars  and cans of baby food and in one case, powdered milk. Police did not say how  many new cases were reported, but as of Wednesday there had been at least 50  cases in England alone.  </P> <P> Three babies were taken to hospitals in Leicester, Exeter and Leeds and later  released. One mother found glass fragments in her baby's food, and another  discovered two pieces of metal. The third baby became ill when eating a banana  dessert, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Firms Offer Rewards  </P> <P> New cases turned up in the province of Northern Ireland as well as across the  border in the Republic of Ireland, police said.  </P> <P> H. J. Heinz Co. Ltd. and Cow &amp; Gate Ltd., two of Britain's leading food  manufacturers, on Wednesday offered a total of $169,000 for information leading  to the conviction of the extortionists.  </P> <P> Heinz, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant, and Cow &amp;  Gate said they had received extortion demands but refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> The Daily Telegraph said police suspected a gang of extortionists who  reportedly got $85,000 from a supermarket chain this year after threatening to  poison food on its market shelves. The gang threatened to spike baby food  unless it was paid $1.7 million, the newspaper said. It did not name the  victimized supermarket chain.  </P></p>

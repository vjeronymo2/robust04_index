			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / People: Head of retail property quits London &amp; Edinburgh Trust John Newman is leaving London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the Swedish-owned property company where he is director in charge of retail property. His departure comes at a time when the group is increasing its emphasis on investment rather than development. Newman, 59, was responsible for some of LET's largest development projects, including the Bull Ring in Birmingham, the Peacocks Shopping Centre in Woking and the Queen's Street development in Cardiff, which is under construction. When Newman leaves at the end of June, his responsibilities will be taken over by Nicholas Sheehan, the group's managing director. Newman joined LET in 1985 from Robert Fleming &amp; Co where he had been director in charge of their property investment and development portfolio. SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Scandinavia's largest insurance company, which bought LET for Pounds 491m in 1990, has been bringing the management of LET under increasingly direct control. John and Peter Beckwith, the founders of the company, resigned from the board last September.</p>

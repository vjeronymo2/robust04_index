			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Bonds rally gives boost to market UK government bonds staged a recovery yesterday, giving a strong boost to the London stock market. Dealers reported cautious investor buying of long-dated gilts, where yields had risen close to 9 per cent earlier this week. However, some warned the recovery was largely a technical correction after the market had been heavily oversold in recent days. 'The recovery doesn't reflect a significant shift in people's attitudes,' said Mr John Kendall, chief economist at Baring Brothers. 'I think we have further to go before things calm down,' he cautioned. Bond prices were also helped by short covering in the futures market where traders squared their positions ahead of today's release of US May employment figures. The London stock market, helped by the gilt rally and a stronger performance from stock index futures, shrugged off its prolonged run of weak sessions, signalling to some fund managers that the near 5 per cent fall in share prices over the past two weeks may have been over-done. The FT-SE 100 index recorded its best daily gain for the year, closing at 2,980.8, a rise of 48.9. It was the biggest daily advance since December 29 when the FT-SE 100 jumped 49.7. In the gilts market the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose more than three points to around 103 1/2 , to yield 8.41 per cent. The September contract of the long gilt future traded on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, jumped more than two points to 100. Europe's other bond markets put on a patchy performance, but many traders said the heavy selling of recent sessions had abated. They said a holiday in many parts of Germany had calmed the German government bond market, which has led recent declines. International bonds, Page 26 London shares, Page 38</p>

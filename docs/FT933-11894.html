			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Vard set to spin off ferry unit VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, is expected shortly to spin off its ferry business, for which it will seek a listing on the Oslo bourse, writes Karen Fossli. The move follows the end of negotiations, which have lasted four months, aimed at selling the ferry business for NKr1.1bn (Dollars 151m) to a group of foreign investors led by Union Bank of Switzerland. Under the deal, Vard would have retained a 20 per cent stake in the operation. It said yesterday it had ended the talks because the terms would have been unsatisfactory given the earnings prospects of its two ferry lines, Larvik Line and Scandi Line. Vard is now looking at ways to convert some of the ferry business's debt to kroner from dollars and transfering a portion of that debt to the newly-created unit.</p>

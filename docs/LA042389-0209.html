			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM ORDINANCE;  </P> <P> SPRINKLER LAWS IGNITE DEBATE OVER COST, SAFETY  </P> <P> When Anaheim last week became one of the few cities in the country to require  sprinklers in all new homes, it took sides in a growing nationwide debate over  whether sprinklers save thousands of lives or simply add thousands of dollars  to the price of every new house.  </P> <P> The emerging battle over mandatory fire sprinklers pits two familiar foes  against each other: firefighters who argue that the devices can prevent deaths  and millions of dollars in losses, and building industry officials who say  those claims are exaggerated and that the price of sprinklers -- about $2,000  per home -- will further discourage home buyers in an already expensive market.  </P> <P> About 500 communities in the United States now require sprinklers for  single-family homes, apartments and condominiums, contrasted with only half a  dozen in 1981, according to Operation Life Safety in Washington, an affiliate  of the International Assn. of Fire Chiefs. Orange County led the country in  1980, when San Clemente became the first city to require sprinklers in new  homes.  </P> <P> "It's an encouraging thing that has started to spread," said Harvey Seymour,  spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. "Up until now, the best  ammunition was smoke detectors. But nothing works as well as sprinklers."  </P> <P> Smoke detectors, now installed in three-fourths of America's homes, are  credited with saving up to 1,000 lives a year, according to the Insurance  Information Institute in New York City. Sprinklers can save more lives,  firefighters say.  </P> <P> A 1988 report by the National Bureau of Standards estimated that adding  sprinklers to one- and two-family homes could reduce fire deaths by as much as  60% to 70% a year, "a savings of about 2,500 lives a year."  </P> <P> Of 55 fires involving residential sprinkler systems studied by Life Safety  since 1986, the devices saved 44 lives and millions of dollars in property,  said director Jim Dalton. "And there has never been a multiple loss of life in  a fully sprinkled building," Dalton added.  </P> <P> In Georgia, Cobb County Fire Chief David Hilton credits a 1981 ordinance with  saving at least 18 lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Less Than 1% of Homes  </P> <P> Yet because sprinklers exist in less than 1% of American homes, reliable data  about them is scarce and often incomplete. Most of the information is  anecdotal, as in a recent Napa, Calif., fire in which a sprinkler extinguished  flames on a baby's quilt and saved the child, said Orange County Fire Capt.  Hank Raymond.  </P> <P> But laws requiring the sprinkler systems will not come easily.  </P> <P> "We have a serious affordable-housing problem," said John Withers, spokesman  for the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern  California. "To rush ahead and require sprinklers on a mandatory basis is  ill-advised, given the tremendous costs involved and the marginal benefits."  </P> <P> Opposing mandatory sprinklers can be about as popular as opposing apple pie and  baseball, builders battling the ordinances concede. But they say consumers  don't want sprinklers, that the systems cost too much when home prices are  already steep, and that insurance savings and safety claims by sprinkler  proponents are unfounded.  </P> <P> "Houses today are safer than they have ever been," Withers said. "Virtually all  fire fatalities are in structures more than 20 years old. If you want to be  totally safe, let's go back to adobe huts. How far do you go, and at what  cost?"  </P> <P> And building industry officials contend that sprinkler systems may not be as  reliable as proponents maintain. Mechanical problems, human error and tampering  may cause them to fail. Withers said sprinklers can malfunction. He cited the  system that flooded a Los Alamitos warehouse when the 1987 Whittier earthquake  shook the Southland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerned With Liability  </P> <P> Withers said his concern is liability. He wonders who would be accountable if  the system fails in a fire: builders, the subcontractors that install the  systems, or the sprinkler's manufacturer?  </P> <P> Sprinkler technology, itself, is simple. Each sprinkler head, typically  installed in the ceiling, is soldered to hold back the water until it is  needed. When there is a fire, heat melts the solder on the head and releases  the water automatically.  </P> <P> Raymond, of the Orange County Fire Department, said he has heard complaints  from homeowners that the sprinklers keep running after being triggered,  flooding a room.  </P> <P> But the damage is usually confined to one room because a single sprinkler head  usually contains a fire there, he said. Rarely are two heads triggered. And  sprinklers extinguish the fire 97% of the time before firefighters arrive, he  said.  </P> <P> "Quick-response sprinklers release from 13 to 25 gallons of water a minute,"  Raymond said. "Compare that to the 125 to 250 gallons a minute from a  firefighter's hose, and you're looking at a dramatic difference in water  damage."  </P> <P> Spurred by safety concerns and tighter firefighting budgets, more and more  cities are adopting sprinkler ordinances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Fire Stations  </P> <P> In San Clemente, city officials trimmed from nine to five the number of future  fire stations in their long-range plans. And fire hydrants, which cost $2,500  apiece, now are spaced 400 feet apart in new neighborhoods, contrasted with 250  feet in older areas, said Fire Capt. Edward P. Harrod.  </P> <P> Studies also show that sprinklers reduce property loss in fires, typically by  as much as 80%.  </P> <P> Those kinds of bottom-line figures may eventually bring America's insurance  industry to the home sprinkler battle.  </P> <P> "It's certainly something the insurance industry generally supports," said  George Tye, spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Cos. "Any kinds of  loss mitigation are generally encouraged. But it's not really been an issue  yet."  </P> <P> For now, few insurance companies in Southern California offer discounts to  homeowners with sprinklers, in large part because so little data is available,  industry officials say.  </P> <P> "There's no base to study in California until there is a widespread demand,"  said John Millen, spokesman for the Farmers Insurance Group Cos., which write  about 700,000 homeowner policies in Southern California. "We're studying it  right now."  </P> <P> Allstate Insurance Co. just began offering a 10% discount last May to  homeowners with central sprinkler systems, said Moira Uhl, a company  spokeswoman in Los Angeles. She said the average Allstate homeowner's annual  premium in Orange County is $408, less about $41 for homeowners with  sprinklers. But that does not go very far in covering the cost of a sprinkler  system, now about $1 per square foot of floor space.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leaving Out Amenities  </P> <P> Until the cost of sprinklers drops, the home-building industry will oppose  them, said Withers of the BIA. If the devices are forced on the industry,  builders will simply reduce their construction costs by leaving some amenities  out of condominiums, apartments and homes, he said.  </P> <P> "I believe that sprinklers will eventually be incorporated into housing,"  Withers said. "But not until you have enough of them out there, with the right  technology and mass produced."  </P> <P> Hugh Council, California deputy state fire marshal, hopes that sprinklers will  follow the pattern of smoke detectors, once priced at $70 apiece and now  available for as little as $10.  </P> <P> "Cost-wise, the more of these things that are out there and the more that are  put in, the more prices will go down," Council said. "That will stimulate  different manufacturers. And we will see a dramatic saving of lives."  </P></p>

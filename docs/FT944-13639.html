			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Opposition leaders pile pressure on Major over sleaze Opposition leaders stepped up pressure on the government yesterday as Mr John Major sought to draw a line under the cash-for-questions controversy by meeting Lord Nolan, chairman of the nascent standing committee on standards in public life, at Downing Street to discuss his remit. Amid continuing unease among Tory right-wingers about the dismissal of Mr Neil Hamilton from his post as corporate affairs minister, Labour sought to exploit the government's discomfort by demanding full details of the charges against him. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told Mr Major in a letter: 'It is essential that MPs and the general public are told the whole truth, and not just presented with a parody of open government.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, told a press conference: 'We are not going to let this go away. We are not going to be reassured about any of this until all the information is out in the open.' Adding to the government's discomfort, Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, said Mr Major's Commons statement - which amounted to a claim that he had tried to blackmail the government - was based entirely on hearsay evidence. Mrs Barbara Mills, director of public prosecutions, disclosed that a note summarising a conversation between Mr Major and an alleged intermediary of Mr Fayed on September 29 was not passed to her office until last Thursday. That was the day on which The Guardian published allegations that Mr Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, the former Northern Ireland minister, accepted payment from Mr Fayed for asking Commons questions. Mr Smith resigned on Friday. As Downing Street steadfastly refused to shed further light on the identity of the unnamed intermediary or the charges against Mr Hamilton, further details emerged from friends of the former minister. They said he was confronted by Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, with an allegation that he had failed to disclose a consultancy with Mobil Oil and a separate allegation about his relationship with Plateau Mining. Mr Ryder was also said to have produced an anonymous letter alleging that Mr Hamilton had avoided paying taxes. The friends said Mr Hamilton was 'dismayed' by the prime minister's treatment of him, but was not planning a bitter Commons resignation speech. He expects to return to the government after disproving all the allegations. Some of the allegations appeared likely to be considered by the Commons privileges committee, described by Downing Street as the proper forum for investigation of Mr Hamilton now that he has left the government. Labour MPs, who walked out of the committee after the Tory majority decided to sit in secret, appeared willing to return if the committee decides to hold at least some sessions in public. However, negotiations have so far failed to produce a deal. Who are the Fayeds, Page 10</p>

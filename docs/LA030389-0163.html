			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHICAGO ENSEMBLE IN BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> "Select," in the sense of choice and stylish, would be a good comprehensive  term for the concert that the Chicago Symphony Chamber Ensemble performed in a  ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The sponsor was the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series. The erstwhile  ballroom may not be precisely a historical site, but considering how well it  all worked, some semantic flexibility may be allowed. The music was choice, the  performances were choice, and the room seemed to suggest a new and eventually  popular site for music.  </P> <P> The program will be repeated Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center.  </P> <P> The five members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Chamber Ensemble are: David  Taylor, violin; Robert Swan, viola; Gary Stucka, cello; Michael Henoch, oboe,  and Andrea Swan, piano. Plainly these musicians derive from a substantial  tradition. Their tones blend easily, they phrase with unanimity and there are  no jarring individual opinions as to tempo, dynamics and general interpretive  conception.  </P> <P> Dire traffic on roadways approaching the Four Seasons precluded a complete  hearing of the opening Quartet for Oboe and Strings in B-flat, by Haydn. In  what was heard, the oboe sound of Henoch was crisp, clear and neatly modulated.  </P> <P> The oboe also became a leading voice in two Rhapsodies for Oboe, Violin and  Piano by the once highly respected turn-of-the-century American composer  Charles Martin Loeffler. The music owes considerable debt to Debussy and his  followers and is craftsman-like and agreeable to the ear.  </P> <P> The violin and viola of Taylor and Swan came together in Mozart's Duo in G, K.  423, a bit more scholarly than lighthearted, but nicely adjusted by the two  string players.  </P> <P> The towering masterpiece of the agenda, however, was Mendelssohn's magnificent  Trio No. 1 in D minor, which was given a superior reading by Taylor and Stucka  with Swan supplying an uplifting piano part.  </P> <P>  The Chicago Symphony Chamber Ensemble will play Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $6  to $20. Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P></p>

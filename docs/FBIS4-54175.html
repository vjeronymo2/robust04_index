			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Move To Reinvade Korea" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Tsuboi, chief of the  security section of the cabinet of Japan, told the budgetary  committee of the House of Representatives on May 23 that a  "joint council" consisting of departemental chiefs of the  ministries and agencies of the Japanese Government had been  formed as regards the "suspicion of nuclear development" by the  DPRK, at which "the situation of North Korea is analysed",  according to a report.    That day, defence bureau director of the Defence Agency of  Japan Murada blared at the same place that Japan "is studying  rules of actions of the self-defence forces [SDF] involving  naval deterrence, combat regulations and the sphere of aerial  action" to "cope with an emergency case connected with the  `nuclear suspicion' against North Korea".    Earlier, the ground "SDF" showed a bellicose move of working  out a new strategy attatching importance to "the influence of  the situation on the Korean peninsula" which would replace the  strategy of "attaching importance to the North".    Facts eloquently show that the Japanese reactionaries are  promoting on a full-dressed stage the reorganisation of the  wartime system for a war of reinvasion against DPRK under the  name of "reaction in case of emergency", taking issue with the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    But the Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion,  clearly seeing the possible consequences of their reckless acts,  and promptly give up the moves to stage a comeback to the Korean  peninsula.</p>

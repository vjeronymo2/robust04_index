			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Chamber fantasies STIMULATED BY the archaizing Cobbett Prize for English chamber music, the student Britten wrote two short single-movement Phantasies, the second of which, his Op. 2, for oboe and string trio (1932), was the opening item of Nash Ensemble's 20th century concert (second in a series of four sponsored by IBM) at the Purcell Room on Thursday. Oboe soloist (but the part does not steal the limelight) Gareth Hulse, violinist Marcia Crayford, violist Roger Chase and cellist Christopher van Kampen revealed the work as a taut and flagrantly impassioned sonata argument, an achievement of extraordinary precocity. Their performance was notable alike for warmth and biting immediacy; and they found a great deal of colour in the music's frugal textures. The other works on the programme (apart from Britten's Op. 93 cantata, Phaedra, for mezzo and small orchestra, with which the concert ended) had a Cobbettish character, two of them taking the string trio and adding a contrasting instrument, the other, Ravel's severe, searching but very felicitously devised Sonata for violin and cello of 1920, subtracting an instrument. The latter piece was realised by Crayford and van Kampen with compelling brilliance. The nine-minute single movement of Colin Matthews's Three-Part Chaconne for the three strings and left hand piano was ideally Cobbettish in its declared use of the 17th century form; but gaily splashed with bass notes from the improvisatory piano (Ian Brown) this chaconne sounded nicely offbeat and modern: the piano takes off into a typical Matthews toccata towards the end. Jonathan Harvey's new and specially commissioned Lotuses puts a flautist (Philippa Davies) with a string trio that often plays in flautando mode (ie. in harmonics), and indeed sports a variety of unorthodox performance techniques, to create a 20-minute ethereal dance of a piece, very free and bright and spiritual. Perhaps Harvey's vigour of invention here was unequally matched to his New Ageism; but there were delectable moments, particularly as afforded by that most breathily seductive of instruments, the bass flute.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM  </P> <P> The world watched in horror as the pro-Iranian "Party of God" murdered Lt. Col.  William Higgins, who worked for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon. This  vicious faction has a long history of similar behavior; it has been involved in  assassinations, destruction of airliners in flight and the seizure and killing  of other hostages. It also claimed "credit" for truck bombings that killed our  Marines in Beirut in 1983 and 1984.  </P> <P> Some observers -- quite erroneously -- have drawn an equivalence between the  Israeli capture of Sheik Obeid and the seizure of Lt. Col. Higgins. Obeid was  not a peacekeeper: He commanded assassination brigades. And according to  international law, such criminals may be seized wherever they are found, even  on foreign soil. Israel has the same right to act against those who attack its  citizens and territory as the U.S. had when it bombed Libya in response to  terrorist attacks against our servicemen in Berlin and when it seized drug  lords in other countries.  </P> <P> Hindsight may make us wish for a different outcome from the seizure of Obeid;  but we must be careful not to confuse the victims of terrorism with those who  plan and carry it out.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. WESTON  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> American Jewish Committee  </P> <P> Los Angeles Chapter  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Ukrainian </F> parliament, by unidentified VYBIR reporter; place and date not  given]    [Text] Vybir: Will you promote the development of private  business if elected the president?    O.M.: Yes, I will. The main thing is that such business  should not be criminal.    Vybir: What are the ways to overcome the Crimean crisis?    O.M.: The only way is for the Ukrainian and Crimean  parliaments to observe the Constitution of Ukraine. My visit to  the peninsula is intended to reach this goal. It was a mistake  on the part of our ruling bodies to neglect situation in the  Crimea. I want to explain to the Crimean parliamentarians the  position of our parliament and my personal position to this  effect.    Vybir: Will left-wingers win the June 26 elections? Given  this, will Ukraine change its foreign policy?    O.M.: Left-wing views start to dominate in our society.  People understand that their prosperity depends on common  efforts. This means that the broad public will mainly back up  the left-wing candidates to the Soviets and the president's  post. Ukraine's foreign policy will also be somewhat changed.  Left-wing orientation is going strong all over the world. This  process brings our civilization to optimal alignment of  political forces. I believe that sharp political turns (whether  to the right or left) should not physically or morally affect  men in the street. Still, the foreign policy concept was fixed  by the parliament and will not undergo cardinal changes.  Everything depends on situation in the countries with which we  will cooperate.    Vybir: What about the possibility of Ukraine's entering into  NATO?    O.M.: Look, NATO is not the world community. Ukraine has  always been and wants to remain an active member of such  community. I do not want Ukraine to enter military blocs, I  want it to be respected by the world community. Ukraine is the  only country that declared its nuclear-free status and  liquidates its nuclear arms. Unfortunately, other countries do  not follow our example. Ukraine could initiate creation of the  international club of the countries that wish to liquidate their  nuclear weapons.    Vybir: What will be the Ukrainian-Russian relations?    O.M.: Russia is a great neighboring state having  historically  strong ties with Ukraine. People should adequately understand  our history.    Vybir: Who is your strongest rival in presidential  elections?    O.M.: All of them are strong enough. If they were weak, it  would not be of great interest to me to run for presidency.    Vybir: What about your chances to be elected?    O.M.: They are rather high.    Vybir: What is the difference between you and other  nominees?    O.M.: Unlike me, almost all of them occupied high official  posts. I am not responsible for the consequences of the  so-called economic reforms. Frankly speaking, among other  candidates only I know well the problems of people. I do not  accuse my rivals since they were "separated" from such problems.    Vybir: Why do so many people negatively assess the actions  of  President Kravchuk?    O.M.: This is because of the consequences of the policy  conducted by the highest authorities while the president  represents such authorities. This was proved by the results of  parliamentary elections.    Vybir: Many people think that the Crimean crisis occurred as  a result of sending some additional Ukrainian troops to the  peninsula...    O.M.: Last Saturday I met with Interior and Defense  Ministers. I proposed not to send additional troops and  national guard to the Crimea. We must not use force but  economic and political arguments.    Vybir: Will the president's powers be limited?    O.M.: This will be hard to do since such changes limitations  must be fixed by the Constitution. If I am elected the  president, I will enhance economic powers of the Cabinet. As I  see it, today the president has too many functions which he is  unable to perform in full scope. Still the president decides  all personnel questions relating to the government. So,  delegation of economic functions to the government helps the  president fulfill his duties more efficiently. My cabinet will  never hinder the process of reforms that are really useful for  Ukraine.    Vybir: What are the ways to divide the Black Sea Fleet?    O.M.: As far as military interests are concerned, Ukraine  gains nothing from the Fleet division. I often proposed to  lease the Fleet either to Russia or the CIS. I am afraid that  Russia may refuse to take lease of the Fleet or buy out a part  of it. Given this, Ukraine will never be able to finance this  huge Fleet. All this is relevant to economic restructuring. For  instance, Ukrainian metal is sold all over the world which  testifies to our mighty industrial potential. But on the other  hand, it proves that we are bad businessmen because not a single  country sells its rolled stock. The Ukrainian ship-building  industry is one of the world biggest, it accounts for 80 percent  of the USSR capacity in this field. Today it mainly works for  export. Why don't we also use it to build our own merchant  fleet or men-of-war?    Vybir: Thank you.</p>

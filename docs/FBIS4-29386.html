			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 17 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Kozo Watanabe, head of the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] delegation which has just returned from a visit  to the DPRK (North Korea), held a news conference at the Japan  National Press Club in Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo, on 16 June. With  regard to the issue of North Korea's development of nuclear  arms, Watanabe said, "This should still be resolved through  dialogue; I am opposed to sanctions." The Japanese Government  has informed the United States of its support of the draft UN  Security Council resolution proposing five forms of sanctions,  including arms embargo. His position directly contradicts  government policy.    Watanabe further pointed out the need to: 1) ask Japan and  other countries concerned to bring about an early reopening of  talks between the United States and North Korea; 2) resume the  Japan-DPRK normalization talks unconditionally; and 3) prepare  for visits of North Korean VIP's to Japan to promote exchanges  between various sectors of Japan and North Korea in order to  create correct public opinion in Japan.</p>

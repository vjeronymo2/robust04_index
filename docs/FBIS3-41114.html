The police revealed this on  Friday following a media enquiry.    Apart from the massive Cannabis haul, 75,439 Mandrax tablets  valued at N$2,263,170 were seized.    Nampol said most of the drugs had been confiscated through  the "excellent assistance of the public," while others had been  seized in joint operations with neighbouring countries.    In 1993 Cocaine valued at more than N$1.3 million had also  been confiscated.    Overall there had been 242 cases involving drugs during 1993  and 366 people had been arrested of whom 37 had been foreigners.  The police again warned the public about the danger of drugs  and urged people to report any cases of drug smuggling to the  nearest police station.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin stressed today that the Bosnian crisis should be  resolved through negotiations, but insisted that Russia would  take an active role in helping end the war in former Yugoslavia.    Yeltsin explained: "Some people are trying to solve the  problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall not allow this to  happen."    In an interview with reporters after he and visiting British  Prime Minister John Major signed a joint statement on reciprocal  non-targeting of strategic missiles, the Russian president also  stressed the need for the heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo,  the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be handed over to U.N.  forces.    Yeltsin told reporters that the Bosnian problem was  discussed  in detail during his talks this morning with Major.    "Our stands are identical on the main point; that it is  necessary for the heavy guns to be handed over to U.N. forces to  bring an end to the shelling.    "Moreover," Yeltsin said, "both sides have confirmed during  the talks that the Bosnian problem should be resolved primarily  by peaceful means, through negotiations."    "This will allow us to put an end to the war in former  Yugoslavia," he said.    He reminded reporters that the Bosnian problem was now being  discussed in the U.N. Security Council.    "This body must issue a mandate to the blue helmets (U.N.  peacekeepers) to accept the guns removed from positions around  Sarajevo. This is important," he said.    However, the president added that he believed that the  strategic positions of the hostile parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina  could be bombed only if U.N. forces were attacked and called for  help.    Meanwhile, the joint statement signed by Yeltsin and Major  immediately after their talks in the Kremlin stipulates that the  two countries would not order their strategic nuclear missiles  to be targeted at each other. The agreement come into effect  not later than May 30, 1994.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: A party marches on its money THERE is one election-year battle that the Republican party has usually won by this stage in the campaign: the battle to raise money. Yet the comfortable flow of funds to the incumbent, President George Bush, has slowed to a trickle in recent months and the Republicans find themselves in the unaccustomed position of having less money in their campaign chest than do the Democrats. In July-September, the Democrats raised Dollars 43.5m in campaign contributions, says the public interest watchdog Common Cause, compared with only Dollars 26.7m for the Republicans. The presidential candidates of the two main parties receive Dollars 55m each from the federal government, in return for accepting limits on their campaign spending. On top of this, each party can raise Dollars 10m in personal contributions of up to Dollars 20,000 apiece. The Democrats had already raised their Dollars 10m for Governor Bill Clinton by the end of August; the Republicans had only raised Dollars 2.4m by mid-September. However, parties can get around these limits by the use of 'soft' money, which is not used directly for the candidate, but for more general ends such as voter registration drives and party advertising. Soft money can include major corporate donations. Tobacco companies such as RJR Nabisco, which has hedged its bets with big gifts to both the Republicans and the Democrats, are big donors. One additional effect of the Republicans' cash shortfall is that, with less than three weeks to go before the election, Mr Bush still has to devote a substantial portion of his time to fund-raising events, whereas Mr Clinton can concentrate solely on campaigning. Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire running as an independent candidate, will receive no federal money, so is not bound by any spending limit. He announced his withdrawal from the election in July but spent about Dollars 7m, almost entirely from his personal fortune, keeping his candidacy alive before deciding to relaunch his campaign at the end of September. Since then, he has spent heavily on national television advertising. Efforts to reform Congressional campaign financing laws failed this year when Mr Bush vetoed a bill backed by the Democrats, which would have introduced a system matching, in some respects, that used for presidential campaigns, where candidates would receive partial federal funding in exchange for voluntary spending limits. The average cost of a victorious House of Representatives campaign rose to Dollars 400,000 in 1990, and a Senate seat cost nearly ten times as much. Reports to the Federal Election Commission so far this year suggest candidates are spending much more to get themselves elected on November 3. The idea of a cap on campaign spending meets much voter support, but any limit can only be voluntary because the Supreme Court has ruled that mandatory limits would infringe a candidate's constitutional right to free speech.</p>

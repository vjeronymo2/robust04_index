With reference to his recent meeting with the prime minister  he said that they had talked about a specific post, but did not  say which post had been offered to him. Earlier Shokhin had  told journalists that if he did not retain the post of vice  premier he would not consider his work in the government  expedient.    He noted, however, that at first he would "fight" for a  serious post in the State Duma, say the post of a committee  chairman. "I would prefer to act in this capacity given the  complicated situation in the State Duma," he said.    Shokhin refused to comment on the presidential decree on  Cabinet reorganization, saying that he would not like to  criticize the decree. He said, though, that if he had been  given an opportunity to take part in drafting this document,  "some of its provisions would have looked much better".    Next week, appointments to the post of vice premier and  other  posts are to be announced.</p>

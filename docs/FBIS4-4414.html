			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae apologized on Friday over an  amendment to the country's final Uruguay Round schedule.    "I feel sorry for failing to publicly discuss the amendment  in advance," he said.    Testifying at the National Assembly Agriculture, Forestry  and  Fisheries Committee, the minister said the lack of its advance  public discussion was due to a "strategic need" to prepare  against verification by other countries.    Minister Kim also said he now thinks that if a little more  efforts had been made, the country would have gained some more.    He said there are no secret agreements the government made  with any specific parties.    "The so-called behind-the-scene agreement with the United  States refers to the mere letters exchanged by the two  countries' ambassadors to guarantee the implementation of what  have already been agreed to," Kim said.</p>

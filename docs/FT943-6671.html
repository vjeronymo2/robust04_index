			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei picks up from early lows Activity was low on the last trading day for August settlements but the Nikkei average edged ahead on buying by arbitrageurs and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 28.20 to 20,471.49, leaving it 0.2 per cent down on the week. This was after the market had hit a low of 20,416.28 in the morning session, and a high of 20,554.31 in the afternoon. The index, after going lower, gained ground on buying by arbitrageurs and an investment trust set up by Daiwa Securities. But profit-taking around the day's high eroded most of the gains. Volume totaled 233m shares, against 247m. Traders noted buying supported from public funds around the 20,500 level, but most investors remained inactive. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 1.92 to 1,635.69 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.33 to 297.61. Gainers led losers by 498 to 437 and 221 issues were unchanged. In London, the Nikkei/ISE index 50 index rose 4.56 to 1,327.50. Stocks which moved significantly were limited to telecommunications, or traded by foreigners, and issues cross-traded by corporations realising profits on share holdings by selling and buying back stocks. Overseas investors traded steel and construction stocks. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y370 and Sumitomo Metal Industries added Y9 to Y339. Minebea, the ball bearings company, gained Y70 to Y875. It lost ground on Thursday on reports that it planned to sell its finance affiliate to GE Capital, the finance arm of the US electronics group. DDI, the telecommunications operator on the second section, rose Y10,000 to Y991,000 following the auction of for shares of Japan Telecom shares. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.33 to 22,835.21 in volume of 50.1m shares. Roundup HONG KONG closed with strong gains as property-related shares boosted sentiment across the board. The Hang Seng Index climbed 62.97 points to 9,399.08, little changed on the week. Strong overseas demand took the market almost 100 points higher during the late afternoon with buying focused on property-related issues in response to better than expected half year earnings figures from Cheung Kong and Hutchison which came late on Thursday . Cheung Kong rose 50 cents to HKDollars 36.50 and Hutchison gained 30 cents to HKDollars 35.80. Brokers said China-linked H-shares were boosted by expectations of strong results and the H-share index rose 46.11 or 3.8 per cent to 1,269.79. BANGKOK closed higher on late buying of building material with the SET index 6.03 up at 1,450.75, but still 2.5 per cent lower on the week. Turnover totalled Bt13.9bn. The finance sector was a loser, however, falling 1.9 per cent as Finance One, which topped the active list, tumbled Bt30 to Bt462. The building material sector gained 3.5 per cent with Siam Cement jumping Bt84 to Bt1,360. SINGAPORE was firm on demand for blue chips but Malaysian shares traded over the counter fell in spite of a late round of buying. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 6.30 up at 2,293.51 for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. KUALA LUMPUR closed sharply lower after rumours had sparked profit-taking which then gained momentum. The KLSE composite index fell 24.36 or 2.1 per cent, to close at 1,111.78, a rise of 2.6 per cent on the week. Analysts said the fall had been expected because there had been no solid reason why the market had risen so high. SEOUL closed broadly higher in moderate trading but many blue chips fell on profit-taking. The composite index closed 5.97 higher at 951.38. TAIPEI was lifted by last minute buying, which took the weighted index 23.09 ahead to 6,881.10, for a rise of 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover, however, slumped to TDollars 58.42bn from Thursday's TDollars 90bn.</p>

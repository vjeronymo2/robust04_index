			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The methodology for the conduct of this program has been structured to support the national goals/objectives put forth in ``Healthy People 2000.'' In many instances, State health departments have already embraced or established their own goals/objectives which match or are synonymous with those outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information gathered under the BRFSS is expected to be of use to State health departments to support risk reduction and disease prevention activities. Because comparable methods are used from State to State and from year to year, States can compare risk factor prevalence with other States and monitor the effects of interventions over time. Also, the use of consistent methods in a large group of States permits the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor prevalence. These telephone survey techniques can also be applied at the community level to guide local efforts in reducing risk factor prevalence. Combined, the behavioral risk factor survey and surveillance data provide a new resource to guide State and local disease prevention efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $2,250,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 50 awards in the following two categories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Core Capacity Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $2,000,000 is available to fund approximately 50 awards. It is expected that the average award will be $39,000 ranging from $24,000 to $54,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Enhanced Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $250,000 is available to fund approximately 10 awards. It is expected that the average award will be $25,000 ranging from $10,000 to $40,000. Enhanced Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity Program awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that the awards will begin on or about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this program is to provide financial and programmatic assistance to State health departments to maintain and expand State specific BRFSS activities and permanently establish the analysis and routine use of BRFSS data and information in directing program planning, evaluating programs, determining program priorities, developing policy, assessing trends, and targeting relevant population groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential enhancement options envisioned by CDC would include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Expansion of State data analytic capacity and capabilities to produce information necessary to support chronic disease prevention and control activities at the State and local level through collaboration with State health department programs, universities, CDC supported Prevention Centers, and other relevant organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Expansion of present interviewing capacity to provide pilot or validity testing of surveillance questions or questionnaires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Expansion of data collection and sampling frames to include point-in-time surveys or over sampling of minority or other targeted high-risk populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Expansion of data management, collection, and analysis activities by acquisition of hardware and software compatible with CDC systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Participation in testing of newly designed sampling procedures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen statistical power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

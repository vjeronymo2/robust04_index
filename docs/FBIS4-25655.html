			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Huang (7806 3874), secretary of the Ningxia </F> Regional CPC Committee: "China's Agriculture Faces a Second  Major Change"]    [Text] Since the beginning of last year, the party Central  Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed the  importance of agriculture, and have adopted a series of measures  to protect peasants, lighten their heavy burdens, increase their  income, and deepen rural reform. All these measures are well  received by the vast numbers of peasants, and have also created  opportunities for changing the current rural situation in which  agricultural development is relatively lagging and rural reform  confronts many difficulties.    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is an agricultural and  stock-raising province. In line with instructions of the party  Central Committee and the State Council, the party committee and  government of the autonomous region have always regarded it as a  guiding ideology for the rural work to care about the life of  peasants, promote agriculture, improve conditions in rural  areas, and consolidate the position of agriculture as the  foundation of the national economy.    In the wake of the national conference on rural work called  by the central authorities last year, and in the light of both  Ningxia's realistic conditions and the new situations and new  changes that have cropped up in rural work, we have put into  practice a series of measures to strengthen rural work and to  deepen rural reform. They are chiefly the following:    1. The autonomous region has set up a leading group on rural  work with a view to strengthening comprehensive coordination of  rural work.    2. We have called a conference on rural work, at which an  agricultural development plan featuring "one stress, three  changes" was formulated. In other words, this plan aims, "by  placing the stress on increasing the income of peasants, to  change the traditional rural economy into a modern rural economy  that is based on agriculture and guided by the secondary and  tertiary industries, change the planned economic structure into  a socialist market economic structure, and transform the old  urban-rural relations and the dualistic structure under which  urban and rural areas are divided and ruled into a new structure  which tends to integrate urban with rural areas and narrow the  gap between the two, thus accelerating economic development of  rural areas."    3. We have paid close attention to implementation of  measures on increasing both production and income. For  instance, guided by the demands of the market and under the  prerequisite of maintaining stable growth in grain production,  we have exerted great efforts to develop easily marketed cash  crops, such as wheat and side crops, and increased the capital  input into agriculture, respectively attaining a growth of 13.1  and over 23 percent over the previous year in budgetary funds  for aiding agriculture and in the total amount of agricultural  loans newly granted by banks. Moreover, we have paid close  attention to first-stage preparations for the Daliushu Water  Conservancy and Hydroelectric Key Project on the Huang He, the  Yanhuan Water Positioning and Pumping Project which has a great  bearing on three provinces and regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, and  Ningxia, diversion works which channel the water of the Huang He  into the Hetao area, projects of comprehensive agricultural  development in the Hetao area, and a number of other key  agricultural projects, including those of aiding the poor and  improving the environment of poor areas that are currently  carried out in three counties on the loess plateau.    4. Regarding it as one of the assessment criteria of their  work, we have urged all units, trades, and industries across the  autonomous region to implement aforementioned  aid-the-agriculture measures through various channels, such as  providing rural areas with joint and unit-to-unit support on  specific projects.    5. By reforming the work evaluation system, we have further  clarified to prefectures, cities, and counties, as well as rural  cadres, the targets and tasks of agriculture and rural economic  development, and urged them to focus their work on increasing  the income of peasants.    All these measures have yielded remarkable results: We have  successfully aroused the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of  peasants, and helped them firmly establish the concept of  stabilizing agriculture, developing the economy, and becoming  rich by various means.    In our opinion, however, the fundamental way to solve  problems of a deeper level in rural areas is to further push  forward economic structural reform in rural areas. The reason  the agricultural development plan of "one stress, three changes"  is considered the key to rural economic structural reform is  that it keeps to the general orientation of changing the old  economic structure into a socialist market economic structure  and it represents the fundamental way for us to develop  agriculture and transform the mode and structure of rural  production.    A comprehensive review of the process of rural reform in  the past decade and longer has showed that although the  contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to  output did immensely arouse the enthusiasm of peasants at the  beginning of reform, thus laying a solid foundation for  comprehensive progress, there has not been a fundamental change  to both the traditional unitary mode of rural production and the  socialized structure under which urban and rural areas are  divided and ruled in different ways. What is more, with the  deepening of reform, especially after the socialist market  economic structure is established, traditional agriculture and  the dualistic urban-rural structure have proved bigger obstacles  to rural development. This is a problem prevailing across the  country.    For example, the residence registration and management  system  is a typical product of the dualistic urban-rural structure  under the traditional planned economic structure. Facts have  shown that by strictly restricting population flow between urban  and rural areas, this system has not only tied peasants of the  older generation to land, but also forced farmland that cannot  be expanded indefinitely to bear more and more new rural  laborers, resulting in waste of resources and declines in  productivity. Such practice runs counter to the law of the  market economy. In view of such a situation and in line with  the relevant guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, we have vigorously conducted experiments  with the residence registration and management system of small  cities and townships, thus opening up a new path for freeing  rural labor forces, which is warmly welcomed by peasants. As a  matter of fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded the issue long  ago: "Eighty percent of China's population are peasants. If the  peasants lack enthusiasm in production, our country will have no  hope of becoming stronger.... In my opinion, the only way for  us to take now is to mobilize the enthusiasm of peasants,  increase output of agricultural products by a large margin, and  transfer rural productive forces in large numbers to newly built  townships and towns and newly established medium and small  enterprises. We cannot always tie peasants to their small  pieces of land, for that practice promises no hope."    It seems that we have no alternative but to admit that to  help peasants become rich, we first have to reduce their numbers.    If we say that the adoption of the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output  is the first major change experienced by China's rural  development, then it will prove a second major change to break  with the dualistic urban-rural structure and to establish a  modern agricultural production structure in line with the  requirements of the socialist market economic structure.</p>

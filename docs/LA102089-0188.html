Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BROWN CANCELS 2 BLACK STUDENT EVENTS, CITING RACIAL ATTACKS  </P> <P> Brown University today canceled two weekend events for black students after a  string of attacks on white and Asian students.  </P> <P> Officials at the Ivy League school took the action to limit the number of  non-students attending campus events during the annual Parents' Weekend, said  Robert Reichley, vice president for university relations.  </P> <P> The two canceled events are "Funk Night" and a dance sponsored by Omega Psi  Phi, a black fraternity.  </P> <P> Since late August, 22 students have been assaulted in 19 attacks. Fourteen of  the attacks involved gangs of black youths beating white and Asian students.  The rest were robberies.  </P> <P> The school is trying to prevent non-students who may have been involved in the  attacks from hanging around parties this weekend, Reichley said. School  officials did not discuss their actions with minority students.  </P></p>

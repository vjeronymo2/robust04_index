			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Watchdog to monitor local citizen's charters THE Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog, will give as much attention to the efficacy of local citizen's charters as to traditional efficiency studies, its new controller said yesterday. Mr Andrew Foster, the deputy chief executive of the National Health Service appointed yesterday to succeed Mr Howard Davies, now director-general of the CBI, said he would give priority to 'putting the user of public services at the centre (of the commission's work) rather than having structure and resources always at the centre'. That will be welcomed by councils, often critical of the commission for analysing efficiency in isolation from quality. Mr Foster said that up to 20 councils were inadequately prepared for the transfer of community care from the NHS to local government next year.</p>

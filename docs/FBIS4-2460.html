			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Fujian Province, a  pilot in China's reform and opening up, scored rapid economic  growth and higher living standards in 1993, according to  provincial Governor Jia Qinglin.    Addressing the annual session of the provincial people's  congress that opened here yesterday, Jia said that Fujian's  gross national product (GNP) -- the value of all goods and  services produced -- shot up by 25.4 percent to nearly 96.8  billion yuan in 1993.    As a result, Fujian had quadrupled its 1980 GNP by the end  of  1993, seven years ahead of schedule, he said in his government  work report.    The governor also released the following figures to  illustrate Fujian's economic achievements in 1993:    -- Industrial output value climbed 48 percent to 149  billion yuan;    -- Agricultural output value rose 11 percent to 39.5  billion yuan;    -- Grain production reached 8.69 million tons; and    -- 13 priority infrastructure projects were completed.    He attributed Fujian's rapid economic growth to  macro-economic control measures and efforts to optimize the  industrial structure and improve economic returns.    "Rapid economic growth has made it possible for Fujian  residents to enjoy higher living standards," he said.    In real terms, the per-capita income of urban residents rose  by 6.8 percent to 2,605 yuan, and that of rural residents by  seven percent to 1,211 yuan.    Apartment buildings with a total floor space of five million  sq m were completed last year, he said, adding that the floor  space for urban residents rose to 10.8 sq m per person.    On the whole, rural residents live in more spacious homes,  with per-capita floor space rising to 22.4 sq m in 1993, he said.    In a move to eliminate poverty, he said that the provincial  authorities have decided to resettle 100,000 poverty-stricken  residents in areas with good natural conditions and bright  development prospects.    These residents should be encouraged to move, on a voluntary  basis, out of areas with harsh natural conditions, he said.    The governor also spelled out the following major tasks for  this year:    -- Deepening reforms in order to speed up the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure;    -- Stabilizing grain production and expanding the rural  economy;    -- Improving economic returns in industrial production;    -- Accelerating infrastructure construction; and    -- Opening Fujian still wider to the outside world.    "In introducing overseas funds, we should focus on the  construction of harbors, power plants, airports, expressways,  the expansion of basic industries and the farming sector and the  upgrading of existing enterprises," he said.    He promised to formulate flexible policies for overseas  companies investing in these sectors.    He also called for efforts to use more overseas funds in the  financial, retail and tourism sectors.    Fujian, on China's east coast facing the Taiwan Straits,  should do all it can to increase its economic and trade  exchanges with Taiwan, the governor said.</p>

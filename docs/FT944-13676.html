			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (13): Widening the network - Joia Shillingford finds new openings in the switchboard market The market for office PABXs (switchboards) is growing so slowly that all the leading suppliers are scrambling to find new sources of revenue. Bryan Van Dussen, an analyst at the Yankee Group Europe, says the industry is almost dead, with only 2-3 per cent growth a year worldwide. However, two new technologies present opportunities for growth: wireless PABXs and multimedia (the convergence of sound, image, text and computing). Wireless PABXs allow users to make and receive calls using cordless handsets. It makes no difference where abouts they are in the office, so long as they are within reach of a radio base station. One or more base stations will be connected to the office PABX, which links users to the fixed phone network. The beauty of the technology is that companies do not need to throw out their old switchboard to use it. It is possible to buy an add-on device which plugs into a standard PABX and links it to one or more base stations. It is also possible for fixed-phone and cordless users to co-exist on the same switchboard. This is important because not all company workers need cordless handsets, and because equipping a cordless user will cost more. According to Mr Van Dussen, the average cost of connecting an office worker to a standard PABX is Dollars 350 including the handset and infrastructure. The cost of equipping a cordless user is about three times more expensive at Dollars 1,000, and it can be more if a lot of base stations are required. High prices help to explain why the wireless PABX market has been relatively slow to take off. Other inhibitors to growth include conflicting standards and a limited choice of products. The development of desktop multimedia applications could also add lustre to the PABX industry. Two main multimedia applications involve the PABX, according to Mr Van Dussen. They are: Desktop video-conferencing and Collaborative whiteboarding. The first enables PC users to see a video image of the person they are talking to on the phone. The moving video image is displayed in a 'window' on their PC. The second enables PC users in different places to look at the same image or text in a window on their PCs. As with a real whiteboard, they can annotate the image, which could be anything from a diagram to a spreadsheet. Whiteboarding and desktop video-conferencing can be used either separately or simultaneously. Because such applications are now possible, US computer companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Novell have started to become more interested in voice technology. This has led software companies such as Microsoft and Novell to try and set standards for the way PCs instruct PABXs. Each 'standard' has its own supporters among computer companies. Microsoft has defined Tapi (Telephony Applications Programming Interface) and Novell has come up with a rival definition, Tsapi (Telephony Services Applications Programming Interface). Novell and Microsoft are each hoping that their standards will be used to develop CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) applications, where computers and PABXs work closely together. Mr Van Dussen describes his dream CTI application as a computer database linked to a PABX. His phone would be answered automatically and calls routed according to the phone number of the caller (this will be possible when BT's calling line identification service is launched). A software program would determine from the database whether the incoming call should be routed to his voice mailbox, his secretary or directly to him. In certain cases, it would just hang up on the caller. Such call-routing applications are useful to telephone-sales centres. There is also demand for CTI in many other areas, for example order-taking, where phone orders go straight into a computer. The Yankee Group is positive about the opportunities for PABX suppliers to penetrate some of the new markets created by developments in wireless technology, multimedia and computer telephone integration. It believes that Dect will grow rapidly as a wireless PABX application, rising from less than 0.1m lines installed in 1994 to more than 2.6m in the year 2000. In addition, Cordless Dect-based phones, such as those sold by Siemens of Germany, could one day be used to bypass the local loop (such as BT's local phone network in the UK) and provide direct connection to long-distance carriers such as Mercury.

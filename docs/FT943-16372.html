			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (6): Why the car factory is at a standstill - Reduced shifts and lay-offs at Tofas spotlight the problems of the industry It was the only sign of life - a security guard in uniform and peaked hat, pedalling his bicycle around the factory floor, like a character out of a silent movie. Normally, the plant would have been drowned by the hum of machinery, but today Turkey's car industry is entombed in silence, at a virtual standstill, perhaps the most conspicuous casualty of the current economic crisis. The scene at one of the car plants in Bursa is today almost commonplace throughout the industry, as managers are forced to send workers home and the economic downturn takes its toll. It's not all misery, says Mr Jan Nahum, general manager of Tofas, a joint venture between Fiat of Italy and the local Koc group. He believes the car market can bounce back if the government adopts a more accommodating attitude. Last year's sales figures, he concedes, were a little abnormal - abnormally good. However, he believes the market is still barely penetrated, the road network is being extended every year and the long-run picture for a country of Turkey's size must be positive for a car producer. Nonetheless, the slowdown could hardly have come at a more awkward time. Turkey is preparing to enter a customs union in 1995 and the auto sector in particular has been striving to get ready for the loss of protection once tariff barriers come down. The issue is of national importance, not just for the number of workers whose jobs could be threatened if a precipitate rush to freer trade results in loss of market share for the domestic car producers. The car industry, with the two main industrial families - the Kocs and Sabancis - now involved, represents a powerful lobby. According to Prof Ercan Tezer of the Automobile Manufacturers Association (OSD), the private sector umbrella group, the industry invested around Dollars 1bn last year to upgrade plant, increase capacity, make progress in automation and efficiency and launch new models. Bursa, more than any other city in Turkey, is dependent on the car industry  -with the country's two largest producers - local subsidiaries of Fiat and Renault - located there. Together with the components industries, Mr Erdem Saker, the Bursa mayor, estimates the car sector accounts for around 50,000 jobs. The crisis is nowhere more dramatically illustrated than at Tofas, which has been on reduced shifts since the beginning of the year, and on June 1 was forced to terminate the contracts of 2,400 workers, around a quarter of its labour force. Tofas says its management had looked at all other options. Workers had had their annual holiday brought forward. Almost 800 jobs had been lost through natural attrition - early retirement and military service, while temporary work contracts were not renewed. It was a double blow for the company. In February, after the government decided to make an international offering of its 21 per cent stake in the car company, Tofas was forced to open its books to the sort of audit scrutiny which would make most Turkish executives uncomfortable. Tofas has since seen its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) lose up to half their value and, at home, its market has been devastated as the car sector became the most visible victim of the crisis. International investors who subscribed to the issue, on the advice of J Henry Schroder Wagg and the US bank Lehman Bros, must be wondering whether they made the right decision. The switch in fortunes has certainly been dramatic. 'You should never see a factory like this,' says Mr Franco Grimme, who has been plant manager for nine years, surveying a empty shopfloor where the machinery and jigs are caught in suspended animation during one of the company's recent shutdowns. Last year, production by contrast, was in a state of almost perpetual motion, with three eight-hour shifts - Tofas even worked on the August Independence Day. In 1993, on the back of a general consumer boom in Turkey, car demand grew by 30 per cent. Tofas produced almost 200,000 units, with 40 per cent of its sales financed by consumer credit. Local producers were unable to meet the demand, leading to a surge in imported vehicles, with around 100,000 vehicles shipped to Turkey, according to industry estimates - mainly Skodas from the Czech Republic and Russian Ladas. Today, however, the picture has changed. Mr Nahum predicts that total car sales in 1994 will be around 250,000, including imports, compared with over 350,000 last year. In December, for example, the company's output was 774 cars a day in three shifts. Last month the number was 450, much the same volume that the company produced in 1991. 'We'll be doing well if we can return to last year's levels by 1996,' says Mr Nahum, whose father Bernard helped establish the Koc car empire in the 1950s. 'But we believe we can keep our market share.' This, it seems, is now the bottom line for the car companies. It explains why even in a deep sales trough, the market has seen the launch of new models. Toyota, with which the Sabanci group is in partnership, is speeding up plans to put its first locally manufactured Corolla on the road later this year. Renault's local joint venture, in which the French company is in collaboration with Oyak, the armed forces pension fund, has just launched its RI9. 'Everyone is preoccupied with launches to prevent sales shifting to the competition,' says Mr Nahum. There have also been moves to increase production inside the factory by reducing the outsourcing of components. In a normal year this exercise helps to reduce costs and take advantage of economies of scale. Today, however, the management's main concern is to look after its immediate workforce. The fuel tank construction which Tofas was to subcontract to an outside producer is now being made on site - all part of the official effort to maximise job hours in these straitened times. Nonetheless, some of the investments which would have gone ahead have been put on hold. Also, many of the investments which have been made to introduce new lines are underutilised as a result of the slowdown. 'This will remain idle and empty and waiting for an upsurge in demand,' laments Mr Nahum, as the company visit reaches one of the new production facilities. Overhanging the industry is concern about the customs union, which, barring upsets, should be in place in 1995. A report by McKinsey's, the US consultants - which the car industry commissioned - suggests that the local manufacturers need an additional five years to be ready for the import competition. Senior car executives have been in discussions with the government on possible tax breaks in a bid to help reduce costs and boost sales. But with the bureaucrats in Ankara also suffering from the absence of air conditioning and other indignities inflicted by the austerity programme, there is little sympathy for their cause. 'We are only now at a critical mass to be able to compete,' says Mr Nahum. His prediction is simple enough. 'If the Turkish car industry has problems, the Turkish economy will continue to have problems.'</p>

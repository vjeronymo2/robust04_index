			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Mannesmann Yesterday's 11 per cent slide in Mannesmann's share price suggests the market was caught offguard by an 89 per cent fall in first-half net profits. In fact, the decline in earnings is less dramatic if the investment in mobile telephones is stripped out. The comparable period was also flattered by an exceptional disposal gain, although the company has never revealed the exact amount. But even German disclosure practice cannot disguise a poor performance by the core engineering business. The company's gloomy statement on the trading outlook underlines that the market is right to err on the side of caution. With 60 per cent of sales coming from export markets, Mannesmann is a fair barometer of cyclical trends both in Germany and across the European capital goods sector. In common with its peers, yesterday's results show some benefits from restructuring and cost-cutting. The automotive division has moved back into profit, despite intense pricing pressure from manufacturers. The Brazilian operations have also been turned around. Yet these one-off gains only highlight some serious cyclical weakness in tubes, plant engineering and machinery  - which together account for more than half of sales. Without contributions from acquisitions, plant and machinery orders are running at a lower level than last year. Mannesmann's diversity may leave it better placed than the competition to ride out recession. With around DM3bn in the bank it appears to have pockets deep enough to maintain the dividend  - albeit at a cost of DM290m this year  - until the upturn. The prospect of profits from telecoms also argues for a higher multiple than for pure engineering stocks, although the message yesterday was that this argument can only be stretched so far.</p>

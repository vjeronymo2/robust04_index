			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Graeme Hart's corporate shopping list Graeme Hart will learn tomorrow if his audacious bid to become one of the most powerful retailers in Australia and New Zealand is still on track, writes Terry Hall. Three weeks ago he launched a Dollars NZ620m bid to buy Foodland, a troubled West Australian retailer. If the Australian Trade Practices Commission agrees, Hart will sell its Australian food stores to Coles Myers, and keep its substantial New Zealand operations - making him the dominant figure in New Zealand retailing. He is already a leading player in Australian bookselling, and has substantial printing and stationery business in both countries. Hart has achieved all this - plus a personal fortune of around Dollars NZ600m - in just six years. During one of New Zealand's worse recessions he has won control of every known target he has gone after, marking him out as a worthy successor to Sir Ron Brierley, New Zealand's best-known corporate predator. Hart left school at 15 and started driving a tow-truck. A year later he bought his own trucking business, and tried his hand at a variety of businesses before deciding - at the age of 31 - to study for his MBA at Otago University. His big break came in 1988, when he beat Brierley Investments to buy the Government Printing Office for Dollars NZ23m. Some estimates of the GPO's more likely value were as high as Dollars 125m. Since then Hart has not looked back. He manages his growing portfolio of companies with a tiny head office staff of seven, including a secretary and a receptionist. His former partner Colin Dewe says Hart customarily works 21 hours a day and his main recreation seems to be the 'three hours left for sleep'. For years Hart has said he would retire at 40. But with little over a year to go, Hart's friends believe that this is one bid in which he is bound to fail.</p>

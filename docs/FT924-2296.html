			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Treaty may leak through loopholes - Maastricht doubts have not been resolved BY contrast with earlier predictions of apocalyptic failure, the British government can claim to be reasonably satisfied with the way it managed the summit negotiations. The Danish problem was settled after a fashion, a pragmatic compromise was hammered out on expanding future Community budgets, and limits were placed on future Community legislation, in the name of the much-derided principle of 'subsidiarity'. Ahead of the summit, Britain had been castigated for its 'calamitous' presidency of the Council; but other member states have gracefully shifted from vituperation to compliments, and even forbore to insist on any new deadline for British ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Yet the Edinburgh meeting has been an essentially inconclusive affair. A year ago the 12 were in various states of euphoria over the completion of negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. Today the future and even the status of that treaty are in doubt, and these doubts have not been resolved by this weekend's summit meeting. The two central features of the treaty are a programme for Economic and Monetary Union, and a commitment to a common foreign and security policy, but both of them are now seriously in doubt. Since the monetary upheavals of this autumn, it is hard to believe that the Emu programme is feasible in the terms laid down by the treaty. In the light of events in ex-Yugoslavia, the claims of a common European foreign policy look derisory. The most pressing question was the Danish conundrum: how to give the Danes a series of opt-outs from the treaty, in a form that was sufficiently 'legally binding' to enable them to hold a second referendum, but not so legally binding as to require a new round of ratification in the other member states. That circle now appears to have been squared through the ingenious inventiveness of the Community's lawyers. And yet everyone knows that circles cannot really be squared. Appearances have been saved by the Danish deal, but the real result has been to void the Maastricht treaty of a little more of its content. The British government may nevertheless believe that the cumulative effect of the Edinburgh package can be seen as a significant double victory for its vision of a Community which is larger, looser and less integrated. The first half of that victory is the Danish deal: if Denmark can be allowed a comprehensive opt-out from most of the main objectives of Maastricht, those objectives cannot really be binding on the other member states. But the second half may seem just as significant, and that is the decision to open membership negotiations with the candidate countries from the European Free Trade Area. Britain would always have preferred a larger but looser Community, ideally nothing more than an inter-governmental free-trade area; so the combination of a deal which weakens the Maastricht treaty, and a decision to open the Community to a significant number of new members, looks very much like a setback for countries like France, which were demanding a 'deeper' and more integrated Community. However, it may be premature to claim a final victory in the long-running battle between the wideners and the deepeners. The wideners have won a skirmish, with the decision to open negotiations on the enlargement of the Community, even before the Maastricht treaty is ratified by all 12 member states. But these negotiations will compel the 12 to debate how a larger Community is to be governed and how it is to take decisions. By definition, the 12 will have to choose between a Community which will be hamstrung by swollen numbers, or one which must accept more majority voting for the sake of effectiveness. They will have to consider whether the universalist model of European integration can be maintained with a larger number of member states, or whether it will be necessary to go towards a multi-speed Europe. And they must consider whether a large Community can continue to give a large voting premium to small member states. In other words, the prospective enlargement of the Community will compel the 12 to confront constitutional issues which remained largely suppressed or shelved in the Maastricht treaty. This will not be an attractive agenda for the inter-governmentalists; and yet on certain aspects of this enlargement agenda, for example the relative voting weights of large and small countries, Britain, as a large country, could have a position similar to that of the deepeners. This is just one of the ironies of the integration game. The paradox is that these negotiations will require the prospective member states to swear their firm commitment to all the obligations of the European Community as modified by the Maastricht treaty; but they will be conducted under the presidency of Denmark, which has just been offered a comprehensive opt-out from these very obligations. There is no easy way of avoiding this charade; but it cannot fail to cast a certain disrepute on the treaty process. Some people profess to believe that the four or five applicants from Efta can be admitted without a serious federal-intergovernmental argument. Subsequent phases of enlargement to 25 or 30 member states would call for far-reaching revision of the Community's rulebook; but this first little enlargement would not require any significant reduction in the voting premium accorded under present rules to the small member states. The navete of this position will not stand up to the pressure of reality; the terms of this enlargement will automatically dictate the terms of subsequent enlargements. In a Community of 16 or 17, the small countries would be in a massive numerical majority, with half the weighted votes but with only a quarter of the population. Everybody knows that this weighting discrepancy will either be rectified before the Efta enlargement, or it will never be rectified. Since the question cannot be postponed to some easier time, it will be addressed, implicitly or explicitly, during the course of the Efta enlargement negotiations. The same logic will require a thorough review of the constitutional issues in the Maastricht treaty. The treaty itself calls for a special inter-governmental review conference in 1996. The conventional hypocrisy is that this review should take place after the admission of new members. No-one seems to acknowledge that it is an extraordinary idea that new members, who have spent 40 years refusing to join the Community, should be voting on the revision of the Maastricht treaty within weeks of their admission to full membership. The logical inference is that the 12 will have to hold their Maastricht review before they admit new members from Efta. Moreover, there will be one serious policy embarrassment in the admission of members from Efta. The Danes may be desperate to back out of the commitment to a common foreign and security policy, including eventually a defence policy. But some candidate countries, like Finland and Sweden, are keen to take on these new aspects of the Community, and will eagerly seek to join the Western European Union defence grouping. Here lies the rub. The WEU treaty includes a far-reaching mutual security guarantee, but it does not have any military organisation; all that has long since been delegated to Nato. The natural assumption is that the new arrivals should also join Nato; and yet it is virtually inconceivable that Washington would agree to an extension of its nuclear security guarantees, just when it is shrinking its military presence in Europe. So if the new Community members seriously claim the protection of WEU, the existing member states will have to consider whether WEU is to be endowed with real military capability; which would mean a military organisation distinct from Nato and therefore separate from the US. It is possible, of course, that none of these questions will be put to the test. The Swiss have already voted against the European Economic Area, which would be an ante-chamber to full membership; and opinion polls suggest that a majority of the Finns, the Norwegians and the Swedes are opposed to full membership. But perhaps they will change their minds, when they see that the Danish deal means that joining the Community does not really mean anything much after all.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] As soon as the public debt bonds are placed on the  market, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]  will be able to return to the Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV]  the funds this bank has disbursed to assist those banks that  have been intervened.    BCV President Antonio Casas Gonzalez is reluctant to  disburse  additional funds, but he said there is no other option.    The public credit law, which aims to provide funds to  Fogade,  stipulates these bonds should not accrue interest and are  nonnegotiable, but they may be redeemed early.</p>

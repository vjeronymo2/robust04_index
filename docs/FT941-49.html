			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pre-tax profits up at German metals group Pre-tax profits at Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German diversidied metals and engineering group, were up 60 per cent at DM55m (Dollars 33.1m) in the five months to end-February. However, angry shareholders at yesterday's annual general meeting were more concerned with calling for the resignation of Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, supervisory board chairman. Yesterday's meeting followed a 12-hour extraordinary general meeting last month, at which shareholders approved a DM3.4bn rescue package negotiated with the group's banks after its near-collapse in December. Criticism of Mr Schmitz was met with resounding applause. 'Your behaviour borders on the unscrupulous,' one shareholder said. Most of the some 300 shareholders present applauded calls for Mr Schmitz to resign. There were allegations that he failed to safeguard against the high risks of oil futures trading, which cost the company DM2.3bn. However, there were no formal motions to remove him from the board. Mr Schmitz, who is also a member of the Deutsche Bank management board, is believed to have the support of five banks and institutions, which together hold about 62 per cent of the group's shares. The pre-tax profit figures do not include the group's New York operation, or the interest payments to finance its losses of DM2.3bn. Group sales fell 1.4 per cent to DM7.14bn. A key vote to approve the activities of the much-criticised supervisory board was postponed until the next annual general meeting. Votes to approve the actions of the management and supervisory boards are standard practice at German general meetings. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who was appointed chief executive in December, said the group would create a holding structure and hive off its plant engineering and chemicals divisions.</p>

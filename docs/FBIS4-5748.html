			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the implementation of the North  America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) last January, the Economic  Planning Agency [EPA] has conducted a survey on the agreement's  impact on Japanese companies' investment behavior. According to  the survey results, Japanese companies are not yet highly  motivated for investments in Mexico and other NAFTA nations, and  the EPA concluded that NAFTA's impact on the companies' behavior  has not been clearly observed so far.    As a trilateral agreement among the United States, Canada,  and Mexico, NAFTA is seeking tariff cuts on a step-by-step basis  to establish a free trade zone involving the three nations.  Following implementation of NAFTA, the EPA surveyed 1,990  Japanese companies which have sales or production subsidiaries  overseas. As a result of the January survey, responses were  obtained from 635 companies.    In response to a (multiple-choice answer) question asking in  which countries or regions companies desire to expand their  operations, 41.6 percent said they want to expand business in  the United States; however, those who favored Mexico and Canada  remained at 10.4 and 6.5 percent, respectively. By contrast,  39.7 percent were interested in newly industrializing economies  (NIE's) in Asia, 53.2 percent preferred ASEAN, and 51.3 percent  were for China. The companies thus showed great interest in  Asia rather than NAFTA. Commenting on this, the EPA said that  the business sector prefers brisk and prospective markets, and  that NAFTA is unlikely to drastically change companies'  investment policies for the time being.    Yet, about 40 percent of the companies that are planning  expansion of operations in Mexico said their plans are to "catch  up with the regional economic merger." The EPA said that  influence of NAFTA is observed on this point.</p>

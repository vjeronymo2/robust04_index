			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Dazhen (0670 1129 2823), minister of power industry: </F> "Power Industry Should Take the Road of `Unconventional'  Development"]    [Text] RENMIN RIBAO's series report about the electric  power issue revealed that the development of power production in  our country was not suited to the needs of economic development.  This has aroused the attention of all social circles. How can  we change the situation of power shortages, which has lasted for  23 years, and move the power industry out of the difficulties  making it a "bottleneck" in the national economy so that it will  actually take the lead in economic development?    In our opinion, to settle this problem, we must carry out  in-  depth reforms and take the road of "unconventional" development.    The so-called "unconventional" development means that  developments should be made by breaking with conventions and  that a new path of reform and development should be opened  toward the goal of the socialist market economy. Thus, we  should make up our minds to proceed from solving the deep-level  problems that have been affecting the development of our  country's power industry and making major breakthroughs in  updating the conceptions, rationalizing production relations,  reinforcing building of the legal system, adopting the  standardized joint-stock system, promoting the separation of the  government from the enterprises, transforming the enterprise  management and operation mechanisms, and establishing a modern  system for the power producing enterprises. In particular, it  is necessary to actually intensify marcocontrol, further  increase investment, expand the scope of raising funds and  inviting foreign investment for running power plants, quicken  the pace of the electricity price reform, raise the debt  repayment capacity of the power plants, promote economical and  effective use of electric energy, substantially enhance the  economic efficiency of the enterprises, further emancipate the  productive forces in the power industry, and eventually create  favorable conditions for effecting a benign cycle in the  development of the power industry. Therefore, "unconventional"  development not only indicates quantitative increases but also  qualitative leaps; it not only requires a high growth speed but  also a rationalized operational mechanism.  <H3>  I. The Power Industry Cannot Move Out of the "Bottleneck"  Condition If It Merely Follows the Course of Conventional  Development </H3>   The power industry can also develop in a conventional  pattern, but in such a large country as ours, it will never be  able to meet the needs of economic development and the needs of  the people in their daily lives. In 1949, in the mainland, the  total electricity generating capacity was only 1.86 million kw,  and the annual electricity output was 4.3 billion kwh. After  the founding of New China, through nearly 40 years'  construction, in 1987, the capacity of installed generators and  the electricity output both leaped to the fourth place in the  world. It is expected that by the end of this year, the  national installed capacity will have exceeded 180 million kw  and the annual power output will have exceeded 800 billion kwh.  This means that at present, two day's average power output in  the whole country is equivalent to the whole year's power  production in 1949.    However, while power production was increasing rapidly, most  areas of the country were still facing increasingly serious  power shortages. The "bottleneck" constraint from power  shortages on our country's modern construction continued to be  aggravated. We can say that the localities which achieved  higher economic growth rates and made quicker development in the  power industry were also facing the most serious power shortages.    We cannot say that the state did not attach importance to  the  power industry in the more than 40 years after liberation; nor  can we say that the investment in the power industry was too  modest; and still less can we underestimate the effects of  reform and opening in the last more than 10 years on the  transformation of the power industry's management system. In  all fairness, however, such efforts and reforms still did not  break through the conventions in the development of the power  industry. This was quite natural. Most of the reform measures  and policies we adopted in the past were related to the  traditional structure of the planned economy and were  unavoidably constrained by the framework of the old systems, so  they could not thoroughly overcome the problems of the  traditional structure. It was precisely these problems which  restrained the power industry from taking the lead in the  development of the national economy.    The problems of the old structure mainly found expression  in the fact that enterprises were not separated from the  government and the power enterprises remained affiliates of  administrative institutions. First, in the structure of the  planned economy, macrocontrol was never freed from some people's  subjective haphazardness and this resulted in the insufficiency  of investment in the power industry, which developed on a  comparatively too small scale. The experts from the World Bank  held that investment in power production in developing countries  should account for over 2 percent of the GNP. However, the  annual average in our country in the period between 1980 and  1992 was only 1.24 percent. Experience shows that in the course  of a country's industrialization, the normal ratio between  power-consuming equipment and the capacity of power-generating  equipment should be 2:1. However, the ratio in our country was  far larger than 2:1 for many years. Not only is the existing  ratio much larger than 2:1 but the ratio for new equipment is  also larger than 2:1. Second, the work of economizing on  electric energy has never been placed in an important strategic  position and there are no relevant policies and measures and no  effective mechanisms and institutions for ensuring this. As a  result, people in all social circles do not pay sufficient  attention to energy economy. This has also made it hard to  widely and effectively adopt the measures for conserving  electric energy. The serious wastage of electric power thus  existed side by side with serious power shortages. Third, the  property rights were unclear. Responsibility, power, and benefit  in power production were not unified. The enterprises had to  eat from the same "big pot" of the state and workers had to eat  from the same "big pot" of the enterprise. For a long time,  state finances were responsible for all expenditure and revenue  in the power industry. Even after the management contract  system was adopted, this situation was not thoroughly changed.  The power enterprises had to deliver over 90 percent of their  profits to the state authorities in the form of various taxes  and fees. As they were situated in the narrow crevice between  the central and local financial authorities, the power  enterprises basically did not perform the investing and  financing functions. In foreign countries, power enterprises  normally hold 50 percent of the funds invested in capital  construction; and some even hold as much as 90 percent. In our  country, however, the power enterprises held less than 5 percent  of the funds invested. Because the power enterprises were not  independent commodity producers and dealers in real terms, they  were not faced with the pressure of competition. Overstaffing  was a prominent and longstanding problem in these enterprises.    The problems of the old structure also found expression in  the serious distortion of electricity prices, which did not  reflect the value of electric power nor the relationship between  supply and demand. The inappropriateness of the electricity  price led to a situation wherein the commodity attribute of  electric power was neglected by people for a long time, making  the power enterprises compete with other enterprises under  unfair conditions. As a result, the power enterprises could not  build up a management mechanism with perfect functions. This  was unfavorable to raising funds for developing the power  industry and also unfavorable to economizing on electric power  and restraining the excessive demand on it. Moreover, this was  also unfavorable to rationalizing the industrial structure and  to expanding the use of foreign funds for running the power  industry.    Within the power industry, being affected and shackled by  the  traditional structure, people's understanding of the market  economy lagged behind and the managerial personnel were not  familiar with such concepts as market, competition, economic  efficiency, and the input-output ratio. Thus, it is necessary  to thoroughly update their mentality.  <H3>  II. To Effect "Unconventional" Development, It Is Necessary  To Concentrate on Deepening Reform, Transforming Management  Mechanisms, Optimizing the Operational Structure, and Enhancing  Efficiency </H3>   In 1975, when Comrade Xiaoping took charge of the work of  the  State Council, he pointed out the need to quicken the  construction rate in the power industry to match it with the  development of the national economy as a whole and to leave a  certain leeway for ensuring that the power industry can take the  lead in development. Putting Comrade Xiaoping's instruction into  practice is the goal of the power industry's efforts under the  new situation. According to our plan, in the period between  1995 and 1997, the capacity of new large and medium generating  sets should reach an average of over 15 million kw annually; and  in the period between 1998 and 2000, this should increase to 20  million kw annually. While the electricity sources are  increasing, power technology and power grids as well as  education in the power industry should also develop at the same  pace. Thus, by the end of this century, the total capacity of  installed generators in our country will reach about 310 million  kw. If GNP increases by 8 to 9 percent annually and the power  consmption of the unit output value in the whole country  declines by 8 or 9 percent, then the power shortages will have  been basically overcome and power supply will reach all  counties. Over 95 percent of the peasant households will be  able to use electricity. To achieve this objective, we must  deepen reform and seek "unconventional" development.    The "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee indicated that the economic reform in  the whole country had entered a new stage of comprehensive,  accelerated, and well coordinated development. The recent  national economic work conference also advanced reform in giant  strides and adopted many reform measures. This provided an  unprecedentedly good opportunity for the "unconventional"  development of the power industry. In order to grasp and use  this opportunity well, the power industry must formulate the  reform strategy, which is mainly oriented to reorganizing the  power enterprises according to the corporate system and shifting  them onto the path of commercial operations, as quickly as  possible and effectively put it into practice.    The adoption of the corporate system is a useful exploration  in the establishment of the modern electric power enterprise  system. The key issue is to set up a modern electric power  enterprise system which is suited to the requirements of the  market economy, has clear property rights, distinctly defines  responsibility and power, separates the enterprise from the  government, and exercises scientific management. Commercial  operation is the inevitable result of the market-oriented reform  in the power enterprises. The key issue is to firmly establish  the concept that electric power is a commodity; create a policy  environment for ensuring fair competition; and really turn the  power enterprises into economic entities and market competitors  which operate independently, bear sole responsibility for their  own profits and losses, and have the ability to effect  self-developemnt and exercise self-control. This is precisely  the path of the standardized joint-stock system.    The joint-stock system is a rather effective form of  enterprise organization and operation as it is suited to the  need, in the development of socialized production, for the rapid  concentration of capital and it has been widely adopted in  various countries. In addition, it is also an organizational  form which can better give expression to the nature of the  socialist whole people ownership system and is an effective way  to effect the "unconventional" development of the power  industry. According to the current condition of our country's  power industry and its tasks, the joint- stock system should be  adopted and experimented with; this is more urgent and more  favorable in the power industry than in other industries. The  primary purpose of adopting the joint-stock system in the power  industry is to effect the transformation of the enterprise  management mechanism and the key to its success lies in strict  standardization. In essence, the so-called standardized  joint-stock system must: Be in keeping with our country's  specific conditions; follow the general laws governing the  socialist market economy as well as the special laws governing  production, marketing, and purchasing in the power industry; be  in line with the state's general requirements on experiments  with the joint-stock system and the state's "20-character"  guideline for the power industry's reform and development; and  must be favorable to the fundamental emancipation of productive  forces in the power industry.    In 1987, the State Council formulated a guideline for the  reform and development of the power industry: "Separating the  enterprises from the government, turning the provincial grids  into economic entities, combining the grids, unifying power  distribution, and raising funds to develop the power industry."  The State Council also laid down the principle of "adopting  measures in the light of the conditions of local grids."  Practice has proved that this is a good guideline which is in  keeping with China's national conditions and the intrinsic laws  of the power industry. It systematically reveals the way to  solve the deep problems affecting the development of the power  industry. Under the new situation of the socialist market  economy, "separating the enterprises from the government" is the  orientation to which the reform and development of the power  industry must adhere. "Turning the provincial grids into  economic entities and combining the grids" is the conclusion  drawn from the objective laws governing the development of the  power industry and the reality of China's economic management.  In essence, it stresses that the provincial and transprovincial  power grids should all be economic entities operating  independently, bearing sole responsibility for their own profits  and losses, and having the ability to develop on their own and  exercise self-control. At the same time, they also form an  interest community composed of the interests of various  quarters. "Unifying power distribution" is determined by the  intrinsic law of the power industry and the complete concept of  "unifying power distribution and exercising management at  different levels." Raising funds to develop the power industry  is a major result of the structural reform in the power  industry. The power industry should develop ahead of other  industries. It is necessary to use both domestic and overseas  funds from domestic and international markets. The orientation  of "raising funds to develop the power industry" must be  maintained. The forms of fundraising to develop the power  industry should also be improved and upgraded in the structure  of the socialist market economy and should be gradually upgraded  to the advanced form of joint ventures based on the standardized  joint-stock system. The standardized joint-stock system is the  advanced form of raising funds to develop the power industry.  It not only has stronger investing and financing functions, and  can more effectively attract international and domestic funds,  but also can rationalize the complicated production relations  formed in the course of raising funds to develop the power  industry because it clearly defines the property rights. This  provides a legal guarantee for the real separation of ownership  from management power, ensuring the legitimate rights and  interests of investors and the operation of managers in light of  the laws and regulations. This is favorable to the  standardization of raising funds to develop the power industry  and using foreign funds and is also favorable to the authorized  operation of state assets. Thus, the operational efficiency of  the state assets and other assets will be enhanced and the value  of the state assets and other assets will be better preserved  and increased. "Adopting measures in the light of the  conditions of the local grids" is a principle that must be  followed in the structural reform and development of the power  industry. As long as we constantly arrange everything according  to the actual conditions, we can certainly find the path of  pursuing the standardized joint-stock system suited to the  conditions of various localities and various local grids,  promoting the healthy development of the power industry.    Following the "20-character" guideline, we can adopt various  forms of the standardized joint-stock system. No matter which  form is used, the enterprises must voluntarily involve  themselves in the joint-stock system. For example, after the  provincial grids are allowed to turn themselves into economic  entities under the standardized joint-stock system, with the  approval of the administrative departments in charge at the  upper level, there may exist a certain number of power companies  managed by investors on their own and power plants run by other  industries. However, they must sign grid-connection agreements  with the local grids as well as electric power purchase and sale  contracts in order to guarantee their interests and clarify  their responsibilities. With the approval of the administrative  departments in charge of the power industry at the upper levels,  experiments with newer and more dynamic management forms of the  joint-stock system may be carried out within a certain scope and  according to the conditions of local economic development, such  as in some cities and counties in the eastern coastal areas  where the economies are growing faster. They can be called  power industry "development zones." It is hoped that local  governments will formulate as many favorable policies as they  can to encourage various quarters to run power plants. People  determined to engage themselves in the power industry should  fully and properly apply these favorable policies, increase  their investment, and increase the production of electricity at  a higher annual rate. This will bring about a chain-reaction  mechanism favorable to the development of the power industry.  This is a major measure for encouraging the economically  developed localities to become rich first in the consumption of  electric power and bear responsibility for increasing power  supplies and perfecting the local power grids.  <H3>  III. With the Standardized Joint-stock System, It Is  Necessary To Strengthen Leadership, Boldly Carry Out  Experiments, and Make Steady Advances </H3>   Through the market-oriented and world-oriented reform and  opening in the past more than 10 years, a good foundation has  been laid for us to adopt the standardized joint-stock system.  On the whole, however, our reform remains in the initial stage  and unevenness is prevalent. At present, the pilot schemes of  adopting the standardized joint-stock system have just been  started in some enterprises of higher quality and stronger  competitive power, to achieve results and to accumulate  experience for guiding the nationwide reform. Other enterprises  should also actively create the necessary conditions, improve  their quality, and make steady advances. They must not rush  headlong into mass action.    The enterprises which carry out the pilot schemes for the  standardized joint-stock system must strictly follow the  regulations and procedures laid down by the state and the  ministry, advancing their work in a well planned and orderly  manner by taking one solid step after another. They should act  in light of their concrete conditions according to the  "20-character" guideline and should actively explore the  concrete forms of practicing the standardized joint-stock system  which suit their own conditions. Their efforts should be  focused on studying and determining the concrete organizational  form of practicing the standardized joint-stock system.    Various power groups should perfect their organizational  structures in the light of the requirements of the modern  enterprise system and also improve their functional structure  according to the requirements of commercialization. The key  point is to implement the State Council leading comrade's  instructions on allocating part of the state investment to the  power groups as their capital funds, to strengthen their  investing and financing functions, and setting up a power grid  construction fund so that backbone grids will be constructed and  managed by the groups which are also responsible for contracting  loans, paying interest, and repaying debts. The power groups  must control 100 percent of the shares in the backbone power  grids and should directly contract loans from the state's  Development Bank. It is necessary to enliven the existing state  assets in the power industry. For example, after the income  from power supply is used to repay the debts and pay interest,  the principal and interest payments should be reinvested in the  power industry and managed by the power enterprises. The  existing and added assets of the power grids should not be  managed separately; instead, they should all be managed by the  power group corporations. The power group corporations should  input the state's capital funds to the large backbone power  plants with the capacity to bear the peak load of the power  grids, including the water- pumping energy conservation power  plants and the power plants and nuclear power plants bearing the  peak loads. They should also exercise effective control and  direct management over these power plants on behalf of the  state. The state-controlled power corporations with limited  liabilities and limited shares should be established on this  basis.    It is necessary to carry out the principle of allowing  various quarters to run power plants with the grids being  brought under unified management. Under the premise of  guaranteeing the safe operation of the power grids, we can  explore various other forms of practicing the standardized  joint-stock system inside the power grids. Domestic and  overseas investors should be encouraged to input funds to start  new power plant projects. However, investments and loans should  be clearly separated. Investors may earn dividends according to  the size of their shares and lenders may receive principal and  interest payments. The parties contributing funds may select  their roles as investors or lenders.    In the next seven years, the power industry will need to use  $25 billion of foreign funds in order to import 45 million kw  power generation equipment. Therefore, in addition to expanding  the use of foreign government loans, loans offered by  international financial institutions, and commercial loans, we  also need to attract more direct foreign investment in the power  industry. This will promote the reasonable movement of existing  capital. Foreign investors should be encouraged to launch joint  ventures, start cooperation projects, or make independent  investments in the field of building power plants. It is  necessary to establish and perfect the legal system for the use  of foreign funds in the power industry and effectively reinforce  the management of the trades that need to use foreign-funded  power. The state interests should be guaranteed, leadership  should be strengthened, the regulations should be strictly  enforced, and risks should be undertaken jointly. The foreign  funds should not be used at too high a return rate or a fixed  return rate in order to prevent the Chinese side from incurring  losses.    Reform is aimed at emancipating and developing the  productive  forces. It is necessary to emancipate and develop the  productive forces in the power industry and to ensure that the  power industry takes the lead in development. Thus, we must  fully arouse the initiative of the central and local authorities  and the initiative of all quarters. This is the key to the  success of the reform.    In order to effect "unconventional" development of the power  industry and make it better serve the development of the  national economy we must, under the correct leadership of the  party Central Committee and the State Council and with the great  support of the comprehensive departments, exert ourselves, do  solid and effective work, improve our work style, combine the  long-term objective with down-to-earth work attitude, unite as  one, and make persistent and unswerving efforts. We shall then  certainly be able to achieve our goal.</p>

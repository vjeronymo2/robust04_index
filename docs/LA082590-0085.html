			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CAMARENA MISTRIAL MOTION MAY BE HEARD IN  OCTOBER  </P> <P> A federal prosecutor said Friday he anticipated that a hearing on a defense  motion for a mistrial in the recently concluded Enrique Camarena murder case  would be held in October. Lawyers for four defendants convicted in the Los  Angeles trial filed for a mistrial last week because of alleged juror  misconduct.  </P> <P> Juror William R. Parris of Lancaster had signed a sworn declaration alleging  that jurors frequently ignored U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's  instructions to avoid news accounts of the trial and that a federal marshal  urged the panel to return a quick verdict on one of the defendants. The  declaration alleged that during deliberations jurors skimmed newspaper  headlines about the case on a daily basis and discussed information they had  heard on television about the trial.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VICIOUS RAG WAR'S BIZARRE CONCLUSION;  </P> <P> RETAILING: THE CREATORS OF GUESS JEANS WON'T PAY A $10-MILLION BOUNTY TO THEIR  SUPERSTAR LAWYER, WHO IN TURN FILES A $17-MILLION LIEN. IS THE FIGHT REALLY  OVER?  </P> <P> It was, perhaps, the only way that this lawsuit could have ended.  </P> <P> After a 6 1/2-year legal free-for-all, the Marciano brothers, creators of Guess  jeans, won back full control Wednesday of that garment industry gold mine from  their archenemies, the Nakash brothers, founders of Jordache.  </P> <P> But rather than giving rise to unvarnished celebration, the settlement of the  rag war only opened the door to more contention -- this time between the  mercurial Marcianos and their superstar attorney, Marshall B. Grossman.  </P> <P> The Marcianos, who cast off at least three high-priced law firms before  settling on Grossman to mastermind their case through five years of legal  wrangling and two protracted Superior Court trials, turned to other powerhouse  lawyers at the 11th hour to negotiate a settlement with the Nakashes.  </P> <P> And not only did the Marcianos charge, in the aftermath, that Grossman tried to  block the settlement, they declared that they would not pay the $10-million  bounty they'd promised him if he restored their control of Guess.  </P> <P> So, hours after the Marcianos sauntered into court singing the praises of  Howard L. Weitzman, the Nakashes' attorney, and wearing lapel buttons  emblazoned with his name, sources said Grossman filed a $17-million lien  against the Marcianos' proceeds from the settlement.  </P> <P> It was the kind of day, in other words, that Los Angeles trial lawyers, who had  watched the case intently, could only term "bizarre" and "incredible."  </P> <P> "As one of the lawyers described it at one point, being a lawyer in this case  was like riding a bucking bronco," said Daniel J. Woods, one of the succession  of lawyers who represented the Nakashes in the Guess-Jordache imbroglio.  "Sooner or later all the lawyers were going to get thrown out of the saddle."  </P> <P> Grossman, it seems, landed with quite a thump.  </P> <P> One of the most feared trial lawyers in Los Angeles, he was the victor in  celebrated cases against Playboy Enterprises, movie mogul Marvin Davis and  sports agent Mike Trope. Last year, Grossman convinced a Los Angeles jury that  the Nakashes had defrauded the Marcianos when they first became partners in  Guess. That verdict set the stage for the trial that ended abruptly Wednesday,  in which a jury was already deliberating how much the Nakashes owed the  Marcianos for their misconduct.  </P> <P> Those successes seemed forgotten by the Marcianos, who had no good words for  the lawyer they till lately could not stop praising.  </P> <P> "He did everything possible to derail the settlement," said Paul Marciano, the  family spokesman and the force behind Guess' riveting ad campaigns. "My opinion  is that he wanted the verdict badly, and didn't get it."  </P> <P> Grossman calmly denied the accusation, insisting that he had worked for five  years to settle the dispute -- a battle waged not only in courts in Los  Angeles, New York, Delaware and Hong Kong, but in criminal grand juries and the  committee rooms of congressional investigators.  </P> <P> But there was no denying that it was two other lawyers, Richard M. Coleman and  Pierce O'Donnell -- the latter fresh from winning columnist Art Buchwald's case  against Paramount Pictures over the origins of "Coming to America" -- who  struck a deal with Weitzman. Their pact returned control of Guess to the  Marcianos and made a still-secret division of the $106 million in company  profits that piled up during the legal warfare.  </P> <P> Trial lawyers say it is not unheard of for one set of lawyers to pursue  settlement on a client's behalf while others are pushing for victory at trial.  But it is unusual.  </P> <P> "The lawyers involved are obviously among the most high-profile . . . people in  town," said Los Angeles attorney Alan I. Rothenberg, president of the State Bar  of California. "It's an incredible twist to end it."  </P> <P> What happened?  </P> <P> Stories differ. One lawyer familiar with the case said pressure from insurance  companies -- which have raised objections to paying for the defense of the  Nakashes and Marcianos -- pushed the two sides toward settlement. But Grossman,  other attorneys said, was so intent on winning a jury verdict that he could not  stand back and negotiate a compromise.  </P> <P> Paul Marciano said Grossman wanted both the glory of a legal victory as well as  an undisputed claim to the $10-million bonus. Marciano said that he offered  Grossman a small bonus, but that Grossman declined it.  </P> <P> Weitzman, whose clients have included sports car maker John Z. DeLorean and  former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, said simply that O'Donnell and  Coleman "brought a different perspective to the table than Marshall did."  </P> <P> Grossman, meanwhile, pointed cryptically to differences between the four  Marciano brothers to explain the new lawyers. O'Donnell and Paul Marciano  denied that the brothers had been at odds; Coleman could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Grossman declined to discuss his fee arrangements, the $10-million bonus, or  the filing of a lien against the Marcianos. Instead, he claimed "a very  substantial victory," one nothing short of "a miracle," in regaining control of  Guess for the Marcianos seven years after they sold a half-interest to the  Nakashes -- a half-interest sold for $4.8 million that now is worth hundreds of  millions of dollars.  </P> <P> MAIN STORY: A1  </P></p>

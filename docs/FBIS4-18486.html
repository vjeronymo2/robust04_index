			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- France has urged inclusion  of workers' rights and environment committees in the future  World Trade Organisation (WTO), to be created after ratification  of the Uruguay Round of GATT global trade talks in Morocco, next  week.    Premier Edouard Balladur wrote to European leaders arguing  that the two issues should come within the compass of the WTO, a  communique by Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said.    The communique, released after a ministerial meeting chaired  by Balladur, said the WTO should "deal with issues affecting  international trade such as the environment and workers' rights."    Setting up an environment committee has already been agreed,  but many countries, in particular developing countries, are  opposed to creation of a committee on social issues, including  workers' rights.    In the communique, Longuet said it was Europe's duty "to  promote economic and social development and to defend human  rights, in particular those of the individual at work" when  setting up international trade rules and mechanisms.</p>

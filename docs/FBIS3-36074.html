Yeltsin's first official visit to a Commonwealth state, leaving  aside his fleeting visit to Ashgabat and his talks with  Saparmurad Niyazov.    The political nuances of the visit were examined at Andrey  Kozyrev's conference with North Caucasus leaders. As the  minister remarked, this is a major step aimed at implementing a  strategic line in the Caucasus, which Russia has traditionally  regarded as a zone of its geopolitical interests. Russia would  not like to have on its border a state torn apart by internal  conflicts and drowning in economic chaos and crime.    The preconditions for establishing cooperation have been  created. Georgia has become a member of the CIS and the  Collective Security Council. But it remains the only neighbor  with which Moscow does not have a framework treaty on the bases  of relations or agreements on border questions. The Russian  delegation is taking a set of these documents with it to  Tbilisi, where it intends to sign them. There is nothing in  them that conflicts with the interests of the North Caucasus  republics. They have no grounds for suspecting that any kind of  "military-political alliance" is being prepared between Russia  and Georgia against Abkhazia, the minister stressed.    One of the main tasks of the visit is to promote the  settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.    Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that in principle Russia has  decided to conduct peace-keeping operations in Abkhazia and  intends to seek the participation of UN and CSCE international  observers in it. The minister recognized at this point that  Russia bears the main burden of the peacemaking work and the  protection of people's lives, Georgia's sovereignty, and the  rights of the ethnic minorities.</p>

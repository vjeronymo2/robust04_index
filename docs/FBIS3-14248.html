			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat and Salamah Ni'mat </F> in Amman]    [Text] King Husayn Bin-Talal began a several-day private  visit to the Sultanate of Oman for talks with Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id about regional and Arab issues.    Informed sources speaking with AL-HAYAH thought it likely  that the two monarchs, who have strong personal ties and conduct  regular talks, would confine their discussions to the political  crisis in Yemen. They have taken a mediating role and  responsibility for the signing of the pledge and accord  agreement, which lost no time in breaking down.    These sources indicated their belief that the visit of the  Jordanian monarch and his talks in Salalah (Sultan Qabus'  southern summer capital, about 1,000 km from Muscat) are what  will decide whether the two sides will proceed in their joint  mediation or whether they will give the opportunity to other  Arab parties that have entered the crisis recently, especially  President Husni Mubarak, who announced day before yesterday that  he is trying to arrange a peace settlement in Cairo between the  chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, Lieutenant General  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council, 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    These sources said that Oman, which borders Yemen, feels  uneasy at the continuation of the Yemeni crisis and the threat  that it represents to the stability of the the Arabian Peninsula  and the Gulf. [They added that] it and Jordan have sent a joint  military committee composed of officers from the two countries  to prevent the outbreak of war between north and south Yemen.    The issue that has given these sources the impression that  the two countries are studying the next step in their joint  effort to solve the Yemeni crisis is the fact that a joint visit  announced in Amman that the Jordanian and Omani foreign  ministers were to take to Yemen before the 'Id al-Fitr [13  March] did not take place.    King Husayn will also present to his host the permanent  topic  in their discussions since the second Gulf crisis--that of  Gulf-Jordanian relations, which have severely deteriorated since  that time. The Jordanian monarch will go on to Qatar after his  visit to the Sultanate in an official visit that is his first to  a Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] country (other than Oman) since  the summer of 1990.    Observers in Muscat told AL-HAYAH that the visit to Qatar  opens a new window for Jordan in the GCC, but does not  necessarily mean that normalization with the rest of the GCC  states has become imminent.    In Amman, Jordanian political sources yesterday opined that  King Husayn's visit to the Sultanate of Oman within the  framework of his tour to the state of Qatar is a Jordanian move  aimed at exiting from the Arab isolation that has been imposed  on it by the Gulf crisis and war and at apprising most of the  Arab leaders of the likely collapse of the peace process in the  region.    An informed political authority said that Jordan believes  that the isolation it is still suffering more than three years  after the Gulf crisis and war is part of the pressure being put  on it within the framework of the peace process. A senior  Jordanian official indicated that the United States stands  behind the political and economic pressure that the Kingdom  faces and the continuation of the Arab boycott of it. He pointed  out that the continuation of the naval blockade of the Jordanian  port of al-'Aqabah and the escalation of the International  Monetary Fund's pressure with regard to foreign debt servicing  have a direct relationship with Jordan's resistance to being  pushed in the direction of a quick settlement with Israel  without waiting for the achievement of noticeable progress on  the other negotiation paths.  The political authority says that King Husayn will inform the  Omani and Qatari leaders of his concept of the results of the  peace settlement between Israel and the PLO, and of its  reflections on Jordan and intra-Arab relations. The Jordanian  monarch made telephone calls to the leaders of Syria, Egypt,  Morocco, and the PLO immediately after the Security Council  issued its resolution on the Mosque of Ibrahim massacre, and the  abstention of the United States from voting on the part of the  resolution that considers eastern Jerusalem part of the Arab  occupied territories, as mentioned by Security Council  Resolution 242 of 1967.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT ACTION ENDS 26-YEAR L.A. SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASE  </P> <P> Ending an often bitter 26-year legal battle, a federal judge in Los Angeles on  Monday dismissed the last remaining defendant in a class-action lawsuit to  desegregate the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima dropped the state Department of  Education and Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig from the suit at the  request of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, which said  it could not afford to continue pressing the case.  </P> <P> The state had become the sole defendant in January, when Tashima dismissed the  Los Angeles school district from the case.  </P> <P> Because the NAACP agreed to the dismissal, it cannot appeal the decision.  Moreover, it is effectively barred from legally renewing its charges that the  district caused the intentional segregation of black students from 1963, when  the original desegregation suit was filed, to the present.  </P> <P> But the district still faces allegations of unequal treatment of minority  students in a suit brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education  Fund and other public-interest law firms in 1986.  </P> <P> And the federal court action does not preclude the NAACP from suing the  district for discriminating against ethnic minority students if it finds  evidence of such discrimination in the future.  </P> <P> The dismissal came as the Los Angeles Board of Education was scheduled to vote  on a massive plan to raise achievement levels of minority students. The  proposed plan is not related to the NAACP suit, but addresses some of the same  issues and acknowledges that "institutional racism" contributes to inferior  education for minorities.  </P> <P> Some observers said they were doubtful that any civil rights organization could  afford the monumental costs of litigating a major school desegregation lawsuit  in the future.  </P> <P> Gary Orfield, a University of Chicago desegregation expert, said the end of the  Los Angeles desegregation case focuses attention on the "special problems in  the very largest cities -- Chicago, New York and Los Angeles -- that have  patterns of segregation no one can afford to litigate. It would cost so many  millions of dollars, beyond the capacity of any minority group in the country  to pay . . . so we may have a situation where justice exists, but no one can  afford to obtain it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learned the Hard Way  </P> <P> Said Joseph H. Duff, an NAACP lawyer who recently was elected president of the  organization's Los Angeles branch: "That is essentially the lesson we learned  -- the hard way."  </P> <P> Duff would not comment on the long-term impact of the judge's decision to end  the protracted lawsuit, but said he is keenly disappointed by it.  </P> <P> "We clearly have not gained any desegregation in the district," he said.  </P> <P> Duff said the NAACP lacks the manpower and the money to adequately research the  case, which would have involved reviewing thousands of pages of documents  produced by the district and the state. He said he does not know how much the  group has spent on the lawsuit. But school district officials estimate district  expenses at more than $4 million since 1963.  </P> <P> "The NAACP will be working politically" to try to force changes in the Los  Angeles school district that will improve education for minorities,  particularly for black youngsters, Duff added.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. G. R. Overton, representing the state, said Monday that "this  case couldn't have been brought successfully even eight years ago" because of  demographic shifts in the district toward a majority of non-Anglo students and  because of the hardships posed by the long commutes many children would have  had to endure if mandatory busing was ordered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Enough Anglos  </P> <P> In the mid-1960s, the school district was more than 55% Anglo. Today, Anglo  youngsters account for 15.8% of the total enrollment of 595,000 students.  Fifty-nine percent are Latino, 16.7% are black, 6.4% are Asian and Pacific  Islander, 1.9% are Filipino and 0.2% are American Indian.  </P> <P> The NAACP filed its original desegregation case on behalf of the district's  black students in 1963 in Los Angeles Superior Court. That suit led to nearly  three combative years of court-ordered busing, which ended after voters  approved Proposition 1 in 1979, an initiative that barred state courts from  ordering busing as a remedy for segregation.  </P> <P> The civil rights group refiled the case in federal court in 1981, again  alleging that the district has unlawfully discriminated against black students  through policies and actions dating back to 1969.  </P> <P> School district officials say, however, that the district's voluntary  desegregation efforts have achieved as much integration as possible in a  district with fewer than 100,000 white students.  </P> <P> The district spends about $260 million a year on integration programs,  including voluntary busing -- chiefly of black students to predominantly Anglo  schools -- and magnet schools, which offer specialized or accelerated learning  to about 25,000 of the district's 595,000 students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Programs in Place  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of programs in place that are helping minority kids right  now," said Peter W. James, a lawyer with McCutchen, Black, Verleger &amp; Shea,  which represented the district in the case.  </P> <P> Last June, NAACP officials were hopeful that they could craft a settlement with  the district that would create new educational programs for minority youngsters  that would begin to reverse years of academic failure. Among the efforts the  civil rights group had envisioned were an expansion of the district's "10  Schools Program," in which 10 of the district's lowest achieving black schools  were reorganized and given special aid, and reducing class sizes in  predominantly black and Latino schools to a maximum of 18 students each. The  district estimated that the new programs would cost in excess of $80 million.  </P> <P> The district relies heavily on the state to cover the costs of integration. But  late last year the state said it would not pay for the proposed programs, and  settlement efforts crumbled.  </P> <P> Duff was critical of the 10-year plan for ending low achievement that was to be  addressed by the school board Monday. The plan calls for a number of costly  changes, such as smaller classes in kindergarten through second grades and more  pre-kindergarten programs. But Duff said it failed to adequately focus on the  specific needs of black youngsters.  </P> <P> "In this district, the achievement problem is essentially a black problem, and  until they deal with that, the other problems are not going to get solved."  </P> <P> The NAACP lawyer acknowledged that the desegregation battles produced some  benefits for minority children, noting that the district's magnet and voluntary  busing programs resulted in "an opening up of white schools to minority  children." But overall, he said, the solutions offered by the district "haven't  matched the problems."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Roxane Arnold contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE DESEGREGATION CASE  </P> <P> Aug. 1, 1963 -- Original complaint filed by parents of Mary Ellen Crawford and  several others, under the co-sponsorship of the American Civil Liberties Union  and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Petition for Removal of Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, requires that an alien entrepreneur file a petition for removal of conditions during the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status (section 216A(d)(2)(A) of the Act). The petition should include any spouse or children accorded conditional permanent resident status. Children who have reached the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence will remain eligible for removal of conditions. The statute also calls for a personal interview of the alien within 90 days after the date the alien files the petition for removal of conditions. The Service may waive the requirement of an interview in appropriate cases (section 216A(d)(3) of the Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule provides that the required petition shall be filed with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's commercial enterprise. The petition will be reviewed by the Service Center, and a determination will be made on the necessity of an interview. If the Service Center director determines in his or her discretion that a decision may be made on the basis of the petition and accompanying evidence without the necessity of an interview, the decision on the petition will be rendered at the Service Center. If the director determines that an interview is needed, the Service Center director will schedule the alien for an interview to be held at the local Service district office or sub-office having jurisdiction over the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States. The local district office will then take responsibility for the case to its conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Decision on Petition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the alien's petition is approved, the conditional basis of the beneficiaries' permanent resident status will be removed as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent resident. Denial of a petition will result in termination of the alien's lawful permanent resident status and issuance by the Service of an order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United States. There is no appeal from this denial, but the alien may seek review of the decision by the immigration judge in deportation proceedings. In such deportation proceedings, the burden shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the alien's petition for removal of conditions are not true. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service explored the possibility of establishing by regulation some form of hardship waiver similar to that set forth at 8 CFR 216.5 for removal of conditions for certain alien spouses and sons and daughters. The Service has concluded that such a waiver cannot, consistent with the statute, be created by regulation for alien entrepreneurs. Section 216A(c)(3)(C) of the Act sets out a mandatory instruction: The Attorney General shall terminate the permanent resident status of an alien entrepreneur who has failed to comply with the requirements for removal of conditions. Unlike section 216, section 216A of the Act does not provide for the waiver of these requirements in cases of hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the statute does not provide for a waiver of requirements for removal of conditions for alien entrepreneurs, the requirement that an alien entrepreneur has sustained his or her investment of the requisite capital during the two years of conditional residence will be interpreted flexibly. The alien entrepreneur will be considered to have ``sustained'' the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence. This liberal interpretation of the term ``sustained'' in section 216A(a)(1)(C) of the Act permits the Service maximum flexibility in determining whether the prerequisites for removal of the conditions have been met in light of the congressional intent underlying this provision. The Service recognizes that a bona-fide and good faith investment may not meet all of the expectations envisioned when the alien entrepreneur obtained conditional residence status. For example, the fact that an alien entrepreneur has less than the requisite capital invested in the enterprise at the end of the two-year conditional period would not necessarily require the denial of the petition to remove conditions. The petition could be granted if the alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial portion of the requisite capital, thereby demonstrating that he or she was actively sustaining his or her investment in the enterprise as required by the statute. The determination of whether an alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial portion of the requisite capital in good faith will be made on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule reflects this standard at 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii) and 8 CFR 216.6(c)(1)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following example illustrates how the alien entrepreneur can ``substantially meet'' the capital investment requirement. An alien entrepreneur is granted conditional residence based on a business plan which envisioned an investment of $1.2 million. At the end of the conditional residence period, he or she has invested only $800,000 in a non-targeted employment area, because through circumstances beyond the alien's control, construction of a facility took longer than anticipated. The Service may remove the conditions, if the entrepreneur can show that he or she can and will invest the additional capital within a reasonable time to complete the investment. On the other hand, if the entrepreneur cannot show that he or she will be able to generate additional capital within a reasonable time, regardless of his or her good-faith efforts, the Service will not remove the conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

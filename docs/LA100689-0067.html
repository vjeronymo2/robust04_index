			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTONIANS BACK DOWN IN DISPUTE WITH KREMLIN  </P> <P> The Estonian Parliament backed down in a dispute with the Kremlin on Thursday,  suspending clauses in a local election law that deprived thousands of Russian  immigrants of the vote.  </P> <P> Estonian radio said 172 of the 243 deputies accepted a proposal by the  republic's president, Arnold Ruutel, to suspend provisions of the law that  allowed only people who had lived in the republic for at least two years to  vote.  </P> <P> The law provoked a rash of strikes by local ethnic Russian workers after it was  passed by the Estonian Parliament in August.  </P> <P> "It was decided to modify the law in view of the current political situation  and, in particular, because of the threat of more strikes," a journalist at  Estonian television told Reuters news agency.  </P> <P> The compromise, which will allow all residents to take part in local elections  Dec. 10, appears to be part of an attempt by Estonia's reformist leadership to  steer away from conflict with Moscow over the issue.  </P> <P> The move was attacked by Estonian nationalists who are pressing for a return to  the independence enjoyed by the republic until 1940.  </P> <P> "We never expect much from this puppet Parliament anyway," said Trivimi  Velliste, president of the nationalist Estonian Heritage Foundation. "But how  can the Parliament vote one way in August and another way now?"  </P> <P> Estonian journalists said deputies agreed to Ruutel's appeal to suspend the  clause apparently in an attempt to rectify what had appeared to have been a  political miscalculation.  </P> <P> Estimates of how many of the republic's 1.5 million people were disenfranchised  by the law varied between 10,000 and 100,000.  </P> <P> They are among hundreds of thousands of Russians and other non-Estonians who  moved to the republic since 1940 as part of a policy of "Russification."  </P> <P> The residence requirement brought the republic's leadership into conflict with  members of the Russian minority, who said the law made them second-class  citizens.  </P> <P> It was condemned by the Kremlin, which declared that it was incompatible with  provisions of the Soviet constitution, which guarantee the vote to every  citizen.  </P> <P> The controversy also appeared to play a large part in provoking a denunciation  by the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee of nationalism and separatism  in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  </P> <P> Estonian deputies pledged Thursday to continue discussion of even more  controversial plans to introduce a separate Estonian citizenship alongside the  Soviet one, to which the right to vote would be tied in the future.  </P> <P> The Kremlin faced another nationalist headache this weekend in the Baltic  region, where the radical Latvian Popular Front is expected to approve a  program calling for progress toward the republic's secession from the Soviet  Union, a spokesman said.  </P></p>

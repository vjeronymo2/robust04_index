			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau's Pounds 1.5m asset disposal angers suitor PLATEAU MINING, which is resisting a Pounds 1.2m hostile bid, has agreed to sell an asset to Delta Gold, an Australian group, for about Pounds 1.5m. Guinness Mahon, Plateau's adviser, said the price was equivalent to 3.45p for each Plateau share compared with 3p at which they were suspended in August. The bid is from Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration company. Mr Michael Bradbrook of Ionian Corporate Finance, Kingstream's adviser, said: 'It is unbelievable that an asset assigned a nil value in March when the Plateau accounts were signed off now has such a huge value.' He said Kingstream had no intention of giving up and was now reconsidering the terms of its offer to take account of the Delta deal. Plateau, formerly a natural resources group but now a shell, is to sell the net smelter royalty interest it holds in the Mhondoro platinum-nickel-copper project in Zimbabwe jointly owned by Delta, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and RTZ. Delta will allot a minimum of 1.85m shares. Australian stock exchange rules do not permit the shares to be sold for 12 months and, depending on the length of the escrow period, Delta will issue up to 200,000 more shares as an additional consideration to take account of the delay.</p>

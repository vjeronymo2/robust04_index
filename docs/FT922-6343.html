			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Contracting-out ONE light shines amid the wreckage of the Thatcher administration's local government policy: the obligation placed on local authorities to put their main services out to competitive tender. The arguments for compulsory competitive tendering, strong to start with, are virtually unassailable on any objective analysis of the impact of the first round of tendering, now almost complete. It is not so much the success of the private sector in competing for contracts, detailed in today's FT survey of progress to date; nor only the evidence of large cost savings in the provision of some services. Most valuable of all has been the effect of contracting out in obliging local authorities to construct 'Chinese walls' between their 'client' and 'contractor' functions. A premium has been placed on performance and quality even where contracts have remained with in-house labour forces. Few friends of local government would wish to return to the status quo ante. At the last general election the Labour party, which professes itself a boon companion, proposed virtually to abolish compulsory tendering. Its readiness to reverse that policy will be an early test of its ability to distance itself from the immediate interests of the public-sector unions in the cause of fair competition and the concerns of the consumer. Labour was to the fore in promoting local citizen's charters and should never have allowed itself to be left behind in the struggle to make public services efficient and accountable. It will deserve to lose its position as the largest party in local government if it cannot meet this particular challenge and make this important change. But if the government is serious in wishing to build bridges with local government it will also need to shift focus in three ways. It will refrain from interfering in the detail of how contracts are packaged; it will clarify the law explicitly to allow local authority direct labour forces to compete for out-of-area contracts where it is financially prudent for them to do so; and it will ensure that a workable scheme is devised to spread competition to local authority white-collar services.</p>

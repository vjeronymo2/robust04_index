			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Renewed focus on US monetary policy - Currency markets When foreign exchanges reopen for business today, the key issue will be how to interpret Friday's US jobs data, showing the fastest rise in job creation since October 1987. With confirmation that the robust US economic recovery continues unhindered, some analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be tempted to decisively tighten monetary policy, possibly ahead of the next meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on May 17. Certainly this was the prevailing interpretation on Wall St yesterday with equities getting off to a very shaky start on fears of higher rates. Not all observers, however, believe that the argument for a policy-tightening is cut and dried. Mr Lacy Hunt, chief US economist at Midland Global Markets in New York, argues that the labour market is not nearly as strong as Friday's headline number would suggest. Most jobs being generated are in low-pay service sectors and this, if anything, has a restraining effect on inflation. Mr Hunt comments: 'Growth with decelerating inflation should not be a concern of monetary policy.' What all of this means for the dollar will become clearer today when European markets reopen. Although the US currency rallied on Friday, it has still significantly underperformed investor expectations. Dollar bulls will take succour from the latest data, but if dollar weakness persists, this could well prompt a sell-off of the US currency. The other focus for dollar watchers will be today's publication of Japanese trade data for March and current account data for February. Last week saw the dollar sink below Y103 after the US administration dismissed as inadequate market-opening measures proposed by the Japanese government. Many analysts believe the market will test the record low of Y101.3 to the dollar and may well fall below Y100. In Europe, attention will remain with Italy. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Freedom Alliance which triumphed in last week's elections, appears to be making good progress in uniting his fractious allies. This helped the lira rise to L959.75 per D-Mark last Friday. The market wants to believe the good news, but will watch closely for signs of political division. It will also expect details of a credible deficit reduction policy if it is to believe in lower interest rates. In the UK, meanwhile, sterling's fortunes are likely to be closely tied to the fortunes of prime minister Mr John Major. A further weakening in his position could further undermine the UK currency.</p>

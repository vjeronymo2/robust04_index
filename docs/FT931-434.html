			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel It was perhaps predictable that Eurotunnel and TML would squabble about the interpretation of the International Chamber of Commerce's findings on disputed cost over-runs for the Channel Tunnel. But the outcome must rank as something of a moral victory for Eurotunnel. It will, nevertheless, prove cold comfort if it only prolongs the dispute and delays the tunnel's opening. Eurotunnel would then start racking up additional costs of perhaps Pounds 3m a day by the year-end, which would alarm its bankers. The financial pain is also becoming acute for some contractors as they are forced to swallow greater provisions. The dispute is developing into one that neither side can afford to lose. That will make it all the more difficult to resolve.</p>

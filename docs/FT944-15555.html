			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Cause for quiet celebration - One year after its launch, Robert Rice examines the progress of the UK's Financial Law Panel As it approaches its first birthday, the UK's Financial Law Panel has good cause for cheer. The panel was set up by the Bank of England amid concern that uncertainties in the law affecting financial markets were undermining London's future as an international financial centre. Today, the FLP enjoys the active support of some 150 (fee paying) law firms, banks and other financial institutions. And according to the FLP's chairman, Lord Donaldson, former Master of the Rolls: 'In its first year, the panel has made far greater progress with its allotted task than could reasonably have been expected.' To date, nine projects have been completed. In addition to guidance papers on so-called 'netting' (off-setting liablities between two parties), the FLP has produced papers on the legal position of 'shadow' directors (people who, while not directors themselves, exercise control over the management of a company); the controversial issue of brokers' liability for premium in non-marine insurance at Lloyds; and a recommendation on the position banks should adopt on security over cash deposits. Lord Alexander QC, chairman of National Westminster Bank and the Bank of England's legal risks review committee, which recommended setting up the FLP, said 'I feel the prototype is flying.' When, two years ago, the committee recommended the FLP the idea seemed a good one, he said. But there were several concerns. Would there be enough subscribers? Would there be enough for the panel to do in the long term? Would enough people want to solve problems outside court to make the panel worthwhile? Those concerns have proved largely unfounded. 'Overall, I'm rather encouraged,' said Lord Alexander. According to Lord Alexander, NatWest is satisfied it is getting value for money. He points to the reassurance the panel has provided for the markets in general, particularly in areas such as netting and shadow directorships, where although bankers and lawyers felt they were on solid legal ground there was still some uncertainty. The panel has also been able to prevent disputes going to court by examining issues such as the Lloyd's brokers' liability. The panel sought to determine whether an industry practice existed by which brokers could be held liable for premiums. It found no such custom existed and the issue has now been resolved without recourse to the courts. 'That seems to me like a very attractive way of dealing with issues,' said Lord Alexander. He believes the panel's greatest strength is that it is seen as impartial - a view echoed by Mr Colin Bamford, the FLP's chief executive. Although Mr Bamford concedes that 'sometimes what we do makes people's lives more difficult', his main objective of ensuring the FLP is seen as independent appears to have been achieved. 'There is no point in the panel being the representative voice of City solicitors or another arm of the Bank of England,' he said. This question of independence is particularly important when dealing with the government. 'My perception is that the government regards us as worth listening to because we are not a representative body of City interests. There is enough special pleading on behalf of interest groups already,' he said. One consequence of this uncompromising stance is that several banks which have turned to the FLP have been frustrated at its dogged impartiality. The debate on the limits of auditors' liability is an example of an issue in which the FLP has resisted any involvement. 'It's an important debate. But there are no legal uncertainties involved. We would just be adding our voice to one side or another and that's not what we're here for,' says Mr Bamford. As it sets out on its second 12 months, the panel's agenda is already full. The two big projects on its hands are legal uncertainties in fund management  -an issue brought to the FLP by UK commercial banks - and the powers of public bodies, such as local authorities and National Health Service Trusts, to deal in financial markets. The latter is a legacy of the 1990 Hammersmith and Fulham council 'interest rate swaps' case in which the Law Lords ruled that swaps contracts between banks and local authorities were invalid because local authorities were not empowered to carry out such transactions. The issue of public bodies trading in financial markets has been given added importance by two recent developments: a High Court ruling in May in the Allerdale case; and by the government's much-vaunted private finance initiative for public sector projects. In the Allerdale case, the High Court ruled that Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank, could not recover a Pounds 5m loan to Allerdale Borough Council, Cumbria, which the local authority had guaranteed. The court said the council did not have the power to issue a guarantee. The judgment heightened concern in the City about lending to local authorities. Since the Hammersmith and Fulham ruling local authorities have been lobbying the government for a change in the law on the public bodies' powers to engage in City trading. Local authorities have proposed two solutions: either abolish the ultra vires rule (which provides that a contract is void and unenforceable if it is beyond the powers of a public body); or introduce 'safe harbour' provisions for banks entering into such transactions. Neither solution is attractive to the government. The FLP was called in and has proposed to the Treasury that a tribunal be set up under the Audit Commission to which public bodies can take pre-clearance for proposed City deals. If the proposed tribunal says a deal is within a public body's powers it will issue a certificate as a safeguard for third parties. It is a novel solution, says Lord Alexander, which only an independent body such as the panel could have proposed. Over the coming months the panel will also be continuing two long-term projects - seminars for judges on practical developments in the financial markets, and the development of the idea of the panel acting as amicus curiae - friend of the court - in litigation involving the operation of the financial markets. The latter has already been discussed with senior judges and lawyers and is generally well received, said Mr Bamford.</p>

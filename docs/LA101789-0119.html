The NCAA Presidents Commission already  has urged a cut in the basketball season by almost one month and removing three  games from the Division I men's and women's schedules.  </P> <P> The council also may consider changes to Proposition 42, approved at the last  NCAA convention, which would eliminate scholarship aid to freshmen who fail to  meet all academic requirements.  </P></p>

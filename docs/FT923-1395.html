			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Prison violence tops French agenda: As the dispute with jail staff drags on it is becoming increasingly bitter THIS morning, the French Justice Ministry plans to hold a meeting in Paris to discuss the increasingly bitter prison officers' dispute. Unfortunately for its hopes of negotiating a settlement, one of the biggest groups of prison officers' unions will not be there. The Union Generale des Federations de Fonctionnaires, whose members include jail staff, announced on Monday that it would boycott today's meeting. Other unions will doubtless follow suit, as they did last week when they walked out of a national negotiating meeting at the Justice Ministry. After last week's setback, the French government has been trying to break the dispute area by area. So far it has had little success. The strike is now in its 12th day. Sixty of France's 182 jails are at a standstill and the remainder are affected by stoppages, go-slows and demonstrations. Conditions within the jails have deteriorated rapidly. Family visits have been cancelled, as have exercise periods. Some inmates have been unable to wash. Catering services have been disrupted. Riot police and military squads have been sent in to restore order at dozens of jails. Night after night dramatic television footage shows prisoners rioting on roof tops, dangling burning rags through their barred cell windows and rampaging in jail yards. Until this week the prison dispute competed with the Maastricht referendum for the headlines. Now the referendum is over, the government is under even greater pressure to tackle what is probably the most pressing problem on its domestic agenda. The catalyst for the current dispute was the murder 12 days ago of an officer at Clairvaux high security jail during a shoot-out in which seven armed inmates escaped. The Clairvaux killing followed a similar incident last month when an officer at Rouen jail died after being attacked by a convict in a cell. The government managed to end the first dispute by agreeing to the prison officers' demands for more staff and better security. But the Clairvaux shoot-out confirmed warders' worst fears about deteriorating security standards in France's jails and the strikes and stoppages erupted again. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, and Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, immediately offered a formal review of the whole prison system. They also promised to provide funds to improve security for prison staff. But, this time, the government's softly-softly approach was not enough to assuage the warders' fears. Prison staff have good cause to be frightened. The murders at Rouen and Clairvaux were part of a stream of violent incidents in France's overcrowded jails. This month alone there have been two heists in which helicopters landed on prison roofs to whisk away would-be escapees. One succeeded, the other did not. The latest Paris-Match magazine features a picture of a Clairvaux inmate toting a pistol which, he claimed, was smuggled into the prison for him. The French government last week underlined the severity of the problem by launching an official investigation into the illegal trafficking of arms in jails. The violence is the product of the steady growth of the prison population, which has more than doubled in size over the past 20 years to 50,000 detainees crammed into jails built for 45,000. The system is run by 18,000 prison staff at a ratio of one officer to every three inmates. Prison staff claim that this ratio is too high given that the overcrowding problem has been aggravated by an increase in jail violence. This reflects the rise in violent crime and also the sharp increase in the number of long-serving inmates since the French abolition of the death penalty in 1981. The official report into the Clairvaux shoot-out described the prison population as 'angry, desperate and ready for anything'. Faced with this explosive situation, the prison officers' unions are asking the government to hire 2,500 more staff. The government has created 530 new jobs since the Rouen killing and has promised to more, pending completion of the review. But after the collapse of last week's negotiations the government invoked its power to suspend striking warders who, as public servants, are not allowed to strike. The prison unions are refusing to resume negotiations until the suspensions are rescinded. The government has responded by saying that it will not give in to threats. In the meantime police unions are protesting against the use of their members in prisons, local police cells are filling up with detainees and conditions within the jails are worsening, thereby increasing pressure on the government to end the dispute.</p>

The basis for the defense  cooperation between Greece and Cyprus was agreed upon during his  talks in Cyprus. Arsenis stressed that since the UN resolutions  have not been implemented and the Turkish occupation troops have  not withdrawn, Cyprus' defense should be reinforced as a  condition for success in international negotiations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Territorial Station for Agricultural Research  [estacion territorial de investigaciones agropecuarias] in  Holguin has been chosen to develop an intergovernmental  cooperation project between Cuba and France which will help  implement the results of science and technology in our current  agricultural production conditions.    Technology has been used in other Latin American countries,  but only with peasant owners of small farms. In Cuba, with an  integral production system, it will be easier to evaluate  production and to make it more efficient from the economic point  of the companies, of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, and  of credits and services.    The French Government will finance the project and already  has assigned more than $250,000, which will be invested in  equipment, fuel, transport, and other material resources.</p>

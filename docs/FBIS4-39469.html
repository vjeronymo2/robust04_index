			<p>BFN     [Text] Groznyy says that the only way to overcome the  present stalemate is to hold "a well-prepared meeting between  the presidents of Chechnya and Russia," a spokesman for the  press service of President Dzhokhar Dudayev told Interfax on  Tuesday. Preparations for such talks must be conducted "without  political intrigues on the part of some aides to President Boris  Yeltsin," he pointed out.    In comments on the statement by the head of the Russian  president's office, Sergey Filatov, to the effect that after  Dudayev's sharp anti-Russian pronouncements a further dialogue  with Groznyy is impossible, the high-ranking member of the  Chechen president's office said that Sergey Filatov "laid the  blame for the disruption of negotiations on the wrong side."  "It's no longer a secret that Russia had no intention of  starting talks in earnest. It only wanted an excuse for  launching another propagandistic ploy," he pointed out.    "In what other way, in Filatov's view, could President  Dudayev react a few hours after an attempt on his life?" the  official asked.    A statement released by Dudayev's press service on Tuesday  says that "Filatov's explanations as to the reasons why the  talks were delayed are so flimsy that comments on them are  unnecessary." "They are designed to conceal Russia's  unwillingness to enter into truly civilized talks" with  Chechnya, the press service declared.</p>

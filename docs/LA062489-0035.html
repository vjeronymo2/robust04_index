			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOCA NO FUN?  </P> <P> Why can't the good sense of some of your book reviewers and entertainment  critics ever show up on your editorial pages?  </P> <P> The latest piece to raise that question is Terry Atkinson's June 19 review of  KCET-TV's "Take Five" programs. I realize that this kind of  "the-emperor-is-bare-rumped" commentary will make it difficult for some of The  Times' senior folk to move in their accustomed high social circles.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, I hope that Terry Atkinson will not be a casualty of his on-point  reportage. The description of the Museum of Contemporary Art as "an  aggravating, depressing home for no-point, no-fun modern art" is long overdue.  </P> <P> CRUGER L.

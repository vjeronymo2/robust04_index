			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Michelin cuts loss to FFr699m MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre maker, yesterday saw its shares rise sharply after it announced a hefty reduction in net losses to FFr699m in 1991, from FFr4.81bn (Dollars 858m) in 1990. The group, which late last year 'rewarded' its shareholders for their loyalty through a period of losses by giving them free warrants, returned to profit at the operating level last year with operating profits of FFr780m, against losses of FFr1.13bn for 1990. Michelin attributed the improvement in its performance to a radical restructuring programme - including tighter stock control and job losses - accompanied by price rises and lower raw material costs. The company's shares firmed FFr11.60 to FFr181.30 on the Paris stock market, It reduced its workforce by 8,500 in 1991, as part of a two-year programme intended to shed 16,000 jobs. The group also reduced investment from FFr12bn in 1990 to FFr3.9bn in 1991 and brought its stock levels down to 22.5 per cent of turnover, well below its target of 25 per cent. The cost of restructuring fell from FFr3.44bn in 1990 to FFr1.42bn last year. Michelin has now made full provision for its restructuring programme, so no further cost should be incurred. Michelin, in common with its competitors, suffered from the impact of the economic slowdown on demand for tyres and from the problems of its customers in the motor industry. Group turnover rose to FFr67.65bn from FFr62.74bn during the year, but this was due to the first full contribution from Uniroyal-Goodrich in the US. The underlying level of sales growth was 2.2 per cent, as a slight improvement in demand from consumers - and higher prices  - compensated for reduced sales to motor manufacturers. Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said the tyre business had got off to a 'good start' in 1992, with the first quarter showing an improvement over the same period in 1991, when demand was disrupted by the Gulf war. Volume sales of tyres fell by 3 per cent in 1991. Michelin managed to reduce its debt by FFr700m to FFr27.8bn last year. Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere signalled that the group may try to raise capital to accelerate debt reduction. This served to confirm long-standing stock market speculation that Michelin might be forced to stage a rights issue.</p>

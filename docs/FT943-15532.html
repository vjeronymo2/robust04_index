			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Riyadh bank posts 21.5% improvement United Saudi Commercial Bank, the Riyadh-based commercial bank controlled by Prince al-Waleed Bin Talal, who recently came to the financial rescue of Euro Disney, has reported a 21.5 per cent rise in first-half income for 1994, to SR157.7m (Dollars 42m). The bank's unaudited figures show an 11.5 per cent rise in assets over the period, to SR10.6bn at June 30 1994. Loans and advances rose 17 per cent, with the bank's total securities portfolio up by 33 per cent on the same period last year. Placements with other banks, meanwhile, fell by 24 per cent to SR2.08bn. Revenues from ancillary businesses rose a nominal SR1.5m. Non-interest operating costs rose almost 10 per cent.

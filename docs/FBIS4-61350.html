			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 27, RIA. There is "the will and the  opportunity" for a realistic partnership aiming to attain  political settlement in Bosnia. Now is the time for joint  action, said Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a press  conference upon the completion of his talks with Alain Juppe,  foreign minister of France, who arrived in Geneva today.    Said Kozyrev in reply to a RIA question: "The main  conclusion  after the talks is that there is the need to unite efforts for a  political settlement in Bosnia in order to preclude a new wave  of violence in the region. My partners and I are optimistic: we  believe there is a realistic opportunity to attain settlement.  We would like to hold - in the near future - a working meet of  foreign ministers to prepare a summit meeting with the  participation of the UN."    On the possibility of new NATO strikes in the former  Yugoslavia, the minister said that everything depended on  specific circumstances. If there are new barbaric shellings of  civilian targets, everything will depend on a specific  situation. "The main thing is that we have made NATO's military  plans not so much the plans of that organization, but the plans  of the UN Security Council to be applied in the worst  situation," Kozyrev noted. The procedure for the  decision-making on the issue is well known: all operations  should be seen as being within the framework of the UN  Peace-keeping effort.    M. Juppe said that he accords "exceedingly great importance"  to the talks with the Russian minister. He called them rather  productive and said that they would continue soon. He plans to  visit Moscow on May 19.    France has always maintained close contact with Russia on  the  issue of the Bosnian settlement, Juppe said. Today's talks are  seen as very important in the light of the situation there.    Today, Andrey Kozyrev had a telephone conversation with UN  Secretary General's Envoy Yakusi Akashi. The two officials  noted the normalisation of the situation around Gorazde, which  lays the ground for the processes of a peaceful settlement in  Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Volobuyev, candidate of juridical </F> sciences: "The Authorities Themselves are Interested in the  Existence of Organized Crime: State-Mafiosi Relationships Have  Become a Way of Life in Russia"]    [Text]  <H5>  Opinion </H5>   Organized crime and corruption as a principally new social  phenomenon (in contrast to the elementary or traditional crime  and the numerous abuses of officialdom since time immemorial)  appeared in the country approximately in the mid 1960's-early  1970's in the form of a powerful alliance that set in between  criminals in the economic sphere, leaders of the criminal world,  and representatives of the bureaucratic apparatus at all levels.  Which also guaranteed criminals protection from any form of  social control, including on the part of law enforcement organs.  Individual major scandalous trials of that period (for example,  trade, fishing, Sochi) only created the illusion of an  uncompromising attitude on the part of the authorities in the  protection of legality. But in fact this was a reaction to a  violation of the rules of the game established in the higher  strata of society, and had nothing in common with the law and  the morality that was being propagandized.    Gathering strength, organized crime began to monopolize all  spheres of unlawful and asocial activity that secure material  profit. Like any social, managerial structure, it developed in  the form of a pyramid, including lower levels of "unskilled  labor" and "bureaucratic" strata that ensured the efficiency of  the system and its security, and also its ideologically ruling  elite.    An economic analysis of the financial-economic activity of  some Soviet republics conducted at the end of the 1980's by  specialists indicated that the volume of shadow turnover in them  increased their budgets. Actually, this indicated the full  criminalization of social relations in them. Risking being  accused of inciting national discord and offending national  feelings, I will not name specific regions, although in some of  them the present rulers have already become hostage to the  interests of mafiosi clans.    What has been said is quite sufficient to answer the  question  that was raised. The authorities themselves turned out to be  interested in the existence of organized crime and in the  corruption that was imminently inherent in it.    One of the main reasons for the offensive development of  organized crime is that it was the only truly market structure  in the state under any conditions, which also enabled it in all  periods to quickly (in a mobile way) adapt itself to changes.  And not simply adapt itself, but at the same time derive the  maximum material and political advantages. The country's entry  into market relations opened up unprecedented prospects for our  mafia. In contrast to other countries, where organized crime  developed in an underground market of commodity and service  shortages, our mafia, protected together with its highly placed  official patrons from any forms of control (including the law  enforcement system), in recent years unpardonably, with forceful  methods, also took legal forms of entrepreneurship under its  control.    State-mafiosi relations are becoming a way of life of  today's  authorities, who, together with the leaders of the criminal  world, determine economic and political realities. Although why  today's? After all, we see in the offices of power the very same  persons we saw 10 years ago. But the new "lucky ones," who made  their way through to the distribution of the property and  authority pie regardless of their political attachment, in a  majority of cases accepted the standing rules of the game which  assure them numerous personal benefits.    At the present time the mafia is already monopolizing  virtually all directions of legal business that bring in  super-profits, not counting the traditional underground  directions.    Therefore:    --it is not accidental that it is by no means the producers  of goods who receive quota, license, customs, tax, and other  privileges, but those who are accustomed to living in the  corridors of power;    --it is not surprising that the militia is being equipped  with technical means with the active participation of the mafia  and through the mediation of the authorities (naturally, not  without profit for the latter);    --it is quite natural that the law enforcement organs are  now  already guarding not only the representatives of authority but  also the mafiosi structures against all accusations;    --it is natural that the popularity and social rating of the  leaders of organized crime is growing, and they continuously  appear on television as "patrons" and "philanthropists."    Under similar conditions, the creation of numerous new  controlling organs (in the fight against corruption and  organized crime, for control over the issuance of licenses and  granting privileges to entrepreneurial structures, and in the  fight against abuses in the division of property, etc.)--is  nothing more than a valve for an apparatus that is unfit for use  to let off the steam of civil dissatisfaction. This is only the  emergence of new stillborn bureaucratic structures, whose  burdensome maintenance is laid on the taxpayer.    Can there be any serious talk about branches of authority  that will be able to oppose organized crime and corruption?    As a rule, the mafia does not give a damn about the numerous  exposures in the mass media--is this authority?    The court, which remains hostage to local and higher  authorities, is intimidated and being bought by the mafia--is  this authority?    The legislator, who out of poverty begins work to resolve  his  own material interests and wonders whether he will be shot in  the event of a dispute with another "branch"--is this authority?    It is simply stupid to rely on the law enforcement organs.  In  addition to the fact that these organs themselves are corroding  more and more from contact with the enemy, they cannot  objectively--no matter how much they wish to--get into the game  outside the boundaries of the established rules. It is  characteristic that their leaders reduce the task of confronting  a dangerous phenomenon in a majority of cases to a fight against  trivial bandit groups that constitute, undoubtedly, an extremely  important element, but only the lower executive element of the  global structure of organized crime. The key is simple: Today  this is the limit of the capabilities of the law enforcement  organs. At the same time, an overwhelming majority of registered  murders are not solved, inasmuch as in a number of cases this  would lead to scandals at a rather high level.    An alarming symptom: To effectively fight the mafia, some  people are demanding extreme measures and the assignment of  additional powers to special subunits. This is the wrong path,  which is, in fact, the recidivist psychology of communist  lawlessness and terrorism and which has shameful examples in the  form of "extraordinary commissions." New lawlessness is capable  of giving rise only to lawlessness with numerous abuses and a  protective reaction that is difficult to predict.    Also absurd are the numerous hopes for toughening the  criminal sector in legislation. This is just another myth. And  the existing criminal law makes it possible more effectively to  oppose organized crime and corruption. Therefore, the problem  today lies not in its toughening (although undoubtedly a whole  series of categories of crimes resulting from specific market  relations should be introduced immediately), but in the  capability to employ it without being afraid of invading the  sphere of interests of the powers that be.    Is the mafia longing to gain power? Undoubtedly. But it  would  be naive to think that the "godfathers themselves" are burning  with desire to occupy key posts in the power structures, thereby  assuming responsibility for the political, economic, and social  situation in the country, and are staking their well-being on  this. The modest role of stage manager is quite enough for them.  And they are handling this role successfully.    Our Russian mafia can really do everything. Apparently,  someone still remembers that in 1988 the USSR officially put  forth its candidacy to conduct the Olympic Games in the year  2000...in the Black Sea city resort of Sochi. Organized crime  was behind this. Just the fact of the promotion was quite enough  for the conduct of large-scale machinations in real estate.    A whole series of events that occurred in Russia in the last  year characterize for me occurrences of this order:    For example:    --the exchange of money, as a result of which only poor  people suffered. On the other hand, thousands of commercial  structures appeared in the sphere of control of organized crime  which to this day exchange tens and hundreds of billions of  Soviet bills for rubles of the new type with unquestionable  profit for the mafia;    --the decision to allocate $500 million for the construction  of a new parliamentary center in Moscow, as a result of which  not only does the new parliament compromise itself immediately  (in any case), but a substantial amount of hard currency that is  released for nontraditional construction will be stolen;    --the collapse of the ruble in January of this year, on  which  quite a few persons multiplied their fortunes in several days.    There they are--real signs of the activity of organized  crime, quite remote from banal bandit formations.    But who will fight against this?</p>

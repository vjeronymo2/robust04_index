			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak "Military Review": "The `Infantry Fighting </F> Vehicle' of Political Support"]    [Text] Sources in Russia's military department inform us  that, despite calls to depoliticize the Russian Federation Armed  Forces, its personnel, and particularly its officer corps,  politicization is continuing, moreover the process is developing  in a direction which, to put it mildly, is not always what the  president, government, and Ministry of Defense leadership would  expect. This trend is even typical of the General Staff  apparatus.    The military department leadership is looking for ways to  stabilize the situation. One of the methods being planned is to  carry out a major reshuffle of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces leadership and appoint to key positions military  commanders of proven loyalty. Among the candidates slated for  replacement are a number of generals ranging from commanders in  chief of branches of the services to Ground Forces Aviation  Commander Vitaliy Pavlov, who refused to execute an order to  open rocket fire on the White House. The presidential  administration is in turn formulating plans to establish a  special structure to ensure more effective control over the  state of cadre work in the Army -- a kind of CPSU Central  Committee Administrative Organs Department.    Special efforts are being made by the defense minister to  bring about the transfer to Moscow of Western Group of Forces  Commander M.P. Burlakov, nicknamed by his subordinates the  infantry fighting vehicle. It is expected that Burlakov will  give a considerable boost to the Army's "reformist wing." It is  not being ruled out that he will be considered as a candidate  either for chief of the General Staff (together with Andrey  Nikolayev, current commander in chief of the Border Guards, who  is less acceptable to Grachev) or commander of the key Moscow  Military District. Our sources in the General Staff claim that  the firm opinion has formed at the highest level that, following  the events of 3-4 October, current Chief of the General Staff M.  Kolesnikov and Moscow Military District Commander L. Kuznetsov  cannot be completely relied on. Burlakov's uncommon political  flexibility works in his favor, of course: He was one of the  first to support the State Committee for the State of Emergency,  but shortly afterward he roundly condemned D. Yazov and his  supporters. However, it cannot be ruled out that this  flexibility could give rise to doubts among the president's more  sober-minded supporters: The fact that Burlakov was the only  commander at P. Grachev's October conference who  enthusiastically approved the results of the storming of the  White House counts for nothing. There is also some perplexity  surrounding the actions of the Western Group of Forces commander  (including the fact that Burlakov flew to the wedding of Defense  Minister Grachev's son and presented the newlyweds with the keys  to a new Mercedes), not to mention the overall situation in the  Western Group of Forces. In the opinion of military men, the  favorable reports brought back by a group of journalists sent  out to Germany on P. Grachev's instructions were bound to be  convincing, but in order to be absolutely sure it might also be  useful to publish the results of an investigation into the  Western Group of Forces and Burlakov personally that was  conducted before last October by the military prosecutor's  office and military counterintelligence.</p>

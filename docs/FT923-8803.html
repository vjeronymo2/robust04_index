			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Building society investigation EXECUTIVES at Portman, the country's 15th-largest building society, were yesterday trying to discover how a 60-ft computer print-out of its mortgage customers was found by the roadside in Bournemouth, Dorset, after it had been sent for shredding. Portman said yesterday: 'We have been unable to find anything amiss with our confidential waste disposal unit and its procedures.' It wanted to know how the list, which contained names, addresses, and account details of more than 1,000 of its 80,000 mortgage customers, had come into the possession of a local newspaper and why the document had not been returned directly to it. Portman said the list was a computer report which had been produced unnecessarily and should have been destroyed immediately. The Data Protection Registrar is investigating to see if guidelines laid down to protect computer information were followed.</p>

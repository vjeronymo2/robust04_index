			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Francisco de Andres report: "Oreja Takes Job as New EU </F> Commissioner"]    [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the Council of Ambassadors of  the European Union, constituted as the Conference of Member  States, officially appointed Marcelino Oreja as the new  commissioner of transport and energy to replace Abel Matutes,  who left Brussels just hours before to begin his campaign as the  leader of the PP [People's Party] list for the European  elections in June.    At 59 years of age, Marcelino Oreja is undertaking a new  task  in his already rich diplomatic career. The new Spanish  representative to the Community's executive body will have the  same areas of responsibility as Abel Matutes -- i.e., energy and  transport -- until the end of the European Commission's current  term at the end of this year. The reshuffle for the new group  of commissioners will be up to Jacques Delors' successor,  although a number of Community sources consulted agreed in  saying that -- given Marcelino Oreja's profile and diplomatic  career -- the most reasonable assumption is that the new Spanish  commissioner should have responsibilities in the area of  European foreign relations.    This raises the possibility of a stormy initial period in  his  relations with Commissioner Manuel Marin, who is currently  responsible for humanitarian aid and EU policy toward developing  countries. Marin's fate, and to a certain extent that of  Oreja's future responsibilities, depends on how the upcoming  European elections turn out for the Spanish Socialists and on  [Spanish Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez' final decision whether  or not to run for the Brussels job if the Twelve fail to reach a  consensus at the June summit on any of the candidates competing  to succeed Delors. Gonzalez's arrival in Brussels would, of  course, displace the Spanish Socialist commissioner.    Marcelino Oreja has also let it be known that he will  maintain the good climate of relations with the Spanish  Government that prevailed during the Matutes years.</p>

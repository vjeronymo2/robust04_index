			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RED SOX LOSE, GET BAD NEWS ON CLEMENS  </P> <P> The Boston Red Sox's pennant hopes were dealt a severe blow Saturday.  </P> <P> They lost, 5-2, to the Yankees at New York in a game delayed at the start for  more than five hours because of rain. But, perhaps more important, they learned  that Roger Clemens (20-6) is still not ready to pitch.  </P> <P> Clemens, out since Sept. 4 with tendinitis in his right shoulder, had been  scheduled to return today in the series finale at Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> But the Red Sox said Clemens' shoulder was still too tender and that it was  uncertain whether he would pitch again this season.  </P> <P> When New York's Steve Sax tripled in two runs in the eighth inning to break a  2-2 tie, it kept the Red Sox tied with Toronto for first place in the American  League East. Since Clemens went out, the Red Sox are 6-11.  </P> <P> The Red Sox had thought Clemens could make three more starts in the 10 games  left in the regular season.  </P> <P> When Manager Joe Morgan made the announcement about Clemens not starting, he  said Clemens agreed with the decision.  </P> <P> "He believes we're doing the right thing, as much as he wants to go out there,"  Morgan said.  </P> <P> The Red Sox bullpen failed to make the save for Mike Boddicker, who held the  Yankees to four hits and a run and left after six innings with a 2-1 lead. The  muddy mound appeared to bother Boddicker, who walked five and made two wild  pitches.  </P> <P> The Yankees, who had lost seven in a row, tied it in the seventh inning when  relief pitcher Larry Andersen threw away a potential double play ball.  </P> <P> Jeff Gray (2-4) was on the mound when the Yankees broke it open in the eighth.  </P> <P> The players were at Yankee Stadium for more than 11 hours. The game lasted more  than 3 1/2 hours. Many of the announced crowd of 37,795 were gone before it  started and hardly anyone was left when it ended.  </P> <P> "This was too long," Sax said. "We watched some football, played cards, slept  and ate. At least it turned out well. I've been here a long time and I'm ready  to get out of here."  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Toronto 2 -- The Blue Jays, who wind up their home schedule today,  missed an opportunity to regain the top spot in the East.  </P> <P> Candy Maldonado and Chris James hit consecutive home runs in the sixth inning  to give the Indians their second victory in a row over the Blue Jays and sixth  in a row overall.  </P> <P> Third baseman Kelly Gruber, who hit his 29th home run, said people who think  the Blue Jays will fold are wrong.  </P> <P> "We came from 6 1/2 behind, and people say we're choking," he said. "I'm not  concerned. We'll win some more."  </P> <P> The Blue Jays had 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings off Jeff Shaw (3-4) but left eight  baserunners.  </P> <P> Oakland 5, Detroit 1 -- Scott Sanderson won his career-high 17th victory and  Rickey Henderson hit his 27th home run to move the Athletics closer to their  third consecutive title in the West.  </P> <P> Although he stole a base and trails the all-time leader, Lou Brock, by only  five steals, 938-933, Henderson lost ground in his bid for the batting title.  </P> <P> George Brett of Kansas City was four for four and shot up to .332, in his bid  for his third batting title. Henderson, one for four, is 10 points behind with  only 11 games left.  </P> <P> Sanderson (17-10) gave up three hits and an unearned run in 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Minnesota 2, Texas 0 -- Allan Anderson and two relief pitchers combined on a  three-hitter at Minneapolis as the Twins rallied to win.  </P> <P> Anderson gave up two hits in five innings, but reliever Larry Casian (1-1), who  gave up the other hit, was the winner in relief.  </P> <P> Rafael Palmeiro had one of the Ranger hits and is hitting .323, nine points  behind Brett.  </P> <P> Baltimore 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Mike Devereaux hit a three-run home run at  Baltimore and the Orioles handed the Brewers their fifth defeat in a row.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson (12-8), in his third start since coming off the disabled list,  went six-plus innings to get his first win since Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Chicago 14, Seattle 5 -- The White Sox kept Oakland's magic number for  clinching the Western Division to two as Carlton Fisk drove in four runs --  including a homer -- in Seattle.  </P> <P> Chicago had a season-high 18 hits as Robin Ventura, Frank Thomas, Lance Johnson  and Ozzie Guillen had three each. Guillen added three RBIs. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

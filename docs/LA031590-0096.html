			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA MUSEUM NEEDS NEW HOME  </P> <P> Less than two years after finding a temporary home for its collection, the  Santa Monica Historical Society may soon be without quarters once again.  </P> <P> Lowe Enterprises had allowed the group to use about 5,000 square feet of an  older building on Colorado Avenue free for the past 18 months, but the  development company is now ready to demolish the building to make way for a  large, mixed-use complex.  </P> <P> "We were glad to help, but at some point we have to get the tenants out so we  can demolish the building," said Rob Macleod, president of commercial  development for Lowe Enterprises.  </P> <P> The historical society was scheduled to vacate the building today, but Macleod  has given the group additional time to find a new home or make plans for  storing the collection of artifacts and documents that dates back to the 1820s.  </P> <P> The historical society, which began in 1975 and established its museum less  than two years ago, is hoping someone will provide for free or for a minimal  fee about 6,000 square feet of office space to house its collection.  </P> <P> Louise Gabriel, the group's president, said that if a new home cannot be found,  the collection of maps, documents, photos and vintage clothing will have to be  placed in storage.  </P> <P> She said that without a museum the community would be missing something  valuable.  </P> <P> "There is more caring for a community when you understand its past," Gabriel  said. "There is greater appreciation for what was done here so that it can be  better for future generations. People go to Europe to see the treasures of the  past; isn't it nice that Santa Monica has its past preserved so that people can  come here."  </P> <P> Since the museum opened in October, 1988, tours were provided for school  children and community groups by appointment. In addition to exhibitions, the  museum also provided an audiovisual history of Santa Monica Bay and a reference  library on the state's history.  </P> <P> Gabriel said the group is hoping to begin a fund-raising drive to pay for a new  building and for an executive director, which would allow the museum to stay  open more frequently.  </P> <P> To make a donation or assist in locating office space, contact Louise or Bob  Gabriel at (213) 829-0305.  </P></p>

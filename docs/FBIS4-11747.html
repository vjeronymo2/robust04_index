			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has said  that the bomb that exploded in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and  killed 11 people last month was made at the headquarters of the  banned Lebanese Forces militia in the presence of Fu'ad Malik,  senior aide to Samir Ja'ja'.    In an interview with MBC, Dallul said that he believes that  the objective behind the explosion was to create sedition in the  country. He added:    [Begin Dallul recording] The measures taken by the  government  were correct. From the security aspect, there was a coup  attempt in every sense of the word, an attempt that served the  Israeli enemy. There were attempts to undermine the homeland.  What happened was very serious and it is up to the judiciary to  decide on it. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): The baby PC with grown-up features Portable computers have been shrinking in size ever since they were introduced in the early 1980s. But compared with the desktop PC, pocket or hand-held machines still represent an uneasy compromise in terms of screen size, keyboard and compatibility. Vortek, part of the the Korean Samsung group, believes it has found the answer by developing the first A5-sized portable, dubbed the Handbook PC. The machine, which comes with a hard disc and 2Mbytes of memory, weighs 1kg and is half the size of conventional notebook PCs. Using its sophisticated power management features the machine can run for up to four hours with five AA-sized alkaline or rechargeable batteries. The Handbook can work with Microsoft Windows software and standard Dos applications as well as its built-in personal organiser functions. It goes on sale next month and will cost around Pounds 1,500.

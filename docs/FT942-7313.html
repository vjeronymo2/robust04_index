			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Dispute at BBC will go to Acas BBC unions and management yesterday agreed to conciliation talks in the dispute over pay and conditions, as unions withdrew plans for further strike action tomorrow, Richard Donkin writes. The talks, to be held today at the Acas conciliation service, follow Tuesday's 24-hour strike among 11,000 BBC technicians and journalists protesting at plans to introduce performance-related pay and other changes to working conditions. The National Union of Journalists and Bectu, the broadcasting union, said they would not yet withdraw plans for further one-day strikes next week. Mr John Fray, NUJ broadcasting officer, said: 'Acas has given us an assurance from the BBC that these talks will be meaningful.' He added: 'I hope the BBC has got the message after yesterday's successful action that they have to change their position.' The BBC said: 'The BBC has always said that it wants to reach a negotiated settlement and welcomes the opportunity at Acas.'</p>

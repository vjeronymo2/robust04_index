			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] This is a report from a special KBS team filing  from Panmunjom:    A preliminary contact for the realization of the South-North  summit talks began at Panmunjom at 10:00 [01:00 GMT] on 28 June.    In his first speech at today's contact, Yi Hong-ku, our  side's head delegate, proposed that both sides abide by the  principle of reciprocity for exchanging visits between South and  North Korea and proposed mid-July as the time for the summit  talks.    Our side also proposed that to ensure efficient talks, the  summit talks be exclusive talks between the heads of states  [chongsang] from both sides.    Head delegate Yi Hong-ku also stated: I hope that the South-  North summit talks will be realized at an early date, thereby  helping to ease the heightened tension and solve all issues  pending between the South and North. I believe that the talks  will provide a historic momentum to open the door to national  unification.    Head delegate Yi Hong-ku also pointed out: The meeting  between the heads of state in the South and North carries  enormous significance in itself, and can serve as a departure to  restore the homogeneous nature of the national community. I  hope that today's contact will proceed smoothly on the basis of  the principle of mutual respect. [passage omitted covered by  FBIS 010Jun28]</p>

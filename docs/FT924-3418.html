			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals behind Westland rise WESTLAND, the helicopter group, is raising its annual dividend from 4p to 4.25p, with a proposed final of 3p, against 2.75p, after reporting an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to October 2. A halving of exceptional charges to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 7m) as a result of lower restructuring costs was behind the profit rise to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 23.7m). Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 422.1m (Pounds 467.4m). Earnings per share were 13.2p (13.1p). Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said the company had reached the bottom of the trough caused by the fall in helicopter orders as well as the recession in civil aviation. He saw the future 'with a degree of confidence' after the intake of orders had trebled in the year to Pounds 1.18bn. Since the year end orders worth Pounds 550m for helicopters had been received from the Ministry of Defence and Canada. Westland, the future of which was at the centre of a cabinet crisis six years ago, is pinning its prospects on the development of the Anglo-Italian EH101 large military and civil helicopter as well as a possible order to manufacture McDonnell Douglas's Apache attack helicopter for the British army. Mr Jones said Westland was also continuing to increase its activities in the civil aerospace sector by producing components for new widebody and regional airliner programmes. Despite its determination to focus new investment on civil activities, largely based on the Isle of Wight, Westland remains heavily dependant on defence helicopters. The new orders and an expected order of 16 naval versions of the helicopter from Italy would lead to an increase in the group's 70 per cent dependence on military helicopter business over the next few years. Mr Jones said Westland's future lay in an increasingly close relationship with Agusta, the state-controlled helicopter company which is its Italian partner in the EH101. This would create a counterweight to the Franco-German Eurocopter partnership between Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace. Westland does not envisage any further radical reduction in its workforce of 8,500 after cutting about 150 jobs in the last financial year.</p>

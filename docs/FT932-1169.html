			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (7): Many a meal for the epicure - Visitors can discover the city's merits with a knife and fork IMAGINE the Istanbul 2000 Olympics, pity the poor synchronised swimmers stuck in the Olympic village while beyond a world of gastronomic temptation beckons. It is hardly surprising that weightlifting and wrestling, sports which often allow great caloric intake, are the ones at which Turkey competes best. For the visiting epicure, the principal merits of Istanbul's Olympic bid can be uncovered with implements no more complicated than a knife and fork. Despite a complex heritage, Turkish cuisine remains craft and not art. Skill is admired but 'foodies' are rare. Diners will search out the restaurant which prepares a familiar dish that little bit more special; other restaurants are quick to copy a dish that has gathered fame, but there is no love of innovation per se. You can buy imported kiwi fruit, but it is the brave restaurateur who would add one to somebody's dinner. The curious exception to this are the large hotels which have pioneered gentle transformations in Turkish eating habits ever since 1915 when the palace chefs succumbed to the lure of the pastry shop at the now defunct Tokatliyan Hotel and ordered a western-style confection for one of the Sultan's particularly important dinner parties. The Japanese restaurant in the Swiss Hotel, the Chinese restaurant in the Ramada, and the Italian restaurant in the Conrad have all made their marks. Now all the chefs at the five-star hotels are thumbing through their grandmothers' recipe books to rediscover Ottoman court cuisine. A conscientious and not over-priced place to sample this is in the dining room or garden of the more modest Kariye Hotel. Lunch in this neighbourhood of restored buildings can be combined with a trip to the famous mosaics of St Saviour in Chora or the rarely visited Sinan-built mosque by the Theodosian land walls at Edirnekapi. Many visitors find it hard to disabuse themselves of the notion that the brochette is the apogee of Turkish cooking. While kebab restaurants are common and popular, many native Istanbulus look upon them as a provincial intrusion from the Arab and Kurdish parts of Turkey, to be treated with the sort of disdain with which Mrs Beeton would eye a chicken nugget. The poor package tourist who finds his gnashers bouncing off a piece of rubbery Shish Kebab (in time to the gyrations of a belly dancer) may well agree. Turkish meat, unless pounded and marinated, is often too fresh to be tender. The best kebabs, therefore, are often made from seasoned mince of beef and lamb, kneaded to a gelatinous pulp and moulded around a skewer. Hanedan, near Besiktas harbour, is a pleasant upmarket kebab house with good starters and which also serves the other accoutrements of a south-eastern cuisine - fresh baked flat bread, and lahmacun, a tiny pizza flavoured with meat, tomatoes, red peppers and fresh lemon. Less salubrious, but equally fine is Hamdi, beside the spice market in Eminonu. The original restaurant was recently torn down, but a sister establishment across the street still maintains the tradition. Here the meat is mixed with pistachio or grilled alongside Turkish loquats - the so-called 'Malta plum'. As delicious as the decor is hideous are the pickled garlic cloves, a spicy dip with pomegranate juice and onion or, for desert, kunife  -sweetened shredded wheat heated with a cheesy filling. Outside the main city, towards the centres of recreation, the woods and beaches, there exist large family restaurants which serve any variety of meat dishes including kuzu tandir, lamb baked in a clay pit oven. Gelik, Beyti and Kosova were once countryside restaurants before the city burst its banks and expanded out towards the airport and the proposed Olympic village. Summer may be fine for sport, but not for fish. Istanbul, a city surrounded by water, is famous for its seafood but in the warmer months the variety is much reduced. For many, it is the quality of the copious cold and hot hors d'oeuvres (meze) that is important, accompanied by raki, an anis drink, or one of the palatable Turkish table wines. Unusual starters and much tastier than they sound are chiroz (a dried fish rehydrated with some vinegar and topped with fresh dill) or lakerda, a salt-cured fish washed of its saltiness and served with red onion. The trend, however, in the more exclusive restaurants these days is to serve a more limited variety of meze, lest the customers skimp on more expensive fish. Korfez, on the Asian side of the Bosporus at Kanlica, caters to Istanbul's highest society with creative elaborations on the Bosporus meal. Its owner, Mr Omer Salur, has imported from the famous Kemal'in Yeri in his native Izmir fish baked in a hardened salt casing to seal in the juice. Other restaurants have been quick to imitate him. Deniz, across the water in Kirecburnu, has learned the lesson well. Nearby, outside Tarabaya, is Facyo's - a long-established fish restaurant famous for its meze. Huzur, known locally as Arab'in Yeri (Chez l'Arab) in Salacak outside Uskudar remains an old-fashioned fish-and-meze place, with the essential ingredient of a dramatic view - the historic skyline is across the water. Cinaralit is probably the best establishment in Ortakoy, Istanbul's infra dig neighbourhood where bars and clubs loiter behind the seafront restaurants. Kumkapi, on the Marmara below the old city, has a number of establishments, most of them restaurants founded by head waiters who used to work at Kor Agop, the grandfather of them all. Like the national variety, restaurant politics displays a tendency to schism. Some family dynasties remain stable, however. Selim Peucak carries on his father's tradition at Vila Rifat on the island of Buyukada (take a horse and carriage from the ferry station to Maden). The restaurant is on the terrace of a wooden house, and much of the produce comes from the garden beyond. Dinner here is generally a set menu consisting of a vast array of traditional meze and grilled meat. Equally secluded, but right in the centre of the 19th century business quarter of Beyoglu is Haci Salih (find the Anadol Pasaj next to the Atlas Cinema). Beyoglu is undergoing a great transformation, with cafes and new bars (try Kaktus) taking over from the clip joints that once abounded. Haci Salih is part of an enduring tradition, however. Some of the regular clientele have memories of the original restaurant which for 40 years occupied much larger premises nearby, now taken over by an establishment called Haci Abdullah which has its aficionados. Mr Abdullah Movit, son of the original Salih, keeps his father's name alive. There are only a few tables, service is over by late afternoon and there is no alcohol. However, there is no better place to sample the basics of Turkish cooking. The current Mr Movit is not a haci (a pilgrim to Mecca) and even takes the occasional drink, but he says the most important quality of a restaurateur is to have a good heart. He shudders when he recalls a stuffed aubergine, during his days of military service in the southern city of Iskenderum. Ever since, he has been reluctant to eat any meal that he has not cooked himself.</p>

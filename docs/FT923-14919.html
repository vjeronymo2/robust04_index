			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: Confusion of war THE HOUR OF THE WOMEN by Christian von Krockow Faber Pounds 14.99, 212 pages THE ROAD AHEAD by Christabel Bielenberg Bantam Pounds 14.99, 196 pages WOMEN make different sorts of wartime heroes from men. Instead of going over the top waving a flag (although doubtless they could do this if necessary), they triumph over the subtler terror of life behind the lines. This is the theme of Christian von Krockow as he records, in the voice of his sister, Libussa, her hair-raising years in the remote eastern provinces of Germany as the Third Reich is swept away by the approaching Russian army. The book does not dwell on horror stories but one paragraph will demonstrate the background to Libussa's struggle: 'We received more and more grim tidings. Many people had actually carried out what we had planned to do: they escaped the brutality of the conquerors by shooting or hanging themselves. Others took poison, like the surgeon from Stolp - and many other doctors . . . Many, indeed more than many, people were murdered, and many were taken away, never to be seen again. Sometimes we could hardly believe our ears: an elderly couple were chased into the village pond and forced to stay there until they drowned in the icy water . . . The proprietor of the Grumbkow estate, Herr von Livonius, had his arms and legs hacked off and was thrown, still alive, to the pigs.' The reason that Libussa does not agree to commit suicide as planned for the family by her mother and her stepfather, Count von Krockow, is that in 1945 she is eight months pregnant. She is prepared to kill herself but not her baby. Instead she and her remarkable mother, a Pomeranian aristocrat who takes to stealing wood and chickens with dignity as well as courage, see to it that the family can eat. As a blueprint for survival, Libussa's behaviour teaches one powerful lesson: always take action, never remain passive. Time after time it is her decisiveness and energy which save her from the enemy. It is not just the simple physical bravery of, for example, returning day after day to the guarded ruins of their estate to steal from the garden, but making the decision to climb out of a shed where she is being held in company with many others. That night, hidden in the burnt-out remains of a German tank she listens to the screams of her fellows who did not have the courage to follow her. As a history book, The Hour of the Women illustrates only too vividly the confusion of war which brings violence to those who least deserve it. After the Russians came the even more hated Poles who were to be the new owners of the von Krackow land. Nevertheless the message, delivered finally by Christian in his own words, is that the wartime boundaries must be honoured by all races. Too much time has passed to retain old hatred. 'If we really love our children and our grandchildren, we must do everything in our power to save them from the horrors we once experienced.' It is this spirit of reconciliation which infuses the book and makes it at heart not a horror story but a testimony to magnificent human qualities. It is probably unfair to read Christabel Bielenberg's The Road Ahead immediately after a book describing life lived at the edges. The first part of Mrs Bielenberg's autobiography, The Past Is Myself, was itself set in wartime Germany and told of an Englishwoman's extraordinary experience married to a German during that terrible period. Rightly, it became a best seller. This second volume is a quieter affair altogether, as peace unravels fear and the Bielenbergs plan a new life in Ireland. Ironic and well written, her book describes their problems as novice farmers when the enemy no longer comes in Nazi uniform but wears a woolly coat and has a way of escaping to the far horizon. Gradually her story turns into a comfortable family saga.</p>

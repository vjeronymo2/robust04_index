			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT BECOMES A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND MOST?;  </P> <P> AFTER YEARS OF TRIBULATION, ELIZABETH TAYLOR FINALLY TAKES ON WILLIAMS' 'SWEET  BIRD OF YOUTH' ON TV  </P> <P> "I had a great beauty. I say it with pride -- no matter how sad it being gone,"  Elizabeth Taylor says wistfully. The 57-year-old legend picks up a glass of  bourbon and downs it like a scared monster whose life is over.  </P> <P> Taylor is rehearsing a scene from Tennessee Williams' provocative play "Sweet  Bird of Youth," which NBC will televise at 9 tonight. Directed by Nicolas Roeg,  the film also stars Mark Harmon, Rip Torn and Valerie Perrine. Hearing the  actress say the words evokes memories of her own personal history and the  demons that have plagued her. It is as if she were reflecting on her own life  of wretched excess, headlines, pain, multiple marriages, booze, drugs and  bedrooms.  </P> <P> "We always knew it would be Elizabeth Taylor," co-executive producer Peter  Locke says of the role of Alexandra Del Lago. "After all, her life is a  Tennessee Williams play."  </P> <P> The film also affords Taylor her best acting challenge in years, reuniting her  with the playwright with whom some of her best work is associated -- "Cat on a  Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer," both of which garnered Oscar  nominations for her.  </P> <P> A few days later, Taylor lounges on her Bel Air living room sofa dressed in a  billowing purple caftan. She is surrounded by amethyst crystals -- in obvious  homage to her famous violet eyes. Above Taylor is a Van Gogh. Nearby is a  sculpture of a majestic horse entitled "Northern Dancer" -- done by her  daughter, Liza. She is in a perky mood -- looking overweight and yet strangely,  inexplicably alluring.  </P> <P> Question: "Sweet Bird of Youth" marks your return to Tennessee Williams. After  your acclaimed work in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly, Last Summer,"  what do these old and new Williams heroines have in common?  </P> <P> Answer: They (the women characters) are all slightly larger than life and a  little off the wall -- and a little crazy. Tennessee's women are all a little  crazy, which makes them infinitely playable.  </P> <P> Q: Do you grab hold of and attach yourself to their quirky side?  </P> <P> A: Oh yes, because it's the most colorful side. Tennessee's women are so rich  and full-bodied . . . all larger than life. Alexandria is an actress. Well,  actresses are a little larger than life. (The late) Mike Todd (Taylor's third  husband) used to say: "An actor is a little less than a man . . . and an  actress is a little more than a woman." An interesting observation. I'm not  saying that men are a little less than men at all but actresses are very  colorful and Alexandra, even if she had been a housewife, would have been  colorful.  </P> <P> Q: I doubt that she would wield a vacuum cleaner unless it was to hit a badly  behaved lover. . . .  </P> <P> A: (laughs) True. She's very selfish, self-centered, but I think she is three  dimensional -- especially when she can get out of her self -- she is very  single minded about that. She does care. She does have compassion.  </P> <P> Q: But in the end, is she redeemable?  </P> <P> A: (Pondering, then quietly) Barely. But, yes, I think so.  </P> <P> Q: You were close friends with Tennessee Williams but there are conflicting  press reports as to when you actually met and what the circumstances were.  </P> <P> A: I met him after I had done "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" in New York. I'm not sure  exactly which year. . . . I was in the hospital with pneumonia and he came to  see me. It must have been about '57. It was after "Cat" -- no, it wasn't after  "Cat" -- yes, it was -- must have been . . . now I am confused. It must have  been after "Cat" but it couldn't have been because Mike (Todd) was killed when  I was shooting "Cat." Well, I was in the hospital, but I think it was the  hospital in New York because that's where we lived. Now I am confused. Mike was  killed in '58. It must have been after. After 1958. Must have been.  </P> <P> Q: How did you get along initially? Do you remember your first impression of  him?  </P> <P> A: Well, we fell about laughing.  </P> <P> Q: Why? What did he say to you?  </P> <P> A: I don't know. But we just hit it off immediately. We got on so well and he  just made me laugh and I made him laugh. I had pneumonia and Dr. Dana Atchley  was running the hospital then. He was a wonderful, brilliant doctor and  everybody was quite in awe of him. He was quite an old, small and diminutive  man. I remember that he came charging into my room the second that he heard  that Tennessee was there. He came charging into my room and Tennessee had just  handed me a cigarette and, or course, I wasn't meant to be smoking, so I made a  tent with my knee and slipped my hand under the sheet between my knees to form  this sort of tent to hide it from the doctor. I had just taken one mighty puff  off of it when he flew into the room and started chatting away with Tennessee.  Their conversation got further and further along and I kept trying to sit on  the cigarette and keep it in the confines of the sheet. You realize that this  doctor would have killed me if he found out. He was capable of throwing me out  of the hospital. Tennessee kept looking at me and I kept trying to avoid his  stare and we were cracking up. Dr. Atchley wanted to know everything about  Tennessee from Tennessee himself. He was a big fan. Finally, the smoke was  really getting heavy. I didn't have an ashtray and no way of putting the  cigarette out except on my skin. Finally, he left and we fell about laughing.  It was just down to a butt. So that's what I remember. A lot of smoke and a lot  of sweat. That was our first meeting.  </P> <P> Q: Time magazine called you the quintessential Tennessee Williams heroine. . .  . A: They did? When did they do that?  </P> <P> Q: Quite some time ago. I think it still applies.  </P> <P> A: Thank you. That means I'm highly melodramatic.  </P> <P> Q: Is that what it means?  </P> <P> A: I think steamy. Full of drama. I take it as also being poetic. I'm sure they  didn't mean it kindly. . . .Tennessee's heroines are all fraught. They're on  the brink of disaster -- some personal disaster. They are infinitely playable.  They give you something to wrap your lips around.  </P> <P> Q: What are the actual elements you relate to?  </P> <P> A: Good dialogue. . . . He writes like a poet and it's so wonderful to have  good words to say because you can relax and be free. I don't know, it just  gives you a sense of security -- or it does me. . . . You can concentrate on  feeling the words and let them invade you.  </P> <P> Q: Williams rewrote "Sweet Bird" several times and at one point the central  figure was actually a man. Was he being partially autobiographical with your  character?  </P> <P> A: (Shaking her head "no.") They say that about all his plays. Well, he did  rewrite a lot. So they were saying that he's writing about himself just like  with (playwright Edward) Albee. They say that all of Albee's parts can be  interchangeable with a man or a woman. They said "Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolf?" was made for two men. (She rolls her eyes.) It wasn't. It was written  for a man and a woman. But people like to say that.  </P> <P> Q: Is this one of his better works or is it flawed?  </P> <P> A: I don't think there is such a thing as his best work. I mean, "Streetcar  Named Desire" is such a fabulous play. This ("Sweet Bird of Youth") is a  fabulous play. "Cat" is. "Glass Menagerie." There's just so many. Certainly, I  think it's one of his best.  </P> <P> Q: You've been talking about doing "Sweet Bird of Youth" for well over a  decade. Why now?  </P> <P> A: Why not? It just seemed like now is the right time. And it just fell into  the right place. Even weight wise, it was perfect. I would have had to put on  weight if it had happened earlier, like I did for "Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolf?" It just happened at the right time.  </P> <P> Q: Do you know intuitively when the right time is? Obviously, you could have  </P> <P> done it any time.  </P> <P> A: I could have but for some reason I didn't. It's not because I didn't like  the play. I've been flirting with it for years. I don't know why. Sometimes it  happens for the right reason.  </P> <P> Q: Nicolas Roeg is an interesting choice for a director. He's never directed  television before and is known for being eccentric -- and not taking any guff  from his stars.  </P> <P> A: Nick has a wonderfully macabre sense of humor. He has a jagged blackness in  his soul. His quirkiness is quite unexpected and that dark element, of course,  is central to fully understanding Tennessee. I think they complement each other  so beautifully because Nick's unexpected qualities give it such a burst of  energy and revival and renewal and rebirth.  </P> <P> Q: How did you know from his work in feature films that he would be able to do  what is, more or less, a classic American play in a medium (television) he's  never directed in before?  </P> <P> A: I knew not from talking to him -- not specifically that -- but rather  observing his work . . . he seems a natural for Tennessee. I'm surprised they  haven't merged before.  </P> <P> Q: Do you still need a strong director or do you prefer to be left alone to  your own devices?  </P> <P> A: A strong director does leave you to your devices. A strong director allows  you to be free and you trust that he's there and he will tell you if you've  gone too far. A strong director allows you to be much more experimental and  take greater chances than a director who isn't secure within himself.  </P> <P> Q: Clearly, you must be quite aware of the irony of playing this particular  role -- she is the ultimate fading movie queen.  </P> <P> A: No. Because I've played so many actresses. People love to write about  actresses.  </P> <P> Q: But this is the literary world's ultimate "has been" actress.  </P> <P> A: I mean at least once a year I play a "has been" actress and I keep on going,  so I obviously haven't been has'd yet! (Laughter). I'm a great success as "has  beens."  </P> <P> Q: Inevitably, comparisons will be drawn between your performance and Geraldine  Page (who originated the role both on stage and on screen).  </P> <P> A: I haven't seen it (the 1959 film starring Page and Paul Newman).  Deliberately, because I didn't want to be influenced. She's such a brilliant  actress.  </P> <P> Q: Did you know you would play the part?  </P> <P> A: I don't know why I didn't see it when it first came out. I just haven't seen  it. Probably deliberately didn't see it since '59, consciously because I  thought one day I'd do it.  </P> <P> Q: How was it working with Mark Harmon, a media magnet of another generation?  </P> <P> A: He's terrific. I think he's pulled out a dimension that, as an actor, he may  not even have been aware of, because he's been playing a certain kind of part.  In this, he shows a dark side that I don't think people were aware of.  </P> <P> Q: Why Mark Harmon over Patrick Swayze and Don Johnson, who were also under  consideration for the role?  </P> <P> A: Why not? He's perfect. He's all-American. He's the right age. The Sweet Bird  of Youth is about to say goodby to Chance Wayne. Not Mark, but Chance, because  of the way he lives and what he has inside: a terrible, dark turbulence eating  at him. Mark doesn't have that in his own life and yet he portrays it well in  this, which I think will surprise a lot of people -- the despair that he shows.  </P> <P> Q: (Co-executive producer) Peter Locke says Harmon adds an innocence that  wasn't inherent in Paul Newman's film performance.  </P> <P> A: I think that's what I mean by all-American, clean-cut. Innocent is good. I  think that's what attracts the princess to him in the first place, and makes  her hang in, makes her want to try to save him. If he were just gone, and a  gigolo and a total user, she wouldn't be bothered. She's seen too many of them,  being led around in other grand hotels. She thinks he's got a kind of golden  innocence and sweetness.  </P> <P> Q: What about beyond acting? What are your personal priorities at this point in  your life?  </P> <P> A: I don't have a set pattern. I take things as they come. Usually with a great  amount of relish. I just lay back and wait for it to happen. And it usually  does.  </P> <P> Q: Are you revealing that you're highly fatalistic or just without a plan for  the future?  </P> <P> A: I think I'm becoming fatalistic. Too much has happened in my life for me not  to be fatalistic.  </P> <P> Q: How do you deal with tabloid reporters going through your garbage and  invading your children's lives day after day?  </P> <P> A: There are certain things that you can do to insure as much privacy as  possible, and I do all of them. When they speculate and put false words into  your mouth, like intimate friends and close sources . . . that's b.s. I know  it's b.s., the people close to me know it's b.s., and that's all I can do.  </P> <P> Q: Are you more hurt by attacks on your children?  </P> <P> A: When was the last time I was hurt by tabloids? I don't even remember.  They're really unimportant to me.  </P> <P> Q: Your son (Michael Wilding) has a small role in "Sweet Bird of Youth." I  asked him if you ever offered him any advice as an actor and he said something  to the effect of "Why would she?" But what sort of advice does Elizabeth Taylor  -- mother -- offer her children? Do you allow them a certain independence?  </P> <P> A: Oh God, yes. I regard and respect their privacy as much as I do my own. They  respect my privacy. I admire my kids as people. They're individuals, with  individual lives. We're very good friends. I would never drop over their house  without calling, and they call before they drop over here. It's a mutual  respect. I think because of that, we're much closer. They know I'm here, and  they're free to call me whenever they want to. They have their lives.  </P> <P> Q: Do you care about misconceptions that circulate about you?  </P> <P> A: No. I really don't care. Supposedly I've been on the verge of getting  married about seven times in the last seven years. There's no point in setting  the record straight, because if people want to believe that, they'll believe  it.  </P> <P> Q: Will you act until you drop?  </P> <P> A: (Big laugh) Till I drop? I don't know when I'm going to drop. I don't know  when I'm going to retire, either. I don't feel like dropping today. I must be  active. I'm active outside of working. I must have my own thing to do, and I  don't mean acting. I'm an active person. (Acting) is probably the thing I know  best. Certainly it's the thing I've been at the longest. I do enjoy it. Once in  a while it's fun.  </P> <P> Q: Do you hear the voice so many actors hear inside themselves burning away  asking: "Where's my next great part?"  </P> <P> A: I never have been driven in that way, and it's probably evident in my work.  You don't need to comment on that. I know you're dying to.  </P> <P> Q: What's the one thing that makes you the most passionate at this stage in  your life?  </P> <P> A: My work in AIDS. That's the most important thing in my life.  </P> <P> Q: What are your goals?  </P> <P> A: There are so many things. I'm the National Chairwoman of AmFAR (The American  Foundation For AIDS Research). It's an on-going, 24-hour-a-day thing. It  doesn't let up. It won't let up until there's a cure and people are educated.  There's still so much stigma left. Where we have helped, aside from giving away  about $14 million, we've been highly educational, I hope. We are trying. It's  like fighting city hall, but the government at least is opening an eye now.  </P> <P> Q: Is the American government now being more responsible toward making the AIDS  issue a priority?  </P> <P> A: Responsible? Oh God, yes. The tone in Washington is beginning to change. But  it won't be enough until there is a cure.  </P> <P> Q: The New York Times once wrote that your highly publicized personal life has  largely overshadowed your acting accomplishments. Is that a fair assessment and  if so, does it bother you?  </P> <P> A: I think it's true. No, it doesn't bother me. It gives me a chuckle now when  I hear critics talk about my work in a glowing way, because they sure weren't  glowing then. To gain respectability in hindsight, I find rather amusing.  </P></p>

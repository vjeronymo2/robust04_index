Yan disclosed yesterday  that representatives of the Moro National Liberation Front  (MNLF) and the government panel have agreed to hold the second  round of formal talks on 13-20 April in Jakarta, Indonesia.    Yan, chairman of the government panel in the peace  negotiations with the MNLF said that another meeting among  members of the mixed committee representing both panels was also  slated for 5-7 April in Zamboanga City in preparation for the  holding of the formal talks in Indonesia.    He expressed belief that the meeting between the two groups  will be held smoothly since they have established better  confidence and atmosphere for the next round of talks.    Yan also said that members of the mixed committee of both  panels met yesterday in an undisclosed place in Metro Manila on  preparations for the holding of the formal talks.    Included in yesterday's meeting were security arrangements  for members of the two panels, particularly those to be assigned  to MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari during the 5 April mixed committee  meeting in Zamboanga City.    "We will give him (Misuari) adequate security but definitely  not more than 500 as he earlier requested," Yan said.    A joint cease fire committee chaired by Brig. Gen. Guillermo  Ruiz of the Philippine Marines will submit today the details of  the meeting of the mixed committee to Yan. Ruiz's counterpart  in the secessionist group is an MNLF major general.    The joint cease fire committee has formed 13 subcommittees  in  the 13 Mindanao provinces to monitor the implementation of the  cease fire agreement.    Yan said that the recently formulated guidelines and ground  rules for the implementation of the joint cease fire agreement  signed by the two parties last 7 November in Jakarta "was fully  endorsed by the Organization of Islamic Countries."    Meanwhile, leaders of the MNLF pledged to arrest their  members who were allegedly involved in the recent kidnaping of  five school teachers in Basilan.    Yan said that the MNLF vowed to arrest Commander Sulaiman  Alih and a fugitive municipal councilor of Tuburan town in  Basilan who abducted five teachers of the Boji Tambis Elementary  School last 7 March.    Ruiz said that the kidnaping case presented before the joint  cease fire committee was considered the first major cease fire  violation of the MNLF. The five kidnap victims were released  unharmed last 11 March.    Yan, however, stressed that the spate of kidnapings in  Mindanao has not adversely affected the ongoing peace  negotiations.    President Ramos strengthened yesterday his peace process  staff as he called on governors and mayors nationwide to fully  support the ongoing peace negotiations with various rebel groups.    The president, stressing that the peace process must move  on,  named Manuel Yan acting presidential adviser on the peace  process, concurrent with his position as chairman of the  Philippine negotiating panel for the peace talks with the  Southern Philippine Autonomous Groups (GRP [Government of the  Republic of the Philippines]-SPAG).    Yan, a former ambassador, succeeded Oscar Santos who was  moved by the president to the post of presidential consultant on  the peace process.    In his regular press conference in Malacanang [presidential  office], the president said Yan will be responsible for the  administration of the Office of the Presidential Assistant on  the Peace Process (OPAPP), as well as supervision of the three  government negotiating panels.    "Santos will now be free to be sent on a mission-type of  activity to help in the peace process, especially in his area of  expertise which is among the coconut farmers, small farmers, and  workers in Quezon and the Southern Tagalog provinces," the  president said.    The president said that Santos has been fighting a serious  physical disability and has been advised by his doctors to take  it easy.    "But he is okay now," he added.    Ramos earlier ordered peace negotiators to speed up their  work without being blocked by legalities.    The president directed all Cabinet Officials for Regional  Development (CORD) and Regional Development Council (RDC)  chairpersons to ensure coordinated action and effective  communication in support of the ongoing peace process of the  government.    During the quarterly CORD-RDC meeting in Malacanang, the  president emphasized the importance of the involvement of the  RDC chairmen who are also governors and city mayors of their  respective areas.    "We would like you to get involved in this effort because we  are seeing the end of the insurgency. We have to make sure that  we provide some hospitality, opportunity, and attraction for  those remaining out there in the hills," President Ramos said.    The president directed the CORD-RDCs to coordinate closely  with the OPAPP and the Regional and Provincial Peace Convenors  in the implementation of measures to support the overall peace  process of the government.    The CORD-RDCs were also directed to inform their  constituents  on what the government has done to push the reform program and  to address the roots of the internal armed conflict in the  country.    The chief executive required them to submit reports on their  activities in support of the peace process to the Office of the  President on or before 30 April and thereafter, as may be  necessary.    The role of the RDCs in the comprehensive peace process  calls  for pushing the reform process in their own regions and enduring  genuine people participation in it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 8 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali Friday [8 April] ordered his special envoy  in Rwanda to bolster safety measures in the country and  especially in the capital, where chaos has broken out since the  deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents this week.    In a written statement read by his spokeswoman Therese  Gastaut, he also condemned "the odious attacks" in which 10  United Nations peacekeepers died.    Butrus-Ghali said he was asking his envoy in Rwanda,  Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, "to take all measures to guarantee  safety throughout the country and particularly in Kigali," the  capital.    There were no details on what measures Booh-Booh would be  asked to enact. Some 2,500 UN peacekeepers are in the country  to help ensure a peaceful transition to elections scheduled to  take place next year.    Pandemonium and ethnic violence have broken out in the  country since the deaths of the two presidents in a plane crash  Wednesday evening.    The UN chief also said he had "learned with great  indignation  of the new incidents in Rwanda and especially the tragic death  of Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana."    He was working on a report for the Security Council  recommending ways of protecting UN staff, the statement said.    In Brussels earlier, sources said Rwandan employees of  foreign aid workers in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan  troops, while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns  have been killed amid the ethnic violence.    Troops have been blamed for the murder Thursday of  Uwilingiyimana, killed in the aftermath of the plane crash  deaths.</p>

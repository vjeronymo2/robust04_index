			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Retiring females match men at 65 - Pensions THE MEASURE The female state pension age is being raised to the male retirement age of 65. IN DETAIL The measure will affect all women currently under age 44. The change will be phased in over 10 years between 2010 and 2020. THE BACKGROUND This change will eventually result in savings to the National Insurance Fund of Pounds 5bn per annum. The basic state pension currently is worth Pounds 56.10 per week for a single person and Pounds 89.80 for a married couple. The pension is built up through payment of National Insurance contributions levied on 'band earnings', earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a week for the 1993/94 tax year (Pounds 57 and Pounds 430 in 1994/95). The Government has reduced benefits under the state pension system before. In 1980 the link with earnings inflation was severed and replaced with the historically lower prices inflation link. The value of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) already has been cut for those retiring after the end of the century. Originally, the pension was 25 per cent of band earnings based on the individual's best 20 years. After April 6 2000 the 25 per cent maximum will be reduced over a period of 10 years to 20 per cent. Also the 'best 20 years' basis for assessment will be replaced by average band earnings over an entire career, which means that periods of low pay will also be taken into account and will drag down the value of the pension. The latter measure will primarily affect women since, due to family commitments, they tend to spend a significant period in low paid part-time employment. Paul Greenwood, research actuary with William M Mercer, said: 'Women currently under age 44, who want to retire before 65, will have to make pay extra contributions to prevent a shortfall. This can be done by paying additional voluntary contributions under a company scheme or by increasing contributions to a personal pension plan.'</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aga pleases market with solid nine-month result Shares in Aga jumped 8 per cent yesterday after the Swedish industrial gas group announced a stronger-than-expected 23 per cent increase in profits in the first nine months. Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.18bn (Dollars 163.9m), compared with SKr964m in the same 1993 period, after sales increased 10 per cent to SKr9.21bn. The company upgraded its full-year forecast, saying it expected profits to be 20 per cent higher than last year's SKr1.36bn. The group's A shares rose SKr5.5 to close at SKr73.5. The figures have been adjusted to exclude Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain which Aga demerged earlier this year to concentrate on its core businesses. At the operating level, income rose 15 per cent to SKr1.2bn due to economic improvement, rising demand for industrial gases, and rationalisation. Aga benefited from economic stabilisation in Brazil, which brought good third-quarter earnings for its unit there. The company saw a reduction in net financial costs to SKr162m from SKr195m while its 34 per cent share of income from Gullspangs, the power company, rose to SKr132m from SKr113m. The group's third-quarter performance was much stronger than a year ago, with income after financial items climbing 56 per cent to SKr398m even though sales were only 7 per cent higher at SKr3.13bn. Investments in new plant and equipment jumped to SKr1.2bn in the first nine months from SKr980m in the same 1993 period. The biggest projects were air gas plants in Finland, Norway, Germany, Chile and Mexico.</p>

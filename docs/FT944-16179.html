			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAT makes Dollars 70m investment in Russian cigarette factory BAT Industries is to gain almost full ownership of Moscow's Java brand cigarette factory in return for investing more than Dollars 70m (Pounds 44.3m) over three years to modernise it. BAT will also introduce some of its international brands to the operation. The agreement, announced yesterday after nearly two years' negotiations, is BAT's fifth in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Once investment in the five ventures is complete in five years' time, they will have an annual production capacity of more than 100bn cigarettes. BAT sold 540m cigarettes worldwide last year. Java is a leading brand of high quality oriental filter cigarettes in Russia and former Soviet republics. Capacity at its Moscow plant will rise from 14bn cigarettes a year to more than 20bn when the modernisation has been completed. The deal has taken so long to complete since BAT signed a letter of intent because of the complexities of the privatisation process. BAT has bought some shares from individuals and institutions for an undisclosed sum. It will be given additional shares in return for its investment to take its stake to more than 90 per cent. Java will take BAT's Russian capacity to more than 30bn cigarettes. Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of BAT Industries, has seen a big increase in cigarette sales since the country launched its new anti-inflation currency in July, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT chairman, said that sales were likely to grow from 86bn units last year to more than 100bn units next year. 'The transformation is quite remarkable, both in terms of the lower inflation figures and the effects on our business.' The new currency, the real, has reduced inflation from 50 per cent a month to less than 2 per cent, increasing the purchasing power of poorer workers. Souza Cruz's investment plans, which include a Dollars 54m leaf plant in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, are on track and the company has enough capacity to cope with increased demand.</p>

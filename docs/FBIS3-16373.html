Like many others, it had a number without any identifiable  meaning added to its name--Svobodnyy-18. But almost everybody in  Amur Oblast called it simply and plainly the "rocket city." A  mysterious and apparently very serious military unit was  stationed here.    At the time of conversion and across-the-board cutbacks in  the armed forces, the situation at Svobodnyy-18 became so bad  that its troubles spilled far outside the bounds of the secret  territory. This was no longer a "rocket bulwark of the  motherland;" the servicemen who stayed suffered together with  their families from poor food supply, inadequate heating in  their homes, and other everyday problems.    Now the oblast has received the news that the government has  instructed appropriate organizations to develop a project for  the construction of a space launch site in the Russian Far East,  and the base for the "Amur Baykonur" will be Svobodnyy-18. The  base's facilities have already been transferred to the military  space forces.    Head of the Amur Oblast administration Vladimir Polevanov  confirmed a few days ago in a public address the seriousness of  the government's intent to launch space vessels from the  territory entrusted to him. As AMURSKAYA PRAVDA reported, the  Amur governor took advantage of Minister of Foreign Affairs  Andrey Kozyrev's recent visit to the oblast to send two  memoranda to Boris Yeltsin. In one, B. Polevanov invited the  president to visit Amur Oblast, and in the other he asked the  president on behalf of Amur Oblast residents to speed up the  signing of the edict on the construction of a space launch site  in the designated area. He even made a suggestion to Boris  Nikolayevich on what to call the future facility: "Svobodnyy  Russian Space Launch Center."    Meanwhile, oblast residents are not unanimous in accepting  the need to build a space launch site here. A lot of concerns in  this respect are being voiced by representatives of the  "greens," environmental science specialists, State Duma  deputies, and ordinary citizens. At their request Leonid  Korotkov, a Russian parliament deputy from Amur Oblast, began  with the help of experts a careful study of the current  environmental situation in the area of all three space launch  sites that existed on the territory of the former USSR. So far  the information he has collected is extremely discouraging. The  oblast public is waiting for detailed data on potential changes  in the ecological situation in connection with the space launch  site construction. Depending on the results, the president will  be informed of the true reaction of Amur Oblast residents.  <H5>  Sergey Leskov, IZVESTIYA </H5>   The idea of building a launch site equal to Baykonur  has been discussed increasingly often lately. The reason is  simple--Russia and Kazakhstan still cannot agree on mutually  acceptable terms for utilizing the largest space complex in the  world built in the Aral steppes.    As to construction of a space launch station in the area of  Blagoveshchensk, where the disbanded rocket forces used to be  stationed, the main argument in its favor is its geographic  location. Although Svobodnyy-18 is located on a more northern  latitude than Baykonur, it is still in the southernmost region  of the territory of Russia. Launch site proximity to the equator  saves fuel in the process of putting the craft into orbit and in  all countries is considered one of the most important factors in  choosing a launch site. In confidential conversations officials  note that the new launch site will open the way for Russia to  enter the fast developing market of space services in Southeast  Asia.    It is believed in the Russian Space Agency [RSA], however,  that these pluses are offset by Amur Oblast's considerable  distance from space infrastructure facilities. According to RSA  Deputy General Director Boris Ostroumov, construction of a major  space launch site in the Far East would be tantamount to  building it out of diamonds. Given the paucity of the Russian  space budget, a realistic approach, in the RSA's opinion, would  be to preserve and maintain existing facilities. There is still  hope of reaching an accommodation with Kazakhstan. On 10 March a  Russian delegation, headed by RSA General Director Yuriy Koptev,  left for another round of negotiations in Almaty. There are also  technical capabilities for expanding the functions of the  northern space launch site in Plesetsk, although each start from  there requires 10-15 percent more fuel as compared to Baykonur.  The extra costs would be greatest in launching heavy rockets of  the Proton and Energiya type from Plesetsk.    At this point the question of building a space launch site  in  Amur Oblast is far from finalized. The initiative for this idea  comes from the military, which for quite understandable reasons  would like to continue utilizing the former rocket base. As of  today there is only an instruction to study the technical  proposal for construction of the space launch site, but  definitely not a government order for the project design. The  situation will possibly become clearer after 14 March, when a  Ministry of Defense commission headed by Colonel General  Vladimir Ivanov, head of the military space troops, will visit  the site of the Svobodnyy-18 military base. The Ministry of  Defense prefers not make any comment until it examines the  facilities of the potential space launch site.</p>

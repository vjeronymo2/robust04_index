			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, Your paper was certainly entitled to recommend voting for whomever it pleased, even Labour. However, are you aware that radio channels in my country, most of them subsidised and hence influenced by the existing socialist government (moreover, soundly defeated in most recent regional and district elections), promptly used your article to, in my view, herald benefits of socialism. I expect our daily, enlightened, companion - the FT - to be more aware of its own international influence and use it with more discrimination.

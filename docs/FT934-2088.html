			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Russian results unsettle prices in European sector German bond prices led other European markets lower yesterday on concern about the strong support for right-wing leader Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the Russian elections, while the imminent conclusion of the Gatt world trade agreement failed to enthuse dealers. After showing little reaction on Monday, the markets were unsettled yesterday by reports that Mr Zhirinovsky had threatened Germany with nuclear attack. However, the Reuters report was based on an old interview, according to North German Radio in Hamburg, which ran the interview as part of a profile of Mr Zhirinovsky. News that a Gatt trade deal appears to have been concluded failed to boost the bond markets, which had discounted an agreement, traders said. 'It's important for its symbolic impact rather than for anything it will do to boost world trade; but failure to agree a deal would have been negative for the bond markets,' said Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at S. G. Warburg. Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank, described the agreement as a series of 'bilateral trade agreements wrapped up in a package'. Dealers said they did not expect the sell-off in the German bond market, where prices fell half a point yesterday, to be protracted, citing the lack of reaction to fears about the political situation in Russia in the foreign exchange market. 'The German market had a relatively good run last week and was running out of steam,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. '(Mr Zhirinovsky) helped tip the scales,' he added. In the futures market, the March bund contract on Liffe had reached a new high of 101.05, before selling off sharply to end the day at its lowest point of 100.26. Traders were also discouraged by the Bundesbank's emphasis that its press conference tomorrow is to announce next year's M3 broad money supply target, apparently suggesting there will be no interest rate cut. Dealers will be keeping a close eye on the M3 target: if the upper end of the target range is left at 6 1/2 per cent, this will be viewed as broadly positive for the bund market, leaving the way open for further interest rate easing in the first quarter of next year. US Treasury bonds weakened yesterday in a thin but volatile session mainly driven by technical factors, rather than inconclusive data on November retail sales. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down a full point to 99 9/32 , with the yield rising to 6.298 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100, to yield 4.232 per cent. The long end at first held up well after the release of November retail sales data, which showed a 0.4 per cent uptick, as forecast. Traders apparently brushed aside yet another indication of moderate-to-strong growth in the fourth quarter. Near midday, the 30-year bond began to slip. Its losses mounted during the afternoon, in parallel with a rise in the CRB commodity index. But the severity of the downturn reflected the low level of activity, which tends to exaggerate any price swings, rather than any fundamental shift in sentiment. The gilts market held up relatively well, easing back less than  1/4 point at the long end, causing the spread between gilts and bunds to narrow. Dealers said they would be focusing on today's November retail price data for further confirmation that inflationary pressures are under control. Italian bonds also ended lower, dragged down by pressures elsewhere in Europe, despite the fall in yields at yesterday's BTP (Italian government bond) auction. Dealers said there were still strong expectations of further rate cuts soon. At the sale, the Italian treasury sold L1,000bn three-year notes at a net yield of 6.98 per cent, down from 7.79 per cent in the last auction, and L1,000bn five-year notes yielding 7.24 per cent, down from 7.98 per cent. French bond futures also fell sharply after reaching a new high on the Matif in Paris. French Bond prices dropped about  3/8 point, outperforming Germany. Japanese government bond futures were little changed during Far East trading, but fell 20 basis points in European trading following Mr Zhirinovsky's comments.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Up to now no efforts have been made to stop or  control the growth of the rapidly increasing gap in society. In  fact, it is as if without realizing it every deregulation  accelerates the growth of this social gap. The reason is that  big businesses have developed and expanded through improper  competition.    The Review Board of KADIN (Indonesian Chamber of Commerce)  made these statements in the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce's  Evaluation of Activities for 1989 to 1994, which was distributed  last week. This evaluation was signed directly by the chairman  of KADIN's Review Board (MP) H. Probosutedjo.    In its general evaluation of the business world, KADIN's  Review Board also said that big businesses are in control of  various business sectors, from upstream to downstream. Big  business control of business is noticeable and real, that is,  they control it vertically and horizontally.    KADIN's MP also said that there is too great a discrepancy  between the wealth or assets owned by small and medium  businesses and by BUMN's (state-owned businesses) on the one  hand and the wealth or assets owned by big businesses,  especially those that are really big businesses, on the other  hand, and "that it has resulted in a social gap which is getting  wider and deeper."    "The growth of the gap between big businesses and other  businesses is greater than the growth of the economy, and there  aren't any effective efforts being made to prevent, control, or  put a stop to the growth of this gap."  <H5>  What Other Theory? </H5>   KADIN's MP concluded that KADIN must play an active role in  overcoming this problem for PANCASILA [Five Principles of the  Nation] harmony and unity by creating cooperation between the  conglomerates on the one hand and the small and medium  businesses, cooperatives, and BUMN's on the other hand. This is  something that is "absolutely necessary."    "The trickle-down theory, the theory of `foster child,  foster  parent,' and the theory of a piece of the pie, have not become a  reality. What other theories will we have to go through in order  to bring about a total Development Trilogy? In this respect,  KADIN must really be able to create national harmony within a  PANCASILA society."    KADIN's MP also made a special evaluation of each player in  the national economy. Many of the BUMN businesses, they said,  are declining. Many are not healthy and in fact are sick.    Meanwhile, the cooperatives are growing slowly, not in line  with expectations, and "not in line with Article 33 of the 1945  Constitution for creating PANCASILA." The mandate of Article 33  of the 1945 Constitution, that the cooperatives should be the  cornerstone of the economy, is still far from expectations.  Cooperation between big businesses and the cooperatives and  between the business world in general and the cooperatives is  still very weak.    Meanwhile, the growth of the private sector, particularly  small businesses, has also been very slow. Among the reasons for  this is the difficulty of obtaining funds, especially the credit  expected from government banks. Permanent Working Capital Credit  (KMKP), Small Investment Credit (KIK), and Candak Kulak [the  credit system for small businesses] have not been very  successful. Small-Business Credit (KUK) was in fact misused by  big businesses.    Many small businesses have also been squeezed by the  expansion and development of big businesses, which have been  growing through improper and destructive competition. For  example, when markets are remodeled, small businesses usually  lose their original selling place because the cost of a stall is  set beyond their ability to pay.    In addition to being squeezed out of their place of  business,  many small businesses have gone bankrupt, unable to compete with  big businesses which develop their businesses from upstream to  downstream on the grounds of free enterprise. Up to now there  have been no attempts to stop or control improper competition.  In fact, "Indonesian competition goes further than free  competition in the liberal capitalist nations."    KADIN's MP said that medium businesses have almost the same  problems as small businesses. Many medium-scale businesses are  being squeezed and are getting smaller as a result of not being  able to compete with big businesses, which are always expanding  and developing through improper competition.    The result is that many midsized businesses, like small  businesses, are tangled up in bank credit. They cannot pay the  installments on their loans or pay the interest. A further  result is that many of the guarantees of medium and small  businesses have finally been turned over to the PUPN [State  Credit Affairs Committee] (now called the BUPLN, the State  Auction and Credit Affairs Board).  <H5>  Unable To Compete </H5>   Big businesses usually have smooth channels of communication  with government banks and with state officials; they have very  close relations with businessmen, which enables the businesses  to run smoothly. On the contrary, the heads of medium and small  businesses and of BUMN's do not have this ability to communicate  directly with those in charge or with the bank officials or  government agencies concerned. The result is that small and  medium businesses and BUMN's are unable to compete with big  businesses and even less so with conglomerates.    KADIN's MP also said that in general provincial businesses  in  the 27 provinces have been left far behind.    KADIN's evaluation was issued at the same time that the list  of candidates for KADIN directors and for members of KADIN's MP  was drafted. For this purpose KADIN's MP held a series of  meetings with groups of company associations and with business  associations. MP held marathon meetings with certain  cooperatives, BUMN's, and members of the private sector from 16  to 21 November.  <H5>  Requirements for KADIN's General Chairman </H5>   In SK [Directive] 092/MP/XII/93 KADIN's MP also issued the  requirements and criteria for candidates to membership in the  MP, for general chairman and for the board of directors for the  period 1994 to 1998.    It was decided that the MP would submit a list of  nominations  to KADIN's Second National Congress, which would contain the  names of 120 candidates for KADIN's MP and the names of 200  candidates for KADIN's Executive Committee for the period 1994  to 1998.    KADIN's MP arrived at eight requirements for general  chairman. They include administrative requirements, such as  having already filled out a form for KADIN's MP. There also are  personal requirements, such as: a person who is experienced, who  is successful, and who has shown his dedication to KADIN.    In addition, it should be someone who understands and is  able  to defend the interests of the business world and who is a  leader. The last requirement is someone who has not been in  trouble with the law, which includes not having had any trouble  with security or defense.  <H5>  Supported </H5>   At the same time, Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the board of  the Bakrie Group, told KOMPAS last week that he supports the  criteria for a candidate for KADIN's general chairman set by  KADIN's MP. Given these criteria, he thinks that the head of  KADIN will be very entrepreneurial. "With these criteria we will  get good KADIN leadership because I think that any head of KADIN  who fulfills these criteria will understand the ins and outs of  the business world," he said.</p>

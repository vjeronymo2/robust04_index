			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Kravchuk seeks tailored debt deal PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday proposed convening an international conference to arrange payment of its share of former Soviet debt, and hiring a western bank to act as debt manager. At the end of a 24-hour official visit to Germany, the Ukrainian leader failed to give the Bonn government the assurances it was seeking that he would sign the international memorandum of understanding on servicing outstanding Soviet debt. The memorandum was negotiated by the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states, with eight of the former Soviet republics. He insisted that he did not trust any former Soviet bank, such as Vnesheconombank, which is being used by the other republics to service the old debts, last estimated at more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33.1bn). 'The Soviet Union no longer exists, and Vnesheconombank is bankrupt,' he said. German government sources indicated last night that they were disappointed at the failure to reach any agreement on the debt question. Without such a deal Germany is not prepared to back Ukraine's membership of the International Monetary Fund, nor guarantee any new export credits. On the other hand, Mr Kravchuk did give Chancellor Helmut Kohl two assurances designed to put his relations with Germany on a firmer footing. He spelt out in some detail how he intended to make Ukraine a nuclear-weapon free nation, and he promised to resettle up to 400,000 so-called Soviet Germans, descended from families expelled from the republic by Stalin during the Second World War. He confirmed that Ukraine's planned national army would have a maximum strength of 220,000, 'only half that of France', and that all tactical nuclear missiles would be withdrawn by July. All strategic weapons would be removed by 1994, he said. However it is debt which remains the main bone of contention. Mr Kravchuk does not dispute Ukraine's responsibility for just over 16 per cent of the former Soviet Union's debts, but he is not prepared to go along with the rest of the republics with a common solution to deal with it. He said he would call a conference early in the year where 'corrections' in servicing the debt could be agreed with creditors. 'I can say I have no trust in the former Soviet banks, and therefore we would propose that for example these debts should be paid back through a west European bank, which would manage them,' he said. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, made it clear he would rather Ukraine sign the common memorandum of understanding. 'It would be much easier for the process if the successor republics had a common line,' a German official said later. 'Signing the memorandum of understanding is important for further contacts.' Mr Waigel and Mr Kravchuk agreed that experts from both sides would meet in the near future to discuss the debt problem further.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE  </P> <P> Cartoonist Jim Unger is taking a two-month leave of absence from his popular  comic strip "Herman" for health reasons. During Unger's hiatus, the Universal  Press Syndicate will distribute "classic releases of the panel in both its  daily and Sunday formats," starting Monday. A one-panel strip with no recurring  characters that depicts a skewed world of dumpy people, whiny little kids and  obnoxious pets, "Herman" has twice been named "Best Panel Comic Strip" by the  National Cartoonists' Society. "Herman" debuted in 1974 and currently appears  in 400 newspapers in 24 countries, including the Los Angeles Times. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

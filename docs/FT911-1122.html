			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Gonzalez warns UK of shadow cast by Gibraltar impasse A 'desirable easy relationship' between Britain and Spain will be difficult to establish as long as the Gibraltar problem remains unsolved, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, warned last night in London. The premier said at a dinner in his honour at No 10 Downing Street that 'bilateral, as well as Community and multilateral relations are affected by this problem, a hold-over from history'. Mr Gonzalez recognised that the opinion of Gibraltarians had to be considered in any solution but he appealed to the British government not to take only their wishes into account. 'Perhaps it is up to the UK, in view of its special relationship with its colony, to make an effort of imagination. We are willing, as always, to help in this task,' he said. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Gonzalez, who is paying the first official visit to Britain by a Spanish premier since General Franco died in 1975, had earlier held talks on mainly European Community problems. Their talks were described by Mr Major as 'very friendly and constructive'. They had discussed at some length the proposal for European economic and monetary union: the British and Spanish proposals for a hard Ecu, or a hardening of the Ecu basket, were similar, Mr Major said. 'We have neither of us given specific support to the other's proposal, but we are very close on the principles of how we must go ahead on economic and monetary union (Emu).' In his speech at No 10, Mr Gonzalez underlined the need for careful planning of Emu and warned against pushing ahead too fast, which would 'endanger the final result'. He also stressed that economic and monetary union must be complemented by a common foreign and security policy. David Gardner adds from Brussels: Spain's call for an equalising budgetary fund to redistribute wealth towards the EC's four poorest members could lead to failure of the current negotiations on economic, monetary and political union. This was the clear message from five of Madrid's partners at this week's meeting of the intergovernmental conference on political union. Delegates from the Netherlands, the UK, France, Germany and Denmark told their Spanish colleagues that if they made their support for EMU and political union conditional on more cash to help the poorest nations catch up, then the negotiations on treaty changes would founder. Unanimous agreement is required for such changes.</p>

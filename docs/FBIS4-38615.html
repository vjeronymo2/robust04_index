			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb June 1 TASS -- Moscow thinks that June should  become the "major" month in the achievement of Bosnian peace  settlement and, possibly, the solution of the whole set of  Yugoslav problems, special representative of the Russian  president Vitaliy Churkin told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview  here on Tuesday.    "We plan and, I think, will soon work on a possibility of  another meeting of foreign ministers. There is common  understanding that this meeting should be held at the Russian  representation in Geneva," he said.    "State leaders are interested in the initiative of President  Boris Yeltsin to hold a special summit on Bosnian settlement.  If this summit is not held till mid-June, the Yugoslav problems  will be discussed at the Naples meeting of the G7 to be for the  first time held as a meeting of the `political eight' with  fully-fledged Russian participation in political discussions.  This is an opportunity that cannot be missed," said Churkin.</p>

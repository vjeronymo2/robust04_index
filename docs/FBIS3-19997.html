Moellemann Says He Is Still Thinking About It; A Run for  the FDP Presidium Is Risky"]    [Text] Bonn, 11 Mar--The former Federal Minister for  Economics Moellemann is preparing his ascent in the FDP [Free  Democratic Party] leadership. At the present time, the North  Rhine-Westphalia Land chairman is conducting talks with other  land associations of the FDP and with members of the FDP  Presidium to clarify his prospects of being elected into the  leading circle at the national party congress in Rostock at the  beginning of June. The Presidium position of Carola von Braun,  who had to resign from the land chairmanship in Berlin after the  "Figaro-Affair," must be filled. Moellemann is aiming in this  direction and has let this be known. He previously belonged to  the Presidium not as an elected member, but on the basis of his  ministerial offices. His election to the broader national board  was always more or less close. A year after his resignation as  minister for economics, he now obviously sees the chance to  benefit from a kind of reparation bonus. A timely place in the  Presidium before the Bundestag electon could improve his  prospects for something beyond that. Between 1991 and the  beginning of 1993, Moellemann was considered to be a candidate  for the chairmanship of the FDP. Most recently he has  increasingly advocated an independent course for the FDP and  differentiation from the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union]. Moellemann favors the election of  the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate Rau as  federal president in May.    Moellemann told this newspaper on Friday [11 March] that he  has not yet decided, because until now he has "not spoken  definitively with everyone." A conversation with parliamentary  group chairman Solms has not yet taken place, because he has  been too busy with the nursing care insurance. "I have informed  party chairman Kinkel that I am considering it but have not yet  decided." Moellemann said that he asked Rhineland-Palatinate  Land Chairman Bruederle, who is economic minister in the Mainz  coalition government under Scharping, about his intentions.  Moellemann let it be known that he suggested to Bruederle that  he be a candidate for the Presidium. But he answered that  Moellemann should run. Bruederle referred to the fact that he  had spoken with many FDP politicians and thereby mentioned that  it is generally considered better for Moellemann to be in the  Presidium than outside. Moellemann expressed his criticism of  the composition of the leadership circle with the remark: "The  Presidium can be strengthened." Moellemann first wants to wait  and see whether and which other candidates will declare  themselves. There is yet time until July. Before that he wants  to concentrate on the fight in his land association. A land  party congress in April will reelect the FDP leadership in North  Rhine-Westphalia; the land list for the Bundestag election must  be presented by the end of May. Sixteen of the 17 Bundestag  deputies from North Rhine-Westphalia and two other candidates  are competing for the at best 12 somewhat secure places on the  list.  <H5>  Unity Through Tactics </H5>   Moellemann is still annoyed with Kinkel about the events in  the selection of the new Education Minister Laermann. Weeks ago  Moellemann had indicated that he was "flabbergasted" over the  fact that Kinkel and Solms had reduced the FDP from 12 to 5 to 7  percent after the election of the chairman last June and were  nevertheless damaging "the largest battalions"--the Duesseldorf  land association. He is upset with Kinkel for maintaining the  "inaccurate" portrayal that after the resignation of Education  Minister Ortleb the chairman had asked him whether he wanted to  return only as a "gesture of courtesy." Nevertheless Moellemann  signaled a truce on Friday: "I have no desire to keep on  fighting with Kinkel." Because of the upcoming elections, the  matter is becoming "too serious for the FDP." They must combine  their forces, for there is no other way. Accordingly, he will  probably keep his opinions about Kinkel to himself after the  election Sunday [13 March] in Lower Saxony.    Despite the disturbed relationship between Kinkel and the  restless Moellemann, the party chairman appears to be convinced  that in the election year neither of the two will allow himself  to be played against the other. Solidarity is also a wise tactic  for Moellemann at this time, because otherwise reverses for the  FDP could be attributed to the obstructionist. Kinkel is  obviously inclined to the view that it is more beneficial to tie  the chairman of the large land association to decisions of the  FDP Presidium. Possibly Kinkel sees this as the lesser evil in  comparison with a constant source of trouble. Other members of  the leadership, on the other hand, are alarmed or at least  uncomfortable with the fact that Moellemann is about to build a  pedestal for appearances as an "antipope." In the end, no one  will dare to oppose Moellemann's candidacy if Kinkel is for it.    Still, they are saying that "Moellemann must guard against  hearing a call from the party that is not coming at all." But  many are aware of Moellemann's organizational abilities, so that  the warning sounds defensive. In the Bundestag group, Moellemann  has gotten on the nerves of several deputies with his constant  attacks against the "incompetent" Finance Minister Waigel (CSU).  "Once again, we hear the entire national economic expertise,"  the people said derisively when Moellemann got going. Moellemann  has realized more and more that he cannot change much with  criticism from the outside; it would be easier in the party  Presidium. But the game is full of dangers. It is said in the  FDP: "A failure at the party congress would set Moellemann's  ambitions back several lengths." On the other hand, they are  making this prediction: "If there is no opposing candidacy to  Moellemann in Rostock, that means a farther-reaching signal to  the executive level." Experienced members of the leadership are  saying: "If Kinkel says that he wants Moellemann's candidacy and  others say that they cannot oppose him, then it will be  difficult to predict the voting behavior of the delegates to the  party congress in a mixture of feeling and intellect; it is one  thing if the leadership recommends something but another thing  whether the delegates will act accordingly."    Until now the vacancy in the Presidium has been attributed  to  women and possible east Germans. The east Berliner Frau Paetzold  occupied the spot and then lost it to Carola von Braun from all  of Berlin. Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger now has  bad cards; if she were to compete for the position, people would  probably say that she is already in the Presidium because of her  office. Wagner, the chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in  Hesse, was defeated by Frau von Braun in 1991. Frau Wagner would  likely have little chance now, because there are already two  people from Hesse in the leadership body: the deputy chairman  Gerhardt and treasury's Solms. It is considered conceivable that  the deputy chairman of the Bundestag group, Weng, is thinking  about whether he should run against Moellemann. For Weng,  however, it may well be more important to plan to succeed  Cronenberg, the vice president of the Bundestag, after the  Bundestag election.    If Kinkel were to want someone other than Moellemann in the  Presidium--there is already a search among east German women--he  would have to use his influence as chairman early. But that is  considered unlikely; many consider Kinkel to be too unsteady and  too weak for this. Little doubt is being expressed about  Moellemann's talents; but it is said that too frequently he  employs them for himself only. This is the impression that  Moellemann has to fight against; but he can also count on the  FDP needing him. Bearing in mind the poor results so far in the  elections for the executive board and his reputation, his game  is risky for Rostock but the view to what comes later makes the  effort worthwhile for him.</p>

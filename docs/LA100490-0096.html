			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> BINGO IS OUTLAWED AFTER 7 1/2 YEARS OF CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> An ordinance outlawing bingo in Cudahy received final approval from the City  Council this week and will go into effect immediately.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 Monday night to repeal a 1983 ordinance that allowed  bingo for charitable purposes.  </P> <P> The issue of how the games should be played has become too politicized, city  officials said. Councilman John Robertson voted against the repeal.  </P> <P> Currently no organization is sponsoring bingo games in Cudahy, and city leaders  said that although several attempts have been made to start new games, none  have succeeded.  </P> <P> In a report to the council, City Manager Jack Joseph said the intent of the  original bingo ordinance that allowed games as fund-raising activities for  nonprofit organizations had been undermined.  </P> <P> "The ordinance has been used to justify attempts to institute large commercial  bingo establishments," Joseph told the council. "Members of organizations  seeking to play bingo have on two or three occasions launched recall drives  against City Council members."  </P> <P> In short, Joseph said, "the 7 1/2-year history of bingo in the city of Cudahy  has been one of controversy, political maneuvering and general unpleasantness,  but no bingo."  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Cambodian hostages 'dead' A Cambodian who had spent two months translating for three Westerners held hostage by the Khmer Rouge said yesterday they were killed last month by a mortar round while on their way to be ransomed. Earlier, in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said he had credible but unconfirmed reports that the Australian, Frenchman and Briton had been killed by a commander of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group. Australian David Wilson, 29, Briton Mark Slater, 26, and Frenchman Jean Michel Braquet, 27 were seized on July 26 in an attack on a train in southern Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge had demanded Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 93,700) for their release. The translator, Mr Hem Nen, said that a week after the transfer was to have taken place, guerrillas coming back from the front lines told him the hostages had been killed. 'I investigated and the exact information is that the three hostages died,' Hem Nen said. 'But I don't know where they put the bodies. I didn't dare to ask them.' In London, a British Foreign Office spokesman said there was no proof of the hostages' deaths; the UK government was doing its utmost to establish the facts.</p>

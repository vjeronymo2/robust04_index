			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROSEN, PENNARIO TEAM AT COLEMAM CONCERTS  </P> <P> Cellist Nathaniel Rosen and pianist Leonard Pennario offered a fascinating  study in contrasts at their Coleman Chamber Concerts appearance in Beckman  Auditorium at Caltech.  </P> <P> Playing three great cello sonatas (Beethoven's G-minor, Opus 5, Debussy's and  Rachmaninoff's), the duo expressed highly individual concepts of each  composition while maintaining generally tidy ensemble and total musical  integrity Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> Rosen has developed into a genuine showman while sacrificing nothing of lofty  artistic purpose. His visual theatrics flow directly from the music, neither  overpowering nor trivializing it. He produces the aural goods, to order and  without disorder, that justify the heart-on-sleeve emoting. This was  grand-manner cello playing.  </P> <P> Pennario, on the other hand, parked his familiar dazzle somewhere else for this  occasion, serving instead as the most discreet of collaborators. This approach  -- piano as foil to the cello's diamond -- worked well enough except for those  passages where the pianist was plainly too deferential.  </P> <P> Beethoven's G-minor Sonata (composed in 1796) emerged as an absorbing  conundrum, the same piece played two different ways simultaneously: Pennario's  pristine, rather faceless Classical-period delineation alongside Rosen's  emphasis on elements presaging the Romantic era. The breakneck clip of the  final Allegro found Pennario having trouble articulating runs, Rosen sailing  through with nimble nonchalance.  </P> <P> Debussy's sonata was splendidly served both by the pianist's almost obstinate  restraint and the cellist's flamboyant eloquence.  </P> <P> Rosen met every demand of the blowzy Rachmaninoff with lustrous tone  (unaffected by tempo extremes), abandoned bravura and heart-rending, songful  legato, seconded by Pennario's secure virtuosity.  </P> <P> Encores: Chopin's E-flat Largo, soulfully limned, and the Scherzo of the  Prokofiev Sonata, a romp for both artists.

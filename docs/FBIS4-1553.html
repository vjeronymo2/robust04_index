			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent Wang Bixue (3769 3024 1331) </F> and XINHUA correspondent Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- Relevant departments--  including the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security--called a  joint teleconference this afternoon to make special arrangements  for cracking down on such criminal activities as theft and  sabotage of railway, oilfield, power, and communications  equipment and facilities. State Councillor and State Council  Secretary General Luo Gan attended and spoke at the meeting.    Criminal activities such as theft and sabotage of railway,  oilfield, power, and communications equipment and facilities  have become rampant in recent years. Incomplete statistics for  1993 compiled by the Departments of Railways, Power, Posts and  Telecommunications, and Petroleum show that the number of cases  involving theft and sabotage of railway, power, communications,  and petroleum equipment totalled over 19,600; that over 3.67  million meters of electric wire, cable, power transmission line,  telecommunications line, electric pump cable, and power-driven  cable were stolen; and that over 36,000 pieces of materials from  power transmission towers, as well as 830,000 meters of oil pump  levers, were stolen, resulting in a direct economic loss of 319  million yuan. These criminal acts have seriously disrupted the  social order, have affected the state's economic construction  and national defense building, and have resulted in a great loss  in state property and people's lives.    Participants in the meeting called on local public security  organs to increase the work of investigating and cracking such  cases, to carry out indepth investigation and study to determine  major regions where crackdowns are to be carried out, and to  strive to crack a number of major cases with great impact on  society in a short time. They also called on public security  organs to enhance coordination with courts and procuratorates;  to resolutely implement the policy of swiftly and severely  cracking down on criminal activities according to law; and to  mete out severe punishments to thieves, to those who receive and  sell stolen goods, and to key members of theft rings who create  major losses to industrial and agricultural production as well  as to national defense building.    Participants in the meeting also stressed that those who  steal and sabotage military communications equipment, railway  and power facilities, and other important production equipment  should never be let off lightly in view of the serious  consequences of their acts and of the great impact they have on  society. The phenomenon of imposing a fine instead of meting  out a prison term should be resolutely rectified, and the  practice of giving verbal admonishment instead of inflicting  penalties should be strictly forbidden.    Luo Gan spoke at the meeting. He said railways, oil, power,  and communications are the state's basic industries, occupying a  decisive position in national economic construction. A high  degree of importance should be attached to the development of,  and security guarantees should be provided to, these industries  since they have a bearing on the national economy and the  people's livelihood as well as on the overall situation of  reform and opening up. He called on relevant departments to  make close coordination, to cooperate with each other, and to  make the utmost efforts to achieve success in the struggle  against the theft of state property.    Departments and units also attending today's joint  teleconference included the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry  of Power Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,  the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, and the China National Petroleum  Corporation.</p>

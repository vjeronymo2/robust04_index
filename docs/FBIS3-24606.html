Bogomolets, Ukrainian SSR  Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 611.018.1:611.82.013:612.085.2]    [Abstract] The distribution and quantity of the main  cytoskeleton proteins (actin, tubulin, neurofilamentous protein  of molecular weight 160 kDa, and glial fibrillar acid protein)  were studied by means of monoclonal antibodies (fluorescein  isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-labelled) in various types of  mouse embryo spinal cord cells cultured in monolayers. During  the process of neuron development, tubulin moved from the  neuronal soma into its processes. Tubulin's concentration varied  among the processes. The authors hypothesized that the processes  with higher tubulin concentration were more functionally active  at those particular stages of differentiation. The total amount  of tubulin should remain constant during a neuron's lifetime,  however. The quantity and distribution of actin filaments in  different types of cells varied. The actin content in neurons  was lower than in glial cells and fibroblasts. Most of the  protein (neurofilamentous, glial fibrillar acid protein) was  concentrated in cell bodies and in proximal parts of the  processes. The cytoskeleton protein distribution pattern in  spinal cord cells was identified. Figures 4; references 17: 5  Russian, 12 Western.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Linread recovers to more than Pounds 1m in 'tough market' LINREAD, the Birmingham-based maker of fasteners and components for the motor and aviation industries, has recovered from the financial doldrums in which it has languished since the second half of 1990. It announced pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 of Pounds 1.05m, compared with losses of Pounds 1.37m struck after restructuring and closure costs of Pounds 1.5m, and a full year deficit of Pounds 2.2m. That translated into earnings per share of 5.62p (losses of 6.91p). 'The market place is tough,' said Mr Peter Tahany, chairman, and it will remain so for the next 18 months. Turnover slipped from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 20m. The interim dividend is 1.5p, against 2p in the comparable half-year and a total 1991 distribution of 3.5p. Recovery owed more to the elimination of loss-making business and rationalisation started last year than to any strengthening of demand from the motor and aviation industries. Although the search continued for higher productivity, to relieve the pressure on margins, the main cost-cutting programme had been completed. Sale of surplus property provided a net Pounds 331,000 to boost profits and to strengthen the balance sheet. This factor, combined with tighter control of working capital, helped to reduce gearing from 59 per cent to 44 per cent.</p>

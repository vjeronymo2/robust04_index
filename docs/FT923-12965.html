			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Proudfoot value drops 17.5% as shares change hands THE MARKET value of Alexander Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-listed management consultant, dropped 17.5 per cent yesterday after a large block of shares changed hands below the market price and amid continuing uncertainty following a management shake-up. The shares dropped 41p to 194p, their lowest since 1987, after 1.2m went through the market at 200p early yesterday. Collins Stewart, the company's joint broker, was believed to have handled the transaction. Analysts have marked down profit forecasts for this year following a cautious trading statement issued late on Monday, when the company also announced the resignation of Mr Thomas Huhn, chief executive officer. Mr Huhn sold nearly all his shares last year and at April 7 held only 50,000 shares via a family trust. Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, yesterday held a series of meetings with institutions. The company has been criticised for not telling the market sooner that trading was tough. 'I've been assuring institutions that while things have not improved in our markets, the company remains strongly cash positive,' he said. The company held net cash of Pounds 21m at the end of last year, enough to pay out nearly two years of dividends. But following yesterday's price fall, the shares are yielding over 12 per cent. The shares have fallen ever since the preliminary results were announced, when they stood at 369p. Since then, former majority shareholder Invesco MIM sold its remaining stake. Mr Huhn's sudden departure has added to the market's confusion. An internal review of the company's strategy was completed late last week and made no mention of senior executive changes. Following a private meeting on Monday with Lord Stevens, chairman of Proudfoot and Invesco MIM, Mr Huhn resigned without warning. He is being replaced by a management committee of Mr Hamilton and three others, all based in the US. Mr Hamilton said the new structure is similar to that used when the company was private, before it reversed into City and Foreign Holdings in 1987.</p>

"We are seeing some movement" from the various parties  involved in the conflict, Stoltenberg said, referring to an  agreement by the Serbs to reopen the airport in the besieged  northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla and to a Moslem-Croat accord  to form a federation. He said these "developments could be  important for further negotiations" and "prove it is absolutely  necessary that the European Union, the United States and Russia  cooperate on this difficult issue." Stoltenberg said he would  soon be heading back to Geneva to monitor developments in Bosnia.    His counterpart for the European Union, Lord Owen, meanwhile  said in Geneva that it would be unreasonable for Europe to feel  sidelined because of the U.S.-brokered Moslem-Croat pact.    "I do not think it is sensible in Europe to feel any sense  of  anxiety, frustration or a feeling of being set aside. This is  something that the European Union has been urging the United  States to do as long as I remember," he told journalists.    Owen said: "In the first instance it seems that the most  important thing to do is for the Americans to carry forward  their initiative in the meetings that are planned to start on  Friday in Vienna and are hoped to end on the 15th which is to  tie down all the details of the Croat-Moslem federation and the  wider confederation between Croatia and the federation."    The European negotiator said he felt it would be a "great  mistake" to see this development as one "against the interest of  the Bosnian Serbs."</p>

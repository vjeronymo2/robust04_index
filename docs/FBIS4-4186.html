			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Kenya President Daniel  arap Moi has said that relations between Kenya and China are  excellent.    In a exclusive interview with XINHUA and China Radio  International before his third state visit to China scheduled  for next Tuesday [3 May], President arap Moi said Kenya and  China are cooperating very well with each other in domains such  as politics, education, culture, economy and trade.    He highly commended the Chinese personnel in various  projects  in Kenya for their hard but enthusiastic work.    President arap Moi said that Kenya in Africa is far from  China in Asia, but they are both developing countries, and are  facing the common tasks that all developing countries are facing.    He rapped the press in Western developed countries over  ignoring to report various development in Third World countries.  Instead, he said, they attack them on the so-called  human-rights issue which was a gross distortion of facts.    He warned the Western media not to create unrest in  developing countries by using the stick of human-rights.    Referring to the problems the developing countries are  facing, President arap Moi said that the main issues in the  present world are peace and development, adding that where there  is no peace, there is no development. He said that the big  threat to peace in Third World countries is poverty which is the  main root to cause turmoil in those countries.    He appeal to the developing countries, particularly African  countries to intensify the South-South cooperation and exploit  their own resources for development.    Recalling the previous visits in 1980 and 1988, he said he  was very much impressed by the Chinese economic development. He  hoped that the coming visit would further promote friendly  cooperation between Kenya and China in various domains.</p>

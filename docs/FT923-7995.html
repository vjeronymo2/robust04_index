			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Names step up campaign THE Society of Names, an umbrella group of dissatisfied loss-making Names at Lloyd's, is stepping up its campaign for an 'independent and enlightened outsider' to become chairman of the insurance market. The society, which was formed last year by Mr Tom Benyon, the former Conservative MP for Abingdon, is being supported in the initiative by the leaders of 13 action groups of Lloyd's Names. The society is highly critical of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names, the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital base. Yesterday Mr John Rew, society chairman, criticised plans to appoint Mr David Rowland, the chairman of brokers Sedgwick, as chairman of the insurance market. 'Rowland is an insider. Lloyd's has to have a major refinancing and for that the new chairman must be an enlightened outsider,' said Mr Rew. Mr Rew, the co-editor of Chatset Lloyd's League Tables, the statistical guide to the market, took over as leader of the group from Mr Benyon earlier this month. Mr Benyon called for the market's present chairman, Mr David Coleridge, to 'resign forthwith' instead of at the end of the year as is planned. He also called on other members of the council, Lloyd's ruling body, to resign.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Fourth mobile phone network to be launched Hutchison Microtel yesterday confirmed that it would be launching a cellular mobile network next month and announced that it would be called 'Orange'. The network will be the UK's fourth, competing against Vodafone, Cellnet and Mercury One-2-One, which was launched within the M25 area last September. Microtel chose the name in an effort to conjure up the image of cellular communications as 'fresh, attractive, and not impossibly complicated to use'. Microtel, whose largest shareholder is Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate, refused to disclose the Orange tariffs yesterday, but said they would be 'highly competitive' with those of existing networks. The launch of One-2-One last year, with free local calls on weekday evenings and at weekends, is widely credited with ensuring the breakthrough of cellular mobile telephony into the consumer market. The Orange network is based on the same technology as One-2-One, but it will be more extensive at launch. It will cover more than half of the UK's population initially, extending to 90 per cent by mid-1995. One-2-One's network is limited to south-east England, although it is being ex-panded. The Orange network will be digital, as is One-2-One. The handsets are likely to be more expensive than those for the analogue networks run by Vodafone and Cellnet, but Orange is likely to compensate with cheaper operating charges. There has been much speculation that Hutchison Whampoa has tried to sell Microtel, in which it has invested more than Pounds 700m. Last year the conglomerate announced its intention to reduce its telecommunications operations outside Hong Kong, and closed its unsuccessful Rabbit telepoint venture in the UK. Lex, Page 20</p>

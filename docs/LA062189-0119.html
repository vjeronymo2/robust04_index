			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SUES REGULATORS FOR $768 MILLION OVER LINCOLN SEIZURE,  LEAKS  </P> <P> The parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan filed court documents Tuesday  accusing a high-ranking regulatory official of illegally leaking damaging  information about the Irvine-based thrift to reporters and others.  </P> <P> In addition, an amended complaint and a new lawsuit filed by American  Continental Corp. of Phoenix seek a total of $768 million in damages from  government defendants, including $568 million for the wrongful confiscation of  Lincoln by federal regulators.  </P> <P> In the amended suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, American  Continental claims that Darrel W. Dochow of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board  was among a number of regulators who illegally disclosed "highly confidential  and inaccurate information" about Lincoln.  </P> <P> Tuesday's filings are part of an intensifying courtroom battle over control of  Lincoln Savings and the financial future of American Continental, its parent  company.  </P> <P> The Phoenix suit was amended to streamline allegations and to add Dochow as a  defendant. Other regulators, not yet named, will be added as their identity is  determined, the suit said.  </P> <P> The new lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Claims Court in Washington, D.C., claims the  government seized private property -- Lincoln Savings -- without just  compensation in violation of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution.  </P> <P> Dochow, director of the bank board's Office of Regulatory Affairs, and other  bank board executives could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> American Continental, headquartered in Phoenix, filed a petition on April 13 to  protect itself from creditors while it tries to reorganize its debts under  Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. The bank board seized Lincoln the  next day, saying the company was operating it unsafely and dissipating its $5.3  billion in assets.  </P> <P> American Continental's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., has maintained that  regulators illegally leaked confidential information in a vendetta against his  company and Lincoln. Keating has claimed that government officials resented his  vocal opposition to new rules limiting the kinds of investments S&amp;Ls can  make.  </P> <P> In announcing Tuesday's legal actions, Keating said in a prepared statement  that the "improper leaks" damaged and continue to damage Lincoln and American  Continental by contributing to a loss of deposits, decreased market value for  American Continental stock and the "termination or impairment of important  banking and other business relationships."  </P> <P> In the amended suit filed in Phoenix, American Continental seeks $200 million  in compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful leaks and injunctions against  further leaks and other violations by the bank board.  </P> <P> The suit claims that Dochow was the "unidentified regulatory official" who was  quoted in a news report in March as saying that "Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  must be sold quickly or it will be seized."  </P> <P> That comment caused a "serious run" on Lincoln's deposits, the suit said.  Company officials have said previously that depositors withdrew $70 million in  the days following that report, and Keating said total deposits have plummeted  by $400 million since regulators seized it.  </P> <P> The suit also accuses the bank board of violating its own rules by using Kevin  O'Connell, an examiner who was allegedly biased against Lincoln, in its  investigation of the S&amp;L. His father, William, severely criticized  Lincoln's operations while he was head of an S&amp;L trade group, the suit  contends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Violation Claimed  </P> <P> In the new suit filed in Washington, American Continental is seeking $568  million in damages resulting from the seizure of Lincoln. The suit claims the  bank board violated a 1988 agreement between Lincoln and regulators over how  the agency would conduct a new examination of the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> The suit is in addition to a previous one filed there that seeks to overturn  the conservatorship imposed by regulators and to return control of the S&amp;L  to the company.  </P></p>

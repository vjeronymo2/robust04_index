			<p>CSO     [Text] MAS Secretary General Freddy Munoz admits that his  political organization has made mistakes and believes this was  one factor preventing the party from winning the majority  backing of Venezuelans dissatisfied with the policies of the  most recent administrations.    Nevertheless, Munoz expresses faith in the possibility of a  profound change in MAS that will restore the party to its  leading role in society. Despite his recognition that MAS did  not win most of the votes cast by persons disillusioned with  Democratic Action and Copei, he says it is absurd to claim that  the party suffered a defeat in the elections held on 5 December  1993.    "The most relevant result of the most recent elections was  the victory of Rafael Caldera, and our party made a significant  contribution to that success," Munoz argues.    Nevertheless, he admits that the victory did not have any  substantial carryover in terms of MAS's election results.    Examining the reasons why progress of the Movement Toward  Socialism was "modest," he concludes that this force "was not  perceived as a distinct alternative to AD and Copei."    Munoz generally attributes this fact to errors in the  adoption of certain lines. He cites the case of 4 February 1992,  when Socialist leaders "failed to tell the truth expressed by  Caldera concerning the following points: the circumstances under  which the coup occurred and the impact which Carlos Andres  Perez's disastrous government had on all of this."    Munoz believes that the line taken by MAS may possibly be  explained by distortions occurring in the party in recent years.    "These deviations were the result of influence exerted on  our  organization by certain ideas, values, and habits that are  characteristic of the dominant political forces," Munoz says.    He concludes that the eradication of such distortions is  essential if the Movement Toward Socialism is to take its  rightful place as a political alternative in Venezuela.    All in all, he believes that a number of MAS leaders  exaggerate when they claim that the party's flaws are its main  feature or its common denominator.    "I naturally bear unavoidable responsibility for mistakes  made by the leadership over the past eight years," he says, "but  what about the undeniable progress which MAS has made during my  term as secretary general?"    Munoz suggests launching a debate concerning the  transformation of the party. "The overall record is positive,  but it is not sufficient to meet the great challenges that we  face."    Munoz appealed for reform of the organization. Emphasizing  "major limitations that have created a need for profound  change," he recommends reviewing MAS's relationship to society  and its capacity to make changes in its thought and internal  life.    With respect to the Movement Toward Socialism's position on  the government of President Rafael Caldera, he stresses that it  should be guided by the principles of solidarity and autonomy.  "This means loyalty to commitments shared and making the  people's interests the top priority."</p>

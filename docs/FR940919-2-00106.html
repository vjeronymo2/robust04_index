			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the new process, SSA will continue to have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for monitoring representational activity and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguarding the interests of claimants. The new process will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish rules of representation and standards of conduct to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that representatives fulfill their responsibilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve the needs of the claimants they represent. These new rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will, among other things, ensure that claimants receive competent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation; establish a code of professional conduct for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives in all matters before SSA; and provide sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against representatives, including suspension and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disqualification from appearing before the Agency in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative capacity, for violating the rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation and standards of conduct. Without disturbing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory intent of facilitating claimant access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives, the simplified and user-friendly new process may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well result in more claimants pursuing their claims without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation. However, the issue of representation will remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a matter of a claimant's personal choice. The new rules and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of conduct provide the framework for assuring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives claimants retain will be qualified, will have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to fully develop the record on their behalf, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately represent their interests, and will be accountable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misconduct or dereliction of duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will also conduct outreach efforts with the legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community, to ensure that information about the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs is widely available to the organized bar and the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judiciary. Policy documents, regularly updated electronically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and rules of representation will be available at forums sponsored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the organized bar and in initial orientation and continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal education programs designed for Federal judges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Information Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information technology will be a vital element in the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim process. To the fullest extent possible, SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take advantage of the ``Information Highway'' and those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological advances that can improve the disability process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and help provide world-class service. The new process will rely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on seamless, electronic processing of disability claims from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first contact with the claimant to the final decision, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all levels of administrative appeal. Existing Agency design plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Intelligent Workstation/Local Area Network (IWS/LAN) and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modernized Disability System will provide an integrated system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the electronic connectivity necessary to support the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a seamless electronic environment, all employees will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same hardware, the same claim assignment and scheduling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software, the same decision support software, the same case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system, the same fiscal and accounting software, the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated quality assurance functionality, and the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management information system throughout all stages of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. In this environment, data will need to be input and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validated once and multiple employees may access a single claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record simultaneously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information technology will be applied to enhance access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services by claimants, their representatives, and other third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties. Claimants will be able to conduct business with SSA via  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone, self-help workstations, kiosks, videoconferencing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic data transfer at SSA facilities and other satellite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations. SSA will conduct forums and produce video and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer-based training materials for third parties who wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in assisting claimants to file applications and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gather medical evidence. Wherever possible, physicians and health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care organizations, advocates, community counseling services, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other professionals who regularly provide assistance to SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants will be supplied with SSA software to electronically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete Agency forms. Data will be transferred to SSA using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreed upon methods. SSA will allow authorized representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate access to electronic claim folders. Paper versions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating source forms will be designed so that the data can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> read by scanning equipment into SSA claim processing systems. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single vendor payment system will be used to pay certain evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers for information which they provide SSA. To further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paperless processing, SSA will adopt a ``signature on file'' policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the claimant's evidence release authorization to eliminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routing of paper medical release forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  "prime minister," Yi Hoe-chang, at a "roundtable conversation of  security-related ministers" on March 25 cried for a  "high-intensity alert posture against the North", a "perfect  posture for countermove" and the like and, on the 26th, turned  up at frontline units of the puppet Army and whipped up an  extreme war fever, drivelling that they should be in a full  defence posture to cope with an "emergency", according to a  radio report from Seoul.    Meanwhile, the puppet Army held a "plenary meeting of staff  officers" on March 26 and discussed the question of doing their  utmost to maintain a posture for immediate entry into action".  Such moves are unpardonable criminal acts leading the situation  on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war.    All the developments cleary show that the South Korean  bellicose elements do not want peace and peaceful reunification  of the country but have used the North-South dialogue to gratify  their sinister aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The Kim Yong-sam group can by no means conceal the fact that  it is an anti-national group blocking the dialogue between the  fellow countrymen and trying to inflict the scourge of war upon  the nation with the help of outside forces.    The "civilian" warmaniacs must stop acting rashly, clearly  mindful of what bitter results their war frenzy would bring to  them.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Barclaycard offers rebates to win business Barclaycard is offering rebates of up to Pounds 150 to credit card holders who transfer outstanding debts from other cards. The move by Britain's largest credit card issuer illustrates the increasingly fierce competition in the market. Barclaycard already accounts for one-third of the 27m cards in issue in the UK. Previously, only smaller credit card issuers - especially those trying to break into the UK market - have offered rebates or lower interest rates on balances transferred from another card. Competition in the card market - where spending through credit and debit cards totalled almost Pounds 50bn in 1993 - stepped up noticeably last autumn when Vauxhall Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, launched a British version of the GM card available in the US. Just over 300,000 GM Visa and Mastercards have been issued so far in the UK. Ford then joined forces with Barclaycard to issue a branded card, in what was seen as a direct response to the GM card. It became available from the beginning of this month. Only yesterday, another non-traditional competitor entered the market when Texaco, the oil company, announced it would be issuing a Visa card jointly with the Bank of Scotland. In addition to the new entrants, financial institutions such as Save &amp; Prosper have been trying to expand their existing small customer bases by offering lower interest rates. Clearing bank issuers such as Barclaycard have also lost some business to cards which do not charge an annual fee. Barclaycard's rebate offer, promoted this week in a press advertising campaign, credits a new or existing customer who transfers a balance from another card with 5 per cent of the outstanding balance. The maximum rebate is Pounds 150, which would be paid on transferred balances of Pounds 3,000 or more. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard chief executive, said the cost of the offer was not being subsidised by existing card holders, since it came from within the recruitment budget. Cross-subsidy - the so-called 'free ride' received by customers who pay off their bills each month - was one of the factors cited by banks when they introduced annual fees. The new Texaco Global Visa card will carry no annual fee for the first year. In subsequent years the Pounds 10 charge will be waived if annual spending exceeds Pounds 2,000. The Texaco card's annualised percentage rate of 20.5 per cent is in the lowest quartile for credit card interest rates. Like many cards, including Barclaycard, the Texaco card will have an incentive scheme based on the amount spent. Its use at a Texaco service station will earn double points. Mr Reay-Smith said Barclaycard had no plans to waive its annual fee of Pounds 10, regardless of how much the card was used. He added Barclaycard was not intending to reduce the APR of 20.7 per cent (or 21.9 per cent on average spending when the annual fee is taken into account). Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Technology: Pioneers on the barcode trail - Vanessa Houlder reports on a system that has earned its stripes Barcodes, it seems, have become ubiquitous. The machine-readable panels of black and white stripes are being used to identify everything from newborn babies to pension books. Yet barcodes have drawbacks, notably in the amount of information that can be squeezed on to a label, which is usually restricted to a simple identification number. In an attempt to pack in more data, manufacturers have been working on a new generation of codes which store information in two dimensions. These codes, which are capable of storing information 100 times more densely than their one-dimensional counterparts, have been used in applications ranging from military security passes to labelling parts on the space shuttle. The latest company to announce plans to launch a 2D barcode is Tec (UK), a subsidiary of Toshiba, the Japanese corporation. Its Data Matrix system, which can store up to 2,000 bytes of information per code, will come on to the UK market next month. Its system has little in common with the conventional barcode, in which data is represented by a pattern of bars and spaces, which can be scanned by laser and fed into a computer. The Tec system works by putting raw data into binary code and representing it in the form of dark and light squares in a matrix - creating what looks like a blank crossword puzzle. To decypher the code, a reading machine takes a photograph of the image, which is then decoded. The company believes that the system's potential uses include keeping records for hospital patients, keeping track of components on production lines, and verifying the identity of document holders. A similar system has already been introduced by Veritec, a Calfornian developer. The Veritec system was spotted by Nasa when it was attempting to improve its method of identifying parts in the space shuttle. By marking the Veritec codes directly on parts, Nasa was able to bypass steps where a human would manually transfer serial numbers, thus reducing the risk of human error. Another advantage of the system was that it was suitable for marking very small parts, since the mechanism for reading the code includes a camera with a lens capable of magnifying the image. The technology also stood out by producing marks on delicate components that were capable of being read after being exposed to outer space. A different technology underpins the two-dimensional system designed by Symbol Technologies. Its system, which it describes as a portable data file, consists of a series of codes stacked upon each other. A single code can contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with around 13 on a traditional barcode. The system which was launched commercially two years ago, is being used to mark the uniform of US fire fighters with their identification and medical history. Symbol Technologies has also experimented with marking blood bags with the donor's blood group, the blood's expiry date and centre of origin. The system is being used in security passes by the US Department of Defence and will be used by policemen working at the Conservative party conference in October. Few developers expect the 2D barcode to replace the traditional barcode. The traditional one-dimensional systems are relatively cheap and effective and have already commanded substantial investment. None the less, the champions of 2D codes firmly believe that their technology will open up new applications. 'It is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to barcoding,' believes Brian Marcel, managing director of Bar Code Systems, a UK distributor of Symbol Technology's system. Yet so far, the uptake of 2D barcoding has been relatively slow. The barriers are not due to cost or technology, says Marcel. Rather, the acceptance of 2D systems depends on potential users' vision and willingness to be pioneers, he says. 'No one likes to be first.'</p>

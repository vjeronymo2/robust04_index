			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Federal Mogul to seal TRW deal FEDERAL Mogul, the US vehicle components manufacturer, says that it is to pay Dollars 213m to acquire the automotive aftermarket business of TRW, the US technology group. Federal Mogul also plans to take a Dollars 14m charge in the fourth quarter of 1992 to cover job cuts, relocations and asset disposals connected with the deal, Reuter reports from Detroit. Federal Mogul, which announced the acquisition on August 23, disclosed the information in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Federal Mogul also said that it estimated that total expenses for the rationalisation of the purchase would reach about Dollars 28m. The remaining Dollars 14m which was not taken in the fourth quarter charge would be capitalised, the company declared. The expenses relate to the costs of eliminating duplication between the two companies' aftermarket parts operations in the areas of personnel, warehousing, information management, shipping, marketing and administration. Federal Mogul also said it believed that by eliminating such duplication it could achieve cost savings of about Dollars 21m a year during and after 1995, with about 95 per cent of that figure realised during 1994. The deal for the TRW aftermarket parts distribution business, which has annual sales of more than Dollars 300m, also includes a long-term supply and trademark agreement. That agreement makes Federal Mogul the exclusive supplier of TRW-brand engine and chassis parts to the independent automotive aftermarket business. The transaction is expected to close by the end of October. Federal Mogul said it would finance the acquisition with a combination of equity and bank debt but the company had not determined the amount of each. Chemical Banking had agreed to provide senior bank financing under a term loan, Federal Mogul said.</p>

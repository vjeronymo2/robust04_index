			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Israeli Center Prepares 365 Studies on Islamists    2. Islamists' Activities Highlighted    3. Repentant Extremist's Story Refuted    4. Labor Party Official on Party Policy, Cultural Conflict  <H5>  ISRAELI CENTER PREPARES 365 STUDIES ON ISLAMISTS </H5>   In a 250-word report on page one, AL-SHA'B writes that "the  Israeli Academic Center in Cairo has prepared about 365 studies  on Islamic groups in Egypt, and about 2,567 researchers and  public figures collaborated with the espionage center to prepare  295 field studies, including one on the Labor Party and its  questionable relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood."  <H5>  ISLAMISTS' ACTIVITIES HIGHLIGHTED </H5>   In a 300-word report, 'Adil al-Bahnasawi writes on pages one  and seven that the killing of innocent people in al-Ghana'im in  Asyut Governorate by the security forces has caused "extreme  anger among the people." The writer adds that "until this  incident took place last Sunday evening [27 March], al-Ghana'im  has been outside the circle of this escalating conflict between  the security forces and the Islamic groups."    Another 240-word report by 'Amir 'Id and Khalid Yunis on  pages one and seven notes that "the Islamists scored a sweeping  victory and all their candidates won in the pharmacists union  elections that took place last Tuesday [29 March]."  <H5>  REPENTANT EXTREMIST'S STORY REFUTED </H5>   Under the headline "The Story of the Investigation's Agent  Who has Become a Television Star," AL-SHA'B publishes on pages  one and seven a 950-word report commenting on the television  interview with repentant Islamic extremist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi.  The paper says that according to reports received by AL-SHA'B,  'Abd-al-Baqi "works for the State Security Investigations  Service," was "planted among the Islamists to spy on them and  collect information," and "has never been a leader and has not  recruited 10,000 people as he claimed, but was merely a member  in the al-Shawqiyun group." The paper says that it has  interviewed some of those mentioned by 'Abd-al-Baqi, including  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi who "affirmed that 'Adil 'Abd-  al-Baqi works for the State Security Investigations Service and  that he befriended him and got married to his sister-in-law to  spy on him." Shaykh al-Samawi denies that 'Abd-al-Baqi was his  student in prison or that he instilled in him the idea of  stealing from the rich to spend on members of the group. He  adds that when they both got out of prison, 'Abd-al-Baqi came to  his house to apologize for his ill manners in prison and ask for  forgiveness and to be accepted as a student, promising he would  be a loyal and faithful student and would only get married at  his hands. Shaykh al-Samawi then says: "I was deceived and  thought that he came with a pure heart."   <H5>    LABOR PARTY OFFICIAL ON PARTY POLICY, CULTURAL CONFLICT </H5>   AL-SHA'B features a 3,600-word article on page five by 'Adil  Husayn, former chief editor of AL-SHA'B and Labor Party  secretary general, in which he begins by outlining the party's  dogma.    Husayn says: "Under the banner of God is great, we seek to  mobilize our people against American oppression and the  strategic alliance between the U.S. Administration and the Jews,  which seeks to cause strife among Muslims, humiliate us, and  weaken us militarily, politically, and economically.    "The Labor Party, under the banner of God is great, is  fighting the corrupt and illegal profiteers despite their power  and high positions. God is stronger and higher. Yes, we fight  the corrupt who plunder the nation's resources and hand its keys  to the enemies.    "We resist the sale of national public sector companies to  foreigners and Jews cheaply. We resist injustice, reject  manifestations of luxury, and object to the displacement and  impoverishment of workers and people.    "We reject attempts to cast doubt on Islam and on those who  call for adherence to the Islamic shari'ah under the pretext of  combating extremism and terrorism. We reject the spread of  despotism, torture, indiscriminate killing, military courts, and  death sentences en masse. We loudly declare that these methods  will not end violence but aggravate it.    "All citizens and champions of freedom: You must realize  that if you display indifference and allow the violation of your  rights and sanctities to become a matter of principle and  course, things will not stop with those who oppose the regime by  force. State terrorism will reach anyone who expresses  opposition in words. The current case against the leaders of  the Labor Party and the editors of its newspaper is a prelude to  something worse--all tongues will be cut and full darkness will  prevail.    "The Labor Party is waging a struggle for the sake of God on  various fronts. We ask the sons of this nation to participate  with us in this struggle by joining our party and backing our  policy. We ask them and ourselves to be patient, because God's  victory is near.    "I say to the faithful that we must struggle and prepare the  means for strength and victory, and then leave the rest to God's  will. God's victory is certain to us; He does not violate His  promise. Whether victory comes in our days or at the hands of  those who come after us, we accept His will. But I wrote once  and add today that the signs indicate that today's youths will  witness the day of victory, God willing, if they strengthen  their determination and intensify their efforts. I am not  dreaming or imagining; I follow what is going on around us, in  the Islamic nation and the world, and the facts and developments  confirm the truth of what I am saying."    Husayn then reviews in detail a study by Samuel Huntington  entitled "Is It a Clash Among Cultures?" which notes that the  world is no longer composed of states but of seven or eight  regional cultures. The conflict in the world will continue and  perhaps intensify, not among states but among these cultures.  The study explains how the West can deal with these cultures,  including the Islamic awakening, and maintain its domination.    Husayn emphasizes the need for unity of the Islamic nation  and strengthening of its alliance against the "Western Satan."  He says unity can only be based on obedience to God. "It is  against religion and country to accept the enemies' domination  of our affairs and to befriend them." This is the duty of  believing governments. "But even if there are weak, corrupt, or  unbelieving governments, the people's power can force them to  abide by God's order," he says.    The writer concludes that the Islamic nation can achieve its  goals and face the Western challenge. This, he says, demands  "patience and the ability to continue the struggle and  sacrifice." We are on the offensive in all places to raise the  banner of "there is no God but Allah," and through large  physical and material sacrifices we will achieve victory. But  what is Egypt's role in all this? "It is certain that those who  govern in Egypt have nothing to do with this Islamic awakening.  In fact they are deliberately trying to smother it." But they  will fail. "Do what you like. The day of reckoning is coming.  On our part, we will continue the struggle by legal means to  remove you, O corrupt and impotent ones, so persons who can  restore Egypt to its place at the heart of the Islamic  renaissance will assume control. In this struggle, I do not  think that trials--or anything of the sort--will deter us. It  is a small price that we will pay willingly, hoping that God  will bless us."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Working Group 4 found that ANSI approval of the data sets was not necessary to go forward with ASC X12 implementation, because the information could be mapped to an existing ASC X12 data set. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is the task Gas*Flow will perform. Only one comment suggested that the April 1, 1994, date was too ambitious for ASC X12 implementation. Since the Commission has now extended the implementation date to June 1, 1994, EBB operators should have sufficient time to program their computer systems to make ASC X12 downloads available by that date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Working Group 4 Report at 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ASC X12 downloads must be made available to any party, including a value added network (VAN). A VAN is a communications or information system providing an aggregation, routing, and delivery service. In effect, a VAN provides a user with an electronic mailbox for receiving information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tenneco argues no implementation date for ASC X12 be set, contending implementation should occur when trading partners agree. As the comments suggest, EBB operators need lead time to modify their system to incorporate ASC X12 downloads. The Commission, therefore, concludes it needs to set a date by which ASC X12 downloads will be available to ensure that users wanting this service can obtain it expeditiously. As specified by Working Group 4, the details of any special arrangements for access to ASC X12 data between the pipeline and a trading partner would be worked out between those parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters address the Commission's proposal to use Gas*Flow to prepare the implementation guide. UDC and Tenneco support the use of Gas*Flow, but Tenneco suggests the Gas*Flow documentation should be submitted to the Working Groups prior to submission to the Commission. Columbia Gas believes the Commission's estimate of one month for Gas*Flow to prepare the implementation guide is overly optimistic and provides too little opportunity for the industry to participate in development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission expects Gas*Flow to continue its current procedure of receiving industry comment on its proposed implementation guide and to submit the guide to the Working Groups for their final approval. The extension of the implementation date until June 1, 1994, provides Gas*Flow with sufficient time to obtain industry input and still finalize the implementation guide in time for the industry to meet the June 1, 1994 date. Working Groups 1 and 2 and Gas*Flow should coordinate their efforts to ensure that any additional revisions made by the Working Groups in the data sets are made in sufficient time to ensure that EBB operators can implement the ASC X12 downloads by June 1, 1994. Once the implementation guide is completed, the Commission will include the guide with its data sets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. ASCII downloads.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters contend ASCII downloads are not needed to supplement ASC X12. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  They generally argue mandating a second download in ASCII format is not worth the increased expense and maintain the resources could be better devoted to development of ASC X12. They recommend ASCII downloads should remain a pipeline option, as proposed by Working Group 4. AER/MRT and Northwest, on the other hand, recommend ASCII downloads replace ASC X12, contending that ASCII is less costly, and faster and more efficient to implement than ASC X12 and that their customers prefer ASCII to ASC X12. Others support the Commission's proposal of maintaining ASCII as an adjunct to ASC X12 since some users may not have ASC X12 capability and ASCII would ensure those users could download the data. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Columbia Gas, El Paso (noting software can translate between ASCII and ASC X12); Enron, INGAA (ASC X12 is more comprehensive and ASCII might not be demanded after ASC X12); National (contending EDI software costs only $500), Natural, WEV, and NGSA (customers wanting ASCII should have to pay the costs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Brooklyn Union and Process Gas Consumers Group (but noting ASCII may be of limited value unless software developers or the users themselves develop programs to extract the needed information).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will not substitute ASCII downloads for ASC X12 as suggested by Northwest and AER/MRT. Even if ASCII downloads would be less expensive to prepare initially, as Northwest and AER/MRT contend, the consensus of the industry was to provide for download capability using ASC X12 because it provided significant benefits when compared with downloads using ASCII format. Some of these benefits include the availability of already standardized and well-accepted procedures and the concomitant software and businesses available to implement the technology. The Commission anticipates that, as ASC X12 is more widely used in the gas industry, users will recognize the advantages to using ASC X12, as they have in other industries, and it will become the industry standard for communication. Nevertheless, to ease the transition to ASC X12 for those customers not yet familiar with the ASC X12 technology, the Commission will require EBB operators to provide for downloading capability in a flat ASCII format as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Protocols for Communications Software and Hardware, Access Requirements, and Log-On Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters raise questions about the Commission's proposed protocols relating to the software and modem speeds used to access EBBs, the requirements for obtaining access to EBBs, and the procedures and principles for logging-on to computers. Columbia Distribution argues the Commission's proposed protocols fail to reflect two principles to which the pipelines agreed: the pipelines' recognition of the need to develop a mechanism under which users can log-on to multiple EBBs with one phone call; and their commitment to work in good faith to address other customer concerns, such as log-on procedures, additional file transfer options, and other logistical concerns. IPAA suggests a standardized basic user interface must be developed, as opposed to each pipeline specifying a different communications package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the statements mentioned by Columbia Distribution reflected a goal for future discussions, rather than a consensus on specific procedures or principles, the Commission did not include them in its current protocols. The Commission recognizes that further standardization of access requirements could reduce the burden on users which have to access many pipeline EBBs. But Working Group 4 concluded, from its review of pipeline EBBs, that adoption of one standard communication package for accessing EBBs was made impracticable at this time by the proliferation of different hardware and other operating considerations used by the various pipeline EBBs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Instead, it reached consensus on the principle that each EBB operator must provide a script detailing its log-on procedures which is compatible with the software package used to access the EBB and must provide for file downloads through VANs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission, therefore, will not require further standardization in this area at this time, but will leave any such modifications to the continuing Working Group deliberations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Working Group 4 Report at 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By using a VAN, a user could have files from multiple pipelines delivered to its electronic mailbox, obviating the need to log-on to each of the pipelines' EBBs individually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Columbia Distribution also asserts some pipelines are proposing to make electronic contracting mandatory for certain transactions; it contends electronic contracting raises legal and business practice issues that should be addressed by the Working Groups. Issues regarding electronic contracting are legal and policy concerns that have been addressed in restructuring or other proceedings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and are beyond the scope of this rulemaking, which focuses on technical issues of how to exchange information. The Working Groups have more than enough technical issues to consider, and the expertise of these groups lies in the technical, not policy, arena.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Questar Pipeline Company, 62 FERC &para;61,192 at 62,307&hyph;08, aff'd, 64 FERC &para;61,157 at 62,283&hyph;84 (1993); Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, 65 FERC &para;61,023 slip op. at 90&hyph;93 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

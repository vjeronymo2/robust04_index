			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (4): A blueprint for planners - The view from Brussels DESPITE the raging debate over the legitimate parameters of EC institutions in helping to build the new Europe, their role in assisting balanced economic development across the community is one of the less controversial items on the political agenda. The European Commission readily recognises that its powers to help the construction of an economic bloc in which all nations and regions share equally are limited. But if it is the business community itself which will ultimately prove decisive in efforts to create a universally prosperous Europe, the Commission can nevertheless play a critical enabling role, paving the way for business to do its job. Armed with a reformed network of structural funds, the Commission is stepping up efforts to reduce the wide disparities which still exist across the community. In the past, EC regional policy was basically confined to providing financial help for the implementation of national policies. Now, however, with the completion of the single market, capital and labour can be expected increasingly to locate where the physical and economic environment proves to be the most attractive. As a result, the overall emphasis is to be placed on a balanced and cohesive, community-wide programme of development which will encourage economic investment to take place throughout the EC. Given the growing backlash against the image of a burgeoning, centralised Brussels bureaucracy and the clarion call for more subsidiarity, Brussels is going out of its way to emphasise that it has no intention of assuming the planning functions carried out at member state level. In the words of Mr Bruce Millan, the EC commissioner for regional policy: 'There is no master plan for Europe'. Even so, Brussels claims that there is a pressing need for more systematic co-operation between regional planners at community level and for transport and energy issues to be considered from a regional development point of view. Last year, the Commission published Europe 2000, a blueprint which broke new ground in considering regional planning at the European level. It said it no longer made sense for planning to stop artificially at national borders and that planners needed increasingly to be aware of developments taking place beyond their immediate territory. The figures spelling out the yawning gap in EC economic performance between member states starkly underline the scale of the job to be done before any claims for a balanced economic profile can be substantiated. By 1991, three member states - Greece, Portugal and Ireland - had a per capita gross domestic product below 75 per cent of the EC average. With the per capita income of the 10 lowest-ranking regions running at less than a third of that of the 10 highest, the unemployment rate in some areas was five times higher than in others. The proportion of young people between the ages of 15 and 19 at school or in training ranges from under 40 per cent in Portugal to more than 85 per cent in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. Public expenditure on research and technical development is up to seven times higher in Germany, France and the UK than in the less-developed member states. As the commission accepts: 'When considered as a whole, regional differences remain comparable to the situation in the early 1970s. This, in spite of a slight improvement due to a more favourable economic climate, more effective harnessing of national and community efforts and a marked increase in assistance from the structural funds.' After a doubling of the structural funds in real terms between 1987 and 1993, the commission admits that, in some respects, the regional disparities have actually widened and the volumes of investment required to make up for deficiencies in basic infrastructure are enormous. The challenge will be all the greater given that the less-favoured regions will also be faced with increasingly stiff EC competition. The task will be compounded by new pressures from central and eastern Europe. The 'economic convergence' objectives set by the Maastricht treaty in the interests of economic and monetary union will be particularly hard to achieve in the poorer regions. A widening of regional differences in a 'two-tier' Europe would undoubtedly be harmful to the community as a whole. The Commission's response to the challenge is outlined in a series of proposals now under discussion. These include another huge rise in resources for the structural funds, which will also be simplified. In those regions lagging in development - such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal - funds would rise by two-thirds while those for other regions would increase by half. There will also, post-Maastricht, be a new fund to help poorer member states with transport infrastructure and environmental projects. Beyond the increase in funding, the Commission is now actively pursuing or considering a number of initiatives intended to help the process of balanced economic development. With the decreasing significance of the community's internal frontiers, new economic opportunities are opening up for the border areas which have long been isolated from the main centres of economic activity. The Commission has, accordingly, set up Interreg, a community aid programme intended to help weld together local economies which have traditionally faced each other across national boundaries and developed differently. The Commission is also concerned to help fill in some of the 'missing links' in EC infrastructure which underline regional differences in wealth and which will frustrate the community's economic expansion. Transport, telecommunicationsand energy supply networks are interrupted by pockets of non-investment which badly need to be filled with the help of EC funds. Some of the community's most acute problems associated with lack of economic opportunity, low incomes and poor quality of life are concentrated in some of Europe's biggest cities. At present, there is no community policy specifically relating to the problems of urban areas and concern over the growth in segregation of rich and poor in many cities means that urban poverty and deprivation could soon figure on the EC's busy agenda.</p>

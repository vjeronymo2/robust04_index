			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foron rescued from liquidation Foron, the successful east German refrigerator company has been rescued from liquidation after the Treuhand privatisation agency secured investment commitments from the London-based East German Investment Trust fund (EGIT). Egit will hold 47 per cent of Foron, and will put up DM11m (Dollars 6.7m) in capital. However, the Treuhand, anxious to save Foron, one of the region's most innovative companies, has agreed to allow Egit to reduce its purchase price of Haushaltsgerateservice, which holds the majority stake in Foron.</p>

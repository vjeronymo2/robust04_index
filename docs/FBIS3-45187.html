According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the gross output  of  the township enterprises in 20 provinces and regions in the  central and western parts in the country reached RMB 400 billion  last year, more than 60 percent up over the year before and 10  percentage points higher than the country's growth on average.    Last year, the state made special loans of RMB 5 billion to  support the development of township enterprises, seen as the  biggest project for turning these areas from being poor into  becoming rich. At the same time, various localities also  increased their investment in this sector. Such investment for  the development of these enterprises is predicted to account for  RMB 35 billion, over 25 percent of the country's total, up from  the 23 percent in the previous year. As a result, a large  number of big-sized and highly efficient items have been set up.    According to initial statistics, such enterprises there have  taken on 3.3 million rural redundant labourers, making up 60  percent of the country's total new working force going into this  sector last year. The gross output, business and sales income  and profits tax earned by these enterprises last year amounted  to 34.7 percent, 36.4 percent and 3.61 percent of the country's  totals.</p>

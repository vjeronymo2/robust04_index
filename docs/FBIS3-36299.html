			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "News Conference of the Party of </F> People's Accord Leadership"]    [Text] Today, at the National Press Center, the Party of  People's Accord [PNZ] leadership held a news conference.  Chairman Henadz Karpenka said that the primary PNZ task is to  nominate candidates for the future elections to the Supreme  Soviet. Henadz Karpenka also said that the PNZ will urge  pre-term elections and changes in the structure of the  Belarusian Council of Ministers. The PNZ chairman expressed full  support for the strike which was scheduled by the Free Trade  Unions to begin on 15 February. The reason for this is the  Council of Ministers' unwillingness to hold talks with trade  unions and adopt a mutually acceptable resolution. According to  Karpenka's words, the PNZ held consultations with trade unions  last Saturday [29 January]. With regard to the economic  situation in the country, Henadz Karpenka stated that its change  will be accompanied by a sharp worsening of the people's living  standard. H. Karpenka said that presidential elections are  necessary; however, they should be organized not by the Supreme  Soviet, but by the people. PNZ Deputy Chairman Alaksey Karol,  while commenting on the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman  Stanislav Shushkevich, stated that this [dismissal] has  strengthened the authoritarian basis and brought a shift toward  an authoritarian style of governing and the monopolization of  power in the government's hands.</p>

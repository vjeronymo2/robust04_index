			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Rumblings in the undergrowth have put pressure on British Aerospace's shares recently, though it is hard to see why. The company was always likely to rationalise its turbo-prop aircraft operations once new banking covenants were in place. So announcing a Pounds 200m write-off to pay for the reorganisation along with BAe's full-year figures would cause little real surprise. Equally, the apparently dashed hope of a new European transport aircraft is little more than a rather unlikely kite which has been flying for some time. More plausibly, fund managers are simply taking profits in one of last year's most spectacular recovery stocks. Yet looking a little further out, there are reasons to be optimistic. The low point of the defence orders cycle has been passed, and Rover's profits are now finally starting to flow. BAe may still offer better opportunities than the Rolls-Royce bolt hole into which some shareholders are diving.</p>

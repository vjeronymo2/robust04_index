			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 5,000 men and women are reported to have  taken part in a memorial rally that was held on Saturday [2  April] some 150 meters off the building that used to house  Russia's dissolved parliament and is currently housing the  Russian Government, in Moscow. A number of opposition parties  and movements, including the Russian Communist Workers' party,  the Working Russia movement, the Army Officers' Union and the  Women for the USSR movement, held the rally to pay tribute to  the memory of those who were killed on October 3 and 4 in armed  clashes in Moscow.    The rally declared the October butchers should not expect  forgiveness. A member of the standing presidency of the  Congress of Soviet People's Deputies Sazhi Umalatova, Komsomol  leader Igor Maliarov and the leader of the Liberal-Socialist  party Valeriy Skurlatov attended the event.    A list of the fallen was read out loud and wreaths were laid  to a symbolic grave at Moscow's White House.    INTERFAX reporters heard no speaker make anti-semitic slurs  although many of those who attended the rally talked about the  need to purge the country of free masons and Jews".    Graffiti on a wall near the White House said Jews were a  criminal organization, and not an ethnic minority.</p>

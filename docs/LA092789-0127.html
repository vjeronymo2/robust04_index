			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REEF BRAZIL GETS FOOT IN SURF-WEAR DOOR;  </P> <P> BROTHERS' LIGHTWEIGHT SANDALS ARE BIG HIT WITH BEACH CROWDS IN U.S. AND  OVERSEAS  </P> <P> Having lugged surfboards across beaches since he was 11, Fernando Aguerre draws  on experience when he talks about the value of a good sandal. But Aguerre says  he could never find a comfortable pair, only ones that were weighty with straps  that burned the skin.  </P> <P> So, in 1985, he decided to start making his own.  </P> <P> As Aguerre expected, his National City-based company, Reef Brazil, quickly  developed a loyal following among surfers by providing a sandal that is both  functional and fashionable. And by introducing his colorful sandals at a time  when mainstream America was hungry for beachwear, Reef Brazil carved a niche in  the larger, active outdoor-wear market as well.  </P> <P> Explaining the surf-wear craze, Aguerre said it was just a matter of time  before the general consumer realized that surfers have a keen fashion sense for  products that are comfortable, colorful and unique.  </P> <P> "We don't want to put a lid on ourselves," said Aguerre, who is marketing his  sandals not only to surfers but to fashion-conscious casual dressers as well.  "We're after the big bucks."  </P> <P> Reef Brazil and other surf and beachwear companies, including Ocean Pacific,  Gotcha Sportswear and Quiksilver USA, are riding a wave of consumer popularity  and hanging some big sales numbers. According to industry sources, sales of  surf wear and accessories are more than $1 billion a year.  </P> <P> Since Aguerre and his younger brother, Santiago, launched Reef Brazil, the  company has definitely been riding a sales crest, growing from 3,000 pairs of  sandals sold in 1985 to 450,000 pairs sold through the first seven months of  1989. The company had expected to sell no more than 350,000 pairs for all of  1989.  </P> <P> In the process, Reef Brazil has built a sales and distribution network that now  includes more than 1,900 retailers, from small surf shops to giant operations,  including Nordstrom department stores and L. L. Bean mail-order house.  </P> <P> For 1989, Reef Brazil expects revenues to reach $3.1 million, up from $1.3  million last year. In 1990, sales should exceed $4 million, the company said.  Nearly 25% of Reef Brazil's sales are exports to European countries, Canada,  Japan, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere.  </P> <P> As Reef Brazil's first customer, Jeff (J. K.) Kinney, owner of the Surf Club in  Pacific Beach, has closely observed the company's growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Selling Everywhere'  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say they're blowing away other manufacturers, but they are selling  everywhere, France, Brazil, you name it. Fernando and Santiago are aggressive  in their marketing. They're little international trade guys."  </P> <P> But just producing a good product doesn't necessarily mean success for a  company, especially in the surfing business, according to James (Jimbo) Gaskin,  associate advertising director for Surfing magazine, one of the sport's leading  publications. To arouse the interest of surfers, Gaskin says, a company must  create an image.  </P> <P> "Reef Brazil has created a vibe . . . the word's out that these guys are  happening," Gaskin said. "Creating a certain image, having mystique. That's  really important. For example, you can have the best surfer in the world, but,  if he doesn't come across in photos, he's a dud. Reef Brazil has come up with a  product that not only is durable and lightweight, but one that looks cool."  </P> <P> Creating the desired sandal, however, didn't happen overnight.  </P> <P> "We've spent two-thirds of our lives surfing in different places of the world,  talking to surfers, finding out about their needs," said Aguerre, who was born  and raised in Argentina. What he discovered from these beach chats was that the  typical rubber sandal could stand some improvement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Material  </P> <P> "The first limitation with rubber is that it's a heavy material," Aguerre said.  "And the toe strap was so tough that it destroyed your feet. So a lot of  surfers were wearing slippers to the beach. That's OK when you're going from  the bed to the bathroom, but it didn't do much for the rest of us who wanted to  look good."  </P> <P> Unable to find quality sandals to stock their surf shop in Argentina -- an  operation the Aguerre brothers ran before moving to San Diego -- the pair began  talking with rubber manufacturers in search of an alternative material suitable  for sandal construction. That's when the Aguerre brothers discovered EVA, a  foam-like material one-third the weight of rubber.  </P> <P> "It was very easy to change the density of EVA, so you could make it harder for  the sole of the sandal and soft and cushiony for the insole," Aguerre said.  "And it's very easy to produce it in different colors."  </P> <P> Working with 15 colors, Reef Brazil combines the shades for more than 45 looks.  One of its more popular styles is a striped model, with an insole decorated  with vertical jade and blue stripes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Going to Last'  </P> <P> And to save toes, Aguerre uses polypropylene for Reef Brazil's straps. "It's  soft as cotton, but tough. It breathes too." Average price for adult Reef  Brazil sandals is $17.95  </P> <P> Like most fashion trends, however, the current surf-wear rage is almost sure to  fizzle, which could send many manufacturers for a spill. But Eric Bowie,  assistant manager of footwear at L. L. Bean, says Reef Brazil has a good chance  to endure in the marketplace.  </P> <P> "I'm sure their sales are benefiting from the current boom, but that's not why  we're carrying them," Bowie said. "We shy away from trendy items. We carry them  simply because it's a good product. It's a well-built flip-flop that's going to  last. And it's comfortable." Reef Brazil sandals' soles come with a lifetime  warranty.  </P> <P> Bowie, who scouts new products for the traditional, outdoor-oriented mail-order  house in Freeport, Me., added: "Reef Brazil was our best-selling flip-flop this  summer."  </P> <P> Although the Aguerre brothers have no plans to enter the clothing market, Reef  Brazil will expand its women's and children's sandal line and provide even more  color combinations. Recently, Reef Brazil also started selling surfboard racks  and bags.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aggressive Marketing  </P> <P> And its marketing campaign continues to be aggressive. Nike may have Bo Jackson  promoting its products, but Reef Brazil has Derek Ho, three-time Hawaiian  Triple Crown surfing champion.  </P> <P> "We were hoping he would promote our product for us," Aguerre said. "When we  finally met him, he was already wearing our sandals."  </P> <P> In 1981, Santiago left Argentina and embarked on a "surf-ari," hitting the  waves off the coasts of Tahiti, the Hawaiian Islands and Southern California.  Upon arriving in San Diego, Santiago became enchanted with the coastal city and  decided to become a permanent resident.  </P> <P> After settling down and finding work at a surf shop, Santiago persuaded his  brother, Fernando, to join him. By late 1984, the Aguerre brothers had  conceived their plan to market their beach sandal and borrowed more than  $25,000 from friends and family to launch their American enterprise.  </P> <P> In National City, Reef Brazil has 15 employees and 5,700 square feet of office  and warehouse space. The company contracts with a manufacturer in Sao Paulo,  Brazil, which employs nearly 150 workers, to produce the sandals. There are  about 45 sales representatives in the United States.  </P> <P> But the Aguerre brothers don't worry about losing control of a company that is  experiencing explosive growth. In fact, they intentionally hold back Reef  Brazil's growth by selling only to select retailers.  </P> <P> "We don't want to sell to a Sears or a K mart, we want to protect the surfer's  mystique," Aguerre said. "We don't want to become a huge company with thousands  of employees. I don't want to have to wear three-piece suits." Fernando, who  sports a ponytail, generally wears shorts and, of course, Reef Brazil sandals  to work.  </P></p>

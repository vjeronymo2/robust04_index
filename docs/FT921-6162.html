			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Heavy loan loss provisions at Skipton Skipton, one of the fastest-growing medium sized building societies, saw profits tumble by two thirds in 1991 because of heavy loan loss provisions. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 11.5m as provisions leapt from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 24.1m. Mr John Goodfellow, who succeeded the late Mr Terry Adams as chief executive, said the results had to be regarded as disappointing even if they might be thought acceptable during a recession. Total assets were Pounds 2.7bn, up from Pounds 2.2b a year ago, making Skipton the 14th largest society by asset size.</p>

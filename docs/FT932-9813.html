			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Much ado about lending: Financial considerations alone no longer dictate aid strategy for Russia The International Monetary Fund does not, for once, hold all the bargaining chips. Negotiators are in Moscow this week to thrash out a tough credit plan with the Russian government, without which no western aid can flow. But they know that the west is determined to start releasing funds soon, no matter what kind of agreement is reached or whether it can be implemented. Financial considerations alone no longer dictate the west's aid strategy to the former Soviet Union, much to the IMF's dismay. Officials from the Group of Seven industrialised countries say they are determined not to see a repeat of last year, when only Dollars 1bn of an original Dollars 24bn aid package was disbursed because the Russian government was unable to meet the IMF's tough financial conditions. 'The G7 did a lousy job last year,' admitted one senior G7 official. 'A good opportunity was lost because the IMF tried to nail down too many details. We are determined not to see that happen again.' At their meeting in Tokyo four weeks ago, the G7 foreign and finance ministers announced a headline figure of nearly Dollars 44bn of assistance to Russia over the next year from the IMF, the World Bank and in bilateral aid. (Both the IMF and the World Bank receive the bulk of their funding from the G7.) But the ministers told the fund to dispense with its normal practice of waiting for a track record of financial discipline before releasing aid. Instead, they instructed the IMF to offer each former Soviet republic fast disbursing aid - labelled a 'systemic transformation facility' - half of which would be paid immediately to any government demonstrating a 'credible' reform strategy. For Russia this facility will provide Dollars 3bn. The IMF was also told to begin to disburse to Russia a further Dollars 4bn in standby loans by, at the latest, October 1, and preferably before the July G7 summit in Tokyo. The World Bank is being pressed to lend about Dollars 4bn during its next fiscal year, which runs from next month to June 1994. The recent Tokyo meeting posed a problem for both the bank and the fund  - and potentially a crisis of authority. According to a senior bank official, the G7's command that the bank and the IMF must come to an agreement with the Russians is 'unprecedented in the annals of the bank or the fund, in any country. Nothing is remotely comparable'. Another bank official said that 'the danger is that our reputation and our expertise will be debauched. We are big organisations which have built up a large body of expertise. Now we are being told: just do it. What happens to morale? And what about those countries which also didn't meet the criteria we set and didn't get the money. You can bet there is a lot of screaming going on behind the walls in Washington.' Life had already become increasingly uncomfortable for the IMF, even before these new pressures were applied. 'Last year,' said one IMF official, 'was a disaster. But it has been a disaster not just for Russia, but for the IMF itself.' At the root of the west's difficulties is Russia's failure to meet the stringent targets set down for the receipt of aid. The reformers, constantly fighting for their political lives and warring with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, were unable to bring inflation down to 9 per cent a month by the end of 1992 by cutting state spending and central bank credits  -the basic condition for assistance. Consumer prices rose by 25 per cent in December alone, and, while the official budget deficit was only 4 per cent of GDP, total credits issued by the central bank to the state sector totalled 40 per cent of GDP. If anything, the prospects for economic reform have deteriorated further in the past few weeks. Both the Russian government and central bank continue to sanction ever more credits for loss-making state enterprises, while President Boris Yeltsin's recent cabinet changes have appeared contradictory. Since his election victory two weeks ago, he has appointed two deputy prime ministers without known commitment to reform, although senior sackings yesterday may signal that he is willing to strengthen the course of economic transformation again. The IMF argues that its inability to lend more is the result of the Russian government's financial profligacy, not excessive caution. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, wrote recently in the daily Russian newspaper Izvestia that the fund could not lend money to inflation-wracked Russia only to see it leave the country as investors took flight from a falling rouble. Since those remarks, the west has had a change of heart. First, western governments, seeing reform stagger and sometimes go into reverse last year, have become more aware of the consequences of failure. President Clinton illustrated the shift in attitude in a speech oon April 1: 'If Russia's reforms turn sour, if it reverts to authoritarianism or disintegrates into chaos, the world cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia replicated in a nation as big as Russia.' Second, the Clinton administration has been influenced by western advisers to the Russian government, who have, at times, mounted a ferocious critique of what they term the passivity and alleged incompetence of the IMF. Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, who has led this attack, says the IMF has proved incapable of thinking tactically and continued to view aid as a reward for success, rather than a pre-condition. 'The IMF has refused to agree realistic targets which take into account the amount of available foreign financing,' he said. In Tokyo, the G7 ministers 'encouraged' the IMF 'to play a more active role'. G7 officials now say the Russian government must merely demonstrate that it intends to bring credit creation under control and cut subsidies to enterprises before aid can start to flow as early as the end of this month. But the lack of a Russian track record of discipline frightens financial institutions. 'The bank and the fund are now under enormous pressure to provide assistance and provide it quick,' said one senior World Bank official. 'And the message is we shouldn't be too worried about conditions. This is very difficult to do, not just in terms of our responsibility to our donors, but also organisationally.' G7 officials rebut the suggestion that aid will now, in practice, be unconditional. 'We have focused conditionality, not weakened it,' said Mr Lawrence Summers, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Nonetheless, growing tensions between the G7 and the international financial institutions remain, and cannot be dismissed as a mere disagreement over strategy. The institutions have to think of life after Russian reform - and of their standing with other, often poorer, members in Latin America and Africa. G7 officials counter that the international financial institutions set too much store by economic conditions and fail to recognise political realities. 'Let's not get overly misty-eyed about conditions,' said one senior G7 official. 'How much conditionality was there in the average Argentine programme in recent years?' 'G7 officials do not believe that it is appropriate to lend regardless of what is going on in Russia,' he added. 'But the task now is to push the Russians to do the right thing. We cannot wait to negotiate every 'i' and every 't'.' The G7's bold strategy is supported by Professor Stanley Fischer, previously chief economist at the World Bank and now an adviser to the bank from his base at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is worried, however, about the capacity of the Russians to implement reform. 'It is possible that the institutions' credibility will be damaged, although probably much less than they now fear,' he said. 'But while the west must not be seen to be supporting everything the Russians do, it must still support them in a big way.' The US backs that view, believing that aid is essential now to buy time while reformers in the Russian government pursue the accelerating privatisation programme and economic restructuring. But the policy seems likely to meet resistance from senior officials in the IMF and World Bank who fear that the money will be wasted, and that they will be blamed. 'One can debate the niceties,' said a senior World Bank official, 'but at some point we must ask - is it likely that the Russian government will deliver on a consistent economic programme? My view is that it will not. I think the G7 will be proved wrong and I don't think it will be our fault.'</p>

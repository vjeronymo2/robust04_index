			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A WORLD OF IDEAS BY BILL MOYERS (DOUBLEDAY: $24.95; 432  PP.)  </P> <P> Reporting events and political rhetoric without examining underlying trends and  ideas, nonfiction programming on television is not renowned for its subtlety of  thought. For a few months beginning last September, however, Bill Moyers  managed to imbue the airwaves with a more reflective spirit in the PBS series,  "A World of Ideas." Regular readers of literature will be familiar with many of  Moyers' subjects -- from Isaac Asimov to Derek Walcott -- but this book, based  on edited transcripts of the show, should still be of interest, for Moyers  doesn't lower the level of dialogue for TV. On the contrary, he consistently  focuses these conversations through thoughtful comments and enlivens them by  playing provocateur.  </P> <P> Moyers is clearly fond of this latter role. In his interview with Northrop  Frye, for instance, he playfully puts the Canadian literary critic on the  defensive by confronting him with a number of stereotypes (e.g., "Canadians are  so friendly that they even say, 'Thank you' to a bank machine"). In many other  dialogues, Moyers takes just the opposite role, tempering his subjects'  extremes of optimism and pessimism. While Joseph Heller paints a bleak picture  of American politics, for instance ("It is the function of a leader in a  democracy, if he wishes to be a leader, to manipulate the emotions and ideas of  the public"), Moyers gently counters Heller's cynicism ("But, like taxes, isn't  politics the price we pay for civilization?"), leading Heller to acknowledge  that "There's no other government that we can envision that we would prefer to  democracy."  </P> <P> Moyers' conclusion is a minor problem in these pages. Attempting to avoid  partisanship, he claims that the only consensus most of these thinkers reach is  that "we can best negotiate the future through a multitude of shared acts." In  fact, Moyers' subjects agree on many issues, such as the need to require our  politicians to speak more spontaneously. Were Moyers to have stressed these  areas of agreement, he might have been able to give his world of ideas greater  clout in the world of action, since squabbling intellectuals are usually the  first to be ignored in politics. One gathers that Moyers would favor such  influence, for as he writes, "the men and women who shared their ideas in the  series are public thinkers. Their Ivory Tower is just a mailing address; they  are at home in the world."  </P> <P> </P></p>

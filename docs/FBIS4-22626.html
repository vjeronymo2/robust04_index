			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Shchurov: "Without Rudder and Sails; </F> When Will There be a Program for Agrarian Reform"]    [Text] A document expected for a long time and even  with impatience fell into my hands a few days ago. The Ministry  of Agriculture has submitted the draft Program of agrarian  reform, which has been going on for three years already, to the  Committee on Agricultural Policy of the Federation Council.    The committee has invited to its parliamentary hearings  forces which usually associate with one another in the language  of ultimatums. It was intended to impartially listen to members  of the government, deputies of the agrarian faction of the Duma,  leaders of the "free farmers" and the "red landlords" and,  having evaluated the positions of the parties, to decide where  and how to further move the agrarian reform forward. However, as  should have been anticipated, the proximity in the hall of the  ideological opponents did not at all bring them together.    Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and the  Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land  Management summed up the results of three years of reform. They  produce a great impression in the sphere of the redistribution  of "no man's property." Thus, 95 percent of the agricultural  lands have found owners--collective and private. Moreover, the  former have remained in the minority: only 34 percent of the  kolkhozes and sovkhozes have maintained their status. Most of  the land and property has been divided on shares among the  members of joint-stock companies and associations  (tovarishchestvo) and transferred free of charge to individual  farmers, horticulturists and gardeners. That is, a mixed  economic system has already returned to the village. Which,  according to theory, presumes the competition of the producers  and reasonable sustenance for you and I as a result.    In practice, however, there hasn't been an increase in  produce from the redistribution of the kolkhozes. The production  of plant-growing products continues to decrease, although at a  slower rate than in industry. During the three years farms have  lost 15-20 percent of the cattle stock, which has slipped to the  level of the '60s and '70s. In comparison with the  pre-perestroyka period, deliveries of trucks to the village have  dropped by a factor of five and those of combines and tractors  by a factor of almost two. Last year arable land received two  times less fertilizers than required, i.e., the land is losing  fertility and we are squandering the grandchildren's  property.    The parties (storona) have not found a common answer to the  question that is traditional in such a situation--"Who is  guilty?" The representatives of the agrarian faction of the Duma  have traditionally accused the reformers of the breakdown of the  kolkhozes and the hurried spreading of individual farming. No  less traditionally the representatives of the government have  alluded to the errors of the previous Cabinet of Ministers,  which fought against inflation at the expense of reducing state  support of the village, and did not restrain the monopolists  whose output increased in price three to five times more rapidly  than grain, milk and meat. As a result both strong kolkhozes and  individual farmers have found themselves bankrupt.    There was even greater discord in forecasts. The academic  secretary of the Russian Agricultural Academy, Anatoliy Shutkov,  has predicted a 10 percent reduction in production this year and  transformation of Russia into a raw material appendage of the  West in the near future. Deputy Vasiliy Starodubtsev has stated  that 30 million tonnes of grain less than usual will be gathered  and that production on individual farms will drop by 15 percent.  The head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Viktor Khlystun, on the  contrary, has stated that in the next few months not only will  one manage to stop the fall but also to gradually raise  production. Having made the proviso, it's true, that to do this  it is necessary to implement the decree on financial support of  the agricultural industry and to adopt the Program of agrarian  reform prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture.    Don't confuse this document with the not unknown food  program. And not just because it is being proposed to raise the  village this time by market measures--demonopolization of  enterprises, privatization of processing, of land... In this  draft of the Program of agrarian reform, which is designed for  two years, there is not even a hint of a limit with respect to  the harvests, milk yields, or volumes of construction which it  is necessary to reach. The question is one of the general  principles and directions of the development of the  agro-industrial complex and a policy of state protectionism.    There are measures in the program long since promised  and long since expected in the village. Let's say, the proposal  to introduce state regulation of the prices for the products of  monopolist enterprises and for the peasants--guaranteed purchase  prices for basic products. Or the introduction of a single land  tax instead of the innumerable assessments which now fleece the  producers and in no way stimulate the efficient utilization of  the land. Or the abandonment of the subsidization of food  imports with the simultaneous repeal of all restrictions on the  export of our own agricultural products. The question is when  these measures will move from the sphere of drafts to real  life.    It's to the point to remember that this version is the sixth  in succession. The previous five drafts have been buried in an  abyss of corrections and coordinations. We have already paid  dearly for attempts to reform the village without thinking, by  means of one-time decrees and edicts. Tatyana Vasilyeva, an  independent farmer from Krasnodar Kray, has said frankly that  privatization has become pilferage and has proposed the adoption  of a law by which one would be able to confiscate land from  false independent farmers, of whom there are any number. It is  no easier to correct the mistakes with the hasty privatization  of processing enterprises built by kolkhoz and sovkhoz money. It  is noted in the draft Program that the controlling bloc of  shares in this case is to belong to the producers. However, time  has been lost--many creameries and meat-packing plants have been  privatized by city-dwellers and are dictating their own terms to  the village...    The program was prepared in today's version as long ago as  last year, but because of the obstinancy of the Ministry of  Finance and the Ministry of Economics simply hasn't attained  approval. According to Viktor Khlystun the intention is to  consider the draft in the presidium of the government only in  April. The Duma and the Federation Council will examine the  document later still, and later still both houses must adopt a  group of laws in elaboration... Given the polarity of the  viewpoints towards reform on the part of the executive and  legislative power there is no guarantee at all that the concept  of agrarian reform will be legitimized in the next few months.    Well, what of it you say? We lived three years without a  program and we'll live some more. Perhaps so. Only in this case  tomorrow the reformers are condemned to make yesterday's  mistakes. While the peasant hasn't known and doesn't know how  much and what to sow. And whether to sow...</p>

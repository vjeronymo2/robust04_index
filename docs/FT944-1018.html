			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Aerospace buys Pascall for Pounds 5.5m Aerospace Engineering, the precision engineering group which yesterday reported a 72 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits, has acquired Pascall, the electronic equipment and component manufacturer, for a maximum of Pounds 5.5m. The group also announced plans to restructure its share capital and change its name to Intelek. The initial consideration for Pascall is Pounds 3m, to be satisfied by the issue of 3m new Aerospace Engineering ordinary shares, representing 7.9 per cent of the issued share capital, with the balance in cash and loan notes. The remaining consideration will be satisfied by up to 2.5m more shares and loan notes, depending on Pascall's profitability up until 1996. Pascall made pre-tax profits of Pounds 184,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.3m in the year to September 30. Aerospace Engineering has also proposed a capital reconstruction which would effectively lower the nominal value of its shares from 25p to 5p. The shares closed yesterday at 16 1/2 p. The company's pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 fell from Pounds 127,000 to Pounds 35,000 on turnover down 3 per cent at Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 7.72m). Continuing activities showed an operating loss of Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 292,000 profit) after a Pounds 160,000 restructuring charge and poor performance by CML, part of the group's aerospace division. The disposal of property in Swindon resulted in a profit of Pounds 471,000. Earnings per share fell from 0.12p to 0.09p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.25p.</p>

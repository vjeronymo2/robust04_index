			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Hopes rise for pact on aircraft subsidies Trade officials in Geneva yesterday expressed optimism that US-European Union differences over subsidies for civil aircraft could be resolved before the December 15 deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Following the failure of Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, to settle the issue in Brussels earlier this week, the negotiations have been handed back to Gatt's civil aircraft committee. This committee is trying to 'multilateralise' last year's US-EU bilateral deal on state support for the European Airbus. 'There is a deal there, I'm convinced of that, and with the political will, it can be done now,' said Mr Mikael Lindstrom, the committee's Swedish chairman, who sees his role as an indep-endent and neutral arbiter. Mr Kantor and Sir Leon said on Tuesday that they came close to agreement in Brussels, and officials confirmed yesterday that neither side regards the issue as a 'round-breaker'. However, the EU in particular is keen to wrap up a revised Gatt code on civil aircraft which would provide more flexibility for aircraft subsidies than the general subsidies agreement proposed in the Uruguay Round talks. In an effort to break the deadlock, Mr Lindstrom last month produced a revised aircraft code based on a modified version of the general subsidies accord, which all sides have accepted as a platform for negotiation. After discussions yesterday with US and EU negotiators, Mr Lindstrom plans to circulate a revised text later this week. The main sticking points between the US and EU are: the level of aircraft subsidies above which there is a presumption of unfair trading practices; which types of subsidy should be subject to ceilings; whether subsidies subject to ceilings should be protected from challenge by competitors; and the EU's demand that past subsidies be exempted from anti-subsidy suits. Under the bilateral US-EU agreement, the EU agreed to cap assistance to the four-nation Airbus consortium at 33 per cent of development spending, but this applies only to large civil aircraft and to the EU's royalty-based subsidy system. The Gatt civil aircraft code, which has 22 signatories, applies to all aircraft and components, and to all forms of subsidies. In the draft general subsidies accord, the subsidy threshold for presumption of 'serious prejudice' is 5 per cent of sales, a figure the EU wants raised.</p>

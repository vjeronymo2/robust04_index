			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: A period of expansion dawns for NZ equities - Terry Hall observes a new mood among investors Trading on the New Zealand stock market continued its stop-go pattern this week, with investors concentrating on the flow of results from heavyweight stocks. There is unusual interest in these results, mostly for stocks with December 31 balance dates, because of widespread awareness that the economy is changing as it moves out of recession. Investors are keen to see which companies are coping best, as New Zealand comes to terms with its strongest expansion since 1984-85. They also want evidence that the companies will cope well with the new environment by ruthlessly cutting costs and debt in pursuit of continued profit improvements. The past three quarters have seen business confidence at its highest level since 1972-73, matched by a flow of encouraging statistics on everything from GDP growth, to low inflation, and increased investment in manufacturing and farming. Against this is concern that rising imports may damage the balance of payments and exports may fall because of the international recession. For example wool earnings, although now a relatively minor export, are sharply down. There is also the prospect of another rise in interest rates if the Reserve Bank repeats its January action and intervenes to support the New Zealand dollar in pursuit of its low inflation target. It is also election year, with the ruling pro-business National Party trailing in the polls. Most companies in the February reporting round have announced profits in line with, or better than expectations. Telecom Corporation, now the biggest company in the country, accounting for 19.9 per cent of the NZSE-40 index, soared 60 cents from early January, reaching a high of Dollars 2.87 (Dollars 1.50) on February 16. This followed its announcement of a 9.7 per cent rise in profits in the nine months to December 31. The group also said it was making a further 5,200 staff redundant during the next four years in a determined bid to stay competitive. Telecom, which eased back subsequently in line with the setback in Wall Street, where it is also listed, has since rallied, closing yesterday at NZDollars 2.64. Fletcher Challenge, the forestry and energy group, announced a six month profit in line with expectations, and confirmed that its asset selling programme was on target. It ended yesterday at NZDollars 2.57, up from NZDollars 1.52 last October. The NZSE-40 index closed yesterday at 1,588.03. Attention is now focused on Brierley Investments' result, due to be released today. The shares closed yesterday at NZDollars 1.09. Brierley has also been re-rated after disclosing wide ranging restructuring plans, including boardroom changes, in November, when it had traded as low as 82 cents. Brierley is expected to announce half-year earnings of around NZDollars 105m (up from NZDollars 90m), including profits of up to NZDollars 50m on recent sales. The group's New Zealand profits are expected to be up sharply, in line with the improving economy, although a negative contribution is expected from its investment in a UK hotel group. Analysts have lifted their earnings estimates for most of the leading companies that have so far reported, based on the strong rise in GDP and continued cost cutting. However some second-line stocks have been marked back after reporting profits below expectations. There is a widespread view among brokers and analysts that the market could continue to mark time until the March 31 tax period. This will allow investors to come to terms with the recent strong upward price movements in the leaders. Leading broker Buttle Wilson described the prices of the leaders this week as 'only mildly cheap'. However, a wild card is the influence of Wall Street, Australia and other markets. International investors are taking an increasing interest in New Zealand equities, leading to 24-hour trading with New York and other northern hemisphere markets.</p>

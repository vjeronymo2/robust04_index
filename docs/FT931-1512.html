			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Norway talks will focus on fisheries FISHERIES policy will be the main issue in the negotiations aimed at admitting Norway to the European Community, European Commission officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. They said that the issue had been singled out in the Commission's 'opinion' on Norway's application. This opinion is expected to be finalised at the Commission's meeting today. Officials underlined, however, that European fisheries policy had evolved since Norwegian voters in a divisive referendum narrowly rejected European Community membership in 1972. One official said: 'I think what we would want to stress is that the Community (body of law) on fisheries is different from 1972. . . We don't expect a rerun of 1972.' The Commission document also singles out Oslo's decision to resume commercial whaling. 'Whaling will need to be discussed, but we cannot say at this stage what will be acceptable and what will not,' an official said. The opinion also echoes concerns expressed in the Commission's opinion on Finland's application about the need to deal with the big differences between Norway's agricultural system and the Common Agricultural Policy and between the two sides' regional policies. Norway's agricultural production prices are often double those in the EC, and farmers, who have to deal with much harsher conditions, are paid more support than they would be allowed under EC rules. Officials said the opinion did not mention Norway's aversion to a draft directive aimed at prising open the EC market for oil exploration, prospecting and drilling as it has not yet been agreed at EC level. Norway, Europe's biggest oil producer, opposes the plans, saying they would interfere with its sovereignty to manage its resources.</p>

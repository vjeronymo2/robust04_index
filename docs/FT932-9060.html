			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rights issue expected from BA BRITISH AIRWAYS is expected to launch a rights issue on Tuesday to raise up to Pounds 400m when it reports its financial results for the year to the end of March. The capital injection is aimed at strengthening the balance sheet following BA's recent series of strategic investments in other carriers at a time of difficult trading in the airline industry. BA is also likely to report a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for its 1992-93 financial year. Analysts are forecasting profits of between Pounds 180m and Pounds 200m, compared with Pounds 284m the previous year. The decline reflects the pressures the airline has faced from increased competition and the recession which has lasted longer than expected. However, BA has continued to buck the general airline industry trend. The majority of its main competitors have reported heavy losses this year. Western airlines have lost more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) on international scheduled services in the last three years, according to recent International Air Transport Association figures. Losses for Europe's biggest airlines increased to Dollars 1.35bn last year from Dollars 1.1bn in 1991, the Association of European Airlines, the trade organisation grouping 23 European carriers, said yesterday. At the same time, BA has pursued its expansionary strategy to become a global airline by acquiring stakes in USAir, Qantas of Australia, TAT of France and a regional German carrier. It has also absorbed the operations of Dan Air, the UK regional carrier, and agreed this week to take over the Plymouth-based Brymon regional carrier. BA last night declined to comment on the rights issue, saying only that it constantly kept its financial position under review. The cash call would help fund the total of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 600m BA is investing in its strategic airline partnerships and reduce gearing, which stood at 46 per cent at the end of the third quarter. The airline boosted its balance sheet last year with an after tax gain of Pounds 140m from the sale of its aircraft engine overhaul plant in Wales to General Electric of the US. It also raised Pounds 320m from a convertible capital bond issue four years ago when it planned to invest in a stake in United Airlines before the deal with the US carrier collapsed.</p>

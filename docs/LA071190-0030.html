			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TO HEAR POLICE TAPES OF BELLINGER'S COMPANIONS;  </P> <P> MURDER CASE: THE COURT WILL USE THE TAPED INTERVIEWS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE  WITNESSES HAVE CHANGED THEIR ACCOUNTS OF THE SHOOTING.  </P> <P> A Pasadena Juvenile Court judge will listen to taped police interviews of three  teen-agers who witnessed Joey Paul Bellinger shoot two deaf brothers in a  Granada Hills parking lot to determine whether the witnesses have changed their  accounts of the shooting.  </P> <P> Judge Sandy R. Kriegler, who must decide whether Bellinger should be tried in  Juvenile Court or as an adult, said Tuesday that he will review tapes of the  original police interviews with three friends of Bellinger's.  </P> <P> Bellinger is charged with murder and attempted murder for fatally shooting  Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounding Edward Vieira, 25, both of Palmdale, during a  confrontation between the brothers and a group of Bellinger's friends on Jan.  28.  </P> <P> During the fitness hearing that began Monday, three of Bellinger's friends who  witnessed the shooting, after a traffic argument, said Bellinger fired in  self-defense, as the brothers charged toward him.  </P> <P> Before he fired, the teen-agers said, Bellinger screamed at the brothers to get  back and fired a warning shot into the air. They also said another teen-ager --  who has been missing since the incident -- screamed at Bellinger to shoot the  brothers.  </P> <P> These accounts differ from earlier accounts released by police, which suggested  that Bellinger fired without provocation or encouragement.  </P> <P> Kriegler decided to listen to the tapes to assess the credibility of the  witnesses. Prosecutors suggested that the teen-agers may have changed their  stories to protect their friend, but defense attorney Gerald L. Fogelman and  the witnesses themselves said they may have left out some details in talking to  police because they were nervous.  </P> <P> One teen-age witness, Inna Spivak, testified Tuesday that when police  interviewed her, they cut her off and seemed uninterested in the context of the  shooting.  </P> <P> "They didn't care about what happened," she said. "They released a lot of lies  in the paper."  </P> <P> The events preceding the shooting are critical to determining whether Bellinger  will be tried as an adult or as a child because one of the factors the judge  must consider is the gravity of the offense.  </P> <P> If Bellinger fired in self-defense, that could be viewed as a mitigating  factor, lessening the seriousness of the crime and improving his chances to be  tried as a juvenile, which would limit the maximum sentence to nine years in  custody of the California Youth Authority. Prosecutors want to try Bellinger as  an adult, which would expose him to a possible sentence of 25 years to life.  </P></p>

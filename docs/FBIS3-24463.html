			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Reports prepared by A.N. Khaustov: "At the Shipyards"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Almaz Shipbuilding Company </H5>   The Almaz Shipbuilding Company in St. Petersburg, under  contract to the Morskiye Sistemy Sukhogo Joint-Stock Company,  has begun construction of the prototype of a series of passenger  vessels with a small waterplane area (SMPV) -- the first ship of  this type in domestic shipbuilding. The Agat Design Enterprise  drew up the technical design (A-4) in 1992. The work  documentation is specified for total completion in the 3d  quarter of 1993.  <H6>  Basic Elements and Statistics </H6>   Overall length, m -- 32.5    Overall width, m --  11    Board depth, m -- 5.6    Draft, m --  2.2    Displacement along summer load mark, t --  139    Deadweight, t -- 24    Payload, t --  17    Passenger capacity, persons -- 186    Speed, knots --  25-29    The choice of the company to build the first SMPV with  all-welded hull and superstructures made of high-strength  aluminum-magnesium alloys was not a random one. For more than  one decade, the enterprise has specialized in building naval  ships and special ships with dynamic support principles, in  particular, surface-effect vessels with steel and AMg-alloy  hulls. Some of the naval ships built have no analogs with  respect to performance and structure in domestic shipbuilding  and even in the world.    The new passenger ship, developed in accordance with the  conversion program, is distinguished by its irregular contours,  particularly those of the subsurface hulls, powerful main power  unit with Z-shaped drive to two engines, unique system of  reversing the ship and moderation of pitching. There are many  new, non-traditional engineering designs in the structure of the  SMPV. The passengers are ensured comfort when the sea conditions  are five points on the scale.    Among the suppliers of the ship's basic engineering  equipment, gear and finishing and building elements are such  well-known firms as MTU (FRG) -- main engines; Sperry Marine  (United States) -- complete control system; NPO [Scientific  Production Association] imeni N.Ya. Klimov -- angle reduction  gears; ANTK imeni A.N. Tupolev -- passenger lounge equipment.    The collective of engineers and specialists of the Almaz  company, headed by A.P. Korolev, general director, has  confidence in the successful development of the prototype ship,  and in the future, of series construction of various  modifications of the SMPV. (Yu.N. Peresvetov).  <H5>  Krasnoye Sormovo Yard Production Association </H5>   On 13 March of this year, the plant launched the next cargo  motorship of the "river-sea" type, the Volga. This ship, ordered  by the Roschart Company, has been named Myskhako.    The Sormovo workers are planning to broaden the export of  their ships. These are, mainly, ships of the Volga type, with a  cargo capacity of 4,000/5,500 t, of the Nizhniy Novgorod type  (or Ni NO-3000, design 19611), with an average cargo capacity of  3,000 t, and the Rossiya type (design 17310) with a cargo  capacity of 2,000/3,000 t. The set of documents for these ships  was turned over for expert examination to the specialists of Det  Norske Veritas classification society, to ensure that the export  orders conform to the maximum to Western standards. On the  whole, the ship meets the basic requirements of foreign  shipowners and supervisory bodies. Motorships of the Volga type,  however, for example, were marked by a relatively low level of  automated ship control, and a large crew; the radio-navigation  equipment is not up to the mark and some materials not  recommended in the West (asbestos-containing) are used.    In the process of negotiations with the Norwegian firms, the  possibility of supplying other ships, including tankers, was  discussed.  <H5>  Yaroslavl Shipyard </H5>   The search for solvent buyers has been the yard's main  problem recently. The yard often has to develop new ships at its  own expense, since the traditional buyers often find themselves  insolvent on the financial plane. Because of this, fishing  trawlers, usually supplied to domestic enterprises, are  increasingly often shipped overseas. For example, a contract was  concluded with an Egyptian firm to build six freezer  seine-trawlers from the modernized design 503. Alexandria will  be the port of registry of the first one of them.  <H5>  Severnoye Machine Building Enterprise Production Association </H5>   The association carried out 357 measures of the re-equipment  plan in 1992. As a result, labor input was reduced by 562,000  norm-hrs, and the level of manual labor was reduced to 34.1  percent. Among the most important measures carried out are  preparation to put into operation a new three-roll sheet-bending  machine with a laser device, development of a completely  mechanized line and a new press to face the boards of  cabinet-type furniture with veneer, and installation and  development of nine new digitally controlled metal-cutting  machine tools.    The following were included among the next tasks to improve  production in 1993: developing a water-screen for the gas  cutting of rolled sheet metal in hull-machining production,  equipping the steel-smelting furnaces with hydro-gas-purifying  systems, developing a unit to purify oven gases to melt glass,  converting forging furnaces from mazut to gas, rebuilding the  thermal subdivision for instrument production, etc. At the same  time, conserving fuel, power and material resources and solving  ecological problems are also priority goals.  <H5>  Perm Kama Shipyard </H5>   The plant is mastering the building of small freezer shrimp  trawlers (design 13307). They are designed to catch tropical  shrimp with beam trawls and fish with a deep-sea trawl, using a  stern trawling system, and also with a purse seine and a cone  net, using electric light. The catch is frozen in  horizontal-slab devices and an air-freezing locker. The trawlers  are designed at the Kiev Leninskaya Kuznitsa Central Design  Bureau, and are built to Registry class KM "Star" 1AZ (fishing).  <H6>  Basic Elements and Statistics </H6>   Overall length, m -- 27    Width, m -- 7.6    Board  depth, m -- 3.7    Draft along load mark, m --  3.05    Displacement, t -- 314    Cruising capacity, days --  20    Speed, knots -- 10.5    Crew, persons -- 6    A 6VD 18/16 AL-2 diesel with 450 kW power is used as the  main  engine.  <H5>  Aksay Fleet REB [Repair-Operations Base] </H5>   The Aksay Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet, located  in Aksay, in Rostov Oblast, is planning to begin building  river-sea type cargo ships. The technical-economic  substantiation for rebuilding and expanding the enterprise was  made with the participation of the Hamburg firm, Blohm and Voss.  It will take about 150 million German Marks, with a recovery  period of 8-12 years, to put the project into effect. The  possibility of building at least seven Sormovskiy type  motorships a year is specified. Moreover, only the ship hulls  will be formed, and their equipment and outfitting is to be  carried out with the resources of two other enterprises at  Rostov-on-Don -- the RIF Joint-Stock Company and Krasnyy Don. In  addition, major ship repair work is planned. In particular, the  Volga-Don Shipping Company AO [Joint-Stock Company] is  interested in the realization of this project, and has already  invested certain funds in modernizing the enterprise. In the  near future, the Aksay Fleet REB will become a joint-stock  company, and some of its shares will be offered to the investors  to go toward clearing off the loan.  <H5>  Neva Planning-Design Bureau </H5>   One of the conversion projects of this bureau is a  medium-sized freezer-longliner trawler (design 13010). The ship  is designed to fish with deep-sea and bottom trawls, as well as  with a ground line. The fish-processing equipment provides the  output of frozen cut-up fish products, including filets, and  ground fish for feed. The ship class is KM "Star" L2AZ (fishing).    The main power unit is a single-shaft, two-machine  diesel-reduction unit based on 6Ch N22/24 diesels with 2X973 kW.  Two shaft-driven generators (2X630 kW) and a diesel-generator  (350 kW) are also stipulated. The variable-pitch screw (196 rpm)  is 2.8 m in diameter. The bow thruster has 135 kW power. The set  of commercial devices for trawl fishing will be  Russian-Norwegian-made (RossNor Joint-Stock Company). The cargo  system includes a hydraulic crane (1.8 t with an 8-meter radius)  and two cargo booms, 3.2 t each. The refrigeration equipment  consists of four compressor units, ensuring a temperature of  -28C in the holds, and three horizontal-slab freezer units  with a total productivity of 36 t/day. A series of ships of this  design is to be built for Russian buyers at the Zvezdochka  Machine Building Enterprise in Severodvinsk.  <H6>  Basic Elements and Characteristics </H6>   Length, m    overall -- 53.3    between  perpendiculars -- 46.2    Width, m -- 12.6    Board depth to  main deck/upper deck, m -- 5.3/7.8    Cargo draft, m --  4.7    Displacement (T = 4.7 m), t -- 1800    Cargo hold  volume, m[.sup]3[/] -- 620    Cruising capacity, days  --30    Number of bunks -- 32    Speed, knots -- 12.4  <H5>  Chernomorskiy Shipyard </H5>   Because the yard has stopped building heavy  aircraft-carrying  cruisers, problems have arisen with the work load of a number of  production shops, and because of this, the idea is being  discussed of organizing a shipbuilding concern in Nikolayev,  which would include the Chernomorskiy Shipyard, the Shipyard  imeni 61 Kommunar and the Okean Shipyard. This would make it  possible to load their shops more uniformly, accordingly  redistributing the orders for performing work done, for example,  on manufacturing hull structures or producing machine building  items. This concern would also have its own bank. It is possible  that scientific institutions, UkrNIITS, for example, might join  this association. In jointly solving, under mutually  advantageous conditions, the problems facing the enterprises,  the participants in this sort of association must at the same  time retain financial independence and bear the responsibility  for the results of their work.  <H5>  Almaz TsMKB [Central Marine Design Bureau] </H5>   The Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau, within the framework  of its conversion, has drawn up a design for a high-speed  surface-effect skeg-type passenger-motor vehicle ferry,  tentatively named the Mistral. The ship was created on the basis  of the missile boat, Sivuch (NATO code name -- Dergach].  <H6>  Basic Elements and Specifications </H6>   Overall length, m -- 65    Width, m -- 18    Draft, m  --3.3/1    Deadweight, t -- 220    Power, main engine, kW --  36,700    Speed, knots -- up to 45    Cruising range, miles  -- 400    The ferry can take on board 352 passengers and 67 motor  vehicles. The sea-keeping qualities are ensured at sea waves up  to 6 points.    In addition to this ship, export versions, based on this  design, of missile, anti-submarine and patrol ships, as well as  Coast Guard ships, have been developed. Their total displacement  is 750-850 t, maximum speed 45 knots, cruising range under  displacement conditions -- 2,000 miles, and on air cushion --  500 miles.  <H5>  Kherson Shipbuilding Association </H5>   The next Arctic supply ship of the Ivan Papanin type will  sail under the Chinese flag. The "christening" of the new ship,  which was named Snow Dragon, took place in April of this year.  This ship -- the first of this type in the Chinese People's  Republic -- will be used for Antarctic expeditions. Construction  of the next supply ship has continued at the building berth. Its  name and the port of registry have not yet been determined.    During approximately the same period, the association laid  the keel of a new tanker-products-carrier. This ship differs  somewhat from the preceding series of tankers with a deadweight  of 28,000 t, through the reduced capacity of the cargo tanks  (board depth of the preceding tankers was 3 m more). Other  wishes of buyers, particularly those from Norway, have also been  taken into consideration.  <H5>  Chaykovskiy Fleet REB </H5>   The Chaykovskiy Repair-Operations Base of the river fleet  (city of Chaykovskiy, Perm Oblast) is planning to build, in  1993-1994, pusher-tugs with 440 kW power, using Design No 81172  of the Sudostroyeniye Design Bureau Scientific Production  Association. These river ships (River Registry class "O," ice)  are designed to push dry-cargo consists and bulk barges with a  total cargo capacity of up to 5,000 t, as well as to tow rafts  and barges.  <H6>  Basic Elements and Statistics </H6>   Overall length, m -- 34.4    Overall width, m --  10.3    Board depth, m -- 2.7    Draft, m --  1.4    Surface clearance, m -- 12.45    Tractive force (8  km/hr), kN -- 68.5    Cruising capacity, days -- 10    Crew,  persons -- 12    Three variations of the tug have been worked out, depending  on the type of towing and coupling devices used. The means of  automation used on the ship provides the possibility of the  power unit operating without a constant watch in the engine room.  <H5>  Shipyard imeni 61 Kommunar </H5>   In accordance with a Ukrainian government decision, this  yard  will undergo 100-percent conversion. The shipyard, founded over  200 years ago especially to build the Russian Naval Fleet, has  already cut back the volumes of building new naval ships from 80  to 20 percent. Finishing work and repair is being carried out  for a number of buyers. At the same time, the financial capital  promised by the government to convert production to the output  of civilian ships and to modernize it is being withheld. The  situation with respect to supplies of completing equipment, and  the introduction of Ukraine's own currency -- the karbovanets --  have become difficult. After all, the yard obtains up to 80  percent of ship mechanisms, devices and instruments, as well as  materials, from Russia. Nevertheless, the yard is expanding the  program for the output of products for civilian purposes. A new  design of transport refrigerator is being built, and contacts  with new buyers, including foreign ones, are being developed.  <H5>  Feodosiya More Production Association </H5>   The enterprise has begun series construction of three types  of sea-going passenger hydrofoils. The prototype SPK  [hydrofoil], Voskhod-2M, was launched at the beginning of  January this year. Ten months passed from the laying of its keel  in the building berth to its launching. According to some  estimates, in a few years the association will be able to  produce up to ten of these ships a year.    Another prototype SPK, the Olimpiya, was launched on the eve  of 1993. While it took about two years to build this ship,  series SPK of this type should be built at quadruple the rate.  At the beginning of the year the keels were laid in the building  berth for four SPK of the Olimpiya type. Diesels from the German  MTU firm were installed on them as the main engine.    After the successful operation of the prototype double-deck  gas-turbine-powered Tsiklon on the Tallinn-Helsinki line, it was  decided to continue building ships of this type, but in a  modernized version. The keel was laid for the Tsiklon-M SPK on  18 December 1992.  <H5>  Okean Shipyard </H5>   The yard has began construction of a prototype ship with a  deadweight of about 8,000 t, with a horizontal cargo-processing  method. This rolker, for mixed sailing, is 140 m long and 16 m  wide, and has a board depth of 8 m. The two main diesels,  turning the two screw propellers, make it possible for it to get  up to a speed of 13.5 knots. Wheel-and-track equipment will be  loaded and unloaded along a cargo ramp. The ship is also  suitable to transport international standard containers, both in  the holds and on the upper deck. It is built on the order of the  Ukrainian Delta Scientific Production Corporation. The Okean  Shipyard is developing ships of this type for the first time,  and they will replace the small fish-factory bases in the  building berths, after the last ship of that series is turned  over.  <H5>  Sever Production Association </H5>   Screw propellers are among the types of goods produced by  the  Sever Production Association. To raise the quality of the  screws, designed particularly for hydrofoils, specialists of the  St. Petersburg State Marine Technology University, by order of  this Production Association, are carrying out research and  experimental work on using a theodolite-computer system to  measure the geometrical parameters of the screws being produced  by the association's specialized subdivision. The ultimate goal  of the work is to increase the precision of the measurements,  and optimize the technology of the marking-out and control  operations.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The enterprise has begun series production of P1-PKV  crystallizers -- special devices to intensify the process of  sugar crystallization. The use of these devices will make it  possible to increase the production of the prepared product at  sugar plants, at the same time simplifying the procedure for  controlling the manufacturing process.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The Arkhangelsk Oblast Council of the Shipbuilding  Scientific  Technical Association imeni Academician A.N. Krylov, summed up  the results of a competition for the best work on mechanizing  and improving manufacturing processes. The following works by  association specialists were commended with honorary diplomas:  "An Automated System for Producing a Set of Planning-Engineering  Documents, Based on a Local Personal Computer Network" (E.S.  Khandanyats), "Remote Control of Power and Heating Pump  Stations" (P.A. Marin, Yu.M. Kotsov, V.O. Levshin), "A Stand for  Testing Automatic Devices of the Elektron Series" (I.K.  Chekrygin, Ye.F. Yermolin, V.A. Shilnikov), "Introduction of an  MRN 340-01 Contact Machine for Group Projection Welding of Wire  Screens" (V.I. Sergevnin, V.Ye. Sherstnev, G.G. Golyakov),  "Modernization of the Gripping Mechanism of an M10P.62.01  Industrial Robot, Included as Part of an RTK [Robot-Technology  Complex]" (A.V. Popov, V.M. Pozdeyev).  <H5>  Vint Scientific Production Association </H5>   One of the latest works of the association's specialists is  developing the structure of an active water-jet-type rudder  (ARV). This rudder is designed for installation on transport,  passenger, fishing and other vessels, in order to increase  maneuverability in forward and reverse motion, and also to  provide low speed for the ship when the main engine is switched  off. The ARV is distinguished by increased reliability and  ecological safety, which are ensured by the degree to which the  working element is protected against mechanical damage and  auto-rotation, and by eliminating from the design seals, angle  gearing or a submerged electric motor in the sea space,  characteristic of traditional active rudder systems.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Specifications of Three ARV Type-Sizes                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Power consumption,|30                |47                |95                |  | kW               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diameter of rotor,|0.3               |0.31              |0.54              |  | m                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rotational speed  |1,475             |1,450             |975               |  |of rotor shaft, r-|                  |                  |                  |  |pm                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Traction on moori-|4.9               |7.0               |15.0              |  |ng lines, kN      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      When the ARV is in operation, the water enters through  notches in the side surfaces of the rudder blade, or at the ends  of it, to an axial or centrifugal pump. The appropriate driving  force is created by the reaction of the jet of water ejected  through a nozzle in the stern edges of the rudder blade. An  experimental model of an ARV with 47 kW power has now been  developed to fit type SRT fishing boats.  <H5>  Monolit Central Design Bureau </H5>   This design bureau, located in Gorodets, in Nizhegorod  Oblast, is the leading organization in shipbuilding in the field  of designing ships with reinforced concrete hulls, floating  repair, transport and launching docks, floating and  floating-stand berths for various purposes, floating workshops,  floating restaurants and hotels, and other vessels.    The basic advantages of ships with a reinforced concrete  hull  include low metal-intensity and construction cost, low operating  costs (no dry-docking and painting required when in operation),  good durability and simple repair.    The following ships are now being series-built at various  enterprises from designs of the Monolit Central Design Bureau  Joint-Stock Company: floating composite and metal repair docks  with a load capacity of 5,000 t (including those for docking  ships of the fishing industry fleet), floating workshops with a  reinforced concrete hull, floating berths, metal and reinforced  concrete, 154 and 108 m long, berthside pontoons, and floating  cranes with a load capacity of 5 t.    Specialists of the Central Design Bureau are also producing  designs for dimensional modernization of docks, and are  preparing the documentation to provide marine communications for  ships running along inland waterways.  <H5>  PeterGaz Joint Venture </H5>   This Dutch-Russian joint venture (partners -- Kheerema Oil  and Gas Development and the Gas Industry) will design and build  an underwater gas pipeline through Baydaratskaya Bay, which will  connect the large gas deposits of Yamal with the main West  Siberian gas pipeline. The 70-km underwater section of the route  will include eight pipelines (1.22 m in diameter each), along  which 170 billion m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas a year can be  transported. The first two pipelines, worth $570 million, should  be laid by 1996, and the last of them is planned to be put into  operation in the year 2005. A number of Russian firms will be  drawn in to carry out the marine part of the project. Work will  be done under exceptionally difficult natural conditions.  Suffice to say that Baydaratskaya Bay, located beyond the Arctic  circle, is ice-free for a maximum of 100 days a year. The total  cost of the project is estimated at several billion dollars.    The materials used in the reports were from the  newspapers SUDOSTROITEL, OKEAN, MORE, VODNYY TRANSPORT, KORABEL,  TRUDOVAYA VAKHTA, KRASNYY SORMOVICH and others, as well as from  publicity brochures and materials given to the editors by  enterprises and organizations.

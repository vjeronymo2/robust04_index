			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / US trade gap narrows Tumbling oil prices helped narrow the US trade gap in November by 6.7 per cent, to Dollars 10.17bn, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. In the first 11 months of last year, the trade gap stood at an annualised Dollars 118.7bn, its highest level since Dollars 152.1bn, in 1987, the department said. The merchandise trade deficit for October was Dollars 10.9bn, revised from a previously reported Dollars 10.46bn. The trade deficit with Japan declined in November to Dollars 5.72bn before seasonal adjustment, after swelling to Dollars 6.09bn in October. The department said imports declined by 1.5 per cent in November to Dollars 50.24bn, due largely to a sharp Dollars 115.6m drop in the cost of oil imports to Dollars 3.09bn. Exports declined by 0.1 per cent to Dollars 40.07bn, reflecting decreases in industrial supplies and materials.</p>

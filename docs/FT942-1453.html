			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Arafat sits tight for a better financial deal: PLO chief delays trip to liberated Palestine The timing of Mr Yassir Arafat's first visit to the newly-liberated areas of Palestine could be decided as a result of emergency meetings in Washington today involving leading members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the World Bank and US officials. Mr Arafat, chairman of the PLO, has delayed announcing a date for his trip largely because he is not satisfied with the financial arrangements for the new self-governing authority which will take over responsibility for the Gaza strip, Jericho and later much of the West Bank. More than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) has so far been pledged by international donors for development projects in the territories over the next five years, but serious problems have arisen over start-up costs of the new Palestinian authority and covering its budget deficit in the first year of operation. Mr Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, who heads the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development (Pecdar), told donors earlier this month that Dollars 177m needed to be paid into a Palestinian account. 'Without it, we cannot build new administrations, or pay the police force and employees.' Mr Arafat said in Tunis on Tuesday that offers of cash aid so far were 'derisory'. Senior officials added that he would not decide on the date of his trip to Jericho until the issue was resolved. Aid donors have pledged Dollars 720m out of Dollars 2.3bn for the first year, of which Dollars 80m has been disbursed and a further Dollars 350m committed to specific projects. However, legal restraints prevent some governments from transferring aid pledges into direct budget support, while others are demanding additional 'transparency and accountability' by Palestinian institutions before releasing funds. The cost of covering start-up costs of the new Palestinian authority and its budget deficit this year is put at Dollars 168m. Some Dollars 91m had already been pledged before a donors' meeting in Paris earlier this month, which brought further commitments of Dollars 42m, including contributions from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which had previously refused to consider any direct cash payments to the Palestinians. These contributions have been paid into the Holst Fund, named after Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister, who played such a central role in facilitating the September 13 outline peace accord signed by the PLO and Israel. The fund, administered by the World Bank, stands at about Dollars 55m. PLO officials, headed by Mr Qurei, wish to know from the bank how quickly this money can be disbursed. At the same time, the PLO team will seek US help in pressing other donor nations to provide the remaining Dollars 35m required to satisfy budget and other costs until the end of this year. Members of Pecdar have emphasised it is difficult to engage in planning longer-term projects while immediate financing requirements for 1994 remain uncertain. Mr Arafat appears equally determined not to make his trip to the territories without having at his finger tips at least some of the financial patronage which over many years has helped sustain his authority.</p>

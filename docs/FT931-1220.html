			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Canberra plays down claims over Fairfax THE Australian government yesterday played down claims by Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian proprietor of The Telegraph UK newspaper group, that it would shortly approve his plans to buy more shares in John Fairfax. Mr Black told Reuters news agency that The Telegraph expected its application for permission to increase its stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent to be approved. 'We expect our bid to increase our shareholding to be successful,' Mr Black said. However, aides to Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister), said no decision had been made. 'I think he is being a little bit premature,' an official said. 'The issue has to be deliberated (sic) by caucus.' Mr Dawkins has until April 24 to decide whether to allow the increased shareholding, following an inconclusive report by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which vets overseas investment proposals. In practice, the final decision will be taken by the ruling Labor party's parliamentary caucus, which has previously sought to limit overseas holdings in newspaper groups to a maximum 20 per cent. Officials say the government has discounted reports in the Fairfax press that Mr Black would sell the Telegraph's existing holding to Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian entrepreneur, if his application is denied. Under Australian cross-media ownership laws, Mr Packer would be limited to a 15 per cent holding in Fairfax, provided he could show that the shareholding would not give him control of the group. Fairfax is the main competitor to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation group. Its titles include the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age, the Australian Financial Review and Business Review Weekly.</p>

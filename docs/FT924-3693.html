			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Gardening: Peat bogs get the bird - Country View IF THE boom of the bittern is a sound which stirs your heart, or you thrill to the long low glide of a marsh harrier floating above feathery reed heads bending in the breeze, then the Somerset Levels will certainly be worth visiting. The Somerset Trust for Nature Conservation has secured Pounds 90,000 from the EC towards a Pounds 180,000 pilot project to turn worked-out peat diggings into areas for suitable wildlife. Although it still needs to raise a large proportion of the remainder, it has already put in hand the initial stages of the project work. The final area, dubbed the Avalon Marshes, should exceed 3,500 acres although the pilot scheme will look at less than 10 per cent of that. Nevertheless, the announcement that the freehold of Fison's peat bogs will be passing to English Nature - although the company intends to continue working many of them - may help to increase this figure before the end of the project. As a result the trust has given a cautious welcome to Fisons' proposals largely because, in that company's Somerset ownership, there is little original peat bog left to destroy. Conservationists are much more worried about the indirect effects of the peat industry for the continued pumping, necessary to lower water levels for peat extraction, is still damaging wildlife reserves of national importance. Peat is funny stuff. When it is wet it can become so waterlogged it turn almost to slurry, but if it ever dries out then it is difficult to impregnate with water again. Rain runs off or slides into the surface cracks and then trickles out of these into the ditches leaving the underlying peat dry, friable and constantly shrinking. Fisons has promised to take immediate measures to protect the water table but one Somerset Trust reserve is so badly desiccated that Dr Christopher Hancock, conservation officer, says it will be touch and go to save it. Usually little peat is left once the extracting companies have finished and most of the peat diggings have been stripped down to their clay beds. By carefully using a mixture of clay and what little peat does remain, a mosaic of islands, reed beds and deeper water can be created. For five years the trust has worked wonders on a small reserve of 66 acres within the pilot study area. The list of birds to be seen from its hides is impressive and includes reed warbler, Cetti's warbler, water rail, various species of duck, including breeding gadwall and garganey and, yes, marsh harrier and bittern do call in from time to time. But while the Avalon Marshes may sound like a location from an Arthurian legend, the area will not look as it did before peat was extracted to feed the enormous appetites of garden centres nor will it have the same wildlife interest. Instead, it will appear very much as it did 6,000 years ago, before the peat began to build up. Restoration is going to be a long-term project.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON U.S. INTERESTS AND ISRAELI-ARAB TENSIONS  </P> <P> When I noticed that Patrick J. Buchanan had written a column ( "A PLO Trick  Shores Up Shamir's Web," Commentary, June 3), I expected to see Buchanan's  typical anti-Israeli-tinged dribble. Predictably, I was not disappointed.  </P> <P> First, I found interesting Buchanan's choice of words for the PLO's attempted  massacre of civilians, i.e., a "trick." How are five speedboats and 16  guerrillas armed with rockets and machine guns called a "trick"? Then, when  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is rightly outraged by this act he is censured  because the near-tragedy simply served to "shore up Shamir's web."  </P> <P> Buchanan vituperates against Israel at the end of his article as to the U.S.  support of Israel, questioning what vital interest of ours was at risk in the  1967 war. I find it confusing how Buchanan can spend nearly a lifetime opining  about the evils of totalitarian communist regimes and at the same time not see  the advantages to lending U.S. support to the only democracy in the Middle  East.  </P> <P> MARK D. KALE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Romeo Dallaire, UN Assistance </F> Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) commander, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Dallaire] [Words indistinct] attract the  attention of UNAMIR and the gendarmerie on their concern about  the security situation in the area, given that people have been  wounded in the last few days [words indistinct] by hurled  grenades.    So demonstrators stopped vehicles, from which they removed  people. They injured people and damaged cars. What's more,  they blocked the road.    [Unidentified correspondent] It has been reported that the  Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] left the premises of the National  Development Council [CND] and shot at demonstrators. What do  you have to say about this?    [Dallaire] This is absolutely untrue. An armed escort of  the RPF that was accompanying an RPF leader came out of the CND  to attend a meeting. When they encountered the demonstrators,  they shot in the air--only in the air--so that they could pass.  This was done twice.    [Correspondent] But it has been said that there were wounded  people among the demonstrators as a result of the shots fired by  RPF elements.    [Dallaire] This is totally untrue.    [Correspondent] So you are saying that no one was wounded?    [Dallaire] There was no one wounded as a result of shots by  the RPF or the gendarmerie. Those wounded were injured by the  demonstrators because they were [word indistinct] from their  vehicle to block the road.    [Correspondent] What caused the exchange of shots between  the gendarmerie and RPF elements?    [Dallaire] This happened because the RPF was without a  UNAMIR escort.    [Correspondent] People say that the RPF elements operated  with the complicity of UNAMIR. What is the truth about this,  General?    [Dallaire] Well, I would like them to provide proof [words  indistinct].    [Correspondent] General, are you planning to ensure that  such cases do not recur in the area?    [Dallaire] [Words indistinct] I hope I will convince the  prefect of Kigali to [?support] the [?communique] [word  indistinct] we presented on [?1] January in which we asked him  to support the gendarmerie chief of staff and ourselves in  halting demonstrations in the area surrounding the CND premises  that accommodate the RPF. This is one thing. Second, we are  [?carrying] a document of [word indistinct] to the RPF that  reflects our dissatisfaction regarding the procedures that were  [word indistinct] in the arms consignment area and that were not  respected this morning. I must also add that we are taking  measures to meet the local burgomaster and local people to  explain to them the existing security procedures in the area  lying between the gendarmerie and UNAMIR.</p>

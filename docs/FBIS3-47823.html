			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vienna-based correspondent Han Ki-pong: "No </F> Progress in the Third Round of the Contact Between North  Korea-International Atomic Energy Agency"]    [Text] The atmosphere in Vienna, where the North  Korean-IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] negotiations  over nuclear inspections have been underway for three weeks, is  considerably different from the optimistic view Washington and  Seoul have had in early January. Even though the third round of  the official working-level contact between North Korea and the  IAEA side was held on 17 January, no "green light" was shown, as  expressed by the IAEA side. It has been learned that, through  steady contacts in New York at the end of last year, the United  States and North Korea reached a series of agreements on  resuming ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary [tongsang] inspections, on  the announcement of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit, on  resuming the working-level contact for exchanging the  North-South special envoys, and on resuming the third round of  North Korean-U.S. talks.    Accordingly, it was expected that the IAEA inspection team  would be able to enter the North by mid or late January, at the  latest, without any problems.    However, as soon as technical negotiations between North  Korea and the IAEA started, North Korea began to behave as  though it had forgotten the political agreement. Such an  atmosphere makes us believe that the U.S.-North Korean agreement  attaches more importance to the beginning of the IAEA-North  Korean negotiations to conduct ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary  [tongsang] inspections, than to the resumption of full-scale ad  hoc and ordinary inspections.    Actually, it is believed at the IAEA that, because the  Clinton administration wants to have a diplomatic success, it  might make "an early announcement."    The subjects of the three rounds of the official North  Korean-IAEA negotiations have been: sounding out mutual  positions (on 7 January), delivering the IAEA's technical demand  conditions regarding inspections to North Korea (on 10 January),  and delivering the North Korean side's position toward the  IAEA's demand conditions (on 17 January).    The IAEA side has kept silent about the concrete contents of  the negotiations. However, it has been learned that the great  stumbling blocks to the negotiations are the scope of the  inspections and technical issues. Among the seven nuclear  facilities North Korea reported to the IAEA, North Korea has  felt particularly nervous about the 5-MW Yongbyon experimental  reactor, which is the most important one in clearing North  Korea's nuclear suspicion; and a radiochemical laboratory,  suspected to be a reprocessing facility. North Korea has assumed  the position that it can receive restricted inspections by just  allowing the replacement and repair of the existing monitoring  equipment. North Korea has claimed that this is enough to  guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord.    The IAEA holds that the ad hoc inspections are aimed at  verifying the accuracy and integrity of the reported facilities,  that there is no alternative but to conduct full-scale and  unconditional inspections.    Along with this, it has been learned that the issue  concerning the number of inspections has yet to be resolved.    Regardless of the level of the political agreement reached  between the United States and North Korea, it is certain that  North Korea is once again trying to buy time.    North Korea has come to avoid international sanctions by  beginning negotiations with the IAEA. It seems that North Korea  is employing a two-pronged policy to leave behind a "nuclear  suspicion," at the most, during negotiations with the IAEA.  This is the very strategy North Korea had employed for the past  year. Whenever North Korea has been driven to a corner, it has  used a hard-line strategy of worsening the situation and  benefiting from it. For example, when North Korea was faced  with the pressure of special inspections, it withdrew from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It will be two years in April  since the nuclear safeguards accord was effectuated. However,  North Korea has refused to receive even the ad hoc inspection,  which is the most basic stage of the inspection, not to mention  special inspections. North Korea has diverted the people's  focus of attention elsewhere so that they regard even the  resumption of the ad hoc inspection as progress in the nuclear  issue.    It seems as though North Korea this time thinks it can still  buy time. The fourth round of the IAEA-North Korean  negotiations may be held on 19 or 20 January. However, it is  difficult to expect that North Korea will change its position at  once.    North Korea will probably accept full-scale ad hoc  inspections at a time when it believes that it can obtain the  greatest benefit from the third round of the high-level talks  with the United States.    It seems that North Korea has planned it can prevent the  issue of special inspections from being a key point in the  agenda at the third round of the high-level talks.</p>

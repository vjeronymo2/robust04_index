			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGASSI SHOULD WORK ON SUBSTANCE OVER STYLE  </P> <P> I have never been more provoked to write a letter in response to an article  than after I read about Andre (Endorsements Have Gone to My Head) Agassi.  </P> <P> It is a tragic scenario to see a great talent like Agassi striving for  recognition as a flash rather than striving for tennis excellence at Centre  Court at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Grow up, kid, and have your agent call mine to talk about designing you some  new outfits with an emphasis on white.  </P> <P> LONNIE BERGER, Van Nuys  </P></p>

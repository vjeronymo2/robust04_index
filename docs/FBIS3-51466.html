The Cuban diplomat was interviewed by EFE before leaving the  Angolan capital, where he was received by President Jose Eduardo  Dos Santos and high-ranking officials of the government,  parliament, and the government's Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola (MPLA).    "Current contacts between Cuba and the United States are  limited to immigration talks, which have not reached a  stalemate; certain Coast Guard-border guard contacts; some joint  operations against drug traffickers; and a telecommunications  deal that is at a deadlock," Robaina said.    Roberto Robaina emphasized that the new element in  Cuban-U.S.  relations "is that (President Bill) Clinton's administration has  yet to use the aggressive language that characterized relations  between the two countries during Republican administrations."    "Even though that doesn't mean much, it is something that  may  surprise certain people," Robaina said, adding that, personally  speaking, he would rather not become "overly enthusiastic."    The Cuban foreign minister said he is frequently asked if,  as  head of Cuban diplomacy, he does not feel some frustration  because some of Cuba's hopes have not been fulfilled -- meaning  the normalization of relations and a suspension of the economic  embargo imposed 30 years ago by Washington for ideological  reasons -- with the arrival of the Clinton administration.    Robaina said: "I feel no frustration whatsoever, because,  personally speaking, I made no plans beyond what is happening  and because I understand that the new U.S. Administration is not  what it really wants to be."    The Cuban diplomat thinks President Clinton is being subject  to heavy pressure, above all from the most "reactionary" members  of the Cuban community in the United States, who preclude any  constructive steps toward Cuba.    Without mentioning U.S. black leader Jesse Jackson's recent  visit to Cuba, the Cuban minister, who is visiting Angola for  the first time since he replaced Isidoro Malmierca in the post  last year, admitted that "there are other nobler areas" where  work can be done concerning the United States.    He said the goal is to create an appropriate atmosphere to  someday allow the emergence of much more important elements of  the U.S. people and to encourage the normalization of relations  between these two countries, which are separated by a mere 150  km of sea.    Robaina said Latin America and Cuba are no longer a  "priority" for the U.S. Administration, although he admitted  that the situation could change given the complex international  situation.    The minister said Cuba is willing to talk about the  normalization of relations if the United States does not come to  the negotiating table with "conditions or stipulations," adding  that no one in his country would accept "subordinate conditions."    "We are prepared to discuss any topic (with the United  States) because we believe anything can result if we talk about  any given issue," Robaina said, but our "independence,  sovereignty, and ability to state our own opinion" will not be  on the negotiating table."    The Cuban diplomat said negotiations concerning the  normalization of relations "should not begin with the most  complicated issues," because an appropriate atmosphere must  first be created.    Robaina said that Cuba believes that "nothing has been  gained" by submission. "Life gave us the privilege of seeing  that those who began by giving in were compelled to continue  down that road, even when they had little left to give."    Moreover, Robaina said that during his visit to Angola his  hosts told him about the current peace talks in Lusaka between  the government and the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola (UNITA) guerrilla forces.    He said they also analyzed the possibilities of increasing  cooperation between Luanda and Havana "on a new basis."    Robaina, who has already visited Ghana, today traveled to  Zimbabwe. He will later visit Zambia and Namibia.    Over 350,000 Cubans went to Angola over a 15-year period as  part of the so-called "internationalist missions."    Cuba withdrew its troops from Angola after signing  tripartite  agreements in New York in 1988. The agreement did not bring  about a normalization of relations with the United States, one  of the guarantor countries.</p>

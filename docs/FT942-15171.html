			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Accident insurance claim batters Aker shares The shares of Aker, the Norwegian cement, oil and technology group, plunged yesterday on the Oslo bourse following revelations that it faced a NKr2.4bn (Dollars 324m) insurance claim over the sinking of a concrete gas platform in 1991. Bringing the claim is a group of insurers seeking to recoup payouts for the accident. Aker's A shares closed down NKr10 to NKr96.50 on the news; B shares lost NKr11 to NKr95.50; and free shares shed NKr10 to NKr97.50 in active trading which saw 5.4 per cent of Aker's total share capital changing hands. Aker's Norwegian Contractors unit was building the Sleipner A platform for Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for work in the North Sea Sleipner gas field. With the edifice nearly complete, the substructure was being submerged during preparations for towing to the field when one of its three shafts took in too much water, causing it to sink rapidly. The claim by a syndicate of underwriters and captive insurers is being led by Vesta, the Norwegian unit of Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. Ancon, the insurance company of Exxon, is also involved. Exxon's Norway unit, Esso Norway, is the second-biggest shareholder in the Sleipner field. Aker said yesterday it considered the claim to be unjustified, as no new information had emerged since initial investigations into the cause of the mishap.</p>

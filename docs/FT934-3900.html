			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: SIB tackling pensions transfer problem from wrong end Sir, The Securities and Investment Board is attacking the problem of people disadvantaged by taking transfer payments from occupational to personal pension schemes from the wrong end. The real problem is with the cash equivalents of the deferred benefits given up. I expect parliament intended that deferred pensioners should be able to rely on transfer payments being fair and that they would not need to obtain advice on the adequacy of transfer payments offered. Cash equivalents are not defined in the legislation, a point on which the Goode Report failed to comment. The basis of cash equivalents is decided by the scheme's actuary under professional guidance notes. According to the Institute of Actuaries one of the purposes of the guidelines is 'to ensure that members of retirement benefit schemes exercising a right to a transfer value can be assured that it fairly reflects their reasonable expectation of benefits otherwise available on withdrawal'. If this purpose were fulfilled a member would not need to worry about loss of value on transferring to a personal pension plan, but merely the choice of the best plan. However, parliament's intention and the institute's guidance sadly appear not to be working. The matter is, in practice, a minefield and the member contemplating a transfer needs an adviser with the technical skill of an actuary, the wisdom of Socrates and the knowledge of Jove. The problem goes much deeper than the SIB may think. Tom Shucksmith, Shucksmith &amp; Co, Consulting Actuaries, Lincoln House, Nutley Lane, Reigate, Surrey</p>

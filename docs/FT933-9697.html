			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Private View: Moslem zealot feels the lash 0 Kalim Siddiqui, leader of Britain's Moslem 'parliament', says the west is conducting a crusade to crush Islam IF THE West allows Sarajevo to fall to the Serbs there is one voice which may be hard to ignore in the ensuing outcry: that of Kalim Siddiqui, the self-styled leader of the Moslem 'parliament' in Britain. Siddiqui, an adroit pro-Iranian publicist, has faded from view since his notorious endorsement of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses. Now he has called a 'world conference' on the Bosnian tragedy which, he claimed this week, is further evidence of a Christian crusade to crush Islam. For Siddiqui believes - or says he does - that western leaders are engaged in a systematic deception over Bosnia based on deep enmity for Islam. President Clinton's threat to strike the Serbs was, he said, 'a downright lie, to hold the headlines while the Serbs do their dirty work.' Kalim Siddiqui lives on a working-class housing estate in Slough and, from the house next door, runs the Moslem Institute he founded in 1972. He was born in India and came to Britain via Pakistan in 1954 to work as a provincial journalist. He was a sub-editor on The Guardian for eight years until the Iranian revolution greatly enlarged his prospects. But for a London University-educated journalist with a PhD he shows a surprising disregard for facts: his allegations are vague, his language rhetorical, his logic slippery. Siddiqui is a unelected politician, a strict Moslem who uses his religion as a rallying cry for the social grievances of poorer Asian immigrants. Yet during more than an hour's conversation he never once mentioned racial discrimination. For him it is all about state-inspired religious discrimination against Moslems. His claim to represent the view of the majority of Britain's Moslems is hotly disputed by prominent co-religionists. Moslems all over Europe were feeling unsafe because of Bosnia, he claimed. I suggested Europeans were afraid of Islamic militancy. 'You frighten them. We are not militant. We have not broken a single window. Am I militant? Do I look a militant? My neighbours will tell you I am the most docile fellow. Militant Islam itself is a creation of the West. Because the West wants to hit at Islam they want to create an image that can be hit. There is no such thing as militant Islam.' The phrase was used to describe any cause - like the Palestinians' - which conflicted with 'western colonial and imperialist interest'. Is Britain still a colonial power? 'Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Here in its own domestic policy Britain would like to see us remain here as an ex-colonial people, as a new underclass in Britain.' Have you been treated like that? 'Personally I have, yes. You know, I am a very integrated person as you can see, no doubt, with all the degrees you can name from the University of London - not from an overseas tinpot university.' He smiled with satisfaction. When later I asked if he felt a personal sense of grievance he said: 'No, no, no. I have been very well treated. No, I am very well integrated.' But the attitude of the native British irritates you? 'Yes, it does. Your attitude, today, has been very irritating.' Yes, I said. What is it that irritates you? 'Your superiority, your white man's burden, your colonial . . .' He broke off. 'You know . . . This little man from Pakistan sitting here in suburban Slough talking to me like this: shouldn't he be more docile to me? That is your attitude.' I'm trying to impose my colonial manners on you? 'Yes, yes. That I have somehow invaded British privacy by setting up a parliament here, you know, by identifying ourselves as Moslems we are offending the sensibilities of the British people.' I asked for examples of persecution by the Establishment. Siddiqui cited the Rushdie affair. I pointed out that Salman Rushdie was not exactly a member of the British Anglican Establishment. Much more convincing was his case for religious schools. 'We have been applying for 15 years and repeatedly told it wouldn't be allowed. We don't want favours, just our rights under the law. Voluntary-aided schools are denied us because we are a non-European culture and they fear that through our schools we would perpetrate a non-European culture on British soil. They would like us to assimilate. They call it integration but really they want to destroy our identity, our civilisation.' He agreed that Britain guaranteed freedom of worship 'so long as religion remains a matter between the individual and his Creator. As soon as it becomes politicised, then of course it becomes unacceptable.' Don't you agree with that? 'No, because we have a political culture of our own. The government doesn't mind if churches are only used once a week. But that is not my religion. I am here to make sure the Moslems of this country do not become an underclass, that they are lifted off the economic floor.' Are you using the religious weapon to get economic benefits for your community? 'I am not trying to get any economic benefit for them.' You said you were trying to lift them off the floor . . . Siddiqui changed tack and talked about unemployment, which he claimed was higher for Moslems than for other immigrants. His Moslem Institute has published a manifesto whose language of zealotry has been construed to mean that Siddiqui and his supporters want a state within a state. 'This is nonsense. of course. There are a number of states within a state: the Church of England, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the trade union movement. We can define a lawful purpose, we are exercising our freedom of association. 'We are not separatists. I want to insist that everything we want to do is within the framework of statute law. The moment I break the laws come and catch me. Then you are entitled to try me and jail me and quarter me and hang me.' I thought of the occasions during the Rushdie row when there were calls for Siddiqui to be prosecuted for incitement to murder. You have come quite close to it, I said. 'I am entitled to the entire width and breadth of the field,' he smiled. You were sailing pretty close to the wind. 'If you are sailing in rough waters as I do, I have to sail close to the wind. Give me the benefit of the doubt and say I am a good sailor.' The purpose of my visit had been to ask Siddiqui about the obligations of immigrants towards their adoptive country, and vice versa. I raised the first point. Siddiqui went off at a tangent, saying migration for Moslems was almost an obligation in itself. Did you migrate for theological reasons? 'No, I didn't migrate. I came as a student and stayed.' To get a benefit. 'To . . . to . . . to . . . ,' he spluttered. 'What does a student do?' Get a benefit, I repeated. 'You know, this is where your mentality is so crude. You can only think in terms of benefit. I am sorry about this. Your mentality comes out. Can you see how hostile you are, now, at this very moment? When you walk out of here, I will view you as a hostile person because you cannot see anything other than the benefit we have got out of it. You don't see what benefit we have given to this country.' We'll come on to that. 'No, no, you won't come on to it, because I know. You will never acknowledge it. The country will not acknowledge it. We were brought in to do the menial jobs, low wages, live in marginal housing and not to talk back to the Great Big White Man.' The British government, he said finally, had 'totally and miserably failed' in its obligation as host. 'We are a major civilisation, a major culture, a major religion. To expect us to walk down the gangway at Heathrow airport and say 'Right, at this moment I am now British, my culture is a thing of the past . . .'' That is not quite what I am suggesting, I said. I am talking about compromise. Siddiqui the sailor changed tack again. Now he was all sweet reason. 'You see, I believe in integration. It is essential, it is natural, it is the right thing to happen. It is like ageing. It will be two, three, four generations before it happens but in the meantime it is my duty to make sure my children are not trampled upon by the host culture. It has to be managed otherwise it will create hostilities on both sides.' What about the whole apparatus of community relations, equal opportunities, the race relations Act . . . 'This is such a trap,' he interrupted. . . . designed to help your people? 'No it's not. It's trying to divert us. It is designed to basically - your word - to oppress us.' Siddiqui said he had twice refused invitations to sit on race relations committees: they were attempts to prevent 'proper leaders' emerging. Why should a government encourage people like you to emerge and shout 'Unfair]'? 'If I have emerged why don't you let me get on with it? Why give me this demonising treatment in the media? You want to destroy me.' You have been created by the media, partly, too. It cuts both ways. 'It cuts both ways, yeah,' he admitted. Siddiqui's PhD thesis was called The Function of International Conflict and was about Pakistan. I said: You talk as if you prefer conflict to conciliation. 'No. That is not right. I don't like getting into the headlines, believe it or not. Please believe me. I am a victim of the Rushdie affair. I was brought out of my obscurity.' Isn't it very dangerous to stir people into thinking they are being persecuted for their religion rather than disadvantaged economically? 'I think you have made a very reasonable point. It is a valid point. I wish it were possible not to raise the issues in the terms in which I have had to raise them. But remember, the whole thing goes back to the Rushdie affair. There might not have been a Moslem parliament had it not been for The Satanic Verses.' There probably would have been no Kalim Siddiqui, either. 'You are absolutely right. I wanted to get on and do my own work. I am a political thinker. I did not expect to end up as a politician, as a public figure. This has destroyed my life. I am wasting my time talking to you now.' I had a sudden thought. Do you have an inferiority complex about English culture? I asked. He did not rant, but for the first time fell silent. 'Good question. I have never thought about it.' There was a long pause. 'Can't answer it. Don't know. I don't think so. If anything I think it's probably the other way round.' Siddiqui the fundamentalist firebrand seemed to have evaporated. In his place sat a tubby, self-important character with a grey beard, fresh face and soulful eyes. He looked about as dangerous as something out of Snow White.</p>

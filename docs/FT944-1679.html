			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Last ditch efforts at Stanhope - Receivership looms unless a deal can be agreed with its lenders With less than 24 hours to go before its banking facilities expire, Stanhope, the property developer run by Mr Stuart Lipton, was last night making last ditch efforts to stave off receivership. Since the last formal meeting of Stanhope's 16 lenders last Tuesday, intensive discussions have taken place between the company, its banks and potential rescuers. The banks, led by Barclays, must either extend their Pounds 140m loans beyond today's repayment deadline or force the company into receiver-ship. The two main rescue proposals have come from Postel, the post and telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, and British Land, the property investment company headed by Mr John Ritblat. While both rescue packages have been refined to offer Stanhope's lenders better terms, the banks would still have to write off up to 20p in the pound on their loans. Alternatively, Stanhope believes it has found an investor willing to provide working capital in return for an equity stake in the company, if the banks agree to a debt standstill of up to three years. The company hopes that the value of its main asset - a 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate developments in the City of London - would rise sufficiently during the standstill period to give the banks full repayment. However, the banking syndicate has been unable to agree on a course of action. Some of Stanhope's banks also made loans to Broadgate Properties and Rosehaugh, which owns the other half of Broadgate and is already in receivership. KPMG Peat Marwick would be favourite to be appointed receiver at Stanhope. It already acts for the banks at Rosehaugh and could therefore handle the disposal of Broadgate Properties as a single entity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Zhiltsov under the rubric "Flight Safety: </F> Search, Resolution": "The Rescue Capsule..."]    [Text] ...increases considerably the likelihood of  rescue for people in accidents on land or at sea, as well as in  natural disasters.    Aviation hardware is improved from year to year, but  unfortunately it cannot yet be said that the number of accidents  and crashes is being reduced, and people are killed every year.  But it is not a matter of the hardware alone--natural  catastrophes, before which people are helpless, make their  contribution as well. But we are quite able to reduce the number  of casualties; we need only take up the matter seriously and  remember that the greater number of lethal instances are  observed in the first hours after a disaster, when shock,  confusion, disarray, serious injuries, great loss of blood and  lack of essentials lead to irreversible consequences. Suffice it  to recall the demise of the Admiral Nakhimov, the earthquake in  Armenia or the tragic incident with the submarine in the bitter  polar waters. So many casualties could have been averted if help  had come even an hour sooner!    The rescuers, it is true, did not arrive on time in those  specific cases for entirely objective reasons--the remoteness of  the location of the catastrophe, the lack of the equipment  necessary in such cases, damage to rail sidings and airfields.  Only air drops of specialists and technical gear, and moreover  immediately, could have radically altered the situation. Far  from every specialist, unfortunately, is able to make a  parachute jump, the more so into an unprepared area or into the  water, in many cases in pitch darkness as well. The rescuers  themselves could be turned into the target of rescue as well in  bad weather conditions or on rugged terrain. One also cannot  fail to take into account that the separate dropping of people  and gear often leads to unjustifiably large losses of time.    An analysis of catastrophes and natural disasters that have  occurred makes it possible to conclude that the effectiveness of  first aid measures, and all aid in general, is determined by the  following conditions:    --the availability of means to deliver rescue gear,  equipment  and rescuers to the site of the catastrophe;    --the presence at the site of the catastrophe of specialists  who can provide for the effective utilization of  emergency-rescue and medical equipment in the area of the  catastrophe or natural disaster;    --the time to bring the gear into readiness for utilization.    These conditions are met only through the air drop of highly  trained, first-class specialists together with the appropriate  gear (equipment).    A special container for the group air drop of rescue  specialists and the necessary gear has been developed for just  that purpose at the Experimental Machine-Building Plant [EMZ]  imeni V.M. Myasishchev.    It must be acknowledged that work on this type of descent  apparatus had already been pursued, but not at all for the  purposes that we are talking about. The idea of the possible  application of this container in rescue operations appeared only  in the middle of the 1980s, largely thanks to impending  conversion.    Two versions of the apparatus were developed--one with  uncontrolled parachute descent, and one with controlled  parachute descent and an engine for movement in the water.    Several containers of the uncontrolled type have been built  over the last seven years. They have completed the stage of  design testing, and have been tried out in dozens of drops both  without people and with people on board. This container is  currently ready for series production. It is manufactured of  duralumin, and is cylindrical in shape. The weight of one fully  equipped is 2,300 kg [kilograms], with a carrying capacity of  five people plus 300 kg of cargo (one tonne in the cargo  version). The drop altitudes range from 400 to 8,000 meters.    The testing was conducted using An-12, Il-76, Tu-95 and 3M  aircraft, and had positive results. The parachute system  employed on the container is the same as the one on the Soyuz  descent craft, and operates according to the configuration of  forced deployment of the drogue parachute--actuation of the  stabilizing system--deployment of the main system. A reserve  parachute is also planned. The rated G-forces should have been  15 when the main canopy opened; in experimental drops they  rarely exceeded 13 (10--13). The time for operation is 0.05--0.1  second.    The crew of the container is accommodated in Kazbek seats,  the type installed in the descent craft of the Soyuz spacecraft.  They are somewhat modified in this version, and have inflatable  cushioning. The container is entirely airtight with an oxygen  reserve on board for five hours, along with communications gear  and a source of electric power. The craft is very easy to  operate and sits low in the water, making it easy to fish people  and various essential objects out of the water, much easier than  from a rescue boat. The rescue module has a good stability  reserve thanks to that low center of gravity and the presence of  special runners. The wave crest washes over the container when  performing operations at sea in storms of three or more, rather  than swamping it. The container maintains its orientation, thus  surpassing the means of sea rescue currently in existence, from  cutters (Yersh and Gagara class) to the not-very-widespread  ground-effect craft.    The design engineering of the rescue capsule allowed for  five  drops, but testing has shown that its durability is considerably  greater. All of the capsules withstood use more than ten times,  and one container was destroyed only on the 48th drop.    The controllable capsule is still in the development stage,  during which a host of difficult problems will have to be  solved--automatic controlled descent and landing on a very  restricted site in particular. The second version of this item,  despite the outward similarity, differs substantially, first and  foremost in the parachute system, which can be actuated at once,  i.e. without the use of a drogue chute and  stabilizing system. The canopy of the main system is controlled  either automatically or by commands from an aircraft, the ground  or right from the descent craft. There is also a reserve  parachute system.    There are four Kazbek seats installed on board, but without  cushioning, and one heated seat. The weight of the cargo is 300  kg in the cargo-passenger version (1,000 kg without passengers).  A 40-horsepower engine started from a generator, even in the air  if necessary, is planned for movement in the water. The craft  can be in autonomous mode for no less than six hours with  continuous operation of the engine and generator.    The circle of tasks that can be performed with this object  is  very broad. It includes first aid to the stricken or the supply  of electric power sources, special tools, tents, foodstuffs,  etc. in the initial stages of an air-rescue operation with the  joint drop of people and special gear. When it is dropped in the  cargo version, units ready for operation immediately after  landing (compressors, certain types of medical equipment,  heaters, firefighting gear, water-pumping modules, special  equipment for scuba operations etc.) can be supplied. The role  of the new rescue craft is particularly great in the delivery of  geological parties and expeditions in remote and  difficult-to-access regions, their supply and the performance of  repair operations on electric-power transmission lines and trunk  gas pipelines, as well as supplying populated areas in the event  of natural disasters.    The container may also be used as a storage device, as well  as an intermediate base during Arctic and Antarctic crossings.    It is difficult not to agree that the craft that have been  developed at the EMZ imeni V.M. Myasishchev are promising and  extremely necessary in today's unsettled times. The work,  however, is nonetheless not proceeding as it should. There are  problems with everything--the parachute fabric, the materials  and constituent items, the testing. One would like to believe  that these are temporary difficulties. Interest in obtaining  these containers is being displayed abroad as well, where  nothing analogous has been created.

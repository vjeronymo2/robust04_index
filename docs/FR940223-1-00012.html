			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposal to amend the delivery requirements for qualification as a supply plant should be adopted due to the changing conditions in the market. As a result of increases in milk production, pool supply plants are utilized less by pool distributing plants as a source of milk for bottling. Consequently, they may be unable to meet the order's present shipping requirements and maintain the producer status of dairy farmers that have been historically associated with this market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, three options are open to the operators of pool supply plants who find that their milk is not needed at pool distributing plants. First, despite the fact that the milk is not needed, they can move milk from the production area to pool plants in the metropolitan area, unload it, and pick up an equal amount of milk from the pool plant and return it to the pool supply plant location where the milk can then be processed into Class III products. This adversely affects the milk quality without even considering the costs of transportation, yield reduction, and milk volume loss. When milk is handled, abuse occurs to some extent. When milk is pumped into a plant, through equipment, and then reloaded and hauled back or hauled to another plant, this process affects the quality of the product. That can affect the milk's use for fluid products, depending on the amount of handling involved. It can also affect the quality of cheese that can be made from milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second alternative is to find another pool plant that has adequate pool sales and combine the two marketing reports. If the combined delivery percentage reaches 30 percent of the total production of the combined supply plants, then both plants qualify to participate in the pool. This option depends entirely on the pool supply plant's ability to find another supplier with adequate sales to cover the deficit and one who is willing to cooperate by allowing its volume to be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third option available to the supply plant operator is to request a temporary reduction in the delivery requirements. Paragraph 1124.7 3(c) allows the director of the Dairy Division to reduce or increase the delivery percentage by 10 percent upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully reviewing the testimony on this issue, it is concluded that the delivery requirements for qualification as a supply plant should be decreased from not less than 30 percent to not less than 20 percent. In view of the increases in milk production and the lower Class I utilization percentage, it is much more appropriate to permanently change the delivery requirements of the order than to rely on temporary revisions in shipping percentages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evidence shows that TCCA is committed to meet the needs of the fluid market. For example, on several occasions it has reduced its cheese production to supply loads of fluid milk to the Portland market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCCA is the largest Oregon-based dairy cooperative, handling approximately one-third of the milk produced in the State each day. Of the one and a half million pounds of milk handled daily, roughly 1.1 million pounds are used to produce cheese for the retail market and 400,000 pounds are shipped to the Portland market for sale to Class I milk handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lower shipping percentage for pool supply plants will not jeopardize the needs of the fluid market, particularly with the provision now in the order that permits the Director of the Dairy Division to increase the percentage on short notice should additional shipments become necessary. The lower percentage will, however, permit milk that has been historically associated with this market to continue to participate in the marketwide pool and, for this reason, it should be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment letter was received with respect to this part of the recommended decision. Darigold Farms stated that it was pleased with the adoption of this proposal and urged that it be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Status of a milk plant operated by a State institution under the Pacific Northwest order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pacific Northwest order should be amended to provide that a milk plant operated by a State institution, but which is not exempt from the provisions applicable to a producer-handler, may receive up to an average of 1,000 pounds per day of Class I milk from fully regulated handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order currently provides that ``any State institution shall be a producer-handler exempt from the provisions of this Section and &sect;&sect;1124.30 and 1124.32 with respect to milk of its own production and receipts from pool plants processed or received for consumption in State institutions and with respect to movements of milk to or from a pool plant.'' Thus, a State institution plant may buy bulk milk or packaged milk products as Class I milk without limits from pool plants for use in State institutions. If such a plant has sales to outlets other than State institutions, a limit on such purchases of 100 pounds per day average is applicable, and the plant must file reports, the same as any other producer-handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

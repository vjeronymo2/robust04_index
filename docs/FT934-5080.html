			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Reforms will help fund justice - Legal system There will be no increase in planned law and order expenditure to fund the government's new criminal justice proposals, Robert Rice writes. The crackdown on crime will be funded by maintaining previous spending plans in full and through management reforms, a re-ordering of priorities and private capital investment in prisons. Spending on the police service will rise by 4 per cent next year and, together with organisational reforms and changes in pay and conditions resulting from the Sheehy report, could result in provision for another 5,000 officers on the beat. Priority will be given to increasing the number of prison places. More than 2,000 extra places will be provided at existing prisons by 1996-97. Six prisons are to to be financed, built and run by the private sector. More than Pounds 100m will be provided over the next three years for secure training centres for juvenile offenders. Their construction will also be financed by private capital. Funding for victim support will increase by 15 per cent to just over Pounds 10m next year. But there will be a cut in previously planned spending on probation services. Overall total planned expenditure for Home Office services will be Pounds 6.26bn in 1994-95 rising to Pounds 6.43bn in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Details of the fundamental review of expenditure on legal services announced by the chancellor are expected to be published within the next two weeks. There has been a cut in the government's previous expenditure plans for running the courts and legal aid of Pounds 43m in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. Legal aid spending, however, will increase by Pounds 12m in 1995-96 over previous plans and a further Pounds 106m in 1996-97.</p>

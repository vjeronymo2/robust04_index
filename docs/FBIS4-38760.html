			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev by Eric </F> Meyer in Bishkek; date not given: "On the Democratization of  Kyrgyzstan]    [Text] [Meyer] This week, you are making a tour of Europe.  Of the five republics of former Soviet Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan  is considered to be the most democratic: Is this reputation  deserved?    [Akayev] It is well deserved. All our efforts are  concentrated on achieving this. Kyrgyzstan is founded on the  rule of law and is on the road to democracy. It is also true  that our process of democratization is proceeding at a faster  pace than in other countries in Central Asia. We have more  political parties than in France, and when it comes to freedom  of the press, the Kyrgyzstan's president is criticized more than  President Mitterrand!    [Meyer] Why?    [Akayev] I see three reasons. First, our democratic  traditions. We have always been the nomads of Central Asia, a  lifestyle which favors democracy. For example, our traditional  seat of power, the Council of Judges (Boloush) is elected. The  Kyrgyz are a very ancient people, older than the Kazakhs. We  can be traced back, in ancient Chinese texts, to as early as the  second century.    Another reason is our multi-ethnic structure: One Kyrgyz in  four is European, German, Russian, or another Slav. Finally,  our country has always been open to the outside world (except  during the Soviet era: editor's note). The Silk Road passed  through our land, which allowed us to assimilate traditions of  both the West and the East, and allowed us to quickly adapt to a  market economy; we are culturally prepared!    [Meyer] Why do people here so often hold up Switzerland as a  model of development for Kyrgyzstan?    [Akayev] In terms of state structure, we are closer to the  French model. Our Constitution reflects the French  Constitution, in terms of the separation of powers between the  president, the prime minister, parliament, and prefects. Our  fascination with Switzerland relates to something else.  Kyrgyzstan is like the reflection of Switzerland in Central  Asia. We also live in high mountains, the Ala-Too chain. Lake  Geneva is like our Lake Issyk Kul. Another similarity is that  both our peoples consist of three principal ethnic groups. With  its French-speaking, German-speaking, and Italian-speaking  cantons, Switzerland has been able to create a confederation.  We have 80 ethnic groups, but with three major ones: Kyrgyz,  Russians, and Uzbeks. Our journalists like to taunt me when I  say that Kyrgyzstan will become the Switzerland of Central Asia:  How, they think, can we compare ourselves to this "little giant"  with its high tech industry and advanced social system? My  answer: By building a state founded on the rule of law!    [Meyer] What do you expect from Europe and what can  Kyrgyzstan offer Europe in return?    [Akayev] I expect a great deal! We already have links with  Europe, with Switzerland and Germany for example, but they are  still fragile. We are the only country in the CIS to have made  the change to a market economy according to the criteria of the  IMF and the World Bank. We are now embarking upon the  renovation of economic structures, which requires investment and  technology transfer. Europe has both of these. I am seeking to  stimulate the interest of your private investors in the  reconstruction and conversion of our industries. In return, we  can offer preferential terms for mining rare metals and raw  materials used in the new technologies and the strategic field.  We also have a natural environment which is perfect for the  development of green tourism.    [Meyer] You are a scientist by training, rather than a  career  politician; does this background lead you to adopt a different  approach to your presidency?    [Akayev] You know Napoleon, when he wanted to reward his  mathematics teacher, Laplace, he made him interior minister.  Shortly afterwards, as Laplace was constantly bothering him with  one little problem after another, the emperor decorated him, at  the same time sending him packing to continue his beloved  studies. I never use my scientific methods in politics. I  prefer to use the experience of previous great politicians whose  memoirs I read, such as de Gaulle, or Eisenhower. The other day  when I was in Moscow at the theater for a performance of "Fouche  and Talleyrand," a very popular play at the moment, I said to  myself: "I need ministers like that." When he got up in the  morning, Fouche knew everything which had happened during the  night, even in the Emperor's chamber. But my interior minister  does not even know what is happening inside his ministry. My  finance minister is unable to collect more than 35 percent or 40  percent of the taxes. Fouche collected 200 percent, and without  annoying anybody! After the Great Depression, Roosevelt, who  was advised to form a government of scientists, replied:  "Scientists are like sugar in your coffee. If there are too  many, it's undrinkable!" So I try to develop realpolitik.  <H5>  We Are Trying To Curb Russian Emigration </H5>   [Meyer] Is there a risk of ethnic rifts in Kyrgyzstan?    [Akayev] This problem is arising throughout Central Asia.  Our large Russian minorities are emigrating. It is a natural  process. France and Great Britain experienced the same thing in  the 1950's and 1960's, and the return of the Algerian-born  Frenchmen could have had serious consequences in France if there  had not been men like de Gaulle or Pompidou around at that time.  We have had ethnic problems, but so far we have managed to  avoid the worst. The departure of the Russians is one of the  conditions of democratization, but these Russians are also  qualified workers. We are trying to curb their departure.    [Meyer] One of your big problems is corruption. What is the  scope of corruption?    [Akayev] It has always existed, and there is no doubt that  it  is getting worse during this transitional period. We are seeing  some people grow breathtakingly wealthy while the mass is on the  brink of poverty. If we do not manage to halt it, then the  situation could explode. We need more than our forces alone to  fight it. Foreign influence, in the form of joint ventures,  technologies, and new blood, can only be a good thing.  <H5>  Maintaining the Balance Between China and Russia </H5>   [Meyer] What are your relations with China, your big  neighbor  on the other side of the Tian Shan mountains, unknown territory  during the 30 years of Cold War, until 1989.    [Akayev] This question is of crucial importance for all of  Central Asia. As a region, we are flanked by two superpowers.  We see them as two wings to help us take off. Flying on these  two wings is our guarantee of sovereignty. Russia is our main  ally and leading trade partner. I hope we can bequeath this  stability, which is the fruit of our parents' efforts, to our  children. Our Russian cultural and scientific heritage serves  as our opening to the world. Through Russia, we are European,  the children of Montesquieu and Diderot.    For us, however, China is 1,000 km of border and 2,000 years  of common history. The first working school in this country was  Chinese. Via the Silk Route, the Chinese traded their textiles  for our sturdier horses. I pray to God that Russia and China  will always maintain good relations, because that is an  essential condition for our security and the security of all  Eurasia!    [Meyer] During his recent visit, did Chinese Prime Minister  Li Peng ask you to bring under Chinese administration the  Uighurian exile organizations from Xinjian ?    [Akayev] No. We have 24 ethnic organizations. We appreciate  their desire to be different and to maintain their identity, on  a strictly cultural level. Our relations with China are  normalizing, and it cannot put pressure on us.    [Meyer] Do you see the possibility of a rebirth of the  ancient empires of Central Asia, in a confederal or other form?    [Akayev] No. There will be no rebirth of the Turkestan of  old. Uzbeks and Kyrgyzis, for example have the same linguistic  and religious roots, but are very different. Our goals are the  same: To build a democracy based on a market economy. However,  the paths we have chosen are not the same. Another example can  be seen in the fact that the Turkmenistan's president wants to  return to authoritarian methods to establish democracy. We do  not have the same approach. It is impossible to restore  Turkestan under these conditions.    However, there are things which we must recreate together:  The democratic area and the borderless market that existed  1,000 years ago in Central Asia; the free trade of goods and  labor. The wellbeing of the peoples leads to solidarity. Three  presidents, Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Karimov of Uzbekistan, and  myself, recently signed an agreement to avoid any hindrances to  trade. Finally, we must avoid using the concept of Turkestan as  a political pawn to counterbalance China: Nothing will be done  against China.</p>

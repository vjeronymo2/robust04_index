			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Trusts zero in on pensions - Life offices' monopoly is under threat as deadline nears for disclosure of charges Investment and unit trust groups are gearing up to take a larger slice of the personal pension market and break the virtual monopoly of the life offices. Dunedin is the latest to launch an investment trust personal plan, following Foreign &amp; Colonial's successful venture earlier this year, while Framlington's plan brings the number of unit trust personal pensions to four including Gartmore, Invesco and Rothschild Asset Management. (Mercury offers a low-cost plan through its life arm while Fidelity and Murray Johnstone offer group, but not individual, plans). Dunedin and Framlington claim to offer low-cost products. Both have a set-up charge of Pounds 100 and an annual fee thereafter of Pounds 50. Framlington's plan looks particularly attractive for higher premiums. For contributions over Pounds 2,000, the initial charge of 3 per cent (5 per cent for lower premiums) is competitive while the annual management charge of 0.4 per cent is very low. Dunedin also offers good value, with no initial charge and an annual management charge of 1 per cent. It is difficult at present for consumers to compare these costs with life office plans because life offices do not have to reveal their true charges until January. But one of the advantages of unit and investment trusts is that charges must be explicit, although not all of the plans available are low cost. Trusts use single-premium pricing, which means that the charges you pay relate only to that premium. With a typical regular-premium life office plan, the charges are weighted heavily to the early years so, if you stop payments during this period, you will have little or nothing to show for your money. With unit trust and investment trust plans, there are no penalties if you stop or reduce premiums or want to transfer your fund to another provider. Several life offices have switched already to single-premium pricing, or plan to do so. This is because they believe that after January, when consumers can see the effect that charges have on their investments, they will avoid plans that incorporate high up-front costs and inflexible contract terms. There are other options for those interested in unit and investment trusts. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the pensions for partnerships department at consulting actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Investors prepared to pay larger contributions should also consider a self-invested personal pension (Sipp).' Sipps separate the administration and investment management and, for larger contributions, offer a comparatively low-cost route to virtually any form of investment including almost all the unit and investment trust funds. Contacts: Framlington, tel: 0345-775 511; Dunedin, 0722-415 890. Both groups offer a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) to top up company pensions. You should always seek independent financial advice before selecting a pension plan.</p>

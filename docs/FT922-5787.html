			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Fiat deal demands by Polish unions LAST-MINUTE union protests have dogged talks - expected to end today - between Fiat and the Polish government on the sale to the Italian motor company of a majority share in the FSM car plant. Union leaders at the Tychy plant, one of two in the FSM combine, were continuing to insist yesterday on being consulted about the terms of the agreement which Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, is expected to sign in Warsaw today. FSM at present produces Fiat's new Cinquecento model at Tychy as well as the 1970's Fiat 126 car at Bielsko Biala. Government officials are due at FSM in southern Poland today to outline the agreement to union representatives who are demanding there be no immediate job losses as a result of the deal. Three unions - Solidarity, the OPZZ (the old pro-Communist movement), and Solidarity 80 (a radical group) - are co-ordinating their protest at Tychy, which employs 7,000 of the factory's 23,000 workers. Tychy's unions are also demanding that the share of production costs devoted to wages remain at the same level as in Fiat plants in Italy and elsewhere. Under the deal, which was provisionally agreed last week, Fiat will invest Dollars 2bn and will ultimately control 90 per cent of the company's equity. It will be taking responsibility for FSM's outstanding foreign currency debts worth Dollars 500m, as well as sums due to domestic suppliers worth more than Dollars 200m. Fiat will add Dollars 180m into the company's capital and will cover FSM's losses for the next four years. Fiat has also promised to make new investments worth Dollars 850m.</p>

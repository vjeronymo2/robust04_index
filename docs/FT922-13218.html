			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Arts: Civic pride triumphant - Architecture Chicago is a great architectural city. It is a proud place with a palpable sense of built civic pride. It is a wonderful sensation to fly in over the flat plains and see the pattern of giant fields turn into the grid of the city. It is a loose grid that gradually gets tighter and tighter until it reaches the densely interwoven streets of The Loop and then relaxes again as the city spills quietly along the green shores of Lake Michigan. Buildings bristle from the grid growing taller and taller until they culminate in the confident cluster of the Sears Tower - still the tallest building the world. The city's architecture divides neatly into two schools. First, from the 1880's the early steel frame architecture of firms like William Le baron Jenney, Burnham and Root and Holabird and Roche dominated the commercial growth of the city. That great American architect Louis Sullivan also worked in Chicago with Dankmar Adler at that time, inventing a style that was both functional and ornamental and that has seldom been improved upon. The second Chicago school, flowering from the late 1930's, demonstrated that the cool rationalism of architects like Mies van der Rohe could elevate the functional glass and steel block into crystalline elegance. In between these schools lies the distinctive and unique work of Frank Lloyd Wright, who invented the strongly horizontal 'prairie houses' for the Chicago suburbs. These are renowned for their casual but organised open plans and a special sense of the tactile and visual qualities of good, natural materials. Recently a new major civic building opened in Chicago which could mark the beginning of a third wave of architectural development. The city decided that it wanted a great new public library to be named after the city's first black mayor - The Harold Washington Library Centre. The architectural competition was won by Thomas Beeby, of the Chicago firm of Hammond, Beeby and Babka. Their solution was completely unlike any of the other entries because it is a powerful Beaux Arts-inspired, American classical scheme, dense in ornament and nourished by all the richness of Chicago's architectural tradition. The library occupies an entire city block between State and Congress streets. Occupies is the right word because the building completely fills the site in a traditional way - rising from the pavements with no hint of plaza or forecourt to break up the powerful grid of streets. It is 10 stories high, rising from a granite base with great arched windows beneath a pediment which is below a curved vaulted roof. The scale is remarkable and from a distance the soaring arched windows seem to suggest that New York's Grand Central station has come to Chicago. No one can doubt the powerful effect of civic grandeur that this new building conveys. The exterior is temple-like: at the same time as it evokes classical memories it seems to be reminiscent of so many European nineteenth century temples of the arts, from the Paris Opera to the Berlin museum. It is a coherently beautiful building gaining much of its presence from the fact that it is in the four square Chicago tradition - a great warehouse of books but one garbed in the civic dress that celebrates the fact that learning and knowledge are civilised and worthwhile aspirations. The civic dress is both strong and decorative. The colour of the exterior is a very pleasing combination of pinkish stone and brick with a green metal and glass attic and copper roof. It looks particularly rich and natural in a city that has too many blank towers faced in brown reflective glass. Additional richness is provided by the iconographic decorative programme devised by the architect. Cast stone and carved ornament incorporates symbols of the city's agrarian past, and books and owls to suggest learning. But the ornamental scheme is more fundamental than just applied decoration. The whole building is conceived as a giant Greek temple - but the columns are replaced by vertical pilasters that appear to be suspended from giant festoons that swing beneath a tough horizontal railing that replaces any orthodox entablature. At each corner of the library roof there will be giant acroterion - each one a flowering of leaves above downward glancing owls. The glazing of the pediment is an almost Schinkel-like line of spears and shields. The two artists most concerned with the ornamental programme are Raymond Kaskey and Kent Bloomer. I suppose that even Chicago is not yet ready for full scale figurative sculpture that would truly complement the scale of the architecture. But what we see today is a brilliant start - how many other buildngs in the world have owls, guilloche, voussoirs, Ceres, corn stalks, Putto blowing air (for the Windy City),festoons, palmettes, finials and shields ? The interior is full of workable and handsome spaces. The furniture is solid, plain and beautifully made. There is no great interior space until you reach the rooftop winter garden - reminiscent of Chicago's Rookery building. This should surely be a great reading room. But I felt that it needed a more solemn architectural treatment to be one hundred per cent convincing as a major public space. Movement through the library is by escalators and although some have criticised the 'department store' feeling these evoke they seem to me to be welcoming and efficient. Marble and terrazzo finishes add a sense of style to the interior. There are many small and intimate places where you feel that you want to settle down with a good book. The triumph of the Chicago Public Library built (by the design and build method with a developer) for a relatively modest US Dollars 195m. inevitably encourages comparison with the British Library now under construction in London. The British Library has no apparent civic or urban qualities and seems destined to be one of the biggest architectural disappointments of the century. There is a bravery about Chicago's achievement that is not nostalgic but soundly based on permanent and durable civic and architectural values. Will it mark the return of a comprehensible public architecture - and a renaissance of ornament and decoration ?</p>

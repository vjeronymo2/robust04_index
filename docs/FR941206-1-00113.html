			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain adequate records to verify the compliance status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source on a monthly basis. The recordkeeping and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements of the general provisions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;63.10 (a)&hyph;(b) and (f) of subpart A would apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources. The source category-specific requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule also apply. Sections 63.10 (c)&hyph;(e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A would not apply unless an affected source installs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an add-on control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affected sources would be required to keep records for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years of all VOC content certifications, VOHAP content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications, maximum allowable dilution ratios,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of coatings and thinner consumed, and compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations needed to determine compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. These records would vary slightly depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the method(s) of determining compliance under &sect;63.784 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source chooses to use. Records of any Method 24 tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or VOHAP tests) conducted on individual coatings, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied, would also be maintained. These records are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in case the results of any such test conflicts with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the results of any compliance determination conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the other allowable methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator believes that the records required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proposed rule are necessary for a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency to determine the compliance status of an affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source efficiently and effectively. All records would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compiled each calendar month and maintained for a minimum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Operating Permit Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the operating permit regulations codified at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 70, any source that is considered major under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act or any nonmajor source subject to a standard under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 111 or 112 of the Act must obtain an operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit [see &sect;70.3(a)(1)]. Often, emission limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scattered among numerous provisions of State implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans or Federal regulations. As discussed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated regulation for the operating permit program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250), this new permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program includes all of the air pollution control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that pertain to a single major stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source in a single document. Sources subject to the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required to submit complete permit applications within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year after a State operating permit program is approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA; if a State program is not approved, sources will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit applications to the EPA within a year after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal program is promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Solicitation of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator solicits comments on all aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposal. However, the Administrator is specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting comment on the topics discussed in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters should provide available data and rationale to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support their comments on each topic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

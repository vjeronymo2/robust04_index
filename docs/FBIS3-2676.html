Addressing the National People's Congress (NPC) now in  session in the Chinese capital, the minister in charge of the  State Planning Commission said that the central government's  plan for national economic and social development in 1994 has  set the following targets:    -- The gross national product is to increase by nine percent  over the previous year. That breaks down into three percent for  the primary industry, 10.7 percent for the secondary industry,  and 11 percent or slightly higher for the tertiary industry.    -- Total investment in fixed assets is expected to reach  1,300 billion yuan. That breaks down into 875 billion yuan for  state- owned enterprises and institutions, and 425 billion yuan  for collective enterprises and institutions and the private  sector.    -- The deficit for 1994 is expected to reach 66.9 billion  yuan. Counting the principal and interest of internal and  external debts and external loans for key projects due to be  paid back in 1994, total internal and external debts for this  year will amount to 129.2 billion yuan.    -- Banks will grant 470 billion yuan in new loans.    -- Total retail sales are expected to reach 1,600 billion  yuan in value.    -- Imports and exports are expected to reach 200 billion  U.S.  dollars in value, with 100 billion U.S. dollars for exports and  the same amount for imports.    -- Inflation will be controlled under ten percent for the  whole of 1994.    -- Efforts will be made to improve the economic efficiency  of  enterprises. That will include increasing the sales ratio of  their products, boosting their ratio of profits and taxes to  capital, improving their labor productivity, increasing their  capital liquidity, and raising their fuel efficiency.    -- The natural population growth rate is to be controlled at  about 1.3 percent for the year.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Bonds under the hammer The sharp falls in German government bonds yesterday are an object lesson on the dangers of issuing authorities trying to play the markets. The Bundesbank may have thought that it would calm nerves by withdrawing its second debt auction in a week. But far from being reassured by the temporary prospect of lower supply, the market simply worried that the move actually revealed a serious lack of demand. The Bank of England has got itself in a similarly awkward position by its reluctance to issue long gilts even when rates were at their lows. How much better off both would be if they simply borrowed routinely and regularly across the maturity spectrum. Then there would be no particular signal for markets to misread. At least the Bundesbank may be right when it says the public sector has no pressing need for cash. The central bank transferred its DM18bn profits to the government in April and borrowing was heavy at the end of last year. Even so, withdrawing auctions cannot become a habit. Given the size of the budget deficit the Bundesbank will have to return before too long. The still-unanswered question is who will buy the paper on offer. With international hedge funds and investment bank proprietary trading desks scaling down activities, bond markets are becoming more reliant on traditional domestic investors. The Bundesbank has pointed to the hope that its rate cuts would attract such buyers out along the yield curve, but the swollen M3 money supply suggests they remain reluctant to move out of cash. There is some evidence that retail investors are starting to nibble. It may take a further rise in real rates to bring them out in force.</p>

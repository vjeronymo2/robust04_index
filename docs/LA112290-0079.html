			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S OTHER PRISONERS;  </P> <P> FAMILIES: THE AFFLICTED AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO SUFFER FROM ALZHEIMER'S.  CARE-GIVERS, ONE AUTHOR SAYS, MUST LEARN TO LEAD AS NORMAL A LIFE AS POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> For those who take care of the millions of Alzheimer's patients, life is not  normal.  </P> <P> But people who care for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease have to try to make  it so, says Sharon Fish, even when the disease forces a very different  definition of normal.  </P> <P> It's better to go out to eat now and then, even though you have to spoon-feed  your loved one in the restaurant, than to feel as if you are trapped in the  house, Fish says.  </P> <P> It's better to hire a person to sit up in your house each night to guard  against an Alzheimer's patient's wanderings than to be fatigued from lack of  sleep.  </P> <P> Fish, a nurse and a writer, has a mother with Alzheimer's disease. For 10  years, Fish has been taking care of her; her experiences led to her book,  "Alzheimer's: Caring for Your Loved One, Caring for Yourself."  </P> <P> Caring for an Alzheimer's patient is bound to be exhausting. It's essential  that care-givers maintain normal activities and have time away from the loved  one, Fish says. But too often, the behaviors that can characterize Alzheimer's  lead to greater isolation.  </P> <P> For example, catastrophic reactions: When faced with frustration or too much  stimulation, Alzheimer's patients can suddenly react with anxiety, abusiveness  or even violent physical or verbal outbursts.  </P> <P> One care-giver told Fish of her father's inability to decide what to eat at a  restaurant.  </P> <P> "I was trying to make him feel better about himself, so I would always ask him  to choose what he wanted to eat; I wanted to give him a choice. But instead of  feeling better, he became frustrated and upset because there were too many  things to choose from. He couldn't process all that information, and once he  even started to cry," she said.  </P> <P> Such an experience might make it seem better just to stay at home; who needs  the pain? But it's important that both the patient and the care-giver remain  part of mainstream life, Fish says.  </P> <P> Techniques for making such reactions less difficult include:  </P> <P> * Avoiding situations that might trigger them, such as a crowded, bustling  store;  </P> <P> * Making life as predictable as possible;  </P> <P> * Limiting choices;  </P> <P> * Simplifying the activities of daily life, such as using clothing with zippers  instead of buttons;  </P> <P> * Not arguing with the patient or trying to reason with him or her;  </P> <P> * Reacting in a calm way, using a soft voice.  </P> <P> And, Fish advises, "avoid emotionally distancing yourself. Reach out with a  warm embrace, a kiss, a touch of your hand. Affection can often defuse a  difficult situation."  </P> <P> While it's obvious that getting out of the house benefits a care-giver, it may  not be so clear that it's good for the patient. But, says Fish, "always assume  more understanding and comprehension than you actually see."  </P> <P> Fish, for example, takes her mother to church on Sundays and on visits to  friends' homes. A year ago, she couldn't: Her mother would wander off. But now  her mother has declined further and is confined to a wheelchair. It's much  easier to take her, and Fish is convinced her mother gets something out of it.  </P> <P> "We go to friends' homes for dinner," Fish says. "People need to know they're  still part of the family."  </P> <P> It's essential that care-givers have time away from their responsibilities,  Fish says. Too often, home health aides are hired to stay with the patient  while a care-giver goes to work or does errands, but not for the care-giver to  have time for other activities.  </P> <P> It's great for a care-giver to go to the movies, play golf or do whatever else  he or she likes. But perhaps some of the best-spent time away from home is in a  support group, Fish says.  </P> <P> "If a person doesn't have a support system, their emotions get quite out of  control," she says.  </P> <P> Her 10 years of care-giving to her ever-deteriorating mother have not been  entirely negative, she says. "I was always real close to my mother. But the  feeling now is much deeper -- I've mellowed out. I've learned a lot in relation  to patience."  </P></p>

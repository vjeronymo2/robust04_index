			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Gardening: Paradise on the crest of a Wave - Robin Lane Fox tracks Columbus and discovers a hint of heaven on the fringe of New York City EVER topical, I have just returned from my horticultural re-run of 1492. I have seen it all, from Spain to America, with Columbus before me: I have followed the poet Lorca precisely, from Spanish Granada to New York. I, too, have shuddered at the big city's darker side while on a Lorcabout of my own: unlike him, I have also shuddered at the rivers of modern development which now pour ever further on to the plains beneath Granada, the source of his poetic vision. On present evidence, I can confirm that Columbus's one observation about gardening was as inaccurate as all his map reading: off Venezuela, he believed that he had found the edge of the beloved garden of Eden. To a self-taught man, the evidence was as overwhelming as DM2.95 to the pound. Four rivers were flowing downhill, like rivers mentioned in Genesis; the landscape was lush and luxuriant and the residents were luscious and naked. From this fringe of divine horticulture, Columbus believed that the world rose upwards, shaped like a female breast whose nipple was the centre of Eden. Significantly, he never returned to check out his anatomy at the top of the world. It was just as well because, from Spain to America, I have found nothing to prove him right. Somewhere, perhaps, there is an unmapped Eden, going topless where I cannot find it. From Granada to Central Park, I have checked out the greenery; I have cypresses clipped like pencils on terraces of narrow carmen-gardens; I have seen myrtles in need of pruning and bedding plants in need of instant eradication. On the fine hill of the Generalise garden, red salvias luxuriate, a far cry from paradise; there is a hint of heaven in New York streets where the trees are ginkgoes, but there is nothing heavenly in the Strawberry Fields garden commemorating John Lennon's name. After two weeks, I needed orientation: it was lucky that friendly gardeners told me about Wave Hill. Wave Hill is not Eden or Sissinghurst but, if paradise is the place which seems the best of the moment by contrast, it has a claim to be taken seriously. It is open every day except Monday and, to find it, you must travel along the Hudson river on a half-hour's journey from New York's Grand Central to Riverside station and a neat, green, garden suburb. In 1843, an American lawyer, William Morris, brought his bride to view the hillside where he had just bought some 20 acres. 'It looks like a wave,' she is said to have told him. So, Wave Hill was born, overlooking the broad river on the edge of modern New York City. From its upper terrace, you might still expect to see smoke signals rising from the unspoilt woods on the far bank. New York's Eden became a garden through money and immigrant talent. The site was brought to life by George Perkins, a business partner of JP Morgan who was hyper-active between 1903 and 1920. He worked with Albert Millard, a head gardener who had trained in royal service in Vienna; together, they laid out a garden in the English style. Two Scottish head gardeners followed: like Bagatelle, the gem of Paris, Wave Hill struck an English chord on the fringe of a great metropolis. Perkins seems to have caught other English habits: a leading financier, he retired at 50 to focus his abilities on social challenges. One of these was to give bits of the garden to people who admired him. The various houses there have a long roll of honoured residents. Toscanini rented one of them and Mark Twain built a tree house in the garden. Since 1960, Wave Hill has belonged to the city of New York; since 1967, it has been managed by a hero of east coast gardening, Marco Polo Stufano, who is its director in his silver anniversary year. He has been essential to its identity. Early October is an unfair test of a flower garden, even in a local Eden. Wave Hill's trees are spectacular, covering more than 700 varieties; its salvias are so much rarer and subtler than modern Spain's with names like Cinegel D'Oro, a pale beauty from Mexico. Plantsmanship is unusually evident, from the fine pans of wild cyclamen in the alpine house to the many intriguing types of plant from American states: odd lespedezas from California or huge bushes of vibernum Setigerum with spectacular scarlet berries. The climate in summer must be pretty awful and winters are a cold Zone VI: nonetheless, echoes sound pleasantly from across the Atlantic, whether a purple origanum Hopleys or a bright red verbena Lawrence Johnston. The conservatories could teach us all a lesson, not least that the violet-blue thunbergia grandiflora would look great if well-grown under grass in Britain. If you love best English gardens best, will it bowl you over? Not, I think, if my eye is fair to its earlier seasons. There is too much potent colour in strong combinations; the water garden is too reedy and feathery and, although the climate must set limits, the plantings on the big pergola do look rather dull. Perhaps it is only temporary, but the view from the upper terrace falls into a mud patch and then gives way to the wilder shores of the Hudson. The gardens peter out into the sort of wild asters you can see on the cuttings by the south London railway at Clapham Junction. The Garden Trail puts a brave face on it: 'Wave Hills's urban woodland is a living laboratory for observing human influence on our environment.' So are England's Network South-East rail commuter lines. Delighted by the trees and the controlled craftsmanship, I veered to the right through the social challenges and found myself on the terrace of Wave Hill's main house. Nowadays, they sell a palatable tea and, as the Columbus re-run merged into jet lag, I fell into a cosmopolitan dream. The Alhambra Spain seemed to have been auctioned on Wall Street and somebody was asking to see my papers in the sort of German spoken in Munich's great botanical gardens. I awoke, expecting politically correct Indians with a blowpipe. Instead, there was a line of white-flowered fibrous begonias, fellow-trackers influencing the environment with wonderfully democratic indifference, and the sounds from three tables of Hebrew-quoting Jews, appreciating the Black Forest gateau. Was not Hebrew supposed to have been spoken in the garden of Eden? Perhaps Columbus, had been right, after all. I took my leave of the finest green refuge on New York City's outskirts: the evening bell was sounding and somebody was driving a car along the lower terrace to remind us that highway morals rule. Taking leave of the lovely viburnums, I descended the hills, to find signs to a Hebrew home for the aged. The evidence vanished, like Columbus's before me, and I was left with an afternoon's memory of a garden with a view across its broad, bold river that even a Scotsman would envy.</p>

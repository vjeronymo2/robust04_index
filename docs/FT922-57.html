			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / State benefits concern advisers THE INSTITUTE of Actuaries, the trade association whose members advise the pensions industry, has called for the government to expand its review of occupational pensions to cover state benefits as well. Mr John Martin, institute president, said yesterday that the patchwork legislation underpinning state benefits was becoming unworkable and hampered effective private-sector pension provision. He said: 'Unless the tax and regulatory regime for pensions in the UK is given a thorough overhaul, employers will become increasingly discouraged from making proper provision for employee pensions.' He criticised the recent trend of employers to provide so-called 'money purchase' pensions, which guarantee a lump sum upon retirement that is often too small because of inflation. Mr Martin urged actuaries to encourage employers to guarantee annual pension increases pegged to inflation. The government has deferred introduction of a law passed two years ago that would have required employers to guarantee annual pension rises equal to 5 per cent or the retail prices index, whichever is lower.</p>

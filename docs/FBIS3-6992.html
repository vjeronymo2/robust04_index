In a dawn assault, about 150 members of the notorious ultra-  nationalist faction attacked government positions in the Bavel  district of Battambang Province, northeast of the former Khmer  Rouge stronghold of Pailin, local police said.    The guerrillas attacked around 5:30 a.m., injuring two  police  officers, two local militia and six soldiers, one of them  seriously, an officer said.    The Khmer Rouge also targeted a weapons warehouse and burned  it down, he said, adding that two guerrillas were killed before  government forces repelled the assault four hours.    "Because we destroyed their nest in Pailin, they have lost  their temper and they just go everywhere in the area to try and  disturb us, rob the villagers and burn peoples' homes," the  police officer said.    In Thmar Kol, about halfway between Battambang and Sisophon,  soldiers opened fire with heavy machine guns and artillery at  what they said was an advancing force of Khmer Rouge.    More guerrilla attacks were expected late Tuesday night, and  aid agencies were put on a security alert and warned not go to  Bavel district.    Cambodian government forces say they seized Pailin, once a  bustling gem-mining and logging centre, this weekend.    Trucks, heavy guns and multiple-rocket launchers were rushed  to reinforce the town on Tuesday, but got bogged down in thick  mud and heavy rain on Highway 10, a strategic route that has  also yet to be cleared of suspected landmines, an AFP reporter  saw.    Tuesday's attack came only a day after a senior government  general said that the Khmer Rouge's estimated 1,500 fighters in  the area had probably broken up into small groups.    Around 25,000 Cambodians have fled into eastern Thailand to  escape the fighting, an armed forces spokesman in Bangkok said  Monday.</p>

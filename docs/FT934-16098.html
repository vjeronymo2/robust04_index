			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Scrambling to unscramble MR JOHN SPENCER, an engineer who is UK marketing director of GI, the US electronics group, is a connoisseur of the work of the cable and satellite television pirates. Several years ago GI suffered a serious piracy problem in the US and 4m decoder boxes in homes with cable television had to be replaced. Mr Spencer said the most effective pirate equipment he had seen was based on an Intel chip inserted into the decoder box itself. But he had also tested a number of other cards that also worked well. It is now easy and inexpensive, he believes, to get pirate microchips manufactured from a floppy disk carrying the configuration of the system. The VideoCrypt system introduced in 1989 has been hailed by BSkyB for its 'unmatched high security and unmatched flexibility'. It randomly cuts each of the hundreds of tiny lines in the television picture and transposes them. Information on the scrambling sequences and control is carried in spare lines of the picture. The security features lie in the 'smart card' rather than the decoder box. The decoder establishes the legitimacy of the card, which has a built-in microprocessor containing the codes needed to unscramble the picture. BSkyB said: 'The smart card security algorithms may be changed frequently making unauthorised attack extremely difficult and economically not viable.' Nobody knows how pirates are breaking BSkyB security, but experts believe some are cracking the code and manufacturing their own microchips. Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has said he hoped to make VideoCrypt the world standard.</p>

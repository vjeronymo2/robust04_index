			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Russian gas giant approaches investors Gazprom of Russia, the world's largest gas producer, has made its first approach to international investors in the build-up to a planned offering of 9 per cent of its stock. Gazprom is spearheading a drive by Russia's largest oil, electricity and telecommunications companies to follow their domestic privatisation by tapping international capital markets. Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank which has been advising Gazprom since May, is expected to make a formal approach to industry and financial investors early next year. It emerged last week that Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gazprom's chairman, spoke at a private presentation to 150 fund managers and other potential investors in New York on November 10. Expectations about the speed of the transaction, and indeed its likelihood, have dipped as the state of Gazprom's accounts has become apparent. Gazprom has hired Price Waterhouse to get its accounts in order and the pace of this effort to improve the quality of information for investors will be critical in determining the timing of the offer. Kleinwort and Price Waterhouse have to judge the accuracy of estimates by the BP Review of World Energy that Gazprom controls 24 per cent of world gas reserves. They will also have to verify claims that in 1993 the company produced nearly 10 times as much gas as Exxon of the US. Apart from evaluating the worth of vast and scattered assets, the auditors will also have to assess potential environmental liabilities. Financiers doubt the feasibility of the timetable for the issue. One said: 'If you told me it would take 10 years to audit Gazprom I would not be surprised.' The resilience of interest in Gazprom was demonstrated again last week as foreign investors bid up the small float of shares on the Vladivostok Stock Exchange. It was reported on Friday that Gazprom offered a tranche at Rbs16,315 (Dollars 5). At that price, Gazprom would be valued at Dollars 118bn (Pounds 72bn). Another of Russia's biggest energy companies, Lukoil, plans to make a presentation to investors this week, also in New York. Lukoil, which produces 15 per cent of Russia's oil, plans to sell 15 per cent of its equity. Lukoil and United Energy Systems, the Russian electricity company, are expected to have American depository receipts in place by the first quarter of next year. They are following AvtoVAZbank, a regional Russian bank owned by vehicle maker AvtoVAZ, which has already filed for ADRs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Appetite for Russian stocks is strong and regional investment funds alone raised more than Dollars 300m last month. But a dispute between a Russian metals group and an aluminium smelter over the validity of a Dollars 300m shareholding has reignited investors' fear about safe custody of their Russian holdings. Some sections of the Russian government also believe the giant energy companies should be heavily regulated to prevent their abusing their dominant positions. Russian oil carve-up, Page 2</p>

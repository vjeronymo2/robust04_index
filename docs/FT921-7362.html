			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The W word THIS HAS been a tough old week for those of us on work duty in Beverly Hills. There is a belief in dull quarters that life in Los Angeles - especially in Beverly Hills - is one long round of parties, polo matches, lunch dates, shopping, private screenings and daily conferences with one's hairdresser, florist, decorator, astrologer, menu supervisor, hypnotist, analyst, celebrity fitness trainer, tennis coach, garden masonry consultant, personal organiser, tax attorney and PR office. And so it is, of course. But there are odd chinks in the day which still have to be filled - work opportunities, I think we should call them - when the resident of Beverly Hills, or even the regular visitor, must turn his attention to this frivolous thing called work. Take Monday. On Monday I was convinced I had spotted a work opportunity. I read in the paper that at 5.30 am on Wednesday the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences right here in Beverly Hills was holding a press conference at which this year's Oscar contenders, five in each category, would be named. The 5.30 am kick-off was designed to attract TV coverage from network news shows on the East coast, and from CNN in Europe. So I rang the Academy. But Monday was a holiday. The Academy was shut. So I rang again on Tuesday. By then, I was told, 'credentialling' for the press conference had closed. 'If you are not credentialled at this time,' a PR hussy told me, 'then you will not be able to attend, though you are welcome to pick up a press pack from the Academy between 7.30 am and noon.' I have never found much nourishment in press packs. These days, journalism is so competitive, editors so shrill, that you have to delve way beyond the press pack if you want to make your mark. You simply cannot ring the News Editor and instruct him: 'Hold the back page, I am picking up a press pack.' Which left me confronting a singular lack of work opportunities with which to make a good fist of Wednesday, to flesh out my schedule and justify the not insignificant cost of maintaining me on the ground in Beverly Hills for another 24 hours. But fortune favours the bold. Not at all flustered by my failure to gatecrash the Oscars press conference, I repaired, at 10 am, to poolside at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The morning was beautiful. The swimming pool quivered and glittered just like a David Hockney. And then my eye fell upon a magazine ad placed by Negative Population Growth Inc. which claimed that, driven by explosive population growth, the US was hurtling towards environmental disaster. At once my journalistic instincts tempered these many years by the white heat of ferocious competition, pinged into action. Talk about a story. According to Negative Population Growth Inc: 'If present immigration and fertility rates continue, our population, now over 252m, will pass 400m by the year 2050 and still be growing rapidly] 'We believe that all efforts to save our environment will ultimately prove to be futile unless we not only halt US population growth, but reverse it, so that our population can eventually be stabilised at a sustainable level - far lower than it is today." What was the ideal size of the US population? Answer: in the range of 125m to 150m, about what it was in the 1940s. How would this be achieved? Answer: by reducing annual immigration to about 200,000 so that it roughly balanced emigration; and by lowering the fertility rate from 2.1 children per woman to around 1.5 and keeping it there for several decades. 'We believe,' said the ad, 'that non coercive financial incentives will be necessary in order to reach that goal.' These would include eliminating the present Federal income tax exemption for dependent children. At once, numerous lines of inquiry suggested themselves to my active mind. Who was master-minding NPG Inc? What did they stand to gain? Was there any plan to eliminate or reduce whole categories of persons - people who work in advertising agencies springing felicitously to mind? Or to eliminate whole cities? What about New York? It has always seemed to me that New York is peopled exclusively by nerds and jerks. Unfortunately, the only way to get in touch with NPG Inc was to send off a cheque for annual membership. So I wrote out a cheque for Dollars 30 and asked the pool attendant to mail it to Teaneck, New Jersey. Then I rang my hairdresser.</p>

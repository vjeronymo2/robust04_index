			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino by </F> Gian Battista Bozzo in Rome; date not given: "Martino:  Reducing Taxes? It Is Possible"]    [Text] With what he is saying in this interview, Antonio  Martino could overtake [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi  in terms of popularity on the tax issue among League  sympathizers, and indeed all who believe tax decentralization to  be the right thing. These statements by the Forza Italia  economist are not a provocation, but the end results of a far  from short or easy process, but one which needs to be begun. In  short, a tax reform which would end up taking the entire  taxation process out of the hands of the center, that is the  Ministry of Finance, and transferring it to reformed and  efficient local authorities. But in the meantime, Martino  explained, one must work in two directions: on the one hand to  reduce overall tax pressure, gradually but without hesitation,  and on the other hand to clarify the rules for preparing the  budget. First and foremost, Article 81 of the Constitution (no  illegal expenditures), which Parliament has never implemented,  must be applied.    [Bozzo] First of all the rules, Professor Martino?    [Martino] To me it seems obvious that it is necessary to  abandon the present arbitrary system. Our problems derive from  the fact that, in the absence of rules, everyone (and I am  saying everyone, including the left) has used public expenditure  for electoral purposes. And hence the enormous growth of  expenditure has provoked a tax explosion, a boom, which has  however remained insufficient to cover outgoings. The whole  history of our public debt is here. And this is why we need  rules: We can no longer give politicians blank checks.    [Bozzo] In addition to rules, Forza Italia is also demanding  a ceiling to the tax burden.    [Martino] The meaning of the tax ceiling is simple: first of  all one must decide how much one can take out of the economy  without killing it. After that one establishes how to spend  these resources.    [Bozzo] It has been said that this is a demagogic  proposition, that we cannot reduce taxes in Italy today.    [Martino] The left has criticized the rule. To me this is  unacceptable. It could not criticize the amount, as I have  never said what the ceiling should be: It could even be equal  to the present one. The fact of the matter is that the left  wishes to continue to spend without control. This being said, I  would add that it is possible to reduce tax pressure, even if  this has to be gradual: One cannot withdraw an addict's drugs  all at once. But taxation can be limited, and rationalized.  Zero cost reforms exist: simplified execution and the  elimination of taxes which yield little or nothing.    [Bozzo] Do you think that it is possible to reduce income  tax  rates? Also: What are you proposing in terms of business  taxation?    [Martino] Reducing progressive personal income tax rates is  essential, because tax rates of 50 percent not only yield  little, but favor evasion. Then we need to untax employment,  because, let us not forget, more than half of labor costs end up  in the taxman's hands. I would propose an exemption for new  "net job positions." Let me explain: "net" in order to avoid  the fraud which consists of dismissing in order to rehire. And  a total exemption for reinvested assets.    [Bozzo] Let us now come, Professor Martino, to tax  decentralization. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]'s  "finance minister" Visco is now talking of tax federalization.    [Martino] I do not know whether my project will be included  in its entirety into the Forza Italia economic program.  Nonetheless I have in mind a radical proposal, the  implementation of which, obviously, requires time and a series  of major reforms. Once a complete rearrangement of local  authorities has been completed with, say, some 50  macromunicipalities, I would then entrust them with total tax  authority, taking it away completely from the center. With two  limits: 50 percent of income would have to be transferred to  Rome, and a ban on recourse to market indebtedness. The reform,  the final point of a long series of changes, would give citizens  ever so much greater control of income and expenditure.    [Bozzo] By way of conclusion: Do you like the idea of a  superminister of the economy and privatization?    [Martino] In theory yes, but without rules even the best  superminister will fail. As to privatization, I would simply  say that, if there is an excess demand for the company shares  being issued on the market, evidently the price is low.</p>

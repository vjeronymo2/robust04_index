			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Free-trade threat to a real market - Changing fortunes of a Paraguay frontier town So deep runs the despondency among the merchants of Ciudad del Este, a Paraguayan town close to the frontiers with Brazil and Argentina, that they are hoping for deliverance at the hands of Argentinian tourists. Fortunes were once made in Ciudad del Este by selling vast quantities of duty-free goods to Brazilians. These days, though, Brazilians have little money to spend. At the same time, competition for their business is keener than ever. Traders are now hoping that some of the hundreds of thousands of Argentinian tourists expected to take their holidays in southern Brazil over the coming three months will drop by Ciudad del Este on their way home. Desperate traders hope they could raise their sales, if only by about 1 per cent, should 100,000 Argentinians visit Ciudad del Este this summer. The duty-free business turns over surprisingly large amounts of money. Mr Guillermo Campuzano, the mayor, claims Ciudad del Este will do Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn worth of business this year, although shopkeepers regard that as too optimistic. The trade is one of Paraguay's most important sources of revenue and creator of jobs. Busy, chaotic and filthy, Ciudad del Este only comes alive when the first shops open and streetsellers begin unpacking their wares ready for the first busload of shoppers. Orange plastic sheeting stretched across the pavements softens the harsh sunlight. Makeshift stalls offer an infinity of goods: women's underwear, toys, fishing rods, sunglasses, batteries, tool sets. Hawkers peddle anything from Chinese-made battery-powered shavers to perfume of doubtful provenance. The shops and shopping centres - owned mainly by Arab and Chinese traders - sell American cigarettes and trainers, Japanese video cameras, Persian carpets, English china, Scotch whisky, and Swiss Army knives. Ciudad del Este and the nearby Brazilian city of Foz do Iguacu have become twin cities. Buses shuttle between them every five or ten minutes. Many of Ciudad del Este's wealthier merchants live in Foz. Everything in Ciudad del Este is much cheaper than in Argentina or Brazil because Paraguay has low taxes and import duties and because smuggling and tax evasion are rife. Traders depend on Brazilians for 95 per cent of their sales. Specialist Brazilian magazines list goods, prices and the shops where they are available. Travel agents sell 'shopping packages'. Charter buses travel in convoys on the long return journey to avoid ambushes by highway robbers. Most of the shoppers are small-time Brazilian smugglers know as 'ants'. One woman said 'I only buy cheap junk. You know toys, radios, things like that.' But the ants' clients are getting poorer and poorer as Brazil's economic problems deepen. Mr Hussein Teiyen, the Lebanese-born president of the chamber of commerce, says sales have halved to Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m per day since 1990. 'There are more sellers than buyers,' he says. 'There are 50,000 people in the city selling. But there are not 50,000 people coming here to buy.' Furthermore, Paraguay's rudimentary economy is in the throes of free market restructuring. The unemployed drift to Ciudad del Este in search of either a job or, more frequently, a living of sorts as a street-seller. Another problem is a crackdown on tax evasion by the new government of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. This has already led to the replacement of 80 per cent of Ciudad del Este's customs officers. Under General Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay for 35 years, corruption and contraband were an integral part of the political system. But Mr Campuzano admits that 'a culture of 35 years, where the abnormal was normal, means it is very difficult to change mentality in a few years'. The prospect of advancing hordes of Argentine shoppers, made wealthy by rapid growth and an over-valued currency, is electrifying Ciudad del Este. Merchants say Argentinians are both wealthier and more discriminating shoppers than Brazilians, preferring higher-priced wares such as perfumes and silk scarves. Trade liberalisation is probably Ciudad del Este's most serious long-term threat. Mercosur, the planned South American common market linking Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay is meant to come into force in 1995 and will require members to levy a common external tariff and remove internal trade barriers. Traders say trade liberalisation in Argentina and Brazil has already forced them to cut margins. Ciudad del Este is such an important revenue source that Paraguay is thinking of making the city a free trade zone after 1995. It may not take much to wreck Ciudad del Este, as can be seen by nipping into Argentina. Traders in the nearby town of Puerto Iguazu, a smaller rival of Ciudad del Este, were ruined by the strong exchange rate introduced by the government of President Carlos Menem. The hordes of shoppers have gone, the hotels lie empty and shops are boarded up.</p>

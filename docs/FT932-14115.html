			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Czechoslovak divorce costs both sides dear: Business suffers as barriers go up THREE months after their divorce, the Czech and Slovak republics are struggling to cope with the costs of separation. Bitter rows about assets and liabilities, differing economic and political aims, and a raft of new regulations have all served to disrupt severely the business that once flowed freely between the two. Czech sales to Slovakia represent about a quarter of all its exports, while the Czech Republic takes about 40 per cent of Slovakia's exports. Officials expected bilateral trade to fall by around 10 per cent, but in January alone it declined by more than half. Companies complain of long delays and extra costs caused by new customs and clearing regulations. The monetary union under which the two states were to share a common currency came to an abrupt end in February. A clearing agreement using the Ecu as the benchmark currency for calculating payments between the two states failed to halt a sharp decline in bilateral trade. The Slovak crown has been devalued by 5 per cent and the Czech crown revalued by 2 per cent against the clearing Ecu, raising the cost of Czech goods for Slovak companies. Current projections suggest bilateral trade could fall 30-40 per cent this year, threatening to postpone economic recovery after two years of sharply declining output. Economists estimate that a 10 per cent fall in bilateral trade will cause a 1 per cent drop in Czech GDP, and twice that for Slovakia. Faced with a collapse of eastern markets, both countries have redirected their trade westwards, mainly to Europe. Last year, about 70 per cent of Czech and Slovak exports were sold in the west, but further inroads into western markets for exports of traditional products, from steel to textiles, are facing growing obstacles. Imports are outpacing exports and the recession in Europe is reducing export opportunities. The downturn in Germany, now the Czech Republic's largest single customer absorbing 30 per cent of its exports, as well as its biggest investor, is viewed with mounting concern in Prague. Czech and Slovak industrial associations, say government suggestions that companies should switch sales from each other to other markets are unrealistic, and would result in a loss of domestic market share to foreign companies. However, the collapse of markets in eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia's partition into two smaller markets, and Prague's focus on western Europe without the benefits of EC membership, may have reduced the Czech Republic's attractiveness as a manufacturing base. Prague insists low labour costs, a skilled labour force, and its location in the heart of Europe provide an ideal base for foreign investors, but the lack of incentives may act as a deterrent. Slovakia, for its part, is desperately courting foreign investors, and recently unveiled substantial tax incentives. Its economy has been more affected by the collapse of traditional markets and its unemployment rate stands at 11 per cent, compared with the Czech Republic's 3 per cent. According to patchy, and at times contradictory figures, foreign investment was Dollars 1.6bn and Dollars 270m in the Czech Republic and Slovakia respectively in 1990-1992. But last month's decision by Mercedes to abandon plans for a joint venture to make trucks in the Czech Republic was a worrying signal. The company said it was no longer interested in the venture because the break-up of Czechoslovakia had made access to eastern Europe more difficult. Several other large investments have either fallen through (Dow Chemicals), are being revised downwards (Siemens) or are locked in endless negotiations (Iveco/Fiat). No one in Prague is willing to hazard a guess at the possible number of bankruptcies that could follow the introduction of a new Czech bankruptcy law this month, but with figures for inter-company debts running at more than Kcs 200bn (Dollars 7.1bn), the fear is that there will be a wave of business failures. Slovakia has so far postponed its own bankruptcy law.</p>

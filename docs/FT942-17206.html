			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Turkish PM devalues lira as part of austerity package The Turkish government yesterday announced a three-month economic austerity package and devalued the lira by 28 per cent against the US dollar in an attempt to relieve the country's economic crisis. The package follows days of chaos on the financial markets and political uncertainty after recent electoral gains by an Islamic group, directly challenging mainstream secular parties. Outlining the package in a televised address, Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, warned that Turkey was heading for Latin American-style hyperinflation unless tough action was taken to reduce a ballooning public deficit. The package includes immediate price increases of state controlled commodities and closures of loss-making state enterprises, which could provoke a backlash. The decisions follow two months of currency turbulence, with interbank rates at one point reaching 1,000 per cent as the central bank attempted to prop up the lira. The central bank, signalling yesterday it would no longer intervene to support the lira, announced that today's official fix against the US dollar would be TL32,050, representing a 28 per cent devaluation compared with the official Central Bank rate yesterday. The package comprises structural measures such as faster privatisation, one-off tax changes and reform of farm support policies to underpin a fiscal programme to slash the budget deficit in the second quarter from TL47,000bn to TL9,000bn. The government also announced proposals to reform the central bank, designed to tighten control over the money supply. Economists welcomed the reforms, but warned that implementation would be the test, given potential opposition from Mrs Ciller's coalition partners, the Social Democratic Populists (SHP). Success will also depend on the co-operation of the main opposition centre-right Motherland party, Anap. Yesterday state controlled prices of petrol, tobacco and sugar were raised by up to 100 per cent. That is certain to fuel short-term inflation, which last month reached an annual rate of more than 73 per cent. The Istanbul stock exchange index jumped by 7 per cent yesterday, but dealers said most of the advance took place before the government announced the economic package. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains lost as the sellers return WEAKNESS in the gilt-edged market following the announcement of the latest domestic money supply statistics undermined an attempted rally in the UK stock market yesterday. The FT-SE 2,800 mark was regained and then lost, and the market closed a further 10 Footsie points off, with traders nervous that today, the last day of the extended May Day equity trading account, will be overshadowed by the outcome of the UK local elections and an important parliamentary by-election held yesterday. Although the picture was brightened by good trading figures from British Petroleum, there was some selling across the range of the equity market. Seaq volume increased by around 26 per cent over Wednesday's levels, with the blue chips and the second line stocks sharing the pain in the second half of the session. In early trading the FT-SE gained 9.5 to clear the 2,800 hurdle with comfort. Equities were helped by an initially better tone in stock index futures, and by the favourable response to BP's first quarter results. However, the euphoria soon wore off and, although the immediate reaction to the absence of any change in interest rate policy at the Bundesbank policy meeting was mild, the June future on the the FT-SE Index came under pressure. Equities also took the news that UK money supply M0, the narrow measure, had risen by 4.8 per cent in the year to April without great surprise. But as government bonds extended losses to around a full point, the stock market fell away. At worst, the Footsie was 12.6 lower and a late rally, encouraged by a slow opening to the new Wall Street session trimmed the loss only slightly. The final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,786.3, down 10.2, left the market right at the lower end of its trading range. Seaq volume increased to 681.5m shares from Wednesday's 539.1m, which reflected retail business worth Pounds 1.05bn. Trading volume has remained high as the market has given ground over the past two trading sessions. Traders entertained few hopes of any significant change in market sentiment before the equity trading account closes tonight. The three week account, extended to cover the May Day break, has proved a wearying experience, and government popularity will be tested today by the local and by-election results. There has been growing belief that the stock market might have already discounted much of the economic recovery now acclaimed in political circles, and that a genuine recovery in corporate profits and dividends might take some time to develop. A further check to confidence has come this week with the re-appearance of rights issue pressures, in the form of Wednesday's Pounds 404m cash call from Royal Insurance. Institutional cash balances are known to be small because of heavy commitments ahead of the Government's bond funding programme, as well as pending equity calls from BT III and ICI/Zeneca. Falls in government bonds yesterday reinforced concern over the pressure which could be imposed on the markets by government's monthly funding programme. The threat of higher yields in the gilt-edged market has acted as a check to confidence in equities.</p>

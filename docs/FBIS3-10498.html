The president, or the PT [Workers  Party]? The PT spent more than 72 hours in meetings this week,  if you add the hours of meetings of its national executive board  in Sao Paulo to gatherings of its federal legislators in  Brasilia. The more the PT talks, the more complicated the  situation gets. So far, nothing new. The PT spent what seemed to  be endless hours debating the main issues faced by the party in  its 13 years of existence. The difference this time is the  question mark behind the heated debate on the participation of  the 36 deputies and Senator Eduardo Suplicy (Sao Paulo) in the  constitutional revision and the development of the PT platform.  It is a question mark that is eating away at the party and  making its candidate for president vulnerable vis-a-vis the bloc  of opponents. Such questions leave the party--which began the  1989 election campaign in third place but is now stabilized at  the top of the polls--at 30 percent, thus facing the same  dilemma as five years ago. Since then, the PT has expelled its  more radical faction, the Socialist Convergence, talked to  businessmen during meetings lubricated with whisky, and visited  military officers. All this without, however, realizing that it  was still held prisoner by the radicals. Or, what is worse, the  radicals, in order not to appear so, have become indecisive.  They are the tucanos of the PT.    At the executive board's meeting on Tuesday 8 February, they  poked their beaks outside. The date that had been set to decide,  finally, whether or not the PT legislators could or could not  participate in the constitutional revision assembly ultimately  went down in party history as the day of postponement. A party  with a profile of firm positions, the PT opted to put off the  decision until 17 February. "We chose that date because Lula  wants to attend," the coordinator of the party's platform, Prof.  Marco Aurelio Garcia, confirmed. In favor of PT participation in  the revision, Lula, the party president, had only five of the 20  votes. Fourteen others voted for postponement, and only one is  adamantly against the revision. Having caught a bad cold on his  fourth caravan trip--this one to Amazonia--Lula was resting at  home. While convalescing, he was weakened by another virus: the  political agreements virus. Although prevented from voting on  the reform of the Constitution, the PT legislators were able to  vote on the Social Emergency Fund (FSE), part of the plan  developed by Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso. So  the PT was not in on the revision, but was voting. This  confusion came about because the executive board would not  accede to Lula's wishes and those of the majority of its  congressmen and senators. Nor would Lula accept the executive  board's radical posture. So the candidate sent a message to the  board, which was meeting at the Hotel Comodoro in Sao Paulo,  asking for them to postpone everything until the 17th, the eve  of the start of yet another caravan trip, this one to the South.  Garcia does not agree that in that discussion on the FES things  were all that simple. "Even I, who is considered soft [preceding  word in English]--I did not think they should vote," he said.  "But that will be resolved next week."    Until then, the legislators, the executive board, and Lula  are locked in an arm-wrestling contest. The "it" in this dispute  that resembles a game of blindman's buff is Lula's candidacy,  which urgently needs alliances and a platform to guide it to  victory. "There are two distinct roads the PT can take,"  suggests Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino. "It could expand its  alliances with a platform that does not create obstacles to shut  out other parties or keep it from governing; or else decide that  Lula will govern merely by mobilizing the public." The second  hypothesis Genoino considers to be a mistake. In this  arm-wrestling phase, the executive board was clever when it  opted for a confrontation with the party's legislators instead  of trying to force the adoption of a platform as happened in  other elections. By attacking the deputies, the factions on the  left, which have representatives on the executive board, played  games with people's vanity. Another strategy used by the radical  is an older one--uniting the other schools of thought. Or  uniting dissenters from those groups, like the Hour of Truth,  the most leftist part of Articulation, which is Lula's faction.  The Hour of Truth was against PT participation in the revision.  "The attack on the delegation was reinforced by the  anticongressional sentiments of the PT rank and file--sentiments  shared by the general public," a party congressman revealed.    Seven legislators drafted a manifesto and accepted the  decision of the radicals. Ten others remained on the fence. The  majority threatened to break with the executive board. From  Belem, Lula tried to put the house in order. He sent (in  different words) the following message: those who are  dissatisfied had better leave. The party president accepted the  position taken by the executive board and was insisting that the  legislators do the same. The 19 rebels then began to negotiate.  At the meeting with the executive board in Sao Paulo, the leader  of the legislative delegation, Jose Fortunati (Rio Grande do  Sul), withstood the fire from the radicals. The payback came out  of the meeting of the delegation on Tuesday 8 February. The  deputies accepted the order to obstruct the revision, but would  disobey the ban on voting, provided they do so as a tactic of  obstruction.    "That is not much," complained Deputy Joao Paulo (Minas  Gerais).    "Calm down, Joao Paulo"--asked his colleague Pedro Tonelli  (Parana)--"the executive board did not realize that if you give  us an inch, we can take a mile."    That same evening, the PT deputies voted against Minister  Fernando Henrique's plan. But they did vote. As the legislators  see it, Lula let the conflict go on because he is holding back  an argument in his favor in order to negotiate later on, in what  will be the most important negotiations. In April, the Ninth  National Encounter will decide, among other things, the policy  on alliances. Lula needs to shove the tucanos, beaks  and all, down the throats of the radicals who are in the PT  leadership. In other words, to do a kindness today so as to win  tomorrow. Lula is counting on some factors in his favor, such as  the good will of PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and the  almost-discarded candidacy of the finance minister. The slate  may also include the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], with which  the PT has already reached an agreement, and the PC do B  [Communist Party of Brazil]. What we do not know is how the most  radical wing, the unrelenting opponent of alliances (especially  with social democratic parties) will behave when this subject is  on the table. Or whether Lula will be able to convince them as  easily as he expects. His leadership is also being tested on  platform issues such as the foreign debt, anti-inflationary  policy, and the military budget. Depending on the degree of  radicalism that prevails at the April meeting, his candidacy  could either be consolidated or weakened.    These differences, Garcia admits, are wearing down the party  and opening a breach through which opponents can attack. "The  disagreements are being mishandled and are certainly hurting the  campaign," said the professor, now one of Lula's most  influential advisers. Garcia emphasizes, however, that those  discussions are about programs. "No one in the PT is obliged to  furnish an auditor's report to prove he can be a candidate; in  this party, the debate is about ideas," he boasted. That is  precisely one of the questions in the voters' minds: who will  prevail, the man, or the ideas? "Lula is bigger," Garcia  answered. Even while extolling the differences and their  content, Garcia admits that the controversy about the revision  will leave scars even among those "colleagues," who, until then,  worked closely together. On Tuesday 8 February, he himself  became irritated with Jose Genoino. The deputy, reacting to  pressure from the executive board, had attacked the PT platform  which, the legislator complained, "worships the State." As  mentor of the text that will be voted on in April, Garcia was  furious. "Look, why didn't he pick up the telephone and tell me  so, why didn't he ask for a meeting to tell me what he thinks?"  he asked. "They use their access to the press to call the  executive board bureaucratic, to attack this or that, but I  could play that game too if I wanted and it would be pure  nitroglycerine, because I have all the documents," he  threatened. Among the closest advisors are some who argued on  Wednesday 9 February that Lula should take a hard line toward  all this squabbling. "It is time for him to blow the whistle,"  said one of them. In the afternoon of that same day, during an  interview in Sao Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), Lula was still  mild-mannered in his comments, despite urging autonomy for the  legislative delegation.    No one expects the members of a big party to hold identical  opinions. That does not happen anywhere in the world. "People  should look at the cost-benefit ratio of all this, and consider  whether it helps the party or helps X, Y, or Z," Garcia  observed. Anyone who is working on Lula's image in the business  community would be the first to close out the balance sheet in  the red. "The party is going through a divisive phase; Lula is a  negotiator and will certainly put an end to this, said  businessman Oded Grajew, one of the people in charge of setting  up meetings between Lula and representatives of business.  Grajew, a former president of the Brazilian Association of Toy  Manufacturers (Abrinq), recalls that he has often been forced to  yield or accept defeat. "A president can be neither a dictator  nor a puppet," he advises.  <H5>  [Box p 28] </H5> <H3>  Preaching to the Choir--Professor Analyzes Style of PT  Documents </H3>   No Brazilian political party produces more documents than  the  PT. There are folders stuffed with papers--directives, programs,  proposals, opinions, press releases, and so on. The  petistas write as much as they debate in interminable  meetings. And every meeting of its directors or officers ends up  in written form. One of these papers, specifically the  "Directives For the State Government Platform of the Sao Paulo  PT" ended up in the hands of Maria Otilia Bocchini, a professor  at the School of Communications and Arts at the University of  Sao Paulo (USP). A scholar and expert on social linguistics, she  made a surprising discovery. The party writes plenty, but the  voter understands very little of it. "The texts are not clear,  they are written only for the initiated," she observed. Herself  a card-carrying petista, Maria Otilia decided to  suggest some changes to the PT editors. And she did so in a very  original manner: she put it in the form of a document.    With good-humored language, she extracted some "pearls" from  the platform adopted by PT candidate for governor Jose Dirceu.  On two sheets of paper, under the title "The PT Way To Write  Documents," she listed, under 11 topics, the flaws and examples  of stodginess she found in party language. Using sarcasm, Maria  Otilia's 11 commandments prescribe exactly what should not be  done when writing for the "masses"--since that is the party's  intended audience. "That was the method I chose to call more  attention to the defects," she argues. In the third commandment,  "Use a tangle of idle chatter, choose words and expressions  whose meanings are elastic, vague, and imprecise," she suggested  a simpler text for the title of the document. "PT Objectives in  the 1994 elections: elect Lula president and win the governor's  mansion." Compare this with what the petistas  preferred: "In 1994, the Brazilian people will have an historic  opportunity to inflict, via the ballot box, a strategic defeat  on the dominant sectors of society."    According to Maria Otilia, petistas "preach to the  choir, repeat themselves, use obscure expressions and titles,  and conceal their thoughts behind difficult words." Evidence of  this last observation can be found in the latest document from  the PT oven. On 8 February, the party put out a press release  entitled "PT Continues Its Obstruction" about the party's  participation in the constitutional revision. In other words,  after two days of debate, the PT released an ambiguous paper  over its internal division. In it, the executive board confirms  its position against the revision, but speaks of a "maximum  agenda" and actually postpones the final decision until 17  February. The fear of appearing to have a limited vocabulary is  the principal cause of this frustrated attempt at sophistication  in language. Or perhaps they prefer to complicate things so no  one really will understand them.  <H5>  [Boxed quotes, page 29] </H5> <H3>  Who Gives Orders To Whom--Will Lula Be Able To Impose His  Will, or Will He Be Led Around By the Party? </H3>    -  Esperidiao Amim, senator, PPR-SC [Progressive  Renewal Party, Santa Catarina]: "There are so many internal  splits that no one can tell anyone else what to do.

They have really hurt the PT."    -  Jose Paulo  Bisol, PSB senator from Rio Grande do Sul: "There are both  utopian groups and forces worried about governability. That  sparks conflicts within the party."    -  Luiz Gushiken, PT  deputy from Sao Paulo: "As president, Lula will be bigger  than the PT because his electorate will exceed the boundaries of  the party."</p>

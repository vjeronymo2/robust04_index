			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Defence of franc to dictate policy - The desire for a new relationship with Bonn THE key element in the new French conservative government's foreign, as well as domestic, policy will be maintaining the franc's parity with the D-Mark, as the only achievement which still holds the door open to eventual European monetary and political union. But that does not mean France's external policy will be unchanged. Indeed, it is precisely to maintain the departing Socialist government's strong currency stance - at a time of wide recession in Europe and record real interest rates at home - that France's new centre-right governors want a new relationship with Germany. All that is mentioned in the joint RPR and UDF manifesto is the need for a 'new initiative' with Germany in the monetary field. But this is just one - though the most important - element of a package deal, including a more aggressive European commercial stance and recognition of Germany's greater geo-political status, which the new government seems to want to present to Germany. If the government can get Germany to agree, it believes that President Francois Mitterrand will have no cause to try to exercise his prerogative in foreign policy. If the Germans balk, and if an EC crisis erupts, then France's new government may well face trouble from its president and from abroad. The new initiative towards Germany, says an adviser to Mr Edouard Balladur, the preferred RPR candidate for prime minister, 'will not be the caricature' often presented by conservative politicians or by the French employers' federation; France's new prime minister will not dash across the Rhine to deliver an ultimatum that Bonn and Frankfurt must somehow find a way to reduce German interest rates by a set percentage by a set date. Rather, this adviser says, the new government will take 'France's first opportunity since the fall of the Berlin Wall to discuss a new relationship with Germany calmly' in an atmosphere unencumbered by the long Maastricht treaty negotiations. This would involve getting the Germans to acknowledge that with their goal of integrating the eastern Lander into the federal republic taking priority over all else, they no longer provide the model of 'balanced growth' for Europe to aim at; that France is now a better approximation of this model; and that, at the very least, Germany must share its anchor position in the European monetary system with France. What does this 'sharing' mean? The answers here are a bit vague. It does not seem to mean the German government making any precise promise on interest rate cuts, which only the Bundesbank can deliver on. RPR advisers believe France has a margin of manoeuvre to lower its interest rates in the coming months, because its short-term rates are a couple of points above German ones, because French inflation is half the German rate of price increases, and because German short-term rates will probably come down another 1-2 percentage points in the next six months. What the new government absolutely does not want to do is to have to respond to some short-term speculative crisis by raising French rates. RPR advisers see the run-up to Denmark's second Maastricht referendum on May 18 as one such danger point, even if, as expected, the Danes ratify the treaty. If Denmark votes the treaty down, making subsequent UK ratification improbable or irrelevant, then the scenario changes to one in which Germany would join France and some other countries, like the Benelux, in announcing a new monetary union plan. So, within its first two months, the new government would like some public show of monetary co-operation from Germany. Narrowing the franc/D-Mark fluctuation bands in the EMS is mentioned in Paris, but the Bundesbank might object that such a move would make its intervention in support of the franc more predictable, and therefore harder to wrong-foot speculators. But it seems likely that Paris will expect some early gesture from Germany to reciprocate its promise to create an identikit Bundesbank by giving the Banque de France autonomy in monetary policy-setting. The new government's persuasive powers may be taxed even harder on trade. But France's conservatives have campaigned themselves to victory on complaints that the European Commission, passively aided and abetted by the outgoing French Socialist government, has been dangerously derelict in its duty to protect not only agriculture but also industry from unfair international competition. Europe is being asked to open up too fast on too many fronts, goes the conservatives' argument in Paris. If Germany wants freer trade with eastern Europe, then it must join France in ensuring the EC takes a tougher line in Gatt negotiations. In return for changing tack on monetary and commercial policy, the new French government will support Germany's case for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR secretary-general who wants to be the new foreign minister, has been quite explicit about playing this political card. Will Germany buy such a deal? Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, has suggested in French minds that it would. The minister has been as keen in public to welcome an eventual Security Council seat for his country as he has been overtly impatient about French obstructionism in Gatt. But another senior German minister has privately retorted recently that there could be 'no deal' on this basis, and that most Germans are not interested in Security Council prestige to compromise on their basic economic interests. France's Gaullist politicians may therefore be deluding themselves into reading into German minds their own reactions to Security Council status. If the new government can plausibly show some success in its 'new initiative' towards Germany, then it may find it easier to soft-pedal on agricultural policy. France will continue to oppose the draft EC-US deal on farm trade; the incoming conservatives are just angry that the outgoing Socialists have left it to them to possibly wield France's veto. But Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the departing farm minister, has shown them it is possible to use guerrilla tactics in Brussels to adapt last year's reform of EC farm policy more to French interests, instead of trying to rip the reform up. In defence policy, the new government will probably continue to edge France nearer to operational co-operation with Nato. Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, is clearly persuaded that with a less US-dominated alliance, there can be a place for France. But the Socialists have left one political trap for the new government, by suspending nuclear weapons tests. Resuming such tests - if the US and Russia continue their own test bans - could prove explosive, in more than one sense.</p>

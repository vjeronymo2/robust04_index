			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad catches the free-market bug - UN body seeks to assist rich and poor in an open trade system AGAINST all the odds, the UN Conference on Trade and Development appears to have accomplished what it set out to do at its eighth conference in Cartagena, Colombia: restructure itself so it can play a bigger part in influencing world trade and development. The future of this UN organisation, which has functioned since its founding in 1964 primarily as a trade and development watchdog on behalf of the developing world, depends on finding new ways to benefit countries - from the very poor to the very rich - that endorse free-market policies. With so many developing countries already carrying out market-oriented reforms and accepting the liberalisation of trade as part of a growth strategy, dialogue has become easier. Few significant conflicts surfaced at Unctad VIII, and, to most delegates' relief, ideology barely intruded. The desperation to keep up 'the spirit of consensus' was such that the final political declaration dissolved into a few platitudes - but the document on revamping Unctad is solid. The organisation's existing committees have been scrapped, and four new ones named. Although the subjects covered - commodities, poverty alleviation, service sectors and economic co-operation among developing countries - are not new, their terms of reference will be redrawn to fit changing circumstances. 'This will have to be done rapidly because the countries clearly intend it should be,' said Mr Carlos Fortin, deputy to the secretary-general, Mr Kenneth Dadzie. Mr Fortin sees Unctad's main function as providing an overall vision of trade and development related issues, and extending this to analysing problems that need international action. For example, all nations wanted to increase trade, so competition was a special concern. 'What kind of competition do we really want? What economic and other obstacles are there for competition? Unctad can do global studies of this nature and be a pioneer in getting agreements going,' said Mr Fortin. Competition surfaced in several guises and is one of the reasons developing countries have come to endorse the negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Until recently Gatt was seen as a rich man's club (with Unctad known as the poor man's Gatt), but now that poorer countries are more interested in trade they want the protection afforded by clear multilateral rules. As a result, there were repeated calls for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay round. Both poverty and the environment were taken up by the conference: 'sustainable' development was the byword, with the proposal that Unctad could be one of the organisations to follow up the Rio Earth Summit in June and help create a new environmental order. Trade-related environmental questions, especially where commodities are involved, are already being tackled by Unctad. The conference gave a high priority to alleviating poverty with support for programmes designed to deal with the problem of the 47 least developed countries, particularly in the context of depressed commodity prices. But Unctad has invested enormous efforts in commodity questions 'to remarkably little effect', as one African delegate said. And Colombia's proposal for a world commodity conference received only tepid backing because few members believed it could succeed where, for instance, coffee pact negotiations have so far failed. The volume of world exports grew by an average of 6.5 per cent a year from 1985 to 1990, with the market-oriented industrialised countries accounting for about 70 per cent of the total. Although developing countries increased their exports by 9 per cent a year in the same period, this figure was largely due to the performance of south-east Asian countries. By contrast, African and Latin American countries depending mainly on commodities had lower export growth by volume, and lost purchasing power. Developing countries are particularly enthusiastic about Unctad's concept of 'trade efficiency' which proved its practical worth in a newly installed 'Trade Point', a trade information technology centre, in Cartagena. 'We've shown here that we can cut the cost of transactions by 40 per cent, even in a small city. It's not highly sophisticated technology, it only costs Dollars 20,000 to install,' said Mr Jean Gurunlian, chief of Unctad's trade facilitation. 'The main aim is to eliminate obstacles and corruption, and move goods faster. What it does require is a change of attitude.' Delegates were so impressed by the possibilities of savings in time and costs that they agreed on a Trade Efficiency Symposium in 1994. Unctad's role as the main UN development forum is still a diffused one, with the important decisions being made by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Gatt. At a time when Unctad, is under pressure to be more useful and look for ways of alleviating poverty, the efficiency concept is thus especially relevant. At the end of the conference, Mr Dadzie, whose term was extended for another year, said the meeting marked a turning point and reflected 'a remarkable unity of purpose' which would 'command the adherence of everyone'. There are a lot of inconsistencies to be ironed out back at Unctad headquarters in Geneva, and the organisation's role as a catalyst will only be assured when the new committees and working groups have proved their effectiveness. But, as the Brazilian delegates commented: 'This is the first time Unctad has even come up with a proper set of priorities. And with the reforms in place we can tackle the substance.'  -------------------------------------------------------------          DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: PERCENTAGE GROWTH               IN VOLUME OF EXPORTS 1980-1989*  -------------------------------------------------------------                                  1980-1985     1985-1989  ------------------------------------------------------------- All developing countries              -1.2           9.5 Africa                                -4.1           2.5   North Africa                        -4.9           5.0   Sub-Saharan Africa                  -3.7           0.8 Asia                                   5.5           8.9   West Asia                          -12.3          11.4   South and South-East Asia            7.4          15.0 Latin America                          3.7           2.8  ------------------------------------------------------------- *Annual average.  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unctad secretariat  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

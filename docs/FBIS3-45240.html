			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Szu-hua (2621 1835 5478): "Zhu Entao </F> Says China Will Resolutely Crack Down on Triads But Welcomes  Those Who Mend Their Ways"]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--When meeting the  visiting delegation from the Royal Hong Kong Police Local  Inspectors' Association in Beijing today, Zhu Entao, director of  China's National Central Bureau of Interpol, reiterated that the  Chinese Government takes a resolute stance in cracking down on  underworld crime. However, the Chinese Government also welcomes  those underworld elements who have turned over a new leaf with  actual good conduct.    Zhu Entao also told the association that the Chinese  Government will not under any circumstances send public security  police to work in the police force of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] or recruit personnel from the  mainland after 1997.    At the meeting, Zhu exchanged views with the visiting group  on police affairs in Hong Kong and the mainland. Touching on  the underworld problem, Zhu reiterated that it is the Chinese  Government's consistent stand to strike resolutely at underworld  crimes and to prevent underworld elements from developing their  organizations on the mainland. They will be resolutely banned  the moment they are unearthed. If underworld elements from Hong  Kong commit crimes on the mainland, they will certainly be  handled according to the law. It is absolutely impossible for  them to seek refuge on the mainland after committing crimes in  Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Zhu Entao said that if they have corrected  their conduct with good concrete performances, the Chinese  Government definitely welcomes them.    As to the recent cooperation between the two sides regarding  the crackdown on crimes, such as the yachts stolen in Hong Kong,  Zhu said the mainland side has paid close attention to the  problem and is now studying countermeasures for that.    In addition, Zhu Entao also explained to the association  that  the Hong Kong Police will still be accountable to the SAR  government after 1997. If there is a police manpower shortage,  this is also an affair for the SAR government and the police  commissioner. The Chinese Government will under no  circumstances send public security personnel or recruit  policemen to work in Hong Kong. He maintained that this is a  major Chinese Government principle to realize Hong Kong being  ruled by the Hong Kong people.</p>

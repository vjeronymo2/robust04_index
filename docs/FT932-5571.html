			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / British Steel increases prices again BRITISH STEEL yesterday announced its third round of price increases this year. The company is raising the list price of steel tubes by an average of 7 per cent from July 4. Steel tubes are used in a range of construction and manufacturing processes. The increase is a result of higher raw material prices previously announced by British Steel, which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m in the six months to the end of September. Analysts have forecast that losses for the year to the end of March are likely to have been more than Pounds 100m. Prices of hot-rolled coil steel, used to make steel tubes, were raised by British Steel in January and again in April. The company said it had no choice but to increase its prices if it was to make an adequate return from its business. British Steel said that prices of many of its products were still well below peak levels of 1990, even after the latest increases. The fall in the value of sterling has made it easier for the company to make increases stick. Exporters of steel to Britain, faced with a decline in the value of their exports, so far appear unwilling to undercut British Steel prices. The company, in addition to raising the price of hot-rolled coil steel, also announced increases in list prices of steel plate and section in January and again in April this year. British Steel said that the increases had generally been accepted by its customers.</p>

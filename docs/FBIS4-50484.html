			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] has  actively participated in and discussed governmental and  political affairs, has strengthened democratic supervision, and  has become an important political force.    In the past year, the Tibet CPPCC Committee has regarded  investigative and researching tasks as its regular work. It has  offered advice and proposals to various localities. When  launching education programs to oppose splittism and enhance  patriotism, the Tibet CPPCC Committee has proceeded from Tibet's  actual conditions, has forcefully publicized that Tibet is an  inalienable part of China, and has promulgated Tibet's  accomplishments in implementing reform in the past 19 years.  Therefore, it has been safeguarding the motherland's unity.    At present, the Tibet CPPCC Committee has become a decisive  political force, thereby ensuring the thriving progress of  various construction projects in Tibet.</p>

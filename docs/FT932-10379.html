			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Travel: How to play the waiting game - Practical Traveller, Cancelled flights ONE does not know whether to rant. Perhaps raving would be more appropriate. Most of us just sit resignedly in the bar, whiling away the hours with an over-priced beer. But what rights do we really have when a flight is delayed, cancelled or rerouted? Our chances of sympathetic treatment, according to the Air Transport Users Committee, depends mainly on the airline, the type of ticket held and the nature of the delay. As a rule of thumb, it says, airlines tend to reflect the standards of customer service in the country of origin. According to the AUC, passengers are in the best position in cases of 'denied boarding.' Nearly all airlines sell more tickets for a flight than they have seats, because a certain percentage of passengers consistently fails to show up. But delicate calculations sometimes go awry, leaving anxious passengers jostling for limited seats. Those denied boarding for flights originating in the EC have European legislation on their side. Carriers are obliged to offer the choice between a full refund or an alternative flight. In addition, you are entitled to cash compensation of Ecu150 (Pounds 120) for journeys up to 3,500kms, and of Ecu300 for longer flights. Compensation may be reduced if you reach your destination with minimal delay, defined as two hours for short-haul flights and four for long-haul. Passengers (like criminal suspects) are also entitled to make a phone call (or send a fax), and to meals and a hotel room where necessary. Airlines may offer their own vouchers in lieu of cash, but you are not obliged to accept them. If the flight does not originate in Europe (this includes return legs) then EC legislation will not apply. Most airlines fill the aircraft by upgrading passengers to first or business class, usually selecting smartly-dressed customers holding full-fare economy tickets. Check-in staff will then seek volunteers willing to be 'bumped' off the flight in return for vouchers. These are redeemable for tickets on the same carrier. American Airlines, for example, offers those bumped off transatlantic flights anything from Dollars 400 (Pounds 259.70) to Dollars 1,000 worth of vouchers. In the case of long delays or outright cancellation, says the AUC, 'rough justice', not EC legislation, prevails. The passenger, in effect, has 'no rights at all.' The thinking is that it would be unwise to compel airlines to pay compensation for delays caused by technical faults, since to do so would create commercial pressures to fly unsafe aircraft. In the case of bad weather or air-traffic-control difficulties, it is deemed unfair to punish the airline for circumstances beyond its control. Thankfully, most airlines have a reputation to protect. If flights are delayed, they will usually provide refreshments and, when necessary, accommodation. In the case of outright cancellations, you should seek to have your ticket endorsed by other carriers. Some airlines are very good at this, but there is a pecking order. First-class, business and full-fare economy passengers are looked after first, with bucket-shop ticket-holders relegated to the bottom of the pile. Missed connections involving more than one airline are the greyest area, the danger being that the stranded passenger falls between two stools. Your best bet is to harry the first carrier. If you have incurred extra expenses because of missing your onward flight, send them the bill. It is difficult to insure against relatively short delays. Many policies only pay out for a wait of longer than 12 hours. If you want to be covered for less drastic circumstances, consult the fine print. Complaints are best pursued directly with the airline concerned. If matters are not resolved satisfactorily send relevant documentation and an explanatory letter to Clare Tallboys, Consumer Affairs Adviser, Air Transport Users Committee, 2nd Floor, Kingsway House, 103 Kingsway, London WC2B 6QX. The AUC is not a statutory body but will help take up your case.</p>

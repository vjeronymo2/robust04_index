			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Tory MPs reject compromise on student unions The education bill, a key part of the government's Back to Basics campaign, appeared to be in deep trouble last night after backbench Conservative critics rejected compromise proposals on student unions. The bill has been stalled in the Lords since its second reading in early January, when peers on all sides objected to provisions giving the government powers to impose strict restrictions on the activities of student unions. A group of prominent Conservative education specialists in the Commons made clear, however, that they would oppose the bill unless it was amended to make membership of student unions voluntary. Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday offered the two sets of critics a compromise which would ensure that student unions remained broadly independent, while abolishing regulations making membership compulsory. Announcing the revised proposals in the Lords, Baroness Blatch, the junior education minister, said the government would replace its proposed power to direct student unions with provisions for a code of practice, including rights for students to opt out. The compromise was welcomed by vice-chancellors, who had campaigned strongly to keep student unions free from what many regarded as a government takeover. Mr Ted Nield, spokesman for the committee of vice-chancellors and principals, said it followed 'very constructive' talks with Lady Blatch and other ministers. The rebels in the Commons accused the government of pandering to the higher-education establishment, and demanded further changes. Mr Graham Riddick, a parliamentary private secretary who has long campaigned against compulsory membership, said the proposals would leave unions in the hands of extremists, and expose students who opted out to victimisation. He said: 'Clearly the bill will have to be beefed up when it reaches the Commons.' Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the compromise as 'an embarrassing climbdown'.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Belarussians look to rouble tie to save them: Leyla Boulton on a plan which critics say would amount to Russia subsidising an unreconstructed neighbour 'Socialism lives on here. Who in the west would feed us like Russia does?' asked Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, governor of the central bank of Belarus, the former Soviet republic that is hoping to consummate a rouble marriage with its giant neighbour as soon as possible. But as he watched demonstrators march past his window in protest against a currency union plan which has also been attacked by Russian reformers, he admitted that too many people in Belarus, including its neo-communist government, were under the illusion 'that this monetary union will save them'. Final agreement is awaiting a decision by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, on Belarus demands for the deal to include subsidised energy and a favourable exchange rate for replacing its surrogate currency, the hare, with the Russian rouble. Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank chairman who would take over many of Mr Bogdankevich's responsibilities if the deal goes through, claim it will help Russian companies by restoring old Soviet-era trading links. Along with making Belarus follow Russian monetary, fiscal, and trade policy, the proposed treaty would abolish all customs barriers between the two countries. Politically, it would make Belarus, traditionally the least independent-minded republic in the former Soviet Union, abandon much of its sovereignty to its neighbour. Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the Belarus prime minister who has failed to introduce any significant market reforms and now wants to restore Soviet-era price controls to deal with inflation that is twice as high as in Russia, claimed the deal represented the republic's 'only chance of survival'. But critics of the agreement in Russia, such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister who believes the parliament will block it, say Russia cannot afford to take on the subsidisation of an unreconstructed neighbour. Even the Belarus side, claiming they spend more money maintaining Russian troops on Belarus soil, have valued the Russian energy subsidies it wants at Dollars 1.4bn a year. Mr Vladimir Karyagin, who heads a Belarus entrepreneurs' union, fears that in finalising the deal, the two governments will focus on helping large state-owned factories at the expense of his country's fledgling private business sector. Mr Bogdankevich, whose pleas for bolder reform have so far fallen on deaf ears in the government, said that monetary union, if accompanied by subsidised energy for Belarus companies, would offer 'sensible new rulers' a golden opportunity to restructure and privatise the economy. 'But you cannot conduct reforms if the government is not up to them,' he said, doubting the opportunity would be taken up, at least not before fresh elections, which are being demanded by the opposition. Although a meek response to a general strike call, the demonstration by a few thousand protestors last Tuesday illustrated the discontent simmering among the republic's 10m inhabitants. Saying that many workers had been frightened away from the protest by the government and their managers, the demonstrators complained about ferocious inflation, low pay and ailing factories. They demanded early elections for both parliament and a new post of president to sweep out a leadership dominated by old-style party bureaucrats. 'Our government is trying to save itself by joining the rouble zone, which we do not need,' said Mikhail, a worker at an electronics plant. 'But we would join a dollar zone any day.' Having kept this industrialised republics' state-owned enterprises going with inflationary cheap credits, the government last year boasted that industrial production had fallen only 10 per cent in 1993. But the results of its refusal to reform are now catching up with it. Industrial enterprises which have continued to function without being forced to become more efficient are experiencing a fall in production much greater than in Russia. Industrial output fell by 39 per cent in January alone compared with January 1992, and inflation for January was about 40 per cent, double the Russian rate. Factories are grinding to a halt and workers fear they will be laid off even without restructuring. With only 3 per cent of state-owned industry and agriculture in private hands, and a discount rate the same as Russia's despite inflation being twice as high, Mr Bogdankevich's hopes that a union could push Belarus into starting reforms seem at least optimistic.</p>

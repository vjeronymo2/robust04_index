			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Germans cools to Maastricht pact GERMAN companies are the least enthusiastic in the larger European Community countries about the Maastricht treaty for European union, according to an international business opinion survey published yesterday. The survey also indicates that a surprisingly large proportion  - 18 per cent  - of German business leaders believe their country will fail to meet the economic conditions for monetary union. The report, based on 1,483 interviews with company directors in seven EC countries, was carried out by Harris Research for the United Parcel Service distribution company. The findings back up the impression that German public opinion has cooled markedly on the aim of European union as a result of the country's post-unification difficulties. Widespread support has also been revealed for setting up a European central bank to run monetary union. More than half of respondents in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Britain and Spain said they supported this, but only 35 per cent of German companies thought monetary union a good idea. French, Italian and Belgian business leaders were the most enthusiastic about the treaty. In Britain, 43 per cent were in favour. In Germany, however, 19 per cent thought it 'poor' or 'very poor'. The survey provides reassuring confirmation of widely perceived national characteristics. The British and Germans are most in favour of free competition, with the French the least supportive. German companies are most pessimistic about future business prospects, with the French the most optimistic. The survey reveals widespread self-doubt in individual countries about their chances of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria set for monetary union. A total of 77 per cent of Italians think their country will not fulfil the eligibility test, as do 56 per cent of Belgians and 29 per cent of British. The most confident country appears to be France, where only 2 per cent think their own nation will fail to mount the monetary union hurdle. The Maastricht treaty sets conditions covering eligibility for monetary union, laying down that countries have to keep their budget deficits to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, and restrain national debt to 60 per cent of GDP.</p>

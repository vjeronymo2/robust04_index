Russian Premier's Visit to United States Has Been a Success --  They Lent Us Money"]    [Text] Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, who is on an official visit to the United States,  has held working meetings with Lewis Preston, president of the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD],  and IMF Director Michel Camdessus.    At the end of his meeting with L. Preston, the  representatives of Russia and the IBRD signed four agreements  granting the Russian Federation loans worth a total of $820  million. We are talking about credit of $300 million to develop  the country's transportation infrastructure, $200 million to  develop the financial and banking system, $240 million to reform  agriculture, and a loan of $80 million to implement land reform.    Replying to a question from an RIA correspondent, Viktor  Chernomyrdin said that he had discussed with the IBRD directors  not only current topics but also the prospects for the longer  term. For example, an organization might be set up in Russia at  the federal level which will concentrate all work with the bank  in its hands. The premier also requested the bank's leadership  to provide the Russian Federation with assistance in pursuing  debts from countries which borrowed money from the former USSR.    Commenting on his meeting with V. Chernomyrdin, IMF Director  Michel Camdessus said that at this meeting they merely discussed  the general state of affairs in the Russian economy. "We did  not mention any loans," he said.    M. Camdessus spoke highly of the measures being undertaken  by  the Russian Government in the economic sphere. "I am sure that  Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet will be successful," he noted. It  is expected that this summer representatives of Russia and the  IMF will begin active work on an agreement for 1995.    Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  believes that the main result of the work done by the  Russian-U.S. Commission headed by himself and U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore is that it has managed to convince the  U.S. Administration of the need to regard Russia as a country  with a transitional economy. Speaking about this in a talk with  journalists, the premier also announced that U.S. leaders  support the lifting of unjustified trade restrictions against  Russia. "Our entrepreneurs should face no obstacles in their  work on the world market," V. Chernomyrdin stressed.    He announced that the commission is broadening the scope of  its activity. "We are complying with all the decisions we have  made and on every occasion we are broadening the circle of  problems under discussion," the premier said.    Russian Federation Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, for  example, told an RIA correspondent that at the next session of  the commission a committee for scientific and technical  cooperation in the sphere of transportation could be added to  the committees for business cooperation, conversion, the power  industry, science and technology, space, and environmental  protection.    V. Chernomyrdin said that during the commission's work they  had managed to reach agreement on U.S. participation in building  storage facilities for weapons-grade plutonium on Russian  territory; this plutonium will then be reprocessed into nuclear  fuel. The United States has agreed to grant Russia compensation  for the dual-purpose nuclear reactors which are being closed  down and where weapons-grade plutonium is produced.    In an interview with an RIA correspondent, Russian  Federation  Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov explained that we are  talking about two reactors located in the Tomsk and Krasnodar  areas. In the opinion of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, closing  them down will cost approximately $1.1 billion.</p>

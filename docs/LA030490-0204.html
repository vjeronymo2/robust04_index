			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> BUSH DIPLOMATIC STYLE: 'LAID BACK'  </P> <P> Diplomacy, as offered by George Bush: Come on over. Informal. Talk about it.  </P> <P> That diplomacy, in a style unique to the man conducting it, is coming out of  the White House these days in staccato maxi-bursts that mimic the monologues --  the verbal shards of thought, they've been called -- of the President himself.  </P> <P> Helmut Kohl? Up to Camp David.  </P> <P> Toshiki Kaifu? How about next weekend? Meet in Rancho Mirage.  </P> <P> Every day, it seems, brings a new example of the way this President -- the man  who took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to opening day at Baltimore's  Memorial Stadium to watch the Orioles and Red Sox -- likes to run his White  House, the nation's foreign policy, and even his leisure time.  </P> <P> This weekend, they all came together in a sand-trap summit.  </P> <P> That is why Toshiki Kaifu, a 59-year-old Japanese politician trying to ride the  tiger of a surging Japan while balancing the demands of his own constituency  and that of an increasingly wary United States, traveled more than 10 hours  from Tokyo to find himself snaking along in an armor-plated Cadillac limousine  between towering walls of hedges along streets named Frank Sinatra and Bob  Hope. Waiting at the end of the ride through the desert was an informal dinner  with Bush and senior aides.  </P> <P> If there was anything atypical about this weekend's version of global Life with  Poppy -- a one-time nickname of the President's -- it was the setting.  </P> <P> To be sure, Walter H. Annenberg, the publishing magnate and former ambassador  to Britain, has played host for years at his Sunnylands estate to Presidents  (Nixon and Reagan, among them) and royalty (Queen Elizabeth II and Prince  Charles, to name two), so there was nothing unusual about President Bush's  coming out for the weekend or about Kaifu's having dinner there with the  President. Nor, given Annenberg's hospitality for prime ministers and  potentates and the extent of his desert domain, was there anything out of the  ordinary in Bush's readiness to invite Kaifu to dinner at someone else's house.  </P> <P> But Rancho Mirage, in general -- and a 32,600-square-foot home decorated with  Cezannes, Van Goghs, Renoirs, a Rodin bronze of Eve and flowers from two  greenhouses on the 250-acre property, in particular -- just don't have the  flavor of the other presidential hangouts: Kennebunkport, Me., the prim,  understated summer hometown of the Bush family diagonally across the continent;  Beeville, Tex., the rough-edged South Texas town where a Bush buddy keeps a  hunting ranch that the President visits each late December, or Islamorada, the  little town in the Florida Keys where Bush likes to take up the challenge of  reducing the Gulf of Mexico's population of the wily bonefish.  </P> <P> No, this is much more of a resort -- a community where tennis and golf and spas  are the raison d'etre; where people live, literally, on the grounds of their  country clubs, like the Morningside Country Club where the Bush-Kaifu talks  were held. In Rancho Mirage, garages have separate little doors for golf carts;  the carts bear markings of prestige (reserved for Bush and Kaifu were identical  carts with shiny grills that replicated the distinct front of a Rolls-Royce),  and house guests, particularly visiting heads of state, don't have to share the  bathrooms.  </P> <P> The President's visit here was originally scheduled as a nearly 48-hour  vacation at the end of two hectic travel days that included Republican  fund-raising events -- lunch one day in Staten Island, N.Y., and dinner in San  Francisco, in a typical Bush itinerary -- and four speeches in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Instead of vacation, Bush spent Friday afternoon and evening with Kaifu, and  met with him again Saturday morning and at lunch, after having awakened him in  the middle of the night just a week earlier to invite him here. It wasn't until  after Kaifu left that Bush had time for golf on Annenberg's private course.  </P> <P> Rancho Mirage is accustomed to such comings and goings, and appeared to take  the 25-hour summit in stride. But in nearby Palm Springs, Mayor Sonny Bono  pronounced the events "totally awesome," and his wife, Mary, was reported by  the Desert Sun to have picked out the outfit she wore to await the arrival of  Bush aboard Air Force One on Friday with an eye to coordinating her colors with  that of the jet, which bears a distinctive Raymond Loewy design in blue, white  and silver.  </P> <P> For all the focus during the talks on the U.S.-Japanese relationship, an  undercurrent was the U.S. public's view of that relationship.  </P> <P> According to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in January, one-quarter of  those surveyed expressed "generally unfriendly" feelings about Japan, an  increase from 19% last June and 8% in 1985.  </P> <P> And Bush went out of his way at a news conference overlooking the Morningside  Country Club golf course after the talks to tell his American audience that his  visitor's readiness to fly over to the United States at a relative moment's  notice "should be interpreted in this manner: that the Japanese feel this  relationship is very important."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Styazhkin] </F>   [Text] Cherkessk April 24 TASS -- Elections to the people's  assembly of the North Caucasian republic of  Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, scheduled for Sunday, became  unnecessary. The People's Assembly, which was designed to  radically transform the republic's legislative power, has been  already formed: This name was assumed by the republican  parliament under a decision taken by its session.    Official elections to the People's Assembly will be held  after Karachayevo-Cherkessiya passes its constitution. It is to  be drafted by the National Council and then submitted for the  people's discussion.    The same decision by the parliament made unnecessary a  republican referendum also scheduled for Sunday. Put to  people's vote was the question about the need for presidency in  Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. When passed, the constitution will  solve this problem.    Primarily, the decision to hold elections to the People's  Assembly and a referendum in the republic was taken by the  republican parliament last year. But then it was revised at the  initiative of the republic's major political parties and mass  movements which decided that it would be difficult to build  truly effective bodies of government without a constitution.</p>

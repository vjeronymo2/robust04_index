			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Zeneca makes debut with 41% rise ZENECA, the bioscience group floated by Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday reported a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits as part of its first set of results. The pre-tax figure advanced from Pounds 261m to Pounds 367m for the six months to June 30. Zeneca's shares gained 24p to 646p. The company, which manufactures pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality chemicals, reported sales up 13 per cent from Pounds 2.06bn to Pounds 2.32bn. Profits and sales benefited from sterling's devaluation. Group trading profits increased 26 per cent to Pounds 412m, of which 7 per cent was generated by underlying volume growth, 3 per cent by price increases and 16 per cent by cost cuts and exchange rates movements. The pharmaceuticals division's trading profits advanced 34 per cent to Pounds 302m, on sales up 22 per cent to Pounds 924m. Underlying volume growth was 7 per cent. The division benefited from its exposure to the hospital drugs market which did not suffer as much as the general practitioner market in Germany, Italy or the US. Sales of Tenormin, Zeneca's best-selling drug, fell 22 per cent to Pounds 242m, following the expiry of US patents. The decline was more than offset by new products. Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said he was looking at a range of options in pharmaceuticals, including joint research and development, product swaps, co-marketing deals, and mergers and acquisitions. The group was examining additional links with biotechnology groups. Agrochemicals reported trading profits down 11 per cent to Pounds 85m, on sales up from Pounds 748m to Pounds 825. At constant exchange rates, turnover fell 3 per cent. A 4 per cent rise in agrochemicals sales in the US was offset by a decline in Europe generated by a collapse in the German and French markets, down 40 per cent and 25 per cent respectively - both hit by CAP reforms. Earnings per share were 33.3p, against 24.6p. The first interim dividend is 10.5p. Lex, Page 20</p>

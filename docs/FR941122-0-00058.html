			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September 29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered. From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994, the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified and addressed in the final EIS. Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes in final rule as a result of public comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following minor changes and clarifications were made to the final rule or to discussions of the final rule based on public comments on the proposed rule. These individual or cumulative changes do not alter the predicted impact or effect of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Several conditions on when wolves may be harassed or taken were removed from the final rule. The following conditions are not part of the final rule: (1) Distinction between adult wolves and pups, and (2) harassment may only occur for 15 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In the background discussion of the final rule, it was clarified that after a private individual takes a depredating wolf, no additional agency actions will be conducted to control problem wolves in an area, unless more livestock depredations occur. This assumes that the problem wolf was killed, and therefore, no other control actions are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Several terms in the final rule were clarified and defined, including: ``opportunistic noninjurious harassment,'' ``unintentional take,'' ``disposal of livestock carrion,'' issuance criteria for a wolf take permit to a grazing lessee on public lands, and criteria for resolving wolf/ungulate conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A termination clause was added to the final rule. The clause clarifies the Service's role and responsibilities regarding the establishment of an experimental population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Three years following the initial reintroduction of wolves, a thorough review will be conducted. The review will determine if further reintroductions are required and if, to date, the management program has been successful. A provision to the rule was added that if the reintroduction and management practices under the experimental population rule did not result in wolf recovery, the Service would take appropriate actions. Such actions would be caused by the failure of the wolf population to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years. All corrective actions would be coordinated with affected States, tribes, and other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Language regarding scientific or technical decisions in the background discussion of the rule was changed. Study design and reintroduction techniques may be changed or modified when expert and skilled biologists determine such changes are necessary and prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of relevant issues based on public comments and the Service's response to those issues follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subspecies of wolf that occupied the Yellowstone area was  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Canis lupus irremotus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The reintroduction program will use wolves from Canada which were once classified as a different subspecies; therefore, this violates the experimental population provision of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In recent times, there have been several revisions to the taxonomic classification of wolves in North America. Several scientific investigations have dealt with this issue (Brewster and Fritts 1994, Nowak 1994, Wayne et al. 1994). These investigations concluded (1) there were fewer wolf subspecies than previously believed, (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> irremotus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was not a distinct subspecies, and (3) that wolves might be better classified as types or representative groups of geographic or climatic conditions rather than distinct subspecies. The northern Rocky Mountains are within the historic range of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Canis lupus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Investigators conclude that reintroduction of wolves from Canada to the Park or central Idaho would accelerate the ongoing natural southern expansion of the species. Additionally, it was determined that current taxonomic discussions of wolf subspecies should not affect wolf recovery efforts in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

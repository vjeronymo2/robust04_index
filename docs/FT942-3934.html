			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The worst in Japan is over, survey suggests A faint economic dawn is beginning to dispel Japan's longest recession in post-war years, yet the rising sun looks anaemic. The latest survey of business confidence ('Tankan') by the Bank of Japan last Friday, showing the first upturn in sentiment for five years, was the latest in a series of indicators that not only is the worst over but an upturn has tentatively begun. The publication this week of gross domestic product figures for the first quarter to March is expected to confirm this. Several forecasters expect a small rise from the previous three months, perhaps a fraction of a percentage point, with a decline of a similar order from the same period last year. Few in Tokyo now doubt that the recession is past or at least near the bottom. The main evidence includes a rise in industrial production from the final quarter of last year to the first three months of this, plus increases in imports, household spending, construction contracts and an acceleration in the rate of growth in housing starts over the same period. At the same time, the rate of decline has slowed in supermarket and department store sales, car registrations and machinery orders. The big question now is in what kind of shape Japan's economy will emerge from the recession. Is it really anaemic, or leaner and meaner than in the fast-growth late 1980s? In the short term, at least, the latest economic statistics suggest a weaker recovery than from the previous two downturns, in the early and mid-1980s. For one thing, the Tankan shows that Japan's corporate restructuring, so far gentle by US and European standards, still has some way to go - not a problem in the previous upturns. The gap between output and demand is still high, though declining. This is shown in the Tankan by a decline in the percentage balance between companies reporting excess and insufficient supply from 55 in the previous survey in February to 50 in May. One consequence is that companies, in particular those in manufacturing, plan to cut their workforces by about 1 per cent, a further drag on consumer spending. Another is that they plan to reduce capital investment - by 3.7 per cent, for the third year running - so hitting suppliers of capital equipment. The general tone of the Tankan was, however, strong enough to give the Bank of Japan an argument not to cut its 1.75 per cent official discount rate (ODR), at which it supplies funds to commercial banks. The BoJ has guided overnight market rates - at which commercial banks lend to one another - to a record low of just over 2 per cent, very close to the ODR. Another drop is seen by many as a vitally-needed step to stimulate the fragile recovery. Yet central bank officials have talked in recent weeks of controlling the risks of recovery, rather than easing credit further, a sign that the lesson of the late 1980s' liquidity-fuelled explosion in asset prices is still etched deep in their minds. All this is worrying for those who fear that tight credit could throttle the recovery. For despite the central bank's strategy of driving down overnight rates, bank lending remains weak. There was a 1 per cent annualised decline in new loans by the 11 city banks last month, the Federation of Bankers' Associations says. All this indicates that the after-effects of the recession might take a year or two to evaporate. Many economists in Tokyo assume that Japan has lost one or two points from the average 4.5 per cent GDP growth rate it experienced in the 1980s. Of course, they could be too pessimistic, an over-reaction to the false economic dawn that appeared in spring last year. Corporate Japan could yet surprise the world with its hidden strength, as it has done before. The latest forecasts of Japanese companies' pre-tax profits by four Tokyo economic research groups range widely, from a 2.7 per cent decline by Nomura Research Institute to a 7.4 per cent increase by Nikko Research Centre. But the four, who published their forecasts late on Friday, expect corporate Japan to show profits growth of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent the following year.</p>

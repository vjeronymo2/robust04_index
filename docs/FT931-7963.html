			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Sacked staff get job-search help THREE quarters of companies help employees they sack to find new jobs, Cranfield School of Management has found. Independent consultants providing 'outplacement' services were the most popular with organisations, particularly for executives being made redundant, the management school's research, published today, indicates. Outside consultants were seen to help improve morale among remaining employees, as well as providing expertise for those seeking jobs, the study found. More than half of the companies using consultants said there had been a positive effect on public relations. However, there had been little observable effect on the retention of employees or on customer or supplier relations. Individual counselling was popular for executives being made redundant, while other employees were more likely to be advised in groups. Irrespective of redundancies, more than 65 per cent of organisations provided some sort of career counselling for their staff. Over half of companies said they would have handled redundancies differently if they had been doing them again. The need to improve communications was most frequently mentioned. The study of more than 600 companies was carried out by Cranfield for the Institute of Directors and the consultancy Pauline Hyde and Associates. The IoD said it welcomed the evidence that companies were accepting responsibility for managing redundancies effectively and realising that severance pay was no longer enough.

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Norway shipowner wins full control of Wilhelmsen Lines Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, one of Norway's largest shipowners, disclosed yesterday that it had paid Dollars 47.2m to gain full control of Wilhelmsen Lines, a leading operator of deep sea roll-on roll-off vessels, in which it held a 70 per cent shareholding, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. 'The acquisition confirms the group's strategy to concentrate on international liner trade as its core business,' said Mr Leif Terje Loddesol, chief executive. The two Finnish sellers, which each disposed of a 15 per cent stake, are Hollming Oy Shipping and Wicoria Oy. The terms of the deal call for the Norwegian shipowner to pay Dollars 41.9m in cash for 30 per cent of Wilhelmsen Lines, and gives the sellers an option from January through March next year to each acquire 275,000 class B Wilhelm Wilhelmsen shares. Should the option not be taken up by March 31, Wilhelm Wilhelmsen will complete the transaction by remitting the outstanding Dollars 5.3m in cash to Hollming and Wicoria.</p>

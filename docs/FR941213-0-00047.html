			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While we do not believe it is appropriate to mandate involvement of the patient and family in every case, the regulations do not preclude such involvement. We would hope that hospital staff would be open to information that the patient or his family might like to provide to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge as easy and effective as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discharge Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters believe that the statute requires a hospital to develop a discharge plan only upon request of a physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purpose of the legislation is to assure that patients receive any necessary discharge planning, not to ensure that a hospital develops a discharge plan only upon a physician's request. We agree that the physician is important to the discharge plan, and we included a provision to require a hospital to develop a discharge plan if a physician requests one, even if the hospital had determined one to be unnecessary. This provision, based on the statute, gives the physician the final decision as to whether a discharge plan is necessary but does not unnecessarily require his input on a routine basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters remarked about the use of the word ``assist'' in &sect;482.43(c)(3), which requires the hospital to ``assist in implementing the *&blank;*&blank;* discharge plan.'' One commenter liked the word ``assist'' as it requires the hospital to become involved without placing the entire responsibility on the hospital. Two commenters objected to the word as it is vague and passive; the statute requires the hospital to be the initiator of discharge planning. The fourth commenter thought the provision required the hospital to implement the discharge plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have decided to revise this paragraph to use the statutory language to allay any confusion. As revised, the regulations require the hospital to arrange for the initial implementation of the Medicare patient discharge plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters stated that we should specify in regulations the format and content of the discharge plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not believe it desirable to specify a single format and content for a discharge plan. Discharge planning is a discipline with competing theories and practices, each of which likely carries with it unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation procedures and formats. We believe the hospital should retain flexibility in deciding the plan's format and content. As our experience with this requirement develops and as needed, we will develop and revise interpretive guidelines for survey personnel to assist them in assessing the sufficiency of an acceptable discharge plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters thought we ought to require the hospital to furnish a written discharge plan to the patient or patient representative. Two commenters would like us to require the patient or representative to sign the discharge plan to acknowledge receipt and acknowledge participation in the plan. One commenter believed we ought to require hospitals to document in the medical record the fact that the patient and family have been counseled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although a hospital may choose to follow any of these suggestions, we do not want to encroach on its autonomy and flexibility by requiring these procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that the patient or patient representative should have the right to a review if he or she does not approve of the discharge plan, with no financial liability during the review process. Another commenter thought that we should include specific guidance about what hospitals must tell their patients about their rights when there are disputes about discharge plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the hospital's responsibility to assure there is a mechanism for handling discharge planning complaints and disputes and we believe they should have the flexibility to determine how to address these. The reassessment process in &sect;482.43(e) can measure how successful the hospital's procedures are.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters wanted the discharge plans to be given to patients within specified timeframes before discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not believe that establishing a specific time before discharge by which a discharge plan must be furnished would be useful. In some difficult situations, the plan may not be ready until shortly before the patient is discharged; having the plan ready too long before discharge does not allow for changing circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (3): From EIS to OLAP - Buzzwords An EIS, or executive information system, was originally conceived as a screen-based information service geared specifically to top executives, with easy-to-use, ready-packaged information which would provide a complete picture of the organisation. 'Drill down' provides detail on components, also in graphical form. 'Traffic lighting' is a technique to aid analysis, particularly of danger-zones or by pre-determined norms or limits for situations. Some now interpret the acronym as 'enterprise intelligence service' as EIS proves useful to managers further down the chain. The system sources include information drawn from internal computer and paper-based systems. It might also include external services, such as on-line share prices: this was once thought of as a primary executive function, but has proved to be a little-used option for most EIS-users. Increasingly, EIS applications are merging with their forebears: decision support systems (DSS) and management information systems (MIS). The latest buzzword to describe this development is OLAP - on-line analytical processing. This describes a multi-dimensional approach which allows the user to draw data together from different sources and view it as a 'cube,' which can be turned in any direction, to report on any dimension or set of dimensions such as time periods, sales regions or product. 'Legacy' is the term used to describe inherited, working systems, often mainframe-based. Although often used in a pejorative sense (because of the expense of maintainance as systems age), a legacy is often valuable, and can consist of core applications. It is not always desirable or practical to upgrade such systems. The alternative is 'downsizing': that is moving the applications on to a smaller computer, often a 'client-server' system of workstations capable of working independently, but linked through a central 'server' computer for sharing of applications and data. Where legacy systems cannot be abandoned, 'interoperability' is an option. This is often used where there are multiple operating systems in one installation, and is eased by using software written to be transportable ('ported') between different operating environments. Where this is not possible, 'feeder' systems can be especially written to give data a route between, for example, a spreadsheet and a consolidation system.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Some Lockheed Debt Ratings Reduced: The investment rating firm of Standard  &amp; Poor's downgraded its rating of Lockheed's senior debt and preliminary  shelf-registered debt to A from A plus. S&amp;P blamed the reductions on  Lockheed's "weakened earnings prospects in a difficult defense procurement  environment." It cited Lockheed's disclosure this week that it would report a  $35-million third-quarter loss. S&amp;P asserted that the tight defense market  would make it difficult for the company to compensate for the loss in earnings  on the C-5B plane program.  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US Nafta plan draws fire - Administration warned over side agreements on labour CLINTON administration proposals designed to attract labour support for the North American Free Trade Agreement are instead drawing Republican and Democratic fire and a Mexican refusal to cede sovereignty over labour rights. House Republicans told Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, they would oppose Nafta if he negotiated strong side agreements on labour and the environment. They object to the setting up of tri-national bodies with power to investigate abuses and recommend trade sanctions as a last resort. The Republicans accuse the administration of having lost the 'vision' of a pact which would boost trade and investment, and warn that the side agreements would channel 'disproportional resources' into the creation of multilateral environmental and labour bureaucracies 'with little accountability and sweeping mandates'. Last week several Democrat groups, members of the Alliance for Responsible Trade, listed objections to the US proposals as they apply to labour. The proposed standard allowing national enforcement of federal laws, they said, would not prevent a government lowering the standards of its laws to avoid being challenged for non-enforcement. The alliance wants an independent secretariat, perhaps with members from non-Nafta countries, overseeing labour complaints. Unlike the administration's proposal, it would accept complaints from citizen groups, rather than having to get government to bring a case. The administration's proposal that a 2/3 vote be required before a complaint is submitted to a panel 'certainly ensures that the panels will never be used. . .' the alliance said. But a Mexican official said: 'An independent commission with enforcement powers will never be acceptable to us.' He said labour was making impossible demands in an attempt 'to scuttle the whole thing'. However, Dr Robert Cohen, a fellow at the Washington-based Economic Strategy Institute who has close ties to labour, insists that some unions would support Nafta if the side agreements were clearer. 'They don't have to give labour absolutely everything that's been raised,' he said. 'But if there was attention paid to them, they could win some formidable support.'</p>

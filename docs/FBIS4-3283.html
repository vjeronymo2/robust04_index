			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China-U.S. Trade and  Investment Fair held at Los Angeles has been successful,  according to Wu Yi, visiting Chinese minister of foreign trade  and economic cooperation (MOFTEC).    Addressing the China-U.S. Trade and Investment Seminar at  the  Asia Society here today, Wu said that the two countries have  signed contracts worth of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134  agreements valued at 4 billion dollars in the fair.    The trade and investment fair is continued here in New York  for another three days, starting this afternoon.    Wu noted that she hoped the fair will also have a greater  breakthrough than that in Los Angeles.    The trade fair, which was deemed as the largest of its kind  held in the United States, began on April 11 in Los Angeles.  Representatives from 26 Chinese provinces, and municipalities  and eight ministries and commissions of the central government  have brought with them over 800 projects to the United States.    Briefing economic development, especially foreign trade and  business growth in China, the minister noted that for the past  15 years, China's foreign trade grew faster than its GDP. The  foreign trade volume last year stood at 195.8 billion U.S.  dollars, making China the 11th largest trading nation in the  world.    She added that foreign direct investment in China has  registered rapid development with the number of foreign invested  enterprises reaching 170,000 and the actual foreign investment  in China totaling 60 billion dollars.    On China's import volume last year, she said it amounted to  104 billion dollars. "Based on this, China's total import volume  for the next seven years will top 1,000 billion dollars," she  predicted.</p>

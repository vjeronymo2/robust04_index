			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Makpo talks to journalists after attempted hijack quashed Captain Tony Makpo speaks to reporters after special forces of the Niger government, assisted by French troops, yesterday stormed a hijacked Nigeria Airways plane at the Niger capital Niamey, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. Israeli security forces were at the scene on behalf of the Nigerian government. The troops captured the four hijackers, two of whom were negotiating with officials on the runway, and rescued all 20 hostages except the co-pilot, who was killed. The hijackers had threatened to blow up the aircraft unless Nigeria's interim government handed over power. The hijackers belong to the Movement for the Advancement of Democracy, which says it has 'decided to make life uncomfortable for the few Nigerians who terrorise the nation economically and politically'. The group calls the government 'authorised armed robbers' and quoted a US congressman as saying that 'roughly 3,000 officials now have Swiss bank accounts totalling Dollars 33bn' - more than Nigeria's foreign debt.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (7): City of Culture for 1993 - Antwerp IT IS a paradox of European culture that the stuffiest cities play host to the most radical artists: Vienna, Salzburg and Edinburgh, all famously bourgeois, woo the enfants terribles of the European avant-garde for festivals each year. Antwerp, which has just launched its programme as European City of Culture for 1993, slots naturally into this set. A deeply conservative, Roman Catholic, Flemish city, where the right-wing Vlaamse Blok scored well at last November's election, its long-standing role as a magnet for innovative artists makes it Belgium's obvious choice as cultural capital. Yet Antwerp joins Glasgow as the only two in the series of Europe's cultural capitals - Florence, Paris, Berlin, etc. - not known as an international arts centre. Glasgow in 1990 responded with a new, cleaned-up image and a programme including sports and popular events. Antwerp - on a budget of BF900m, less than a third of Glasgow's - has a much tighter, arts-orientated schedule which builds on the tradition of artistic excellence which already makes it a powerhouse of Flemish culture. Like Glasgow, it has more to prove and more to gain from its year in the arts limelight, than the other cities. Visit Antwerp, and the paradox of the radical and the traditional is everywhere. More than 300 Madonnas are sculpted into niches on the outside of the stepped, gabled houses of the 17th century merchants who made Antwerp rich. Now the lugubrious Virgins brood warily over the pazzazz of developments such as the old docks, about to become Antwerp's Covent Garden-style piazza and home to Eurosail '93, a mooring of tall ships from round the world. At the new Dock's Cafe, a former warehouse on the banks of the River Scheldt, city slickers queue nightly for cocktails. Seconds away, the remnant of the old port life, a street of red-lit windows where negro prostitutes advertise their wares, struggles for survival. As a young man, Simenon, Belgium's most famous writer, once gave his most precious possession, a silver watch, for 20 minutes with one of them. The growth of high-tech industry in Flanders, and especially the expansion of Antwerp's and Rotterdam's docks into western Europe's two leading ports - both slick, stream-lined post-modern affairs - has created a milieu spawning experimental, up-to-the-minute Flemish art. Ask any Belgian to name national artists of international standing, and the list will be Flemish: choreographers Wim Wanderkeybus or Anna Theresa de Keersmaeker and the 'Rosas' group with the kinetic dazzle and compressed energy of their violent new dance forms, both recent guests in England; directors Jan Fabre or Jan Lauwers with multi-tongued music-drama like 'Sweet Temptations' or 'Invictos', an Andalusian dance of death based on Hemingway which plays in Dutch, Spanish, English or German according to its audience. All these have criss-crossed Europe this year, but at home too, along with trendy visitors such as Vienna's Claus Peymann, Tadeusz Kantor's Polish troupe and the American musical 'Josephine' about the life of Josephine Baker, which began its European tour in Rotterdam and Antwerp, they were the biggest hits of this season. They illustrate a distinction between Flemish and Walloon cultural self-images: where Brussels, the outstanding Monnaie Opera excepted, languishes as a Francophone Cinderella too close to the rigorous chic of Paris to thrive as an independent artistic metropolis, Antwerp joins Rotterdam and Amsterdam in a snazzy nexus of confidant Flemish-Dutch cities which see themselves as a heartland of North European culture. It is the European connection that Eric Antonius, director of the festival Antwerp 93, is stressing in his strategy for the city's role as the first cultural capital in a Europe without frontiers. 'It is typical of Europeans', says Mr Antonius, 'that they are continually taking a close, critical look at themselves and at the world in which they are trying to survive. They ask questions, hesitate, often live at variance with themselves and dare to brush aside their achievements so as to start all over again'. His European theatre programme, 'The Questioner' (De Vragestellar) will reopen the Bourla Theatre, the monumental late-classical building on the Komedieplaats which has stood empty since it was declared a fire hazard in 1980. Oedipus, Hamlet, Orfeo, Don Juan, Faust and other self-pondering archetypes of European drama will tread its boards in 1993 along with those giants of modern angst, Peter Handke ('The Question Game'), Bernard-Marie Koltes, with a roll-call of down-and-out and mass-murderer heroes, and Thomas Bernhard, who distils existential agony into drama and even comedy like no one else. It's an exciting programme but there's an unmistakeable whiff of the Teutonic heavyweight about it; had Brussels hosted such a festival, French legerete would as distinctly have been the name of the game. But Antwerp 93 undoubtedly has a finger on the pulse of contemporary theatre. In the other performing arts, the programmes are also serious and innovative. The modish arts complex De Singel will collaborate with the Flemish Opera, for example, on the first Festival of Contemporary Opera, directed by Jan Fabre and including several Flemish composers or theatre-makers. 'I am an international artist but first I am a Flemish artist', says Jan Lauwers, who will direct Walter Hus's opera 'Orfeo'. Antwerp 93 will be a showcase for what there is in Flemish culture beyond Rubens, Brueghel, waffles and lace. Anyone who has not visited the city for some years will be surprised. The messy frontage of the turn-of-the-century Centraal Station, one of the great railway cathedrals of European station architecture, will be restored to its former lustre for 1993. The wall which has for years divided Antwerp Cathedral will go, making the Cathedral of Our Lady again the largest Gothic church in the Netherlands. And the old waterfront will be a jazzed-up catwalk of restaurants for style-spotters. In industrial Antwerp early this century, the saying used to go: 'Antwerp owes the Scheldt to God and the rest to the Scheldt'. The port is still the city's life-blood, but the old docks should attract a fleet of Euro-yachts and a crowd of Euro-visitors, and will be the nerve-centre of the new tourist Antwerp too.</p>

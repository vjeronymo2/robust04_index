			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Developers submit case for Scots 'superquarry' Redland Aggregates, part of the Redland construction group, yesterday opened its case at the public inquiry into its plan to establish a quarry at Lingerabay, on Harris in the Western Isles, and extract 600m tonnes of anorthosite in the next 60 to 100 years. The inquiry's first witness was Mr John Leivers, director of lands and planning for Redlands in the UK, who said four previous planning applications for development at Lingerabay had been granted. The project involves removing the eastern side of a hill named Roineabhal and shipping it away, creating an artificial sea loch. The quarry will cover an area of more than 1 square mile. Mr Leivers said there would initially be low-key development leading to increased production to satisfy anticipated demands. Answering concerns about the effect of the 'superquarry' on tourism, he said: 'Since coming to Harris in 1987 I have never met anyone walking off the hill at Roineabhal except sheep.' The Scottish National Party made a submission to the inquiry when it opened which urged exhaustive research into the effects of the plan and called for a referendum of the people of Harris to be held before the application was decided by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. The superquarry has the support of Western Isles council, but the Scottish secretary ordered the inquiry because of the environmental and economic issues. Objectors say it would harm the island's economy, creating noise, dust, vibration and traffic to the detriment of the tourist industry. The hearing is likely to last into next year.</p>

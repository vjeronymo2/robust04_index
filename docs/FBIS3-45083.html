			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- North Korean President  Kim Il-song is likely to visit Beijing soon to discuss with  Chinese leaders problems on the Korean peninsula following the  resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, sources said  Wednesday [12 January].    Kim wants to visit Beijing in the belief that the  circumstances surrounding the Korean peninsula will change  rapidly as a result of successful negotiations between his  country and the United States, said the sources, who are well  informed on North Korean affairs.    "North Korea is secretly sounding out the Chinese Government  on the possibility of Kim's visit through diplomatic channels,"  one source said. "Beijing is showing agreement in principle for  the North Korean leader's visit to China after the nuclear  question is resolved."    If the visit takes place, Kim and Chinese leaders will  discuss such problems as reform and open-door policy in North  Korea, improvements in North Korea's relations with Japan and  the United States, an inter-Korean summit and South-North  relations, he said.    In this connection, Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and one of  Kim's closest aides, will visit Beijing in late January at the  invitation of the Chinese Government to discuss the visit, the  source said.    "Hwang's Chinese visit has not been made public in detail as  yet, but judging by recent developments both in North Korea and  China, Hwang will discuss issues related to the Korean peninsula  as well as Kim's visit," he said.    In addition, Hwang will study China's reform and open  policy,  he said.    Chinese officials confirmed Hwang's planned visit in  meetings  with the South Korean National Assembly speaker when he visited  China on Jan. 6-11, the source said.    Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power  hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's  Assembly along with Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu.    Hwang was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee  and named to head a so-called task force for relations with  China and the United States. As such, he is understood to be  managing issues related to improving ties with the United States.</p>

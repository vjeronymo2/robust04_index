			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Gardening: The plot thickens - The new issue of a bible for vegetables THE book Vegetable Garden Display has been in print for 50 years, having been first published in 1941 as a part of the Dig for Victory campaign during World War Two. It was then written by staff of the Royal Horticultural Society, all experts in vegetable growing, control of pests and diseases, management of soil, manures and fertilisers and other matters. It was an enormous success - as befitted its excellence - and sold more than 150,000 copies in its first year. It has been reprinted many times and been through a number of revisions, the biggest change coming in 1981 when it was completely re-written by Joy Larkcom, a leading specialist in all matters relating to the cultivation of vegetables in the home garden and allotment. It was, perhaps, a tacit acknowledgment that, authoritative though the RHS staff were and still are, their general training tended to be towards fairly large gardens and that Larkcom better represented the needs of the majority of modern home gardeners. The result was excellent, and the Vegetable Garden Display strengthened its position as the favourite book on this subject. It has not at any time been especially concerned with the cultivation of vegetables for exhibition, and that characteristic has been strengthened by Larkcom's association, for her insistence on quality for home consumption is well known. Now it is time for a jubilee edition. Not only is Larkcom back as its author but now her name is fully displayed on a handsome four-colour cover. It is published by the Royal Horticultural Society and is distributed, price Pounds 10.95, by Batsford. For the first time it is illustrated in colour throughout and I consider it excellent value for money. The book has 160 pages, 12 more than last time, and the contents fall into two nearly equal sections. An initial 58 pages deal with tools, soils and the improvement or maintenance of fertility by means of cultivation, the use of composts, manures and fertilisers, methods of arranging crops, planning for continuity of cropping, sowing techniques, planting in containers, watering, weed control, protected cropping, storage for winter and dealing with pests and diseases including a section on organic remedies. The rest mostly consists of a straightforward description of vegetables in alphabetical order with exhaustive descriptions of the way in which each is grown. There is an easy to follow month-by-month reminder of work in the vegetable garden, a list of books for further reading, plus the names and addresses of useful organisations and a comprehensive index. I find the whole book so admirable that I hesitate to pick out any items for special mention but, because it is still fairly novel, I think many buyers will read the section on the bed system of cultivation with special interest. This takes the place of the conventional vegetable garden and consists of a fairly wide bed with long rows running across it, often as much as 30 ft long and spaced a foot or more apart. In these the vegetables are spaced out. One can walk along these roads to sow, plant, thin, hoe and eventually harvest the plants. Using Joy Larkcom's words, in this system the vegetable garden is divided into a number of narrow beds, generally separated by permanent paths. Most plants are grown at equidistant spacing across the bed rather than in widely spaced rows. Since all the work is done from the paths there is little need to tread on the soil, which damages soil structure. Only those areas where vegetables will be grown need be dug and the beds tend to become more rather than less fertile due to concentration of food and preservation of soil structure. Roots penetrate more deeply, so plants can withstand drought better. There are several variations to the raised bed system including beds that are permanently raised above ground level by as much as 12 in, which results in better drainage and faster soil warming. The tops of these beds are sometimes rounded to give an increased surface area. Larkcom describes beds in the Golden Acre Park at Leeds which are edged with one railway sleeper on one side and two on the other, so the beds can be converted into frames.</p>

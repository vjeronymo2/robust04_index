			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Finnish singers For a country of its size, Finland has produced more than its share of notable singers, from Aino Ackte to Jorma Hynninen. Representatives of the youngest generation include the soprano Karita Mattila and mezzo Monica Groop. In what became a Finnish mini-festival at the Wigmore Hall, both gave recitals there in the last few days. Since Mattila burst onto the international scene a decade ago, her voice has filled out. Her tone is now full and creamy, something on which she seems to rely too much: there was a sameness about her opening works, a group of Schubert's Italian Songs and a selection from Mahler's Lieder und Gesange aus der Jugendzeit. The rest of the programme revealed Mattila's powers better. In two Runeberg settings of Sibelius, 'Arioso' and 'The Maiden's Tryst', she soared through the desolate, wide-ranging lines impressively. Strauss's extraordinary Drei Lieder der Ophelia were evocative. Best of all were Mattila's five Rakhmaninov songs. With sensitive accompaniments from the Finnish pianist Ilmo Ranta, she caught the distinctive mood of each, from the mystery of Pushkin's 'Oh, never sing to me again' to the impassioned 'What wealth of rapture'. Mattila has a fluent, idiomatic way with languages, and sang the Rakhmaninov with a Russian glint. Monica Groop - who last month was a touching Varvara in Covent Garden's new Katya Kabanova - made an exciting Wigmore Hall debut on Thursday. She is a more 'complete' artist than Mattila, more responsive to texts, and better able to communicate them to her audience. Her deep, natural musicality ensures beautiful phrasing. Groop has devoted time to oratorio work out of the limelight, but her even, glowing tone makes hers one of the most exciting young voices around today. Groop revealed reserves of radiance in her Brahms and Strauss Lieder, but was perhaps strongest of all in the Sibelius songs (which she has just recorded for BIS), performed with an icy passion. We heard several of the composer's Swedish settings, but the handful of Finnish songs - whose lines rise and fall gently with the poetry - were most beguiling of all; she also sang Sibelius's only English song, the noble Hymn to Thas. Accompanied by Gustav Djupsjobacka, Groop brought the country girl of Grieg's great Haugtussa cycle to vivid life: though she is versatile, this music is ideally suited to Groop's temperament and musical insight. Groop's recital was sponsored by the Union Bank of Finland.</p>

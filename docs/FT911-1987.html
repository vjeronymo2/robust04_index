			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY exchanges to go under one roof NEW YORK'S five commodities exchanges are to move under one roof in Manhattan in mid-1994, ending years of indecision which has hampered expansion plans. Late on Tuesday night the board of the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), the world's largest energy futures market, agreed to sign a joint relocation agreement with the four other exchanges involved. The signing was expected to take place late yesterday or today. Nymex, the third largest US futures market after the two Chicago exchanges, had also been considering moving across the Hudson River to New Jersey. Speculation on why Nymex left its decision so late pointed to poor relations between Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex chairman, and Mr Martin Greenberg, chairman of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), which is mainly a metals market. Long-running merger talks between the two exchanges failed once again earlier this year. The futures commissions merchants who operate on the exchanges are keen to cut costs through the use of a single location. Yesterday Mr Guttman said: 'We will work with the other exchanges to achieve a consolidation of operations and other cost savings in advance of a move to the new location.' The new building will be a couple of blocks north of Nymex's current position in the World Trade Center. Besides Nymex and Comex, the building will house the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange. New York City will provide Dollars 145m towards the Dollars 260m project.</p>

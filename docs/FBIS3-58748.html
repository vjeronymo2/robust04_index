			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Finlay Marshall, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] South Africa was tonight invited to rejoin the  Commonwealth after a 33-year absence. The offer came from the  Secretary General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Chief Emeka  Anyaoku, when he spoke at London's South Africa Club.    He said: "The Commonwealth's 50 member countries drawn from  all the continents and regions of the world will provide the new  South Africa with a ready gateway to the wider world."    Chief Anyaoku said that central to the resolution of South  Africa's accumulated problems will be its ability to reintegrate  fully into the world community of nations. He invited South  Africa to heal the "family rift" now that it was becoming a  non-racial democracy.    South Africa will hold its first democratic elections on  April 27 with all races able to vote after its Parliament  approved an interim constitution leading to black majority rule.    Chief Anyaoku said: "By normalising its relations with the  Commonwealth, South Africa will at a stroke be consolidating its  relations with 50 other countries with influence and a network  of relations in their respective regions."    He added: "A post apartheid South Africa, reconciled and at  peace with itself and its neighbours, will, as far as the  Commonwealth is concerned, be sufficient reward in itself. It  will be a triumph for the most cherished of all Commonwealth  principles, namely, the equality of all human beings  irrespective of colour, religious belief, culture or any other  adventitious criteria," he said.</p>

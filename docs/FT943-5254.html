			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hambros to launch Asian trust Hambros Bank is to launch an investment trust specialising in Asian companies with a market capitalisation of less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m). The Hambros Smaller Asian Companies Trust is based on the manager's belief that smaller Asian companies are under-researched, and should benefit disproportionately from fast economic growth in the region. It will be managed by Hong Kong-based Hambro Pacific Fund Management, which already runs the Hambros EQUUS South East Asia fund, covering a similar geographic area, and ranked 13th of 32 offshore funds in the same sector over three years. The new trust's initial portfolio will be concentrated in the markets of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, but the managers will also be free to invest throughout the rest of Asia, from South Korea to India. The fund will be dollar denominated, but London-listed, and will have an initial life of about seven years. Shares will be issued at Dollars 1, and warrants will be attached on a one-for-five basis. Capital will be raised by means of an institutional placing by NatWest Securities, with a minimum subscription of Dollars 30,000. A similar trust, Edinburgh New Tiger, was launched in March this year to invest in Asian smaller companies, but its shares are still trading at below the issue price after the corrections in world stock markets earlier this year.</p>

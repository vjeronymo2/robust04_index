			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Jiapei [3527 1367 1014], State Information </F> Center (SIC) Vice-Director (and participant in aforementioned  KEJI RIBAO Symposium): ``Some Reflections on the Global  Information Infrastructure Tide'']    [Summary] China has had enough of the bitter taste of a  backward information infrastructure. If the nation does not now  work out such an infrastructure, then by the next century--even  though the old ``bottleneck'' restrictions may be resolved--a  new ``bottleneck'' will appear: the added difficulty of  [jointly] raising industrial competitiveness and the State's  comprehensive national power. China's present level in  information technology is 30-40 years behind that of the U.S.  To raise industrial competitiveness and the State's overall  national power, China must firmly take up the task of building  an information infrastructure suited to domestic conditions,  incorporating innovative technologies and management practices,  documented by relevant laws and standards, and based on research  and surveys into the economic and social benefits of this global  tide. So far, China's information infrastructure building has  been government-driven, unlike the market-driven form seen in  the U.S. This situation needs to be changed: non-government  investment must be encouraged, industrial activity and the  entrepreneurial spirit must be part of the overall campaign;  industry leaders must no longer rely on the government alone  before taking action. In the area of resource allocation, the  government has invested over 20 billion yuan, which went for  construction of a dozen-odd major information systems, and is  investing an additional 50 billion yuan for construction of  information systems at as many as 10,000 firms.</p>

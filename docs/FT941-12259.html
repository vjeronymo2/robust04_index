			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: An image of Japanese caution - The Emerging Investor Ask Mr Yoki Satani about Japanese investment attitudes toward emerging markets and the account executive for the foreign stocks division of Nomura Securities will lose his native reserve and state pointedly that the general image among his domestic clients is one of caution. However, months of compelling statistical data and favourable articles, pleading and persistence finally persuaded at least one of his Japanese client's to invest a small percentage of funds into Hong Kong late last year. This reluctant move ultimately earned the client dividends, and saved face for Mr Satani. The descent of Japanese equity prices, now languishing in their fourth year of weakness, and bad economic conditions, have made domestic investors extremely cautious about putting money into equities, either at home or abroad. Recently, however, some life insurance companies, trust accounts at trust banks and investment trust management companies have started to look to south and east Asia for better returns on their investments. Brokers speculate that this trend will continue, eventually including key markets in eastern Europe and Latin America. For instance, some domestic investment trusts have begun to offer funds specialising in stocks from other Pacific Rim countries to accommodate a slowly growing interest in emerging markets. One such is Nomura Securities Investment Trust Management, which established the Asian Open Fund last October, and saw its value double in three months to Dollars 2bn. Mr Giles Scott, director of sales at Barings Securities Japan, expects a further disinvestment of monies into Pacific Rim funds from retail investors staring in April, the start of the new fiscal year. 'Cash rich people are looking for other investment opportunities and are finding the rest of Asia more attractive than Japanese markets,' he says. Nevertheless, the level of investment remains low - less than 1 per cent of the funds that Japanese securities houses have available to allocate - according to the Investment Trust Association. In general, Japanese investors have been slow to see the potential of other Asian equity markets and the growth in emerging markets worldwide. This stems partly from ignorance - most institutions have had limited historical exposure to overseas equity markets, while traditionally they have looked to western Europe and the US for fixed income instruments and equity markets with deep liquidity. Another reason is a fear of the unknown, preventing them from taking immediate action, even when the performances of emerging markets has proved otherwise. But the primary explanation for caution has been the country's economic doldrums, and the severe equity losses suffered by institutions in recent years. Direct overseas investment during fiscal 1992 dropped by 17.9 per cent to Dollars 34.1bn, representing half the amount invested during fiscal 1989, the peak year. According to the ministry of finance, in the first half of fiscal 1993 it declined another 9.6 per cent, compared with a year ago. Mr Toshihide Sakamoto, a director of the sales division at Salomon Brothers Asia, believes domestic institutional investors will limit foreign investment until the Nikkei starts to show significant signs of improvement. 'If you have Y1bn and you are losing Y900m, you cannot take the risk,' (by investing in overseas markets) he says. One effect of declining stock prices, together with falling domestic interest rates, is that institutional investors, pursuing a higher yield, have sold some of their foreign stock holdings: Dollars 3bn in 1992, the first net sale in 12 years, compared with a net purchase of Dollars 3.6bn in 1991. But given the impressive performance of emerging markets in 1993, will Japanese investors become more active in the future? Assuming the Tokyo stock market improves, Mr Sakamoto expects investment 'to grow dramatically over the next three years'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Friday      Week on week change Stock                Country   dollar close    dollars       %  ------------------------------------------------------------------- HM Sampoerna         Indonesia    8.2579       2.5372    44.35 Korean Air           S.

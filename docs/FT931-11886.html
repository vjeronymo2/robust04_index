			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Closure threatens thousands of jobs - Gillian Tett assesses the mood among businesses in two communities waiting for the long-feared bombshell IF Rosyth or Devonport closes, the thousands of dockworkers will not be the only people to lose their jobs. Almost 30,000 jobs in the Devon and Cornwall area depend directly or indirectly on the Devonport complex, with up to 600 local companies drawing business from the yard, says Mr Paul Bishop, a lecturer at Plymouth University. The picture is similar at at Rosyth, where a recent study by Fife Regional Council claims that at least 800 businesses in Scotland have dealings with the yard. Few doubt that the closure of either yard would trigger knock-on job losses across each region's economy. Mr Malcolm Haggart, managing director of a Plymouth marine engineering company, said: 'If Devonport loses, it would be like dropping an atomic bomb on the shopping centre. It would devastate Plymouth.' Uncertainty about the yards' future has prompted many local suppliers to diversify in recent years. Although the larger defence suppliers have been hit by wider defence cuts, most insist that their businesses will not be affected by the eventual location of the sole refitting yard. Most of Devonport's specialist defence suppliers, for example, are already located far outside the region. Nevertheless, the businesses now at risk are the hordes of tiny enterprises scattered around Rosyth and Plymouth which have grown around the rich pickings of the yard. In Plymouth alone, for example, the Devonport complex is estimated to generate some Pounds 521m of income for the region. And Mr James Brodie, chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, said: 'It could have a devastating effect on the retail sector.' Mr Bill Taylor, director of economic planning at Fife Regional Council, said: 'The issue is not just about the direct suppliers but a chain of suppliers.' ROSYTH Clark Retail Newsagent 8 employees Turnover Pounds 400,000Hundreds of local shops depend on the dockyard for custom. 'If Rosyth goes it would put paid to a lot of our jobs,' says Mrs Marilyn Sallnow, temporary manager of the Rosyth branch of Clark Retail, a newsagent chain. It estimates that around 40 per cent of its business would be lost. 'Rosyth would be like a ghost town,' adds Mrs Sallnow, whose husband, father and brother-in-law all work at the yard. Norman Davidson Self-employed taxi driver Rosyth's isolated location, several miles from the nearest big town, has provided jobs for hundreds of taxi drivers.  'If the yard goes, it would kill the taxi trade,' says Mr Norman Davidson, who believes that '20 per cent of taxi drivers would go to the wall'. Systems Reliability, Fife 44 employees Turnover Pounds 4m If Rosyth closes, local observers fear that it could lead to a drainage of high-tech skills from the area. Small businesses such as Systems Reliability, a local computer hardware and installation company, have grown up around the yard and its suppliers. 'Our success is in local hands,' says Mr Robert Rob, sales director. Arco East Scotland, Linlithgow 85 employees Turnover Pounds 10m Arco East Scotland supplies protective clothing and safety equipment for the yard workers - in the last three months it sold more than Pounds 60,000 worth of jackets alone to the dockyard.  'If Rosyth goes we would have to set about laying people off, no question,' says Mr Ron Dow, divisional director. Although Arco also supplies a wide range of other industrial outlets, many of these are also linked to the yard. 'We supply so many of the subcontractors - electrical shops, ship blasters, even bus companies.' Wilkie Hook, Bowness 400-500 employees Turnover Pounds 1m The family business employs 150 men on contract ship-blasting at Rosyth. If the ship and submarine refitting business disappears, it will have to lay off almost all these workers. 'Many of those men won't be prepared to travel to other parts of Scotland for work,' says Mr Archie Wilkie, director. G and D Scaffolding Services, Dunfermline 20 employees Turnover Pounds 750,000 Although most suppliers have tried to diversify, many remain vulnerable because of their small size. The privately owned G and D Scaffolding draws 25 per cent of its business from the yard.  'That means that we are not totally dependent,' says Mr Gordon Hendry, G and D's owner. 'But you only need to have a few other clients going down and the ratio changes.' MacTaggart Scott, Edinburgh 350 employees Turnover Pounds 12m Although a number of specialised defence companies are located in Scotland, many say their business could follow the refitting programme to Plymouth if necessary. MacTaggart Scott, which produces hydraulic equipment for ships and submarines, supplies both Rosyth and Devonport. 'I think both should be kept open,' says Mr Patrick Prenter, managing director. Although only Pounds 500,00 of its business is directly linked to Rosyth, he admits that the closure would mean 'the loss of jobs, albeit a limited number'. Scottish Power, Glasgow Turnover Pounds 635m Fife Regional Council, Rosyth provides Pounds 24m of business for the energy sector each year, supporting an estimated 310 jobs in electricity and gas. Scottish Power, which supplies Rosyth, denies that losing the yard would affect its overall financial performance. GEC-Marconi simulation plant 400 employees in Fife Turnover Pounds 50m (7,000 to 8,000 employees throughout Scotland Turnover Pounds 400m) GEC-Marconi, which has indicated it would be interested in bidding for Rosyth or Devonport, produces specialised defence supplies for both yards from factories across Britain. Its plant in Fife has provided simulation equipment for Trident submarines.  Like other specialised defence suppliers it insists the decision will not affect jobs. DEVONPORT Ron Dewdney Cornish pasty business 32 employees Turnover Pounds 700,000 Many local caterers and food shops depend on Devonport for their business. The catering company Ron Dewdney, for example, sells about 2,000 Cornish pasties daily - a quarter of its production - directly to ships and yard workers, with several thousand more sold to the yard's suppliers. If the yard closed Mr Alan Meatyard, manager, would make at least five employees redundant. 'It's the knock-on effect that's the real problem,' he says. 'A lot of the people I supply with pasties supply the yard.' Osmond Guest House Turnover Pounds 24,000 More than 150 family-run guest houses depend on the yard for their livelihood. Mr Mike Richards, owner of the guest house, explains: 'During the week we get contract workers from firms like Marconi staying here. At the weekend we get sailors.' Avondale Arms Pub 5 employees Pubs fear the loss of spending power resulting from Devonport closing would hit them particularly hard. Mr Arthur Squire, who has run the Avondale Arms next to the yard for the past 43 years, says: 'My trade is the yard. If that goes, I go.' Owens Uniforms 30 employees Turnover Pounds 500,000 Mr Clive Owens, managing director, has been making uniforms for the Royal Navy for 50 years. Eighty per cent of his orders come from the Ministry of Defence, with 100 uniforms going directly to Devonport each year. Although Mr Owens believes that the jobs at his company will be safe even if Devonport loses the bid, the impact of such an outcome would be 'devastating' for the area. 'It's the uncertainty that is the worst,' he says. Fox and Haggart Marine engineers 18 employees Turnover Pounds 250,000 A huge network of tiny businesses, often family-run, has grown up to supply Devonport. Fox and Haggart has depended on the yard over three generations. Mr Malcolm Haggart hopes to hand the business on to his young sons. But if Devonport loses the contract he will have to 'seriously consider' closing down. 'Some of the people working here have been here for 40 years,' he says. 'It's all they know. How can you expect them to retrain or get another job?' Bee-Clear Industrial ship cleaners 94 employees If the yard were to close it would not just be the yard's suppliers that would be hit, but the suppliers' suppliers too, says Mr Keith Rickard, managing director of Bee-Clear. The company itself would cut 60 jobs. South West Crane Hire, Exeter 44 employees Turnover Pounds 2m The Devonport yard provides business for construction companies across the south-west. But if Devonport loses the bid South West Crane Hire would shed a third of its workforce. 'I've got no alternative,' says Mr Michael Jeffery, managing director. South West Water, Exeter Water suppliers About 2,000 employees Turnover Pounds 96.7m Devonport's contract with South West Water represents one of its most significant local contracts in financial terms, according to Mr Paul Bishop of Plymouth University. South West Water denies that losing Devonport would lead to redundancies. Yet Mr Bill Frazer, South West Water's managing director, has added his voice to the political lobbying. In a recent letter to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, he declared that 'DML is one of our largest customers, and makes an important contribution to the costs of our huge Pounds 4m per week investment in improving treatment works, water mains and sew-ers'. British Aerospace 1,000 employees British Aerospace, a supplier to Devonport, relocated to Plymouth to be near the naval docks. Like most specialist defence suppliers the company insists that if the naval work moved its business would follow it. 'But it would make the task of distribution to our customers much more difficult and expensive,' says Mr Chris Tear, head of public affairs.</p>

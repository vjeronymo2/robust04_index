The YESHA' Council yesterday decided to draw up a list of  volunteers who will be available at short notice to physically  resist the evacuation of settlements. The move followed  comments by Foreign Minister Peres questioning the viability of  the Gaza Strip settlement of Netzarim. [passage omitted]</p>

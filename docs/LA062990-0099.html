			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VANDALS DEFACE BARELY DRY MURAL OF ESCONDIDO'S PAST  </P> <P> Vandals defaced a just-completed Escondido mural Wednesday night, marring  one-quarter of the painting in what backers are calling a racially motivated  incident.  </P> <P> Two 5-gallon containers of white primer paint were splashed onto the mural,  which depicts the history of Escondido and had been opposed by some residents  for what they felt was a Latino overtone that would attract gang activity.  </P> <P> "It's clear that whoever did it intentionally directed the paint toward the  Native American people depicted in the mural," said Nicole Brown of the  Felicita Foundation, the sponsoring organization behind the painting.  </P> <P> The mural, completed Wednesday by local high school students and noted San  Diego muralists Salvador and Gloria Torres, had been in the works since April.  It cost $8,400 and took more than 1,300 hours of volunteer work to construct.  </P> <P> The mural decorates three walls of the North Inland Neighborhood Recovery  Center, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center on Ash Street.  </P> <P> Despite the incident, the dedication of the mural went on as planned Thursday  night, Brown said.  </P> <P> "I see it as a racially motivated act, by people who view the mural as a  statement that's purely Hispanic-oriented, which the mural is not," said  Barbara Waters, director of the Felicita Foundation. "It's community oriented  and shows cultural diversity."  </P> <P> The mural depicts aspects of the history of Escondido and includes  representations of American Indians, African-Americans, Asian-Americans,  Latinos and Anglos.  </P> <P> The mural also shows landscapes, scenes from the Wild Animal Park, and  technological advances as well as two hands, one light-skinned and one  dark-skinned, clasped together.  </P> <P> "The neighbors didn't like it being there," said Aaron Bouchard, a junior in  high school who worked on the project from its inception. "They figured that it  would bring a bad element to the neighborhood just because it had basically a  Hispanic base."  </P> <P> Salvador Torres, who was one of the original painters of the well-known  muralists in San Diego's Chicano Park and who has been active in community  mural painting for more than two decades, said the newness of public art to  Escondido led to misunderstandings by some residents and brought expected  criticism of the mural.  </P> <P> "All of this is part of Escondido's development, and of course the native  population is one of the most important of all, and that's why in the center of  the ethnic group figure is the Native American," Torres said.  </P> <P> Brown said it will take at least 50 hours and $1,000 to restore the mural.  </P></p>

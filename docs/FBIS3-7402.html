The inspection, in line with a government-wide move to stamp  out irregularities related to state-funded construction  projects, will focus on how Yulgok projects were awarded to  civilian contractors, whether they are proceeding as scheduled  and if there are any irregularities, ministry officials said  Monday.    Most of these projects were launched as long-term  undertakings under a tight security lid and thus have not been  inspected over the years.    The first-time inspection will be extensive in covering many  Yulgok construction projects and put particular stress on  checking whether project officials have taken bribes, an  official said.</p>

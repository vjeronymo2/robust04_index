			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY VOWS NO RELOCATION FOR OWNERS OF HOMES IN WATTS;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: MAYOR RESPONDS TO PROTEST OF STUDY CALLING FOR THE ELIMINATION  OF URBAN BLIGHT. SOME RESIDENTS SAY HIS POSITION ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH.  </P> <P> Reacting to a storm of community protests, Mayor Tom Bradley pledged Wednesday  to oppose any redevelopment plan in Watts that would displace homeowners.  </P> <P> "The bottom line," Bradley said, "is if you live in Watts in a single-family  residence, you don't need to fear losing your home. It won't happen. That is my  commitment to you."  </P> <P> The mayor's promise -- grounded in his veto authority over City Council actions  -- appears to run counter to the language of the city-sponsored feasibility  study, which lays the foundation for the Watts project. The study calls for the  elimination of urban blight through "selective demolition . . . and  relocation".  </P> <P> Officials of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which is in charge of  the project, said they did not know how a broad prohibition against eminent  domain would affect the project, which is designed to bring new industrial,  commercial and cultural facilities to the impoverished community.  </P> <P> "Where and how those things will be built, where the new commercial and  industrial areas will be . . . that will all have to be decided and decided by  the residents themselves," said Robert Tague, the CRA's chief of operations.  </P> <P> Bradley also announced at a press conference that he had postponed the first  phase of the Watts project -- the period when the planning is done -- for at  least six months. The mayor's action could delay groundbreaking for the project  for two years or more, according to CRA officials.  </P> <P> The postponement came in response to angry criticism that the city was trying  to ram through the project before the people of Watts had any idea of what was  in store for them. Bradley said he agreed with the complaints of many residents  that they had not been given enough time to learn about the impact of what  would be the largest redevelopment project ever undertaken by the city.  </P> <P> Several Watts residents attending the press conference praised the mayor for  postponing the project, but said his position on eminent domain was not strong  enough.  </P> <P> "We should have a law passed by the City Council barring eminent domain," said  Andreattee Jones, a resident and education coordinator at a neighborhood youth  center. "No one should have to worry about getting kicked out of their house."  </P> <P> Eminent domain refers to a longstanding government prerogative to condemn  private property when it serves the public good. It has been invoked to build  everything from freeways to schools. It would be a more ticklish issue in the  Watts project, however, if houses were to be condemned for commercial  development.  </P> <P> Jones and others said Bradley's promise to protect homeowners offered slim  consolation to the thousands of renters who live in one of the densest  concentrations of public housing projects in the city.  </P> <P> Bradley said the fate of the tenants should be decided during the planning  phase. "The community is going to give the answer on that matter," he said.  </P> <P> Appearing with Bradley, the two City Council members who represent Watts sought  to offer tenants more reassurance.  </P> <P> "It would not be in my plans to diminish the total amount of affordable  housing," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores.  </P> <P> "No residentially zoned properties, period," said Councilman Robert Farrell,  when asked where he stood on the question of tearing down rental buildings.  </P> <P> The official assurances were not enough to deter a group of Watts residents  from pressing a lawsuit against the city and the CRA. After filing the suit  Monday, the plaintiffs returned to court Wednesday, seeking to enjoin the city  from using eminent domain in Watts. If successful, the suit also would diminish  the city's authority over the Watts Project Area Committee -- a citizens' group  that will be formed to oversee project planning.  </P> <P> Critics have argued that the City Council violated state redevelopment law by  giving itself the power to appoint 11 of the 25 committee members. Control of  the committee is emerging as an important issue in the redevelopment dispute,  with critics fearful that the City Council would overload the committee with  developers and businessmen.  </P> <P> The Watts project is significant not only for its size -- about 2,000 acres of  South-Central Los Angeles -- but for what it represents. It is the first  comprehensive approach to rebuilding Watts since the rioting 25 years ago.  Despite periodic attempts to upgrade the community, Watts has remained one of  the poorest, most run-down and dangerous parts of the city.  </P> <P> City officials had counted on an enthusiastic reception after spending the last  18 months developing a broad outline for the project. In addition to financing  new buildings, the proposed revitalization would pour $200 million in public  and private capital into neighborhood social services such as job training,  drug counseling and day care.  </P> <P> But residents argued that they had been kept in the dark until just before the  City Council gave preliminary approval in June. Moreover, at community meetings  last month, officials did little to allay people's fears of losing their homes.  Many people said they were suspicious of the city's sudden interest in Watts  after years of comparative inattention.  </P> <P> "Why the sudden interest now? Where were you 25 years ago?" asked one resident  at the press conference. "Is it because of the Metro Rail or the Century  Freeway that you are interested in remaking our community."  </P> <P> Even without a redevelopment project, Watts' years as an urban backwater may be  over, the result of a network of new rail and freeway routes that crisscross  the community on the way to downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and the city's  main airport and harbor.  </P> <P> Some residents suspect that city officials would like to turn Watts into a  bedroom annex for downtown office workers. Others worry that they will be  squeezed out by a commercial and industrial renaissance that will offer few  jobs that local people are capable of filling.  </P></p>

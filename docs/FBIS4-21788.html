			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, March 30 (AFP) -- The authorities are holding  23 Jordanian Islamic militants suspected of trying to kill  Jordanian and Palestinian leaders involved in peace talks with  Israel, a legal official said here Wednesday.    The 23, all veterans of the Afghanistan war, were believed  to  have plotted to kill Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali and Palestinian peace negotiators Faysal al-Husayni  and Hanan 'Ashrawi last year, according to charges being drawn  up against them.    The militants, already detained for more than one month,  were  also suspected of involvement in a series of bomb blasts in  Jordan in January and February.    The official said the militants plotted to kill al-Majali  during an interview, with one of the group posing as a  journalist. However, the interview was postponed.    Al-Majali was leading Jordan's delegation to the bilateral  peace talks with Israel at the time. The Arab-Israeli talks  were suspended after the February 25 Hebron massacre.    The militants also planned to kill al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi  when the Palestinian leaders made one of their regular trips to  Amman, the official said.    Bombs were to be planted in their hotel rooms with the  connivance of a hotel employee, but the plot failed due to the  secrecy surrounding the Palestinian leaders' movements.    The official said the militants were expected to stand trial  at the end of April.    The group's aim was to ``torpedo the peace process and get  alcoholic drinks, bars and cinemas outlawed,'' the official  explained.    On 6 February the authorities said they had arrested two  Islamic militants implicated in the bombings of two cinemas in  Jordan on 26 January and 1 February which injured a total of  nine people. The two had reportedly fought in Afghanistan.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said a group of militants  had been rounded up for planning attacks against the Jordanian  parliament and leading political figures.    Nearly 400 Jordanians and Palestinians have returned to  Jordan over the past year after undergoing military training  with the Afghan Mujahedin.</p>

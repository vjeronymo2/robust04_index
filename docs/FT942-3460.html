			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Caracas closes 8 finance houses The Venezuelan government yesterday surprised bank depositors by closing eight troubled financial institutions which it had been keeping afloat since early this year. Long lines of sometimes angry depositors formed outside the closed institutions, which have a combined total of 2m depositors. Some accused the government of defrauding them of their funds. The move was the latest by the administration of President Rafael Caldera to ease a financial system crisis which began in January when Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest bank, failed and was taken over by the government. Following the collapse of Banco Latino, other insitutions were struck by runs on their deposits and had to rely heavily on financial aid from the central bank and the government's bank deposit guarantee fund (Fogade). The institutions taken over by the government and closed include seven banks (Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas, Construccion, La Guaira, Maracaibo and Metropolitano) and a company which financed commercial and industrial projects, SF Fiveca. Even though the government had been the de facto owner of these institutions for some time - it had demanded shares and other assets in return for financial assistance and had appointed its own administrators - the authorities felt that the financial aid had reached an unacceptably high level and that the banks could not be properly restructured without intervention. The eight banks had lost a large share of their deposits and had financial losses amounting to several times their capital. They received the equivalent of almost Dollars 3bn in government assistance. Questions have been raised publicly as to whether some of this money was used improperly by the banks while still controlled by their former owners. The government had been expected formally to take over the institutions but the decision to shut the banks was not expected. It emphasises the depth of a banking crisis which has done much to undermine confidence in the Venezuelan economy this year. In announcing the decision, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said that each depositor would be eligible to receive up to 4m bolivars (Dollars 24,000 or Pounds 15,900). In the case of Banco Latino, the government recapitalised and reopened the institution, paying depositors up to 10m bolivars. However, the authorities saw no end to the financial aid required by the other eight institutions and decided to close them down.</p>

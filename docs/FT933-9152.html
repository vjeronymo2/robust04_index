			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: European leaders shamed by failure to help defend Bosnian Moslems Sir, I would like to congratulate Edward Mortimer on his article on Bosnia, 'Wrong order of priority' (August 4). Every time that the topic of Bosnia is raised I feel a deep sense of personal shame and humiliation as a result of continuous violations of the most basic tenets of civilisation going unchecked and unpunished - shame as a citizen of the UK and Europe, humiliation through anger and impotence. The failure of western Europe to respond to flagrant racially motivated aggression in its immediate area of influence, when the west possessed overwhelming military power to resist or punish it, will be condemned by history. Europe, with the UK to the fore, appears to have contrived the military disadvantage and ultimate defeat of the Bosnian Moslems through an arms embargo, knowing that the Serbs had obtained the major part of the old Yugoslavia's weaponry and also possessed an efficient arms industry of their own. The situation has been made disastrously worse by tantalisingly assuring the Moslems of a fair settlement that would not reward aggression. Had we told them the truth - that we would not allow them the weapons necessary to defend themselves and would not defend them either - they would have had to face reality and negotiate a settlement before the privations and huge loss of innocent lives that have taken place. We can surely only forgive Moslems throughout the world if they subscribe to a conspiracy theory. If it were not for the collective vacillating incompetence displayed by our leadership, to say nothing of lack of moral courage, I could easily subscribe to such a theory myself. I hope it is not true. We are living through a dark period of European history, and the exchange rate mechanism is indeed of little relative consequence. We should all remember that civilisation is precious and one of the few things worth fighting for. It is only skin deep, the skin has been broken and we are haemorrhaging.

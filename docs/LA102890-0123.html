			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS;  </P> <P> DESIGN-O-MAT  </P> <P> COMES A TIME in a person's life when the urge to publish strikes. That impulse  can find expression, given the presence of a personal computer and software  that makes creating a newsletter or party invitation as simple as  point-and-click.  </P> <P> But lacking such pricey tools, one must resort to glue sticks and Magic Markers  -- or a visit to Imageland.  </P> <P> UCLA professor of design Mits Kataoka founded Imageland with the desire to  bring the latest technologies in full-color imaging and graphic design to the  layman and to allow his clients full creative control over their projects,  which range from the creation of posters, business cards and brochures to  T-shirt art. The typical customer has no previous experience with such  technology, and some have no experience in the visual arts (one exception was  artist David Hockney, who paid a visit in order to experiment). Imageland  charges $45 per half-hour for the use of its equipment and the assistance of a  trained operator; printing and copying fees are added on.  </P> <P> Just visiting Imageland can prove inspirational. "Consumers get ideas from what  they see," Kataoka says, "and professionals get ideas from things consumers  have done."  </P> <P>  Imageland, 911 Westwood Blvd., Westwood; (213) 208-7877.  </P> <P> MICHAEL DIEHL  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / RJB forecasts profits of Pounds 220m if it buys English coal regions RJB Mining, the coal company, is telling potential investors it can make annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m by the turn of the century from the English regions of British Coal which it is negotiating to buy from the government. In one of the boldest and most controversial fund-raising exercises in recent times on the London Stock Exchange, RJB aims to raise Pounds 425m in a share issue and Pounds 628m as debt. In private City presentations, RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, indicate that they believe the debt can be cleared by 1998 when existing electricity contracts end. RJB, which put in an offer of Pounds 914m to win the government's backing as preferred bidder for the regions, forecasts annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn in 1999. Profits before then will be Pounds 116m in 1995, Pounds 188m in 1996, Pounds 211m in 1997 and Pounds 186m in 1998. The amount of money RJB, capitalised at Pounds 157m, needs to raise means that investors will study its projections closely. Many executives in the electricity and coal industries believe the company, which bid up to 50 per cent more than its nearest rival, is taking a highly optimistic view of markets. RJB will win the regions if it can raise the money and agree final terms with the government. RJB, which yesterday refused to comment, says in its presentation it expects to sell about 34m tonnes of coal from those regions and sell them at an average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule at today's prices. Some analysts believe sales around the mid-20m tonne mark are more realistic. The generators, to which most of the coal will be sold, are thought to want to buy coal for nearer Pounds 1 a gigajoule and are prepared to import rather than pay what they believe to be excessive UK prices. Among other key aspects of the presentation, RJB says: Costs per tonne can be cut by at least 10 per cent, partly through streamlining colliery management and increasing equipment utilisation. The English electricity supply market will require 27.1m-43m tonnes a year by 1999. Of the Pounds 628m of borrowing, Pounds 528m will be bank debt and Pounds 100m corporate bonds. Net assets of the regions are Pounds 902m and projected operating cash flow over five years is Pounds 1.35bn. Expected dividend yield is 4.5 per cent initially. Some 95 per cent of shares will be placed with institutions, with 5 per cent set aside for an offer for sale, but this could rise to 15 per cent if there is demand. Details, Page 24</p>

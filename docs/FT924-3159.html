			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Berisford losses at Pounds 22.3m as acquisitions are sought BERISFORD International, the commodities and property group that nearly went into receivership in 1990, is looking to expand once more through acquisitions. The group announced annual results yesterday, showing a loss of Pounds 22.3m before tax, against a Pounds 20.5m deficit in the preceding year to September 30. The company has tax losses of Pounds 365m in the US, Pounds 40m in the UK and Pounds 19m of advance corporation tax which can be recouped. The US losses can be used for up to 15 years but would vanish if Berisford were taken over. Mr Alan Bowkett, who joined as chief executive at the start of the year, said he was now spending 75 per cent of his time looking to the future. Acquisitions would be funded by equity and borrowings. Mr Bowkett said he was 'working very hard' on a deal, and was 'not afraid of debt'. He was looking to buy in areas of industrial manufacturing and distribution, building products or food, and planned initially to buy in the UK. He wanted a company with 'a sound product' and hoped for a friendly deal with the target's shareholders, if not its management. Mr Roy Hammond is to join Berisford as operations director in January. Mr Bowkett and Mr Hammond have worked together in two other companies. Mr Peter Butler, the finance director who has overseen repayment of Pounds 1.5bn of debt, is leaving in the new year. Mr Bowkett said that all the group's problems had now been addressed and there were no more 'black holes'. All the off-balance sheet debt had been brought on balance sheet and he anticipated an unqualified auditors' report on the accounts. At year-end net debt was Pounds 15m (Pounds 18.6m cash), but asset sales since then should give the company net cash by the new year. Early repayment of remaining term debt is planned which will leave the group with four banks, compared with 68 banks when it entered refinancing talks. Shareholders' funds at the year end were Pounds 84.6m and have stabilised at that level since then, Mr Bowkett said. Turnover fell to Pounds 130.5m from Pounds 694.2m, reflecting disposals. Mr Bowkett said the ongoing business had sales of about Pounds 50m a year but central overheads, at about Pounds 5m a year, were high for the size of business. Pre-interest losses were Pounds 2.7m (profit Pounds 21.2m) and interest cost Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 19.6m). Exceptional items of Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 22.1m) included property write-downs of Pounds 16.3m. Extraordinary debits totalled Pounds 42.7m (credit Pounds 76.1m). There was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 67.1m (retained profit of Pounds 62.1m). Losses per share were 4.9p (2.9p). The group is planning to consolidate its 10p shares into 50p shares to reduce the bid-offer spread and cut dealing costs. COMMENT Berisford's survival in any form is a remarkable achievement. But assessing its future as an investment is another matter. The share price of 18 1/2 p, down  1/2 p yesterday, is close to net asset value of 17p a share which, in the absence of profits and dividends, is probably about right. From here on the shares are highly speculative, depending on Mr Bowkett and his team picking a suitable first target and being able to attract investors to finance a large enough deal. If they succeed, and build on that achievement, the eventual prize will be the unlocking of the US tax losses. Not one for the faint hearted.</p>

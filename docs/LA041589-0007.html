			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S TRIAL IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> North is on trial because he twisted and warped what it means to be an  American. Being born and raised in the United States, I was taught that we  Americans believe in the individual, making our own choices, and standing on  our own two feet.  </P> <P> According to North, being a "good American" means taking orders with an  enthusiastic, "Yes, sir!" No questions asked. As for myself, I thought people  are supposed to do that under the rule of dictators and tyrants.  </P> <P> VALERIE LOH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

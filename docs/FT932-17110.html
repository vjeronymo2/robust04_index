			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Strikes pose little threat to economy: As commuters across Britain face widespread disruption, FT writers assess the strategies of the unions TWENTY years ago a one-day strike by the main rail and mining unions, boasting a combined membership of about 500,000, would have sent shudders through the economy. Today the combined membership is closer to 100,000 and, aside from the considerable inconvenience to rail commuters, the one-day strikes will have little economic significance. Less than 10 per cent of domestic freight is now carried by rail and the coal stockpile is 11m tonnes, more than a quarter of the coming year's contract with the electricity generators. The unions, aware of the limited impact of their action, cite the official reason for today's disruption as the European Trade Union Confederation's day of action against unemployment. Unofficially, however, today is the closest that the more traditional sections of the British labour movement can get to a general strike against unemployment and pit closures. Leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers still believe pit closures and privatisation can be stopped by mass action supported by sympathetic public opinion. Mr Ken Capstick, leader of the Yorkshire NUM, says: 'We don't have the industrial muscle any longer and we rely on popular support and on other sections of the trade union movement. But in a strange sort of way the miners can still give the lead.' The RMT rail union appears to accept that privatisation is unstoppable but wants to cushion members from the effects. Its low-key campaign has failed to win the public support that it achieved during the 1989 rail dispute but it has forced the government into abandoning plans for a radical restructuring of the British Rail pension fund. The official reasons for action today are that BR is refusing to give a 'no compulsory redundancy agreement' and refusing to abandon the use of private contractors on traditional railway work. But the RMT executive also wants to show solidarity with the NUM, especially because many of the 20,000 job cuts expected at BR are linked to pit closures. Laws on industrial action, however, mean the RMT may only take action against its own management. The NUM won 60 per cent support on a 75 per cent turnout for the action and the RMT got 70 per cent support on a 55 per cent turnout. Both have talked about further action but no firm decisions have been taken. The RMT, in particular, might face a much tougher reaction from BR and even from the government if it does attempt another strike. Whatever the outcome of today's action and the threat of further disruption, the important future battles will be fought in the law courts.</p>

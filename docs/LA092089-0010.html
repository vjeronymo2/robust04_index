			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN QUAKE  </P> <P> I must applaud the work of your Moscow Bureau chief, Michael Parks, in his  effort to keep readers up to date on the progress of the reconstruction efforts  in earthquake devastated Armenia (Part I, Sept. 5).  </P> <P> Although the reconstruction continues, it is at a snail's pace. The longer this  effort takes the larger the impact on the psyche of the 1/2 million homeless  survivors, poetically described as "refugees in their own land." This is why  the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia (ERFA) has made it its priority to see  to the mental well-being of the survivors.  </P> <P> Since January, ERFA has dispatched seven groups of mental health specialists  under the direction of Dr. Armen Goenjian and Dr. Sarkis Arevian. Focusing  their efforts on the children of the earthquake, these teams have serviced over  3,000 patients. In addition, they have held numerous seminars and conferences  to teach their techniques to local professionals.  </P> <P> PAPKEN SASSOUNI  </P> <P> Chairman, Earthquake  </P> <P> Relief Fund for Armenia  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

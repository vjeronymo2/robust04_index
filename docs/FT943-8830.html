			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Spring Ram gears up for exports drive - The new management team's recovery programme is under way. There are signs not just of recovery but of expansion at Spring Ram, the Yorkshire-based kitchen, bathrooms and furniture group where institutional investors last year forced a boardroom shake-out. The new management team led by Mr Roger Regan, the building industry veteran who took over as executive chairman last July, is investing Pounds 5m to start a new cabinets business. This follows the acquisition of a furniture company from BTR in June and the launch of an export drive. The new management's enthusiasm is scarcely reflected in Spring Ram's share price, which has fallen sharply since the market became concerned about the outlook for the building materials sector and the big DIY retail sheds which Spring Ram supplies. But analysts will be looking at the longer term outlook when the group reports its half-year figures on August 31. Although they are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m in the current year, they believe that profits of more than Pounds 30m could be achieved by 1996, depending on the progress of Mr Regan's recovery programme. The cabinets business will use the increasingly popular foil technology, developed in Japan, which allows cheaper chipboard and fibreboard furniture to be covered with woodgrain and other decorative finishes, at a fraction of the cost of wooden products. It is due to start production in November, and will use a 97,000 sq ft factory alongside the group's Regency Doors plant at Barnsley. The start-up is being masterminded by Mr Hartley Moyes, who joined the group last October as managing director of Regency Doors. He was previously managing director of Homeworthy, the Silentnight business. The cabinets business has the biggest share of the Pounds 150m UK market for foil-covered furniture, which grew by 66 per cent between 1990-93. A Pounds 42m rights issue in January has also given Mr Regan flexibility to make bolt-on acquisitions. The issue bolstered the group's balance sheet following last year's pre-tax losses of Pounds 36.4m - which included Pounds 30.2m of provisions and write-downs. In June, Spring Ram's Stag Furniture subsidiary paid BTR Pounds 5m for the Rest Assured group of companies, which make bedding, upholstery and hand-crafted furniture. Mr Regan said this would allow Stag, which makes bedroom and dining room furniture, to offer retailers an enlarged range. Not all the news is positive. Artisan Tiles, the lossmaking Bradford plant which has been making ceramic tiles since 1992, is 'still struggling'. However, the group is more upbeat about Regency Doors which had also been identified as a possible candidate for closure and lost Pounds 10m last year. Mr Regan said there was now no question of closing the plant, which employs nearly 300 people - most of them former miners. Mr Regan said the group was on - or slightly ahead of - its plan for Regency to return to profitability by 1996. Mr Moyes said this was despite an 'appalling inheritance' of ineffective management in key areas - in particular the absence of production and material control systems, which led to huge wastage. A new management team at Regency brought in consultants to help introduce control systems and a new sales team has been recruited. Stocks have been cut, the cash outflow controlled and improved training has led to a sharp increase in the output per trainee. New doors have been developed and the latest catalogue shows more than 20 different designs. Mr Regan reckons Regency needs only 15 per cent of the UK doors market, which it estimates at Pounds 250m, but is also anxious not to provoke his main rivals into a price war, which could hurt everyone. So the company has launched an export drive, focusing on Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and the US. Exports are also a priority for Spring Ram's bathroom division which last year lost money, in spite of having sales of Pounds 60m - nearly a third of group turnover. Ram Bathrooms, the world's largest manufacturer of acrylic baths, makes money - as does the group's showers business. But these profits are wiped out by losses at Spring Bathrooms, which makes high-volume sanitary ware. Mr Regan has raised prices, partly to get rid of non-profitable business. Output of cheaper bathroom units has been cut from 16,000 to 12,000 a week, with the loss of about 80 jobs. These are the only significant job cuts made by Mr Regan - not counting the 27 former Spring Ram directors who have now departed, including several who became millionaires through share options. The bathrooms market represents a particularly good export opportunity, according to Mr Regan, who says that luxury homes on the Continent are increasingly sold on the range and luxuriousness of their bathroom fittings. The whole Spring Ram group exported only about Pounds 18m-worth of goods last year, out of total sales of Pounds 240m. But Mr Regan believes that overseas sales could be raised to Pounds 60m by 1996. An important element in that exports drive will be the group's ultra-successful kitchens business, which last year made operating profits of Pounds 18.3m on sales of Pounds 109m. Mr Regan describes the kitchen division, which accounts for 12 per cent of the total UK market, as a 'sleeping giant'. He said: 'The Germans supply about 7 per cent of the UK kitchen market. There's no reason why British kitchens should not supply a significant proportion of the German and French markets. There will always be demand - particularly for the English country kitchen style, using lots of wood.' Analysts can be sure of a more considered presentation of the interim figures from the new chairman than they were accustomed to from his predecessor, Mr Bill Rooney, the co-founder of Spring Ram who was forced out last year. The new team discovered that Mr Rooney had planned to build a gantry over the M1, which adjoins Regency's Barnsley plant, emblazoned with a sign welcoming motorists to Yorkshire and Spring Ram. Mr Regan quickly shelved that idea, but jokes that he knows just what he will do when the Regency plant, which is currently painted bright red, stops losing money: 'I'll paint it black]'</p>

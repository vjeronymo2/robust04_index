			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Further slump in UK house prices Nationwide Building Society produced yet more bad news for homeowners this week, with the announcement that its index of house prices dropped a further 2.7 per cent last month. This brought the average house price down by Pounds 1,491 to Pounds 53,038, and piled on yet more difficulties for families already struggling with 'negative equity' - where the value of their house is less than the value of the outstanding mortgage. Halifax Building Society's index only fell by 1.2 per cent, but this followed a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, which was sharper than that registered by Nationwide. Both societies suggested that confusion following Black Wednesday continued to damage consumer confidence, and Halifax called for base rates to be reduced 'at least' to 6 per cent.

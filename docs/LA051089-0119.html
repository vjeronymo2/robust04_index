			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT LINING UP SUBS FOR ANAHEIM SCHOOLS WALKOUT  </P> <P> Substitute teachers were still being hired late Tuesday afternoon as Anaheim  Union High School District officials made final preparations to keep all of the  district's 21 schools open during a 1-day teacher strike today over stalled  salary talks.  </P> <P> While Assistant Supt. LeRoy Kellogg declined to say how many substitutes were  on standby, the president of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn. said he  expected at least 600 of the district's 900 teachers to walk out.  </P> <P> "I don't think they (district officials) ever expected the kind of unity  displayed at our meeting last Friday," when 82.4% of the teachers gave the  go-ahead for today's 1-day strike, union President Leonard Lahtinen said.  Teachers are expected to walk off the job at every school, he said.  </P> <P> Anaheim Union district officials have vowed to keep all classes open and  continue regular services through the job action. Kellogg said the district  placed advertisements in Tuesday's newspapers seeking credentialed substitute  teachers and was also drawing on other districts' rolls of substitute teachers  to hire enough, at $180 a day each, to cover the strike. The Anaheim Union High  School District, which includes junior and senior high schools for most of  Anaheim, as well as for La Palma and Cypress, maintains a list of about 250  substitute teachers. Many substitutes are retired teachers, he said.  </P> <P> But Kellogg said he would be surprised if retired teachers crossing picket  lines today included former Anaheim Union High School District teachers, who  most likely once belonged to the union.  </P> <P> "I'd be surprised if they do, and disappointed," added union President  Lahtinen.  </P> <P> The strike is being waged on statewide Day of the Teacher to demonstrate the  teachers' impatience with stalled contract talks. Teachers have been working  without a contract since last August, and the two sides have failed to reach  any agreement despite the attempts of a state mediator.  </P> <P> Teachers, whose salaries range from $21,000 to $42,000 annually, want a 41%  share of the district's budget surplus after a 2.5% reserve is set aside this  year. For next year, they are seeking a cost-of-living adjustment of about  3.2%, plus 41% of the budget surplus after a 3% reserve is set aside.  Negotiators for the district, which has suffered financially as enrollment has  dropped through the years, do not want to guarantee a pay raise but have  offered teachers a share of any budget surplus.  </P> <P> But teachers say that going without a guaranteed increase for 2 years is  unacceptable.  </P> <P> "Basically we've been willing to bite the bullet for this year, but we refuse  to do that for another year," Lahtinen said. No new negotiating sessions are  scheduled.  </P> <P> "We're waiting for a call from them. The ball is in their court. We don't have  anything else to offer," Lahtinen said.  </P> <P> He said district officials were asking teachers Tuesday to "hand in all keys,  roll books, roll sheets, attendance cards." Although he said that is standard  procedure in the district's strike manual, "I think teachers feel that it's an  insult. We are having a 1-day strike. It's not as if they're never going to  come back to the classroom again."  </P> <P> Teachers plan to set up picket lines at each campus before school begins. At  noon, they will hold a rally at Pearson Park in downtown Anaheim, with teachers  from nearby Anaheim High School marching to the site, Lahtinen said. The  teachers will have lunch before heading back to the schools for more picketing,  he said.  </P> <P> The district board has voted to punish the strikers with loss of pay or  disciplinary action and will make it more difficult for teachers to take sick  leave on the day of the strike.  </P> <P> District officials will not know how many teachers are absent from classrooms  until the school day begins.  </P> <P> While Kellogg declined to give specific numbers, he said "several hundred"  substitutes will be standing by and will be dispatched from several "staging  areas" within the district. He would not say whether classrooms would have to  be combined for the day but stressed that there will be "adequate teachers to  keep the schools open." Students who are absent without an excuse will be  considered truant, he added.  </P> <P> Kellogg said countless parents have been calling the district's strike  information hot line for a taped message that states that schools will be open  and that the district "will maintain safe and orderly campuses."  </P> <P> Kellogg said the district has hired private security guards for the day, which  irked Lahtinen.  </P> <P> "We put out a flyer to our members asking why the district has finally found  the money to improve security when we've been asking for that," he said. "They  will hire them when teachers are on strike, but when teachers are on the job,  they're not interested in securing the campus."  </P></p>

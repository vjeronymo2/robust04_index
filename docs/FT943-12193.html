			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas rallies Automotive and aerospace components group Lucas Industries rallied from an early fall to close 5 down at 193p, after it denied a US press report claiming it was under criminal investigation regarding inspection of parts for commercial aircraft. At the day's worst the shares were down 15 at 183p. However, comments from City analysts and a company statement in the second half of the session - saying that 'there were and are no quality problems' - helped steady nerves. Sentiment was further enhanced by a recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite, a long-term bull for the shares. Leaving its current year profits estimate at a top of the range Pounds 60m, the broker raised its estimate for the following year by Pounds 2m to Pounds 140m. In a note on the components sector, Mr Robert Speed at Henderson said: 'Lucas remains a recovery situation and the adverse share price reaction to the reports from the US provide a cheap buying opportunity.' Tobacco giant BAT Industries rose 7 to 432p after a batch of broker buy notes ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. SG Warburg, James Capel and Nomura were all supporting the shares as the market anticipated profits of between Pounds 880m and Pounds 920m. Last year the group reported a profit of Pounds 902m but that included a Pounds 123m exceptional profit and analysts have been taking heart from recent figures released by US rival Philip Morris which pointed to a general increase in sales. High street bank Barclays was weaker than its rivals in the sector as it was announced that a German subsidiary Merck, Finck &amp; Co had been named in an investigation by the Frankfurt public prosecutor into press allegations of insider trading. The shares closed 3 lighter at 542p. Improving optimism over the domestic drinks market worked its way into a number of second line brewing and pub stocks. Cider-maker Merrydown plunged into losses and the final dividend was slashed from 7.0p to 2.5p. Profits were hit by a big restructuring charge. The shares slipped 2 to 130. In a quiet food manufacturing sector, attention was again focused on one of the sector's favourite bid candidates, United Biscuits. However, turnover of just one million was enough to send the share price up 6 at 322p. Cadbury Schweppes, a wistfully rumoured predator, retreated 9 to 425p. Adverse press comment hurt Hillsdown, off 3 at 161p. Northern Foods slipped 4 to 202p as NatWest Securities warned of the uncertainties surrounding the shake-up in the UK dairy industry. Unigate lost 2 to 360p. Weekend press speculation over a hostile bid for William Low, the Scottish supermarket group under a friendly offer from Tesco, sent the former's shares shooting forward. J Sainsbury remains the market's favourite, being Tesco's biggest rival, under-represented in Scotland and having requested information from Low's regarding Tesco's offer last week. Low shares ended 13 ahead on 278p with turnover a hefty 2.6m. Tesco fell 4 to 237p, while Sainsbury added a penny to 406p. Shares in engineering group GKN and components company T&amp;N also benefited from the review by Henderson Crosthwaite. The former closed 3 ahead at 627p, after the broker raised its 1995 forecast by Pounds 25m to 245m, and the latter put on 7 to 249p, as Henderson increased its estimate for the following year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m. Motor distributors were firm in anticipation of good new car registrations for the month of August. Lex Service put on 10 to 474p, ahead of today's interim figures, and Cowie firmed 3 to 285p. Worries over leasing at British Aerospace left the shares trailing 9 1/2 to 502 1/2p. Blenheim, the exhibitions organiser, was one of the big casualties in the market as the shares responded to a Sunday newspaper article which took a hard hitting approach to the company's performance over the past decade. The shares fell 43 to 257p. London International Group, the condoms and surgical gloves company, held steady at 85p on relief that the rump of its recent Pounds 115.2m rights issue had been successfully placed with institutional investors. SG Warburg, the underwriter, placed the remaining at 84p a share 11.7 per cent, a healthy premium to the issue price of 70p a share. Last week's improved UK construction statistics continued to feed through to selected stocks in the construction and building materials sectors. Among the former, Barratt Developments was helped by a share tip in the weekend press. The shares added 3 to 200p. Amec and Beazer managed rises of 2 to 117p and 163p respectively. Westbury put on 6 to 174p. Among materials groups, RMC advanced 3 to 950p as it announced plans to spend Pounds 15m over the next five years upgrading its lime production operations. Elsewhere, Caradon rose 3 to 309p, and Marshalls 3 to 148p. Recent strength among water and electricity utilities was checked by the dull market as regulatory issues, the subject of some optimism last week, were now perceived as more bearish. South West was the biggest casualty among water stocks, the shares dropping 14 to 520p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter from Panama City; broadcast </F> in progress -- live]    [Text] ....party President Mireya de Gruber; Arnulfo  Escalona has been elected candidate to the post of first vice  president; and Dr. Jose Teran as candidate to the post of second  vice president. Here is an interview with President Guillermo  Endara and [Arnulfista Party President] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber.    [Begin recording] [Endara] That is my party's decision. I  must express my profound disappointment with those who were my  friends in Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement]  and who enjoyed great friendship, trust, and power during my  administration. I think they have been ungrateful to the  Arnulfista Party. I think their attitude of scorn toward the  Arnulfista Party is similar to what occurred with the Christian  Democratic Party [PDC] a few years ago.    I am deeply hurt because my party has been despised and  because Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has been despised. She is very  important to us and to me. Mireya was Arnulfo Arias Madrid's  wife. She took care of him and helped him. She was his loyal  and permanent companion. We Arnulfistas love her very much.  Personally speaking, I love her very much and I must express my  support for her at this time.    [Reporter] Will there be any changes in your government as a  result of this?    [Endara] Those decisions will be made next week. There will  undoubtedly be changes. [applause]    [Reporter] President, what is your opinion of the slate?    [Endara] There will be changes.    [Reporter] Mr. President, what is your opinion of the slate?    [Endara] I think the slate is a slate for the people. The  alliance I tried to achieve, meaning the alliance Arnulfo Arias  tried to achieve between vested interests and the Panamanian  people, represented by the Arnulfista Party, worked during my  government. However, it is obvious that vested interests want to  usurp power and take complete control.    [Reporter] President, do you still believe in political  miracles?    [Endara] What happened today is a political miracle because  now the people are with the people.    [Reporter] Who are these vested interests that want to seize  power?    [Endara] The Panamanian people know who they are, and you  know who they are. They are vested interests that want to seize  power.    [Reporter] Gentlemen, just a minute please, you are blocking  the light. Mrs. Mireya, please, your views about the people who  will accompany you in the slate?    [Gruber] This evening, almost at 2100, the Liberal Authentic  Party [PLA], the Liberal Party, and the Arnulfista Party reached  an agreement on a slate. We have a doctor, Arnulfo Escalona, a  man who has worked hard. He is well-known in this country. We  also have Dr. Teran, a young man, 36 years old, who  wants...[pauses] who knows this represents a sacrifice but wants  to work hard for a better Panama.    [Reporter] What do you think? What kind of campaign will  you conduct given that there is a marked division?    [Gruber] We...[pauses] our campaign is dedicated to the  humble people, the poor. We will have nothing to do with any  party. The Arnulfista Party will start working on Monday, so I  do not worry about the other parties.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Liberal Party members have  traditionally opposed Arnulfista views and positions?    [Gruber] Well, we have been working with the PLA since 1984.  We now have the Liberal Party. We have worked very well with  the PLA, and I know we will work well with the Liberal Party.    [Reporter] Who will be your main adversary? What is the  outlook?    [Gruber] I have always recognized and said that the only  adversary here is the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]. The  other are not, only the PRD.    [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, your opinion about Molirena's  decision to abandon the alliance?    [Gruber] They objected only to one electoral circuit. That  is why they left. Therefore, I do not think they had a good  reason. They did not want to be with the Arnulfista Party any  longer. That was all. [end recording]</p>

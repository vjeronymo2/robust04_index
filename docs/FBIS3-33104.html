According to the information available, the government spent  some 4,482 billion pesos during the first 10 months of this  year, far exceeding the 1992 total, when the figure was 2,711  billion.    Data supplied by the Dasa consulting firm indicate that,  relatively speaking, construction spending increased faster than  sums collected by the government.    While the increase in tax revenue rose 17.3 percent between  January and October of this year compared with last, funding for  this sector was far greater. The major spending effort aimed at  construction results from the determination of government  officials to expand the infrastructure in different areas of  social services, a goal recently adopted as a priority by  government authorities along with the construction of housing  for lower-income groups and the middle class.    While the government did manage to collect 13.435 million  pesos during the period of 1992 undergoing scrutiny, the  absolute, percentage proportion was smaller this year,  comparatively speaking.    From January to October of this year, duties and taxes  totaled 15,758 million pesos, according to the information  available, demonstrating that less is spent than is taken in.  Despradel and Associates data also reveal a general, marked  trend in the public sector to increase capital spending beyond  regular spending. While regular spending rose by 33.8 percent  during the period analyzed, capital charges increased even more  on a percentage basis, amounting to 42.6 percent.    Despite the fact that the Central Government has maintained  a  policy aimed at increasing public spending by earmarking funds  for construction, the country has not endured the scourge of the  inflationary process that it has felt in previous years.    The figures show that inflation did rise in our country, but  generally remained under control. For example, the increase  during the peak month of September was only 1.2 percent.</p>

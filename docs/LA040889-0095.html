			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENE AUTRY MUSEUM SALUTES THE WOMEN OF THE WILD WEST  </P> <P> With typical myopia borne of chauvinism, they talk about the Old West as the  idyllic era when "Men Were Men." Starting this weekend, the Gene Autry Western  Heritage Museum will take a giant step toward correcting the impression, in a  wide-open tribute to "Daring Women of the Wild West."  </P> <P> The two-month salute will draw overdue attention to the role of women in  Western rodeos and shows from the 1800s to the present. Focus of the show will  be an exhibit lent by the Buffalo Bill Cody Center of Cody, Wyo. (Cody's shows  featured a variety of feisty and courageous female performers), an exhibit  enhanced by Autry's own collection of show material from the 1880s through the  "Golden Age of Rodeos" in the 1920s up to the barrel racers and other distaff  daredevils of today.  </P> <P> Special entertainment and pertinent films will include a pair of one-man shows  by actor Eric Sorg, next Tuesday through April 16. Matinee performances, titled  "Annie Oakley and the Wild West," will trace "Li'l Missy's" career as seen  through the eyes of Cody, her mentor. Evening shows are "Cody! An Evening With  Buffalo Bill," not entirely pertinent to the theme but a fascinating attempt to  separate the reality from the myth of Cody.  </P> <P> A series of musical performances will kick off today at 2 p.m. with Patsy  Montana -- first female Western singer to sell a million copies of her records  -- and an all-women Western band playing twice each afternoon on April 29 and  May 29. Other entries in a rich and varied program will be cowgirl roping,  Hollywood stuntwomen and films (Barbara Stanwyck 's "Annie Oakley" and Gail  David's TV series of the same name).  </P> <P> General admission to the museum, at 4700 Zoo Drive in Griffith Park (adjacent  to the zoo), is $4.75, students and seniors $3.50, children 2-12 years $2.  Theater admission is $3 for the general public and $1 for museum members and  paid visitors. Call (213) 667-2000. DICK RORABACK  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS EDGE HIGHER IN VERY QUIET SESSION  </P> <P> Stock prices closed higher Monday, bolstered by a rising dollar and mild  bargain hunting in the slowest trading of the year. The Dow Jones index of 30  industrials, which fell 49.10 points last week, rebounded 14.82 points to  2,257.86.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 112.96 million shares, down from  153.75 million last Thursday and the lightest total since a 110.63 million  share day on Dec. 28.  </P> <P> A smattering of takeover activity and a steady dollar lent background support  to traders looking for an excuse to hunt bargains after two weeks of setbacks  in stocks.  </P> <P> But trading was anemic, with many players reluctant to return to the market  following the three-day Easter weekend. The market was closed for the Good  Friday holiday.  </P> <P> "It's one of the lightest days I've seen in quite awhile," said Charles Jensen  of MKI Securities. He said the advance was "not very convincing" and raised  questions about its staying power.  </P> <P> "You can't be impressed when volume is so light," said Larry Wachtel of  Prudential-Bache Securities.  </P> <P> Brokers attributed the tepid market to the absence of trading in Europe, where  exchanges are still closed for the Easter holiday, and to market anxiety ahead  of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's key policy-making committee.  </P> <P> "Europe was closed and the Japanese are winding up their fiscal year," said  market analyst Trude Latimer of Josephthal &amp; Co, explaining the slack  volume.  </P> <P> Jerry Hinkle of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. said investors are trying to  assess several issues, including the seriousness of inflation, further rises in  interest rates, and whether the economy could be pushed into a recession.  </P> <P> "We at Sanford C. Bernstein do not think there will be anything close to a  recession but the marketplace is neurotic," Hinkle said.  </P> <P> The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by analysts that the  Federal Reserve may bide its time for a while before deciding whether to  tighten credit further.  </P> <P> Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said  in a weekend interview that he believes interest rates are close to peaking  out. He predicted lower rates later in the year.  </P> <P> But worries have also increased of late that subsiding interest rates could be  accompanied by a slowing of economic activity significant enough to qualify as  a recession.  </P> <P> In some scripts now being written on the Street, that would mean that corporate  profits might also be topping out about now.  </P> <P> American Medical International led the active list and jumped 3 5/8 to 21 1/2.  An investor group led by Dr. M. Lee Pearce made a $24-a-share buyout offer for  the company, which also announced that its board is considering a financial  restructuring. In a related development, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's  Investors Service said they placed AMI's debt under review for possible  downgrading.  </P> <P> Other hospital-management stocks moved up in sympathy to the AMI buyout offer.  Humana gained 1 to 29 5/8, and National Medical Enterprises added 1/4 to 27  3/4.  </P> <P> Polaroid fell 4 1/2 to 36. The company succeeded in fending off the takeover  advances of Shamrock Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> International Minerals &amp; Chemicals rose 2 1/8 to 41 1/4. The company said  Curtiss-Wright Corp. had received clearance to acquire more than $15 million of  International's stock.  </P> <P> Sears Roebuck gained 1/8 to 42 1/2 in active trading. The company announced the  sale of its Coldwell Banker commercial real estate business to the unit's  employees and an investor group.  </P> <P> Exxon was unchanged at 44 1/2, recovering from some early selling on news of  the huge oil spill that occurred when an Exxon Shipping Co. tanker ran aground  Friday near Valdez, Alaska.  </P> <P> The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,872.208, up 11.260, or 0.39,  from the trading day.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.68 to  163.32.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.94 to 334.73, and S&amp;P's  500-stock composite index was up 1.59 at 290.57.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 0.38 to  400.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at  325.50, up 0.63.  </P> <P> On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices eased in late trading Monday to close near  their lows for the day after the dollar's rise to over 132 yen encouraged some  profit taking, brokers said. The Nikkei 225-share index lost 56.12 points, or  0.18%, to end at 31,512.40, near the low of 31,505.20.  </P> <P> The London Stock Exchange was closed the Easter holiday.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: Page 5 and 9  </P></p>

President Luis Alberto Lacalle, on his return to the  country,  commented on Bill Clinton's call for a presidential meeting in  Miami in December. Lacalle said the U.S. president did not just  say: I invite you to attend. He said instead: We should work  together in the period between the time you receive this letter  and December to make sure that the summit's agenda will be  enriching and productive.    Lacalle understands that Clinton's suggestion is important.  Countries must join arms; nations must meet more than  governments; public and private groups from different countries  must start working together. For instance, commercial chambers,  educators, and cultural associations should start working  together. In this manner the summit will be the end of a process  where groups from different levels, where intermediate  associations have had a say.    [Begin Lacalle recording] The meeting will be difficult but  the result will be much more productive. A presidential meeting  is always important, but everything there is concentrated in a  declaration where each president explains his opinion. But if  this contact is enriched, as President Clinton says, by  different group meetings -- we must agree at what level we  begin, although we have suggestions -- I think it will be  easier to understand each other. The presidents then will reach  more constructive conclusions. This was what dominated our  talks, together with the issue of relations between Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] and NAFTA, which President Clinton  is following carefully. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine optimistic over poll tax levels - Local Government THE government set its face against Budget changes to the poll tax system yesterday, as Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, expressed optimism about the size of bills for the coming year. Ministers also resisted renewed pressure to help businesses facing large increases in the business rate. Mr Michael Portillo, local-government minister, said the Department of the Environment had neither sought nor expected Budget changes to the uniform business rate, in spite of representations from organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry. Industry has been pressing for improved transitional relief. Mr Heseltine said in the Commons that Labour's 'gloomy predictions' that poll tax bills would be nearer Pounds 300 than the government's target of Pounds 257 would not be fulfilled. During a debate on government grants to councils, he told MPs that in the third quarter of the current financial year, 29 per cent of the budgeted yield had been collected, compared with 28 per cent in the third quarter of the previous year. The total budgeted yield collected in the first nine months of the year is, however, down on that for the previous year, at 68 per cent and 74 per cent respectively. Earlier, Mr Portillo told a Westminster press conference that the losers under the business revaluation - concentrated in the south-east  - would be balanced by the large number of gainers from the revaluation in areas such as the north of England. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the phasing in of property revaluation that coincided with the abolition of domestic rates three years ago will mean increases of 20 per cent plus inflation for 390,000 businesses in the next financial year. The CBI is among many business groups that have called for the increases to be suspended because of the financial pressures imposed on industry by the recession. During the debate, ministers offered little comfort in the face of cross-party backbench protests about how the government distributed grant among councils and decided how much they needed to spend - their standard spending assessments. Mr John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet minister, warned that while Shropshire county council had staved off cuts in nursery education by drawing on balances, that route offered no longer-term solution. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, accused Mr Heseltine of manipulating the grant system to benefit Tory shire districts.</p>

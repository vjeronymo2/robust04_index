			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Invergordon busy Shares in Invergordon surged on reports that one of its biggest institutional shareholders had been approached by Whyte &amp; Mackay, the US group which holds a 41.2 per cent stake in the Scottish spirits company following a failed bid over two years ago. Fleming Investment Management was reportedly unsuccessfully approached to sell its 13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon for 300p a share. Yesterday, the shares closed 20 ahead at 288p, although the turnover at 680,000 was not excessive. The US group launched its Pounds 350m hostile offer at 275p a share and has never discounted rebidding. Recent dull results from Invergordon were seen as encouraging for the predator.</p>

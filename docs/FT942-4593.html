			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Oxford teaches Clinton the Latin for gridlock Oxford tried not to let the visit of the US president cut too heavily into its routine yesterday. True, outside the Sheldonian Theatre, where Mr Bill Clinton received his degree by diploma, there was enough electronics and satellite communications equipment to restart the Star Wars programme. For a modest distance down the street outside there were crowd barriers, and a number of solid-looking figures with wires sprouting from their ears mumbling into their hands. And rather more men than is perhaps strictly conventional in Oxford were standing on roofs and staring into windows through binoculars. But for the most part the university seemed to inhale deeply and carried on manufacturing world leaders. The speech given by Lord Jenkins, Oxford's Chancellor, was careful to maintain the university's dignity at the same time as honouring Mr Clinton. Mr Clinton, dressed in scarlet robes, took some ribbing from Lord Jenkins in good part and said the university had intimidated him before. Following the degree ceremony in Latin, he once more felt like 'just another Yank, half a step behind'. Oxford's citation-writers had certainly been hard at it, even managing a Latin translation of the president's 'achievement in resolving the gridlock which prevented an agreed budget'. Mr Clinton also shrugged off a student protest outside the theatre. As the chanting threatened to drown out his speech, he mildly observed that all forms of debate were clearly still alive in Oxford. Earlier, after a morning of dour rain, Oxford spared some welcoming sunshine as Mr Clinton's fleet of Chinook and Sea King helicopters clattered into Merton Fields just after midday. A good crowd turned out to see him land, but he was quickly ushered away for a private walk up Merton Street to the back entrance of University College, where he studied politics as a Rhodes scholar from October 1968 to June 1970. While he enjoyed a private lunch in his old college, nervous-looking undergraduates spilled from the Examination Schools next door at the end of the morning paper. This is finals time and some who had finished that lunchtime ended up in the pub which was reported to be Bill Clinton's favourite - the Turf. By the time the president had finished eating a few streets away, the distinctive white-tie-and-black-gown subfusc uniforms of some finalists were doing passable imitations of lemon meringue pies, covered in flour, eggs, champagne and crazy foam. Good training for a world leader.</p>

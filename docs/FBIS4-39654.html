			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Dyakov: "The Sad Signs of Crisis"] </F>   [Text] It is usually said: "dry figures." On the other  hand, they are objective. In this respect, no verbal description  can compete with them. As they say, you cannot add or take away  anything. So of course it is interesting to see how the year  1993 looks against the backdrop of the previous one.    The numeric picture of both years is painted in the short  report by the Crimean State Committee on Statistics. As one  should have expected, many data indicate the deepening of the  socioeconomic crisis in our republic.    First, the demographic data. As of 1 January of this year,  the population of Simferopol numbered 356,200,  Sevastopol--374,400, Kerch--181,500, and Yevpatoriya--115,000.  The urban population comprised 68.3 percent, and rural--31.7  percent of the total. Men comprised 46.7 percent, and  women--53.3 percent.    In 1992, the number of births was 28,400; last year--25,700;  the number of deaths--29,800 and 32,600, respectively. Infant  mortality increased. Blue- and white-collar workers numbered  853,700 and 803,600 respectively; 100,500 and 95,200 persons  worked on collective farms.    Industry decreased the output of most categories of  products.  The per capita output by year amounted to: electric power--327  and 242 kW/hr; oil (including gas condensate)--7 and 5.8 kg;  natural gas-- 188 and 187 cubic meters; iron ore--3.8 and 0 kg;  mineral fertilizer--21.6 and 12.4 kg; sulfuric acid--95.6 and  91.1 kg; cement--173 and 147 kg; meat--33.1 and 23.7 kg;  butter--4.8 and 4.5 kg; whole milk products (recalculated as  milk)--94.5 and 76.1 kg; canned food--240.2 and 204 standard  cans; bread and bakery products--107.9 and 103 kg.    The situation in agriculture was grave. It was characterized  by shortages of fodder for public animal husbandry, as well as  fuels and lubricants, and price disproportions. The yield of  grain over the last two years amounted to 32.9 and 27.3 quintals  per hectare, respectively; corn for grain--37.5 and 30.6  quintals; potatoes-- 137.5 and 138.6 quintals; and  vegetables--143 and 132.9 quintals.    The livestock herd is declining. Horned cattle numbered,  782,700 and 730,700 heads, respectively, , including  cows--253,800 and 248,300. Swine numbered 427,800 and 370,000;  sheep and goats 1,007,600 and 995,600; and horses 13,400 and  13,600.    Production of agricultural output per capita of rural  population amounted to 700.5 and 565.2 kg of grain, 140.4 and  161 kg of potatoes, 56.1 and 48.8 kg of meat, 270.1 and 257.1 kg  of milk, and 362 and 319 units of eggs.    The average wages of blue- and white-collar workers in the  national economy amounted, respectively, to 5,690 and 131,503  karbovantsy, and those of kolkhoz members--3,735 and 82,170  karbovantsy. Of course, it is hard to judge the well-being of  the population by these indicators, because the purchasing  capacity of money is not the same--it declines quickly. In any  case, last year prices grew faster than wages.    The State Committee on Statistics also provided us with  figures on the average income level of workers in the national  economy in April of the current year. It amounted to 879,200  karbovantsy. The average wages in banking was 3,147,132  karbovantsy; in air transportation--1,449,935; in  construction--1,311,944, agriculture-- 470,542, and  industry--975,601. As compared to March, the average wages in  April increased by 6.6 percent.</p>

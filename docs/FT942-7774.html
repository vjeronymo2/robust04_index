			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Leading Article: British parties and Europe 'This is not some trivial opinion poll,' said Mr John Major yesterday, launching his party's manifesto for the European elections on June 9. He is right. The European Parliament, especially since the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty last November, is in a position to exert significant influence on the destinies of the European Union if it finds the sense of purpose to do so. It does not have the full powers to grant or withhold taxation, or to pass legislation, that are traditionally those of parliaments in sovereign states; and, largely for that reason, there is no European executive which depends on a disciplined majority in the parliament to carry on its business. But, precisely for that reason, individual MEPs have greater freedom than most of their national counterparts, and those who are prepared to work can have a great deal of influence on the detail of European law. Under Maastricht their influence on other aspects of EU policy, such as foreign relations, should be expected to grow as well. Yet none of the manifestos published in the UK yesterday focuses primarily on the role of the parliament or on how the candidates of the parties concerned would speak and vote if they were elected to it. All three of the main British parties behave as if this were in fact a mammoth opinion poll. The Conservatives defend their record as a government in upholding British interests in Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats blame the Conservatives for everything that is wrong in Britain today - whether or not there is a European connection - and attempt to seduce the voter by promising to behave differently if and when they gain power at Westminster. Direct experience About the specific role of the parliament they have rather little - in the Liberal Democrat case, almost nothing - to say. The Liberal Democrats may be partly excused by the fact that up to now the majoritarian electoral system, which Britain alone uses for these elections, has denied them any direct experience of EP membership. Still, since they alone are prepared to advocate 'a federal Europe', one might have expected them to present themselves as members of a Europe-wide movement with a single programme. This they fail conspicuously to do, perhaps because on many social and economic issues continental liberals are closer to British conservatives, while British liberals are closer to continental socialists. The Conservatives, too, have problems in this area. You will search their manifesto in vain for a reference to the European People's party, the alliance of Christian Democrat parties to whose parliamentary group the Conservative MEPs have belonged since 1992. Only the Labour party can proudly proclaim its intention of 'co-operating with our allies across the continent' to press for a list of economic objectives. Socialist group That list deserves some attention, because the socialist group, already the largest, is the one most likely to find itself in or close to a majority after the elections. Ironically this outcome is made much more likely by the British electoral system, which the Conservative government has insisted on retaining. The main argument for this system  - that it tends to produce a stable governing majority - has no relevance to this election. All it achieves in this context is to distort the overall political composition of the parliament by exaggerating the swings of the British pendulum (usually against the party in power at Westminster). This phenomenon will be particularly unfortunate in the present instance, if it helps the Labour party and its continental allies to impose their agenda on the EU. The list of objectives may sound benign, but its main premise is that public spending at European level can and should be used to 'promote', 'boost' or 'generate' new jobs. It also includes 'an industrial policy', and 'the effective application of regulations in all countries in order to ensure that industry is not disadvantaged by unfair competition'. The application of this philosophy across the EU could virtually be guaranteed to ensure that Europe as a whole remains a high-cost, over-regulated region, whose enterprises would indeed be 'disadvantaged' in competition with those from other parts of the world.</p>

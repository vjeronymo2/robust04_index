			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alleanza enters Ambroveneto pact ALLEANZA, the Italian life insurer controlled by Generali, has entered the shareholders' pact running Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector bank, with a 11.15 per cent stake, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Alleanza has bought 5 per cent from Gemina, the Fiat-controlled investment group which last month announced the sale of its holding of more than 13 per cent in the bank. Alleanza, which already has a small holding in the bank, is also buying 5.25 per cent of Ambroveneto currently owned by Generali.</p>

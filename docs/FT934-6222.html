			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Spanish showdown on incomes policy: Talks between unions, employers and government have failed to secure a social pact and protests begin today Workers in Spain are planning protests across the country today as the unions start to test the government on its attempts to secure an incomes policy for the next three years. Agreement on wage moderation is central to efforts by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to pull Spain out of recession. But three months of talks aimed at securing a social pact between unions, employers and government have produced nothing. Both the government and unions are digging in their heels. Mr Gonzalez says he will force through measures to deregulate the labour market and to peg wages below inflation, whether or not he has an agreement. He has put a November 30 deadline on the talks. Officials say emergency legislation will be put before the cabinet on December 3. The unions say they will follow up today's protests with a 24-hour strike towards the end of December. The prospect is now one of a government-union showdown marked by escalating industrial unrest that is likely to undermine confidence in the peseta. More talks on the social pact are planned for tomorrow but it is unlikely anything can now be agreed. Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, who drew up the reform package, sums up the government's frustration over the negotiating process: 'Rarely have I attended such long meetings with so little to show for them.' The government would have preferred a consensus, but it is determined to act alone because the reforms are 'urgent and necessary'. The talks were probably doomed from the start. In early October Mr Gonzalez acknowledged as much in an interview with the FT: 'The great problem of (the social) pact is that the government has nothing to give in exchange. We are asking for an incomes policy to improve competitiveness, for changes in traditional collective bargaining procedures and for a modification of the labour market that will make it more flexible . . . this requires a cultural change in union attitudes and this is very difficult.' The unions may be blamed for intransigence but the government can equally be accused of failing to face up to the unions in the past and of now attempting to do too much, too late. The rigidities concerning fixed employment conditions, severance terms and job classifications that Mr Gonzalez now seeks to loosen were enshrined in a Workers' Statute that was legislated by his government in 1984. At that time Spain, which was then not a member of the European Union, enjoyed a highly protected economy, had strong pent-up growth potential and a cheap labour force. None of these conditions applies today as Spain enters its second year of recession, with the domestic economy contracting 1 per cent by the third quarter. During the economic growth period of the late 1980s, the government did little to curb inflationary wage agreements in public sector companies and forced up unit labour costs by transferring a growing social security burden on to companies. At present 24 per cent of Spain's social security expenditure is financed directly by companies, against an average of 9.8 per cent in the EU. Attempts by the government to stimulate jobs were counter-productive or short-lived. A system of short-term contracts introduced in 1986 merely created a rotating system that had employees alternately working and receiving unemployment benefits, and a youth employment scheme was abandoned after a general strike in 1987. Mr Carlos Ferrer Salat, the chairman of Unice, the European employers' confederation, points out that Spain now has double the the EU's unemployment rate, three-times that of the US and 10-times that of the Pacific rim. 'Europe has the most costly and rigid labour market in the world and Spain has the most costly and rigid market in Europe,' said the Barcelona-born businessman. In the midst of the worst post-war recession that Spain has endured, the government has now come round to facing the deep-seated structural problems that it believes are preventing job creation, even in growth periods, and which have forced up wages even when the economy was flat. 'Why does our economy only create jobs when it is growing by more than 2 per cent?' Mr Solbes asked a recent meeting of businessmen in Barcelona. 'Why, even when we are booming, do we have unemployment levels of 16 per cent? How is it that in the midst of a recession, wages increases are above our inflation level and above those in other countries that are better off then Spain?' Mr Solbes, an economist, knows the answers perfectly well and he has brought Mr Gonzalez round to understanding the nature of the problem. This is why the government has embarked on its go-it-alone course of imposing an incomes policy and reforming the labour market. By January 1 Mr Solbes wants clear guidelines in place that will hold down wages to below inflation over the next three years. He also wants new laws that end fixed-term employment contracts, permit job mobility, streamline redundancy procedures and lower severance costs, and which substitute sectorial collective wage agreements with case-by-case deals. Bracing himself for the forthcoming bout of labour unrest, Mr Solbes is talking tough: 'The country is in no position to have strikes. It has to get down to work.'</p>

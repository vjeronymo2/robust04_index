			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Observer: Just desserts It seems that Russians who smuggled Iraqi asylum-seekers across the Baltic Sea to Sweden were seeking their own kind of asylum. Life in Swedish jails, they thought, was better than their cash and job-starved existences back home. Prisoners in Sweden are paid allowances of up to 60 crowns a day even for attending a training course and may be eligible for travel grants when on parole. So now officials are considering changing the allowances to make a prison term less attractive for people from countries with a lower standard of living than Sweden.</p>

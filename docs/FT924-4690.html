			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: How the endless rise of Harland Simon ran out of fuel - The questionable methods behind the group's collapse ON TUESDAY February 11 Mr Roy Ashman, chairman of Harland Simon, the control systems and imaging group, finally admitted his run of luck was over. At a board meeting that day it became clear that the company's years of profits growth, built on successful products, but some highly questionable financial procedures, were past. Harland issued a warning which spoke of an expected 'significant fall in profits'. Its shares collapsed from 590p to 253p and Mr Ashman resigned. Faced with a crisis of confidence among customers and shareholders, Harland fell deeper into trouble and by this September its shares were suspended. One month later receivers were appointed. The extraordinary rise of Harland Simon was over. Harland's main business was manufacture of process control equipment, especially for the newspaper industry. Its products were well regarded and sold to several national newspapers, including the Telegraph group, News International and Financial Times. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.5m in the year to March 31, 1989 to Pounds 8.3m in 1990 and Pounds 10.5m in 1991. In the weeks leading up to the profits warning, analysts expected Harland to make profits of Pounds 12.5m for the year to March 1992. But it announced losses of Pounds 6.3m. Mr Ashman, who did not return telephone calls seeking interviews for this article, co-founded the company and is described by former colleagues as a dealmaker who left details to others. He gained the confidence of the City, which was impressed by his ability to explain technology in simple terms. Harland won a stock market premium and outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by 200 per cent between 1988 and the profit warning. According to former employees, he was an optimist who believed the plaudits awarded him in the City. But in the quest for yet higher profits, Harland became dependent on orders from major shareholders. When these sold out, Harland was unable to sustain orders and turned to questionable financial practices. 'He got absorbed by his own aura and got deeper and deeper in trouble,' a former colleague said. Documents in the possession of the Financial Times provide evidence that: Harland altered a large customer order so profits could be taken earlier than allowed by accounting regulations. executives misled investors about Harland's relationship with Perfect Information Limited (PIL), a loss-making information company. Harland overcharged for equipment sold to PIL which was then sold and leased back from banks at the inflated value. two executives lodged the accounts of a subsidiary at Companies House against the wishes of the subsidiary's managing director, who said a board meeting was not validly convened, as required by the Companies Act. Harland was floated in 1987. In the mid 1980s a major source of business was Mirror Group Newspapers, then controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. At the same time, Mr Maxwell's Pergamon was a Harland shareholder, after gaining an option in 1986 to buy into the company. On Harland's flotation, Pergamon made a profit of nearly Pounds 900,000 on its shares. Mountain Dew, a family trust controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, founder of Polly Peck International, the failed fruits and electronics group, then emerged as Harland's major shareholder, owning 28 per cent by August 1989. Mr Nadir was again one of Harland's main customers. Newspapers such as Mr Nadir's Istanbul-based Gunaydin placed substantial orders with Harland for process control and imaging systems. In 1990 Mountain Dew and Mr Ashman set up News Cuttings Bureau (NCB), a company that later changed its name to PIL. Mountain Dew owned 80 per cent of NCB while Mr Ashman and Harland each owned 10 per cent. In late March 1990, just before Harland's year end, NCB ordered Pounds 3.8m of equipment from Harland. The transaction was booked in Harland's 1990 accounts, generating operating profits of Pounds 2.5m. Helped by this profit boost, Harland successfully completed a rights issue in July to raise Pounds 13.8m. Mountain Dew used the opportunity to sell its stake in Harland in September 1990 for a profit of nearly Pounds 5m. Its shares in NCB were sold to Mr Ashman and Harland, so that each owned 50 per cent. Harland's links with Mr Maxwell and Mr Nadir were well known but their importance was not fully appreciated by shareholders. 'Harland kept beating our profit estimates. Looking back, the deals with Maxwell and Nadir were either fortunate coincidences or extremely clever forward planning,' one shareholder said. By March 1991, with no large shareholder to place orders, recession began to take its toll. With its financial year drawing to a close, Harland told its subsidiaries to find orders. According to a former employee, 'there was always a problem at the year end, but Roy (Ashman) always seemed to pull a rabbit out of his hat'. On March 25, PIL director Mr Neil Smart wrote to Harland Simon Library Systems ordering Pounds 2.4m of equipment. Mr Smart's order was doctored by Harland. A second letter, written subsequently but backdated to March 25, removed a paragraph that mentioned timings for delivery, and changed PIL's payment terms. The letter, found in PIL's files some months later, was purportedly signed by Evelyn Child, on behalf of Mr Smart. Ms Child was Mr Ashman's personal assistant, and had no responsibility for PIL or Mr Smart. According to former Harland employees, this second letter was to help convince Harland's auditors, Price Waterhouse, that profit from the order could be taken in 1991. These employees said taking profits early happened on other occasions. Harland booked about Pounds 1.6m profit from the deal, even though none of the equipment could have been prepared, delivered and invoiced in the six days before the year end. Equipment sold to PIL was also overpriced, sometimes by up to 50 per cent. Earlier this year a group creditor asked a specialist computer company to value a system supplied by Harland to PIL. The company's conclusion was: 'The system was grossly overpriced.' In 1990 and 1991 Harland sold equipment to PIL for Pounds 7.8m. According to a bank involved, the list price was Pounds 3.5m. Harland therefore booked at least Pounds 4m of clear operating profit - a 50 per cent margin compared with about 14 per cent for the business overall. On one occasion in 1991, a computer with a list price of Pounds 250,000 was sold by Harland to PIL for Pounds 400,000. The equipment was then sold to and leased back from a leading bank. The bank only checked on the value of the equipment once Harland's problems became public. Harland did not consolidate PIL, even when it increased its stake to 50 per cent, because the stake was classified as a short-term holding in its accounts. In summer 1991, Harland told shareholders it had disposed of the investment. Harland paid the Swiss company Oerlikon Buhrle a nominal SFr5 for Contraves, a loss-making drives company. According to Harland, Oerlikon agreed in return to invest Pounds 2.45m in Sandford, a Liechtenstein trust, which in turn invested the money in PIL for a 54 per cent stake. But Oerlikon has repeatedly said it made no money available. Price Waterhouse qualified Harland's 1992 accounts because it could not establish ownership of Sandford. Sandford's trustee, Prince Michael von Liechtenstein, refused to comment. Sandford held the 54 per cent stake in PIL, but documents with the FT suggest Harland retained control of PIL throughout. Until January this year, five months after Harland claimed to have relinquished control of PIL and Mr Ashman stepped down as a director of PIL, Mr Ashman was the sole signatory on PIL's bank account. After Mr Ashman resigned from Harland in February, PIL's bank mandate was changed to allow any two signatures from PIL's three directors. But two directors, Mr George Neophitou - appointed in February - and Mr John Stobart, were Harland executives. Harland also remained sole guarantor for two equipment leases, worth more than Pounds 4m, taken out by PIL. Contraves was to play a large part in Harland's downfall. It continued to lose money and by last December Mr John Redshaw, managing director, admitted privately that Contraves had much higher borrowings than previously thought. Following Harland's profits warning, and more rigorous accounting policies, Harland made provisions of Pounds 5.23m to cover Contraves. By December, Harland had order and cashflow problems. Mr Ashman and Mr Redshaw met with other executives and discussed wage freezes and redundancies. In one meeting, Mr Ashman said: 'I don't think Christmas will come this year.' On December 12 Harland released an optimistic interim statement with a 16 per cent profits increase. The company said it was weathering recession well and had secured good orders. Problems mounted through January as cash drained out into Contraves and orders were scarce. Yet Harland continued to give upbeat briefings. On February 10, the day before the board met to agree on a profits warning, Mr Ashman met with one institution, John Govett. After the meeting, it bought 125,000 Harland shares for more than Pounds 700,000. When the profits warning was released two days later, analysts and shareholders were stunned. Mr Ashman was quickly succeeded by Mr David Mahony, the deputy chairman of Harland and an industrial adviser to Hambros, Harland's merchant bank. But Mr Mahony failed to restore confidence and Harland's shares continued to slide. Morale, dented since the Christmas pay freeze, plunged. Customers and suppliers started asking questions. Harland discovered it had a new problem. Systems supplied to PIL were working poorly and despite Harland's effective control over the company, PIL's managing director Mr Charles Warner-Allen started to complain. Because of PIL's poor trading position, he wanted a statement in PIL's March 1991 accounts - which had still not been finalised - that Harland was PIL's ultimate holding company. Mr Warner-Allen argued that a March 1991 information memorandum seeking subscribers for shares in PIL - subsequently aborted - contained such a clause. Harland refused. If it had agreed, it would have been forced to consolidate PIL's accounts. Instead, Mr Stobart and Mr Neophitou signed off the accounts in June with only a statement of support from Harland. According to Mr Warner-Allen, he was not notified of a board meeting to clear the accounts, as is required under the Companies Act. In a letter to Mr Neophitou, Mr Warner-Allen said he was 'staggered' to find out the accounts had been signed off without the approval of the company's managing director. By September, Harland's decline looked terminal. Proceeds from the disposal of a subsidiary were withheld by Barclays, Harland's main banker, and the shares were suspended on the stock exchange at 20p. Harland did not go into receivership immediately. Instead, its financial adviser, Hambros, put forward two company doctors, Sir Ian Morrow and Mr Tony McCann, to join the company's executive committee, but not as directors. Mr McCann was paid more than Pounds 6,000 a week during his short tenure. On September 15 Hambros told Harland it was switching to weekly invoicing for its advice. In the last few weeks of September, Hambros charged Harland up to Pounds 19,000 a week for its services. On September 11 Harland wrote to PIL saying it was withdrawing support. PIL went into liquidation and triggered the guarantee of more than Pounds 4m granted by Harland over PIL's leased equipment. The guarantee was worthless once receivers were appointed at Harland on October 23. Several hundred employees are unsure if they will recover all their pensions. The pension fund's trustees, Mr Ashman and Mr Mahony, approved the investment of Pounds 500,000 of the fund's money in PIL. Harland said in July that the money would be returned, but it has not been repaid. When Mr Ashman left the company in February he received a Pounds 365,000 pay off, together with his full entitlement of Pounds 960,000 from Harland's Pounds 6m pension fund. Mr Ashman, meanwhile, is attempting a comeback. Working out of an office in Milton Keynes, he and two other directors have bought Harland's control systems division from the receiver. The company is being renamed Harland Simon Limited. A former colleague said: 'Roy thinks he can start all over again. He still thinks the City loves him.'</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark board decides on bidder THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark last night decided to recommend one of three potential bidders for the family-owned shoe manufacturer after a marathon meeting lasting almost 12 hours. The board convened at 10.30am, but by early evening had still not chosen between the three rivals: property and commodities group Berisford; shoe manufacturer FII and an investment consortium of existing shareholders backed by Electra Investment Trust. Although the decision is not expected to be announced until after shareholders have been informed, speculation centred on the success of the investment consortium. As Clark shareholders, the institutions have pre-emptive rights over the sale of its shares. The board is believed to have rejected a fourth bid in cash or shares from a group of institutions which was pitched at approximately Pounds 2. The board's decision not to consider the fourth bid is thought to have been strongly opposed by the four directors who last year sought to unseat the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting. It is likely the directors will try to reconvene the egm, which was adjourned until no later than the annual general meeting planned for this month. All the bidders were seeking majority control although Berisford was believed to be demanding at least 90 per cent. The investment consortium is thought to be looking for at least 51 per cent. The board faced three options in its choice of potential bidder: Berisford has made no secret of its desire to build an international industrial holding company spanning Europe and the US. Clark's would be just one of four divisions, with the emphasis on making it more competitive in an international environment. FII, on the other hand, argues its knowledge of the shoe industry would bring considerable benefit to both companies and few jobs would be lost. A significant supplier to Marks and Spencer, FII would be able to introduce Clark's range of children's and casual shoes to this market. The investment consortium, meanwhile, is prepared to back the company's existing management and is aiming for an eventual flotation.</p>

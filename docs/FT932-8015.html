			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York raw SUGAR prices remained broadly lower at midday after a steep late morning drop, but the emergence of trade buying and an easing of technical selling allowed prices to move well off their two-week lows, traders said. Analysts said fundamentals remained bullish. That was underscored by the International Sugar Organisation's estimate for the 1992-93 world production deficit at 1.61m tonnes. New York arabica COFFEE prices erased moderate morning losses to stand slightly firmer at midday. The early sell-off came as profit taking emerged after Tuesday's rise of 3.45 cents a lb. Sales were also prompted by news that the Green Coffee Association had revised downwards by more than 50 per cent the decrease in US coffee warehouse stocks in April. On the LME COPPER ended the afternoon kerb little changed, with the mood indecisive and many traders looking to buy dips and sell rallies. There appeared to be solid resistance around Dollars 1,820-Dollars 1,830 a tonne for three-month metal and support below Dollars 1,800. Other metals were little changed - many appeared to be entering consolidation phases, dealers said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

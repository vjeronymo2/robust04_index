			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text of dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy </F> secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Jallul] Hizballah is at odds with the Lebanese  State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject it. It  seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the  situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the  al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary  action and politics.    [Qasim] Adaptation usually means a relinquishment of  principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to  principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash  with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote  the idea that any ideological and political difference with a  party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in  Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy  only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and  political differences should not lead to military clashes. We  also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and  thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our  faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and  them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe  in the use of force to impose our will on others.    Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September  massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us  into an internal military conflict to justify the international  security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some  scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military  clash, especially with the Lebanese Army.    We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in  the use of that method by any side and because we did not want  to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they  wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to  strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed  to prevent a peaceful demonstration.    Regarding mass media propaganda, we believe that this way  pushes the country toward a unilateral military rule and will  not lead to the establishment of a free, coexisting Lebanon,  which we have known and which should continue to be. Without  such freedoms, there will be no Lebanon. We have no interest in  confronting the authority through newscasts, and we want to  prevent any comparison between us and people blasting the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church. Some people wanted such an unfair  comparison. Therefore, we deprived them of such a chance.    [Jallul] You seem to be supporting the dissolution of the  Lebanese Forces.    [Qasim] We are against any international explosion, we  condemn any relationship with the Israeli enemy, and we build  our relations with others on this basis. I believe that a  peripheral issue led to the dissolution of the Lebanese Forces,  and it is essential to concentrate on the nature of these forces  and their positions. We clearly reject the logic of these  forces and their relationship with the Israeli enemy. [passage  omitted]    [Jallul] You are linked with Iran by spiritual and  strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political  relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a  collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue?    [Qasim] I believe that the collision assumption is wrong and  baseless. The contrast in views on the Madrid conference is not  new. Had collision been a possibility, it would have begun when  the Madrid conference convened. Each of the two states  appreciated the other state's position, convictions, and  circumstances, so the relationship between them continued to be  strong without being affected by what takes place in this regard.    I do not believe that there is a problem more sensitive than  this one. Thus, the possibility of collision is ruled out, and  the possibility of understanding and cooperation on common bases  is the rule. In our relations with Iran and Syria, we do not  feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are contradictory, and we  feel that we are in harmony with both parties.    [Jallul] Many people fear that your resistance of Israel is  meant to achieve domestic purposes.    [Qasim] Our resistance of Israel will give us a great asset  among our people and kinsfolk who are yearning for the removal  of Israel from every inch of occupied land. Thus, the outcome  of confrontation with Israel cannot be separated from the  repercussions on the domestic level. It is unfair to say that  we are fighting Israel to increase our domestic weight.  Fighting against Israel is part of our ideology, plan, and  strategic conviction.    [Jallul] Will you continue to fight Israel if it withdraws  from Lebanon?    [Qasim] We support the Palestinian people in defending their  occupied territories because we regard this people as rightful.  However, details of this support would be discussed at an  appropriate time.    [Jallul] Are you negotiating with Israel on a possible  withdrawal from southern Lebanon?    [Qasim] There is no need to negotiate with anyone. Israel  can withdraw, and no one is preventing it from doing so. We do  not want to conclude any security or political agreement with  Israel because it is an occupying force and should withdraw from  the territory it occupies.    [Jallul] In your slogans you say that "Israel is a germ" and  should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that the  Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for withdrawal  from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open fire on  Israel across the Lebanese border?    [Qasim] We will oppose any agreement that gives legitimacy  to occupation which usurps lands.    [Jallul] In Palestine or Lebanon?    [Qasim] Anywhere in this occupied territory. Details on the  way of dealing and on confrontation will be left for the future.    [Jallul] Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard" playing a role  in the confrontation you are waging with Israel?    [Qasim] The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard does not  fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that some of  its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play an  educational and training role and do not participate in other  matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's  attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in  the region.    [Jallul] Elections of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council were  held recently. You participated in these elections in favor of  Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din. Your failure to nominate an  independent candidate was interpreted to mean that you are not  permitted to occupy posts in the official shiite institutions.    [Qasim] Only those things which God banned us from doing are  prohibited. We are convinced of the need to deal with these  institutions, and we determine the way and limits of such  dealing according to both our goals and the objective  circumstances. In analyzing the situation of the Shiite Islamic  Council, we found that Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din is the  right man for this post. You know that in such cases a person  may be nominated but another person may be selected. There is  nothing strange in this matter.</p>

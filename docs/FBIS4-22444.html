			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Koval: "Criminal Investigation Resigns"] </F>   [Text] I do not recommend you read the following, because  it is guaranteed not to make you feel optimistic. I am unhappy  about it myself but, try as I may, there was just no getting  around the numbers.    Take this one, for example: did you know that there has been  a 95-percent turnover in the Criminal Investigation Department  of the Moscow Oblast Internal Affairs Administration in the past  year? That figure was cited by Mr. V. A. Sidorov, an  administration employee, at a meeting of the oblast League of  Retail and Wholesale Entrepreneurs. Mr. Sidorov attempted to  blame this wholesale departure of professionals on the low pay  scale. I must object.    Firstly, insofar as I am aware, even the lowest pay grade  for  a militia employee is higher than average pay in Russia. Things  are hard for everybody, except for a few.    Secondly, financial difficulties are not enough to make a  true professional consider changing jobs. In my conversations  with former MVD employees they have cited reasons relating to  morale, not financial reasons (see: "Honest People on the Night  Train" in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 20 November 1993). A militia major  of my acquaintance left criminal investigation out of fear for  his own life when he learned that an information about an  operational plan he discussed behind closed doors with his  bosses reached criminals the very same day.    Even someone who is not a professional can understand that a  95-percent turnover in the criminal investigation staff hampers  active and effective crimefighting efforts.    A poll taken by the Moscow Oblast League of Retail and  Wholesale Entrepreneurs among its members before this  information was made public indicated that only 13 percent of  them expect help from the authorities when they encounter  criminal structures.    The most risky type of business activity was trade  (indicated  by 82 percent of those surveyed), with banking in second place  (77 percent), followed by services (16 percent). Only 5 percent  of manufacturers are subjected to criminal pressure. That fact  is easy to explain: no one is making big money in manufacturing  nowadays -- people who are involved in it are barely making ends  meet.    Virtually all power structures are now affected by  corruption. According to figures from the same poll, 60 percent  of entrepreneurs had encountered bribery among public officials,  and 71 percent said the same of the militia. For the procuracy,  tax inspectorate and state trade inspectorate the figure was 51  percent, and for banks -- 47 percent.    Once again, these figures come as no surprise --  legitimation  of graft began with Gavriil Popov back at the height of  "perestroyka," when he stated that a bribe is merely an  "expression of gratitude to an official for a job well done." On  the contrary: reported cases of bribery, now a rarity, are used  by the authorities solely for the purpose of getting rid of  undesirable political opponents.    When they have to protect their interests, more than half of  the entrepreneurs prefer not to go to the agencies that are  supposed to protect those interests (76 percent do not believe  the militia, 79 percent mistrust the former KGB, and 92 percent,  the office of the public prosecutor); instead they enter into  illegal contracts with criminal structures. Modern racketeers  never impose impossible terms, as they are well aware of their  own interest in keeping a businessman's business profitable.  Instead one finds the excesses among bureaucrats in the "law  enforcement" structures, whose appetite becomes more insatiable  with each passing day.    Meanwhile the taxes that should supposedly ensure your  safety  and mine continue to rise. Recently the minister of internal  affairs publicly announced an anti-crime program that he had  drawn up and submitted to the President. A secret program, I  should note. That means that if it is adopted there will be no  accountability requirement in connection with its  implementation, since you and I do not have a "need to know"  what it contains.    I would like to direct particular attention to the fact that  the minister has requested R2 billion [rubles] to carry out the  program, and that the government has already included this  funding in the budget. According to estimates by independent  experts, the actual amount, not counting inflation, would  already exceed that amount by a factor of nine. Considering the  program's goals and the amount of taxes collected, even R18  billion is not a lot. That is to say, once again what we have is  an empty declaration that does not pursue the objective of  achieving real results in the fight against crime.    The conclusion drawn from the figures that our editorial  staff has available is depressingly simple: your safety and mine  is in our own hands. Should we band together to protect  ourselves? Should we move about the streets in groups? Or should  we think about getting a new government? The choice is ours...</p>

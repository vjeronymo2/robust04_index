			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAK PREMIER URGES FREE MARKET  </P> <P> Declaring that only a free market system can reverse decades of economic  decline here, Czechoslovakia's new prime minister Tuesday proposed fundamental  changes that would essentially dismantle his nation's Communist economic  structure.  </P> <P> After 40 years of Communist rule, "much of our inherited national wealth has  been dissipated," Prime Minister Marian Calfa told the Federal Assembly,  Czechoslovakia's Parliament, as he outlined the government's legislative  program.  </P> <P> Now, he said, "we have to accept the market with all its advantages, but also  its disadvantages."  </P> <P> Calfa, a Communist who presides over a largely non-Communist government, also  said the government plans to introduce new laws in January that would guarantee  freedom of religion, speech and association, the rights of the media and the  functioning of a free democratic political system.  </P> <P> A few hours later, the Parliament, dominated by long-obedient Communist  deputies, voted unanimously to approve the government's policies.  </P> <P> At the same time, deputies one after another took advantage of live national  television coverage of their meeting to assure constituents that they support  the speedy election of activist playwright Vaclav Havel, leader of the Civic  Forum democratic movement, as the nation's next president.  </P> <P> The government plans to hold free elections here next spring, and even  Communist members of the assembly who had opposed Havel only a few days ago  appear to have decided that supporting him is their best hope for gaining  reelection.  </P> <P> Deputies have been receiving a flood of letters, telegrams and petitions  supporting Havel. And to reinforce the message Tuesday, they were greeted by  thousands of students, many of whom had come to Prague in special chartered  trains, who gathered near the assembly building with pro-Havel banners and  placards.  </P> <P> Havel's victory is now all but assured. "It does seem I am the likely person to  be elected," he said at a news conference Tuesday. Late Tuesday evening, the  Parliament's Presidium announced that the election will be held on Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Calfa's speech was a remarkable embrace of free-market principles. The  government, he noted, will continue to provide services for which the market is  ill-suited, such as education and health services, and will strive to ensure  full employment while fighting inflation.  </P> <P> But, he said, "we cannot afford to experiment" with half-measures that would  mix some market principles into the nation's current centrally planned system.  Only a free market, he said, can "ensure economic rationality, an increase in  the standard of living of the population and rational use of natural  resources."  </P> <P> During the first quarter of the new year, he added, the government would  introduce laws to break up the giant state monopolies that now dominate the  economy; legalize all forms of private property; authorize companies to sell  stocks; establish open markets for money and capital, and begin a "progressive,  but not hesitating, introduction of a convertible currency."  </P> <P> The current state pricing office will be turned into an anti-monopoly  commission, he said, and the government will move "urgently" to close old,  inefficient factories.  </P> <P> The government, for the first time, also will introduce an unemployment  compensation system. It will propose a new state budget that will sharply  restrict government spending, reducing the size of the bureaucracy and cutting  money for the army and the police.  </P> <P> Overall, he said, the aim will be to "create all conditions to make  Czechoslovakia an equal partner integrated into the world economy."  Czechoslovakia will ask for some form of "association" with the European  Community, he said.  </P> <P> Although Calfa pledged to try to make the transition to a free market as  painless as possible, he also warned that "the government cannot permit rising  wages without increasing productivity."  </P> <P> Calfa's speech went far beyond the ideas he outlined in a news conference after  he was appointed last week. The new statements clearly reflected the thinking  of his finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, who likes to call himself the "Milton  Friedman of Czechoslovakia," a reference to America's most prominent  conservative free-market economist.  </P> <P> In describing his goals, for example, the prime minister chose words that would  fit easily into a Republican Party platform in the United States. The free  market "gives every individual the opportunity to follow his own interests and,  at the same time, benefit all others," he said.  </P> <P> In the debate that followed, only a few hard-line Communist deputies departed  from the basic direction set by Calfa's speech. The government must preserve  "the unchangeability of our socialist system," one deputy said. "We're entering  into a new era of socialism," said another.  </P> <P> Most deputies, however, chose instead a tack that would have been familiar to  American legislators, using their time on television to press parochial  concerns.  </P> <P> Several deputies from mining regions, for example, raised the plight of miners  who are likely to lose their jobs in the coming economic restructuring. A  deputy who represents an area with a large ethnic Hungarian population called  for a new ministry to handle minority affairs. And a delegate from Prague asked  government ministers to examine the city's housing shortage.  </P> <P> The one common theme, other than support for Havel, was concern about the  nation's severe environmental problems, as delegate after delegate rose to  complain about dirty air, contaminated food and rising cancer rates.  </P> <P> The parade of endorsements for Havel began with Calfa himself, who was quickly  joined by the nation's Communist minister of national defense and most of the  other members of the new government.  </P> <P> When the vote comes, Havel is likely to be the only candidate nominated for the  presidency. One potential opponent, Alexander Dubcek, who led the nation's last  reform effort in 1968, is expected to be elected chairman of the assembly.  Another candidate, Cestmir Cisar, an official in Dubcek's government, withdrew  from the race Tuesday night and endorsed Havel.  </P></p>

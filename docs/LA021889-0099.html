			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The three national television networks have asked for several changes to the  provocative Diet Coke ad that claims consumers are switching from regular Pepsi  to Diet Coke. But the ads will continue to run, Coca-Cola U.S.A. executives  said. The ad will now specifically note that while 2 million families stopped  buying regular Pepsi last year, "about a half million of them moved to Diet  Coke." And the ad will also note the source of the ad's claim --  Connecticut-based Marketing Research Corp. of America.  </P></p>

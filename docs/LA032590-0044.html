			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTIST REFUSES TO PLAY IT SAFE;  </P> <P> CURTIS YORK'S POLITICALLY PROVOCATIVE PERFORMANCES REGULARLY STIR UP  CONTROVERSY AND ANGER.  </P> <P> Some observers and art lovers are fretting over whether people who make art are  going to turn timid in the face of congressional inquiries into federal arts  funding. National Endowment for the Arts budget cuts today, rampant censorship  tomorrow: That's the worst scenario, but, some feel, not an outlandish one.  Will artists start reasoning that it's better to play it safe right now, until  all this blows over -- thus employing a subtle form of censorship? Will they be  hit with their own case of "The Wimp Factor"?  </P> <P> A few may, but don't count on performance artist Curtis York. A former student  of Utah's Weber State College and the University of Utah, York came to Los  Angeles with $50 in his pocket to study with performance artist Rachel  Rosenthal. After four years of presenting his own and others' work, York, 26,  who wears leather clothes and sports a Mohawk haircut, has regularly stirred up  controversy -- and some anger -- with a collection of politically provocative  pieces.  </P> <P> Take, for example, the working title of a piece planned for Los Angeles  Contemporary Exhibitions: "Autoeroticurtis." Or his latest, at Highways in  Santa Monica: "The United States of Christ."  </P> <P> That's nothing compared to an early working title, which was -- Jesse Helms,  are you listening? -- "Flaming Faggot, Burning Witch."  </P> <P> Actually, York hopes that Helms, or one of his local allies, is listening.  "This is especially meant for right-wing Christians to see. If their faith is  strong enough, hearing a little truth about history won't shake it."  </P> <P> At the same time, York warns: "The time to be polite is over. No one can tell  artists what they can and can't do."  </P> <P> It is a careful tightrope York is walking with "The United States of Christ."  With his collaborator and longtime friend, author Frosti, the professional name  of Scott Simpson, York says his intent is to deliver a warning against trying  to bridge the separation of church and state as well as deliver a theatrical  message of tolerance.  </P> <P> Not an easy trick, considering the charged emotions surrounding some of the  show's themes, such as abortion rights, and freedom of expression. Though a  scene shows one of York's characters (he plays 15 in all), a Roman Catholic  priest, flagellating himself to sexual ecstasy after flubbing a Communion  ceremony, he also states: "I can't stress enough that this isn't an  anti-Christian piece."  </P> <P> Performance artist Rosenthal said, "He puts himself on the line morally and  politically. His pieces are strong, but they're never a lecture. As a gay man,  he feels threatened by religious fanatics and others who would suppress him. He  has a fearlessness for confronting hard issues."  </P> <P> York's use of complex and clashing currents in his work is consistent, even  when it means disturbing his audience and friends. He freely admits that his  1989 show, "Blackout," was "very sacrilegious and upset a lot of people." In  response to "Meet the Mormons," which York, targeting the Mormon Church,  performed last year with Robert Daniels at Highways, one letter writer to The  Times condemned the show for "attacking prejudice with prejudice."  </P> <P> Frosti, York's pal since high school, said he was very offended by it, and told  York as much. "I knew that Curtis was coming from deep personal pain when he  did that show, but the Mormon Church as a whole shouldn't have been held  responsible for some of his terrible experiences. Individuals should have. We  were both raised in that religion. He had bad experiences; I didn't."  </P> <P> But, York reveals that after staging "Meet the Mormons" he went through "a  forgiveness process. I forgave the Mormons I knew growing up, and I forgave  myself." In many ways, that performance was the catalyst for "The United States  of Christ."  </P> <P> Another was Frosti's research, triggered by his involvement in the pro-choice  movement, into Roman Catholic Church history. Meanwhile, York had been  performing in others' pieces, notably John Fleck's "Blessed Are All the Little  Fishes" and the Peter Brosius/Dennis Cooper/Ishmael Houston-Jones work, "The  Undead" (at the Mark Taper Forum's 1989 Taper Lab and planned for the Los  Angeles Festival in September).  </P> <P> "I was incredibly busy," York said, "but the ideas emerging out of Frosti's  research demanded to be played out before an audience." Delving into Vatican  history as a model of what happens when a religious institution assumes the  power of the state, Frosti found useful material in books such as "Vicars of  Christ: The Dark Side of the Papacy" by ex-priest Peter De Rosa and "Outline of  Ecclesiastical History" by B.H. Roberts.  </P> <P> A theatrical strategy emerged from the research, which was to draw parallels  (through various characters York portrayed) between past and present. So such  episodes as the Catholic involvement in the Inquisition, or the Vatican's  ability to tax many of the royal courts of Europe, are interwoven with American  Christian fundamentalist efforts to institutionalize school prayer, ban books  or make abortion illegal.  </P> <P> Why focus on Catholicism? "We're artists in the Western tradition," said York,  "and the Catholic Church has been a powerful political force in the West. It's  what we know. But there's a broader concern, and that is to show that it's not  healthy for people to practice religious fascism and not know history.  </P> <P> "I was raised a Christian and with Christianity's humane morals, and I'm glad  of that. It would be cool if everyone followed the Golden Rule -- 'Do unto  others . . . ' -- which is what the faith comes down to. But when one's beliefs  cross over from personal choices to attempts to influence others' choices, that  is going too far."  </P> <P> When York added that "no one should be prevented from practicing their  religion," he meant this in a personal way. As a witch and follower of the  Wicca faith, an earth-based religion, he is cognizant of the legacy of the  persecution of witches by more traditional religions. "Nothing more could be  done to my religion than has already been done to it."  </P> <P> He winced reporting the methods of torture of suspected homosexuals during the  Inquisition in Spain, France and Italy, revealed by Frosti's research. York  said the show is "including historical material that hasn't been presented  publicly before."  </P> <P> In some ways, York would like to go even more public than he already has. He  would like to go back out on the road, possibly disturbing audiences along the  way.  </P> <P> "It's not that I want to be internationally famous or anything," he said  sheepishly, "but I think the content in my pieces deserves to be heard by more  people than in L.A. and New York. I'd like to go off the usual performance art  circuit, into cities like Tucson and Boise. There are open-minded people there,  too."  </P> <P>  "The United States of Christ" continues at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa  Monica, today and April 1, 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $10. (213) 453-1755.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WORLD BEAT'S POLAR EXTREMES  </P> <P> Jamaica's Jimmy Cliff and Nigeria's Fela Kuti stand as progenitors of the  current world-music consciousness. But paired on the "World Beat '90" tour,  which came to the Greek Theatre on Sunday, they proved to represent polar  extremes of the movement.  </P> <P> Cliff -- stating flatly, "I am not a politician, I am a musician with a  mission" -- espoused a one-world-peace-and-harmony philosophy and declared that  the way to change the world is to "keep hitting . . . with positive sounds."  Cliff's loping, spirited and tuneful reggae fits the bill.  </P> <P> Cliff classics ("The Harder They Come" and the soul hymn "Many Rivers to  Cross") and newer material ("Reggae Down Babylon") all carried a sense of  hopeful yet patient righteousness, pushed to the fore by the singer's giddy  dance-mugging (described by one observer as "a cross between M. C. Hammer and  Bill Cosby").  </P> <P> In sharp contrast, Fela left no doubt that he is a politician. A forceful and  articulate 10-minute speech was almost as prominently featured Sunday as the  two half-hour musical pieces that made up his and his massive ensemble's  headlining set. Where Cliff is one-world, Fela is emphatically Third World --  he even made a point of rejecting the world-beat tag as a manifestation of  Western cultural imperialism, saying, "We don't play world-beat music, we play  African music."

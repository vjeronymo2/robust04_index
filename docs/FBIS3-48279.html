The first vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing  Committee, Yi Chin-kyu, gave a lecture on the subject "on the  current situation surrounding Korea and patriotic work of  Chongnyon" in Saitama Prefecture on January 16.    He said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea won the  most acute confrontation with the international reactionaries  last year under the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Polish price deal fails to please farmers THE Polish government, which relies on farm interests for its parliamentary majority, could face protests from farmers' unions despite a controversial decision this week to introduce minimum procurement prices and subsidise farm credits. The unions have long campaigned for minimum farm prices but it could prove a hollow victory as officials in the Ministry of Agriculture expect the government to fail to set the price of milk, wheat and rye at levels the farmers want. Feelings in the countryside are running high as real incomes last year fell 40 per cent below 1989 levels while production in 1991 remained above the average of the late 1980s. The government of Mr Jan Olszewski is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to cut spending and keep the budget within Zl 65,000bn or 5 per cent of GDP. It has already cut government spending on farm products while the increase in subsidised farm credits is below the rate of inflation. The only real concession to farmers is lower interest rates for the purchase of tractors .</p>

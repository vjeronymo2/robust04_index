			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA COVERAGE  </P> <P> Judging by the letters to the editor, some readers would prefer to "kill the  messenger" by attacking Parachini's coverage of the NEA controversy. Parachini  is criticized for posing the debate in terms of "censorship" rather than  congressmen "protecting the taxpayers" and for labeling the American Family  Assn. as fundamentalist.  </P> <P> Of course, those who seek to impose content restrictions on recipients of NEA  grants would prefer to avoid the stigma of censorship. But in 1972, the Supreme  Court held that the government "may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis  that infringes his constitutionally protected interests, especially his  interest in freedom of speech." The government can no more prohibit NEA grants  for sexually explicit art than it can restrict religious exemptions to only  Episcopalians or Social Security benefits to only Republicans.  </P> <P> And as far as the American Family Assn. is concerned, Parachini is certainly  not alone; The New York Times (May 16) called it "a fundamentalist religious  group." Its spokesman, the Rev. Donald Wildmon, states that somebody's values  are going to dominate and asks asked whether these values will be humanistic or  Biblical.  </P> <P> As a constitutional lawyer who has followed this issue closely, I consider  Parachini's reports to be objective and well-balanced.  </P> <P> STEPHEN F.

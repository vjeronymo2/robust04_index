			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Anurat Maniphan] </F>   [Text] Hanoi -- Thailand yesterday proposed the setting up  of sub-regional subcommittees as part of a strategy for success  in economic cooperation among six countries sharing the Mekong  River.    The proposal was put forward by Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak at the ministerial meeting of the Third  Conference on Sub-regional Economic Cooperation organised by the  Asia Development Bank [ADB].    Mr Suphachai stressed that the subcommittees would not serve  a bureaucratic purpose.    Their function would be to "see to it that the recommended  projects in all sectors are implemented in due time".    He said later there should be subcommittees on all areas of  economic cooperation manned by experts.    Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Burma and south China are  discussing and in some cases have started cooperation in  transport, energy, environment, trade and investment, human  resources and tourism.    Mr Suphachai said the sub-regional plans were "widely known  in the outside world".    "Responsibility rests on our shoulders to keep the momentum  of this effort and to agree to move ahead with certain projects  as soon as we can," he said.    "There is no choice here but to succeed."    Besides the sub-regional subcommittees, the deputy prime  minister proposed three other points towards what he called a  strategy for success.    Firstly, he urged sub-regional states to start with projects  that are "most feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for  concessional financing".    Secondly, he called on participants to agree on "fair terms"  for the use of infrastructure network.    "The aim which must always be kept in mind is to make this  network a most efficient means of economic development and not  an end in itself," he said.    Lastly, he urged encouragement of stronger cooperation among  the private sector.    While governments should offer the right framework and  facilities, business people ultimately would be doing the work.    Elaborating on the first point, he drew attention to the  transport sector and cited the so-called East-West Corridor, an  overland road link between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.    In the energy sector, he welcomed the shift of emphasis from  self-sufficiency to a more integrated approach.    He urged a well-planned energy management system for the  sub-  region and serious consideration of the possibility of a grid  connection.    On the environment, he expressed concern over air pollution  and marine oil spills and noted a need to standardise  legislation.    He offered facilities at Thailand's Environmental Research  and Training Centre, set up with help from JICA [expansion  unknown] of Japan, for sub-regional training in monitoring,  impact assessment as well as management.    In human resources, he spoke of Thai Government plans to set  up a centre for training in agriculture, health, finance, the  hotel industry and development planning in the sub-region.    He also welcomed the recommendation that health co-operation  include HIV/AIDS prevention and malaria control.    In tourism, he supported the idea of promoting the  sub-region  as one rich in nature, culture and diverse life-styles, and  backed the proposal for a sub-regional tourism forum.    Mr Suphachai emphasised Thailand's "strong commitment" to  sub- regional cooperation by pointing out that Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai chairs a national committee specifically set up to  oversee this development.    Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet reaffirmed Hanoi's  commitment.    He expressed hope for early translation of projects into  reality and confirmed that Vietnam supports meetings to "remove  obstacles and bottlenecks".    ADB president Mitsuo Sato said sub-regional cooperation was  "an important building block of both national and regional  development".    Countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region now need to turn  ideas into viable projects, strengthen the institutional basis  for cooperation and find ways of mobilising necessary resources  for project implementation.    The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia  and the Pacific [ESCAP] offered information assistance in terms  of trade, investment and energy, and spoke of undertakings for  the sub- region in the tourism, transport and environment  sectors.    In tourism, ESCAP is undertaking, with funds from the  Japanese government, a study of tourism development in the  Mekong River area, and plans to hold a sub-regional seminar on  the subject either in Kunming or Bangkok early next year.    In transport, ESCAP is continuing work on the Asian Highway,  the Trans Asian Railway and the Trans Asian Land Transport  Infrastructure.    In environment, ESCAP in cooperation with the ADB, is  implementing a project on coastal and marine environment  management in the South China Sea which includes coastal areas  of Cambodia, China's Hainan province and Vietnam.</p>

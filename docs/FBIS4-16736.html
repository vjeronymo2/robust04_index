			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 74 (564) for </F> 18 April 1994 compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy  and edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Boris Yeltsin on Monday met Nikolay  Medvedev, head of the parliamentary group of the New Regional  Policy coalition. The meeting was held behind closed doors, but  some sources told Interfax it had focused on the finalization of  a draft for a civic accord, a proposed agreement between  reformists and hardliners to prevent violence. The same subject  was discussed at a meeting of a working group including the  leaders of all eight parliamentary groups, also held on Monday.    Alevtina Fedulova, deputy chairwoman of the lower house of  the legislature, said Yeltsin and the parliamentary group  leaders were to consider the finalized draft of the accord at a  meeting tentatively scheduled for April 22. But she said the  meeting might be postponed if a draft taking account of all the  suggestions and objections that had been made was not ready by  that date.    IF Note: Some sources told Interfax some of the objections  were very serious. For instance, the Communist group, headed by  Gennadiy Zyuganov, protests against one of the fundamental  points in the draft, a clause in which the signatories would  pledge not to make any amendments to the Constitution that might  destabilize the political situation in the country. Extreme  nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Saturday that his  Liberal Democratic Party would not sign the accord unless  Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy Chubays as deputy prime minister and  chairman of the State Property Committee, Andrey Kozyrev as  foreign minister and Viktor Yerin as interior minister.</p>

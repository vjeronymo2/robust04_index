However, Granic does not believe that the Bosnian Serbs would  want to join the federation negotiated by the Muslims and Croats  on an equal basis. Granic also foresees difficulties in  negotiations with the Serbs in Krajina. Antti Halinen reports.    [Begin recording] [Halinen] Granic, who was on a short visit  to Helsinki, said that he is hopeful about the agreement on a  federation signed by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats.    [Granic, in English] Concerning the future federation  between  the Muslims and Croats, I am optimist.    [Halinen] The situation there is better day by day.  According  to Granic, arrested people have been released, aid convoys can  move again, and the confidence-building has started again. I  think that the great majority of the Muslims and Croats supports  the agreement, Granic says.    [Granic, in English] I think that very strong majority  Muslims and Croats support it, the future federation.    [Halinen] Granic believes that the Bosnian Serbs will join  the negotiations, but there are not many signs that they would  join the agreement between the Muslims and Croats on an equal  basis. [passage omitted]    According to Foreign Minister Granic, the first task is to  create a lasting and universal cease-fire. According to Granic,  the main problem in the negotiations with the Krajina Serbs is  that they do not want autonomy but an independent state, and  that is out of the question.    [Granic, in English] Definitely no state in the state, I  told  yesterday and two days ago...    [Halinen, interrupting] According to Granic, Croatia is  prepared to grant the Krajina Serbs a local autonomy that is  internationally monitored in two areas, but Croatia will not  negotiate on regional integrity and sovereignty. Behind the  unbending attitude of the Krajina Serbs is the support of Serbia  and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, according to Granic.  Granic says that more than 7,000 men and a lot of military  equipment came from Serbia during last year to help the Serbs in  Krajina. That is why it is not easy to find a solution in the  negotiations without Belgrade's cooperation, Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic says. [end recording]</p>

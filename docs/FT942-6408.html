			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Pace quickens in rebuilding of Beirut / A look at the immensity of the task and progress so far More than three years after the end of Lebanon's devastating civil war, there are few visible signs of reconstruction and recovery. Parts of central Beirut have street lighting. Electricity supplies are less erratic. Schools are being rebuilt. Opulent shopping malls and marbled apartment buildings are rising in Beirut's more select areas. But for the planners of Lebanon's redevelopment programme, the big heave is only now getting under way. The government of Mr Rafik Hariri, the billionaire contractor who became prime minister in 1992, has set itself the target of re-establishing Lebanon as an 'upper middle income country' by the year 2000, and of restoring its role as a regional commercial, financial and services hub to capitalise on a prospective Middle East peace. The government estimates this will need public investment of Dollars 11.7bn (Pounds 7.75bn) over the next decade and total private investment of twice that. Lebanon, with gross domestic product of around Dollars 5bn, must therefore simultaneously raise these immense amounts and the confidence among local and international investors that will be needed if the project is to succeed. 'It is a Herculean task,' says one Lebanese banker. But work is in progress. The Council for Development and Reconstruction, the state agency contracting out the bulk of Lebanon's infrastructural work, is advertising for 50 new professionals - planners, economists, lawyers, engineers - to join its 150 staff because, says Mr Boutros Labaki, CDR's vice president, 'the rhythm of reconstruction is going to accelerate'. Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company created by the government in a flotation this year to develop downtown Beirut, meanwhile, is set to double its staff to around 160 in the next two months, by which time preparatory works will have begun on Lebanon's crown jewel project to revive Beirut's commercial core. Mr Nasr Chamaa, Solidere's managing director, says the Dollars 560m turnkey project to repair central Beirut's basic infrastructure, a four-year task, should be awarded by mid-July and work begun by August. Twenty two companies have already bid for the project. CDR has awarded 380 contracts worth Dollars 625m in the power, water, transport, telecommunications, water, housing, education and other sectors. The biggest so far, a Dollars 422m deal for refurbishing and expanding Lebanon's telephone lines was awarded earlier this year to Siemens, Ericsson and Alcatel. A flush of other big deals is imminent. The cabinet last week, for instance, is understood to have approved a Dollars 300m deal with France Telecom and Finnish Telecom to establish a 500,000-line cellphone network. Letters of intent have been agreed with Hochtief, the German construction group, and local partners Consolidated Contractors Company, for the Dollars 400m rebuilding of Beirut international airport. Within the next couple of months, CDR is expected to announce the winner of a Dollars 720m tender to build two 450MW combined cycle power plants. There will also be a Dollars 400m project to revive the coastal railway, and a Dollars 126m refurbishment of Beirut port. CDR calculates its investment requirements over the next five years at Dollars 7bn, after which officials say Lebanon's infrastructure will be rebuilt and expanded. The sheer scale of the project raises the question of how it is to be financed, not least while the government pursues tight economic policies which aim to reduce domestic and foreign debt from a predicted peak of 84 per cent of GDP next year (it was 50 per cent in 1992) to 39 per cent by 2002. So far the government has won international loans and grants, mostly from Arab and other international agencies, for Dollars 1.6bn - 23 per cent of its proposed investment spending over the next five years. It is discussing further lending and aid with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the World Bank, and with France on the financing of the two power plants. No one in government underestimates the task of raising the billions of dollars still required, particularly in the face of competing regional demands, most notably in Gaza and Jericho. Part of the solution, according to Mr Labaki, will lie in varying the financing of projects on an almost case-by-case basis. The cellphone deal, and a proposed Dollars 60m Beirut-Syria motorway will, for example, be on a Build-Owner-Transfer basis. Bidders for the power plants are required to provide their own financing for the deal. Mr Labaki says the government plans to issue, for the first time, dollar-denominated treasury bills in a Dollars 300m sale to finance housing and road-building in Beirut's suburbs. But the effort is considerable and it will prove feasible, in the view of local economists, only if the government can tempt back more of the billions of dollars of expatriated Lebanese wealth it began to tap with the Solidere flotation. This raised Dollars 650m through the sale to Arab investors of Dollars 100 shares, a secondary market in which will open next month. No one knows the scale of such overseas wealth, held by the often wealthy Lebanese communities in West Africa, North and Latin America. Mr Freddie Baz, economist for Banque Audi, a local commercial bank, estimates that resident Lebanese alone hold Dollars 8bn in overseas deposits. He says new instruments such as the proposed dollar T-Bills could raise up to Dollars 500m a year from those Lebanese investors shy of taking a risk on the Lebanese pound. Some other Lebanese - and Gulf - investors are nevertheless happy to take that risk, and the flow of money into currently high-interest local currency T-Bills has contributed to Lebanon enjoying its first balance of payments surplus in the first quarter since 1988. But economic growth is currently a more modest 4 per cent, and Mr Baz describes productive investment flows as 'stagnant and timid'. Lebanese, and international investors, happy perhaps to make short-term plays on local T-Bills, generally want to 'wait and see'. The dilemma for Mr Hariri's government is that while investors may prefer to bide their time, the fate of his project for the country demands otherwise. CDR and Solidere, which resemble as much as anything sophisticated marketing machines, must prove within the next few years, that their and Mr Hariri's hard-sell self-belief is infectious.  -----------------------------------------------------                  LEBANON'S RECONSTRUCTION  ----------------------------------------------------- Committed loans and grants, May 1994  ----------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                  Dollars 1.634bn  -----------------------------------------------------                                                Percent  ----------------------------------------------------- Arab Fund for Economic &amp; Social Development      12.4 Saudi Fund for Devlopment                        14.1 Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development         7.2 Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development      1.8 Islamic Development Bank                          2.6 World Bank                                       10.7 Commission of the European Communities/European Investment Bank                                  16.5 France                                            3.7 Italy                                            24.7 Others                                            6.2  -----------------------------------------------------     INVESTMENT APPROPRIATIONS BY SECTOR: YEARS 1-5  ----------------------------------------------------- Housing                                  Dollars 755m Post and telecoms                        Dollars 750m Education                                Dollars 680m Water supply and Waste water             Dollars 500m Health and Social Affairs                Dollars 351m Agriculture and irrigation               Dollars 242m Government buildings                   Dollars 173.5m Solid waste                              Dollars 119m Transport                               Dollars 1.7bn Electricity                             Dollars 1.4bn  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Council for Redevelopment &amp; Reconstruction  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "LHC [Large Hadron Collider] Project </F> Presented to CERN Council"]    [Text] Geneva--On 17 December, the board of the CERN  [Nuclear Studies and Research Center] (the European Particle  Physics Laboratory), which includes representatives of its 19  member states, reviewed the final version (technical parameters  and budget) of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) project which, if  built, will be the most powerful particle physics facility in  the world.    According to Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith  (Great-Britain), who will succeed Professor Carlo Rubbia as CERN  director on 1 January 1994, the cost of this giant proton-proton  collider, which will be 10 times more powerful than the CERN's  present electron-positron ring, the LEP (Large Electron-Positron  Collider), is estimated at 2.23 billion Swiss francs (nearly 9  billion French francs [Fr]).    If it is approved by the board during the first half of 1994  (the decision should be made in April), construction of the LHC  might start in 1995 and be completed in 2002. The expenditures  concerning the project were included in the CERN 10-year plan  for 1995-2005. Pr. Llewellyn Smith said that member states might  increase their participation and mentioned the possibility of  both intellectual and financial contributions from non-members,  such as the United States now that the SSC [Superconducting  Super-Collider] project has been abandoned, which "complicates  the decision."    In fact, a few weeks ago, the U.S. Congress refused to go on  with the construction of the SSC--a project similar to the LHC  but still more gigantic and powerful--which was deemed too  costly (total cost: about $11 billion). People in Geneva  estimate that, as a result, "thousands of physicists, in  particular U.S. physicists, will be tempted to come and work at  the CERN" if the LHC is built.    France is in favor of building the collider, which will be  set up above the LEP, in the 27-km-diameter ring under the  French-Swiss border. Early in November, Russia expressed its  intention to contribute to the construction. In addition,  Switzerland recently announced that it would grant the CERN a  loan of 34.4 million Swiss francs ($23 million) for the  construction of a new building that might provide an additional  876 work stations.    Every year, 6,000 scientists from all over the world  (including already an increasing number of Americans) come to  the CERN, which has a permanent staff of 3,000. For over 10  years now, the CERN has been the leading particle physics  laboratory in the world. Building the LHC would enable it to  retain its rank and to make new discoveries, several of which  have already been predicted by theoreticians, for instance that  of Higgs' boson.    The CERN board also approved the laboratory's 1994 budget,  which amounts to 924.1 million Swiss francs, compared with  951.67 million Swiss francs in 1993.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Income shares: expect the unexpected  -Philip Coggan on a complex, and sometimes risky, investment INCOME SHARES appear to be all the rage at the moment. In the recent launch of its Split fund, Schroder received so much demand for the shares that it was forced to increase the size of the trust and buy large chunks of the other classes of share itself. The popularity of income shares is largely due to falling interest rates. With returns from building societies more than halved over the last two and a half years, investors are on the lookout for any product which can offer an above-average rate. Holding the shares tax-free within a personal equity plan (the Schroder shares yield 8 per cent after charges) puts the icing on the cake. But income shares can be complex instruments and investors need to consider the risks carefully before buying. Income shares receive all the dividend income of a particular investment trust. Because they constitute only part of the capital of the trust, the yield on each share can be much higher than on a conventional trust share. There is a catch. In return for taking first claim on the trust's income, holders allow other classes of share (usually zero dividend shares) to have prior claim on a trust's capital. Thus the danger for a private investor is to concentrate purely on the current yield offered by an income share. Very often the shares will have a set repayment value - which will often be less than the current price, and in some cases, such as Contra-Cyclical, will be virtually zero. What normally happens is that, in the early years of the trust, investors are attracted by the running yield and push up the price; as the date becomes due for the trust to be wound up, the share price falls rapidly towards its repayment price. Those who buy such shares at the wrong time will lock themselves into a capital loss. This can also be true with the so-called 'hybrid' shares, which sometimes go under the innocent-sounding name of 'ordinary income' shares. The repayment value of such shares is not set, but dependent on what is left after repaying the other classes of capital. The value of hybrid shares can thus be highly volatile and dependent on the manager's success in growing the assets of the trust. There may well be investors who want securities which pay a high rate of income but which run down capital - income shares could be an alternative to an annuity, for example. Such shares might also be useful for creating capital losses to offset against gains elsewhere in the portfolio for CGT purposes. Remember, however, that you cannot do this with income shares held in a Pep, which is outside the CGT system. But there may be many people who buy these shares without realising what kind of investment they are getting. A reader wrote to the Weekend FT last year, complaining that his income shares in Fleming Income &amp; Capital had declined from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 4,000 by the time he received his first Pep statement. 'I may never see my Pounds 6,000 again,' he lamented. In fact, by the time his letter arrived, his shares had rebounded so he was back in profit. That is the kind of bumpy ride which hybrid income shares can provide - and not all investors will enjoy it. As we reported in January, Fleming and Kleinwort Benson wrote to investors in their split capital trusts to warn them of the dangers involved in reinvesting the income on high income shares. Income shares were unpopular for a while in 1992 as investors worried that UK companies were cutting dividends sharply as a result of the recession. The fear was that many income shares would be unable to maintain their dividends. But the period since Black Wednesday has seen a revival. 'As a sector, they have had a pretty good run as people have switched due to falling interest rates elsewhere. It is becoming a fairly fully valued sector. One has to search to find reasonable value,' says John Korwin-Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at S G Warburg Securities We asked Korwin-Szymanowski to recommend a few income shares that offered the best returns. The table below shows four shares, with their current price, the years before they will be wound up, the flat yield (the current income divided by the share price) and the gross redemption yield, assuming either no growth in the trust's income and assets or 5 per cent per annum growth. All this illustrates how complicated the calculations for the investor can be. Take the M&amp;G Dual shares, which stand at 350p. The running income on the shares is a whopping 26.3 per cent. But when the trust is wound up in under four years time, the shares will be repaid at just 100p. So those who buy Pounds 3,500 worth of shares now will get back Pounds 1,000. If you allow for this, the gross redemption yield (assuming dividends stay static) is 12.7 per cent. But because most of this return in the form of income, the net redemption yield after basic rate tax is just 2.9 per cent per annum. Even if one assumes dividend growth of 5 per cent per annum, the net yield is just 6.6 per cent. So this share, Korwin-Szymanowski points out, is only really suitable for non-taxpayers. Other shares, which have lower flat yields, have more attractive net redemption yields. One of his tips, General Consolidated, has already cut its dividend but Szymanowski thinks the worst is over and the shares are only marginally above the repayment value. So while the running yield is lower than on M&amp;G Dual, the net redemption yield is higher. Shares in Tor participate in some of the trust's capital growth, so the redemption yield increases sharply on optimistic assumptions about the stock market. Because so much of the return is in the form of income, top rate taxpayers should only consider income shares inside a Pep (and even then beware of the capital losses). Once they have used up their Pep allowance, they will normally be better off looking for capital gain than seeking extra income. Few investors use up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93). Income shares can have their attractions. But it is not a good idea simply to look in the papers for the stock with the highest yield. The expert advice of a stockbroker is essential.</p>

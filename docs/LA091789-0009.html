			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE KITCHEN: AROUND HOME ;  </P> <P> QUICK BREAKFASTS  </P> <P> BREAKFAST is one of the fastest-growing segments of the restaurant business.  What that mostly means is that more people are grabbing a cup of bad coffee and  a greasy doughnut on their way to work. If they're feeling like being good to  themselves, they might go for one of those egg sandwiches the fast-food joints  seem to be touting with increasing fervor.  </P> <P> It's a sad situation. And an unneccessary one, considering that breakfast is  the day's easiest meal to prepare.  </P> <P> One of the best places to stock up for good breakfasts is the Old Town Bakery  in Pasadena. They bake more than ordinary muffins (although they do a good job  with those). There are, for instance, the only homemade English muffins in the  area. These monsters look like hockey pucks for giants, with a dense, chewy  texture and a wholesome, homemade flavor. Half a muffin makes a fairly  substantial meal. To put on top there are wonderful homemade four-berry  preserves; unlike ordinary jams, these are filled with fruit, not very thick  and not very sweet.  </P> <P> If cereal's more like what you think of in the morning, Old Town Bakery makes  its own granola filled with sliced nuts, dried fruits and whole grains. You get  a container of the granola topped with fruit in season. All you have to do is  pour a little milk on top; it's quicker than stopping at the fastest food joint  -- and it keeps you going all day.  </P> <P>  The Old Town Bakery is located at 166 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena; telephone  (818) 792-7943. English muffins are 50 cents each, preserves are $4.50 a pint,  and granola and fresh fruit is $3 a bowl.  </P> <P> </P></p>

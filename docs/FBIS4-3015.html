			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, April 15 (XINHUA) -- UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali reaffirmed here today that the United  Nations "will not hesitate" to use force again in time to  protect the UN peacekeeping forces and maintain peace in Bosnia.    Addressing a joint press conference after talks with Spanish  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the UN chief expressed his  cautious optimism on a negotiated settlement of the conflict in  Bosnia.    On Russia's complaint that it had not been consulted on the  NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia on Sunday and  Monday, Butrus-Ghali argued that the Russian authorities had  been informed from New York before the attacks.    He said he shared the view Russian President Boris Yeltsin  sounded during his visit to Spain earlier this week that force  could not put an end to the war in the area.    Dialogue should be encouraged, but "if the UN peacekeeping  forces face risks and relevant UN resolutions allow us to use  force, we should not hesitate to resort to force," Butrus-Ghali  said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 12 April, TASS -- UKRINFORM News Agency sent a  report to ITAR-TASS about Ukrainian frontierguards showing  vigilance on borders with Russia and Belarus. "Units of the  State Committee for State Border Protection reliably guard  Ukrainian borders," the report says.    The report notes that in the first months of the new year  Ukrainian frontierguards in interaction with custom offices and  the interior bodies prevented the smuggling out of Ukraine of  various products surpassing five times last year's indexes.  They prevented the smuggling of nearly 5 kg of gold, 15 kg of  platinum and alloys, 12 kg of silver, 339 tonnes of rare earth  metals and 81 articles of antiques. More than 90 per cent of  this contraband was arrested on the stretches of the state  borders with Belarus and Russia. Certain "transparency" of  frontiers is taken advantage of by smugglers, UKRINFORM notes.    Skilfully manoeuvring mobile units and supported by  aviation,  frontierguards control 1,500 roads and paths leading to former  union republics, the Ukrainian news agency notes. At the same  time commandos specialising on contraband become more active.  They cross the border, try to bribe frontierguards or put them  to pressure.</p>

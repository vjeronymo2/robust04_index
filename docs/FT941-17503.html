			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Sexy, daring and dramatic - Theatre in Europe A journalist once asked de Gaulle to name the three greatest European writers. 'Dante, Goethe - and Chateaubriand', came the reply. 'What] Not Shakespeare?' exclaimed the journalist. 'But you asked for European writers', said de Gaulle. It is that great divide which makes European theatre an exotic, heady experience for us English. It grows out of different roots; its future will be different. It is multi-cultural and multi-lingual. Keynotes are high stylisation, boldly revised texts, surreal, post-modern settings. Intellectual debate on stage is sexy, daring - dramatic gods are figures like Sartre and Brecht. The results can be dazzling, or dire. Ironically, it is an American, director Bob Wilson, now working in Paris, who towers over Europe's stages. Wilson's genius is to turn tradition upside down, extracting the mythic essence of a piece through a contemporary, minimalist aesthetic all his own. This year he fixes on two very traditional areas. In April, he stages Grimm's fairy tales in Munich; in June he directs two Noh operas in Florence. Both are tightly-controlled art forms, for which his brand of chill artifice - jagged sets; miming, cardboard characters; jangling tunes - offers exciting possibilities. Vintage Wilson - musicals The Black Rider (an update of William Tell), and Alice in Wonderland - will be revived at Hamburg's Thalia Theatre. Both mix high tech razzle-dazzle with nursery rhyme soulfulness, and confirm Wilson as a star entertainer. In Europe, the musical, with its roots in cabaret and Brecht, has an intellectual respectability which attracts pioneering directors. In the 1980s, Germany's prophet of surreal aesthetics, Gunter Kramer, produced a legendary steel-and-neon Threepenny Opera at Cologne which influenced all subsequent productions. This New Year Cologne's extravaganza is Kramer's Anatevka, a radical revision of Fiddler on the Roof. The Vienna Burgtheater's New Year show is The Caucasian Chalk Circle, directed by veteran Brechtian Ruth Berghaus, with her hallmark of mechanised choreography and menacing cityscapes, to Paul Dessau's original music. In June, another former east German, Katharina Thalbach, offers The Threepenny Opera in Hamburg. East European influences now hold firm sway over western drama. Big daddy at the Burgtheater is Hungarian satirist George Tabori, who directs his own new play next month. Highlight at the Comedie Francaise is Alexander Lang, formerly of the Berliner Ensemble, directing Kleist's Prince of Homburg. A good night at the Burg or the Comedie, the two oldest houses in Europe, is perfection. Across the Seine at the Odeon Theatre, the Russian season will be this theatre's most exciting foreign festival for years: watch for Lev Dodine's Cherry Orchard and Lluis Pasqual's doing Tsvetaeva's The Phoenix. Too few foreign shows visit Britain, although Peter Brook's famed L'homme qui, about the psychology of madness, arrives from Paris in the spring.</p>

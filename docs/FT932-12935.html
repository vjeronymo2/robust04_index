			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / EC backs new Serbian sanctions: Foreign ministers express grave reservations about the use of force EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday backed tougher UN sanctions aimed at ending the fighting in former Yugoslavia, but left open the option of military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs. After two days of talks at Hindsgavl Castle near the Danish town of Middelfart, the ministers pledged to enforce new sanctions which will freeze Serbian assets abroad and clamp down on traffic on the Danube and in the Adriatic Sea from today. The EC agreed to consider appointing a new 'sanctions supremo' to streamline the multiple international efforts to tighten the sanctions, with the UK favouring an American. Lord Owen, the international mediator, in Belgrade yesterday tried to win last-minute backing for his international peace plan from Bosnian Serb leaders. At the end of his five-day diplomatic shuttle around the Balkans, Lord Owen cautioned that the fate of the Serbian people hung on the acceptance of the plan, which divides Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. If Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, rejects the proposed maps, more sanctions will go into force in Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro, at midnight New York time today. Deputies to the Bosnian Serb assembly last night debated whether to accept the peace plan. In the 11th-hour meeting, a shaken Mr Karadzic warned deputies in the frontier town of Bjelina that the international community would impose sanctions and was also likely to bombard Serb-held parts of Bosnia. An often stammering Mr Karadzic asked deputies if they were 'prepared to wage war against the entire world' if they failed to back the plan. Croats again fought Moslems, their former allies in several towns in central Bosnia despite an organised ceasefire. The EC ministers expressed grave reservations about using force against the Bosnian Serbs because of unpredictable consequences and the risk of disrupting the United Nations humanitarian effort. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said: 'We could pass the point of no return.' The UK, however, appeared to cross a psychological line on Saturday when UK officials said Britain was prepared to use force if necessary to protect 150 Canadian troops engaged in humanitarian operations in Srebrenica. UK officials have said they expect a senior US envoy to arrive in Europe for consultations on possible military options. But Mr Hurd said he did not expect 'a cut and dried plan' and said UK support would depend on its concerns about the use of force being met satisfactorily. France, along with other EC members, stressed that the use of force required UN backing.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHUNG AND BRANDO  </P> <P> I always knew that TV's Connie Chung was a lightweight, and her interview with  Marlon Brando last Saturday proved it. It was like a teeny-bopper journalist  asking questions of a rock idol. She was weak and obviously intimidated.  </P> <P> Brando's arrogance, his jerklike acting and his demeaning of his profession  made him less than a riveting interviewee. But wouldn't a Mike Wallace or a Sam  Donaldson or a Barbara Walters have challenged him -- and given us more of an  insight into this very private and talented man?  </P> <P> HAL ROTHBERG, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

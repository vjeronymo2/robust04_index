			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Live telephone relay between Vilvoorde studio and Boudewijn </F> Van Spilbeeck on the plane from Kigali to Nairobi]    [Excerpt] [Announcer Verstraeten] We come back for a  moment on the situation in Rwanda. We are in direct contact  with our reporter Boudewijn Van Spilbeeck, who is on a plane  that is shuttling between Kigali and Nairobi. So, Boudewijn,  you have left the Rwandan capital. Why? Has the situation  become too dangerous?    [Van Spilbeeck] Well yes, Danny. We have just landed in  Nairobi and indeed, the situation in Kigali has become very  tense and has made the evacuation gain momentum. This morning  around 1030, the Rwandan troups installed two multiple rocket  launchers [Stalin orgels] right at the entrance of the airport,  some 150 meters from the airport building. They have fired a  couple of rounds with these rocket launchers toward a hill a few  kilometers away where the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] was  located. They are very impressive rounds, up to eight rockets  at a time. There was the risk that the RPF would return fire  and consequently hit the airport building, the runway, or the  planes.    The Belgians then warned the Rwandans that they would  destroy  the position if one more shot was fired by the Rwandans. The  Rwandan soldiers did fire one more shot. The Belgians then  fired a couple of rounds with a heavy machine gun mounted on a  tank. Immediately thereafter the planes that could, left. One  Belgian C-130 was ready to leave and took as many people as  possible on board; a Spanish C- 130 stood ready and another two  C-130s were approaching. I went on the first C-130 that skimmed  over the military camp near the airport to avoid antiaircraft  missiles and then suddenly went up in the sky. We could then  see from the plane that on the way to the east thousands of  Rwandan people, packed with their belongings, were fleeing  Kigali.    [Verstraeten] They are running because the rebel army is in  town and the battle with the Rwandan Army can burst out any  moment.    [Van Spilbeeck] Yes, Danny. The situation in town has  become untenable for many people. The RPF continues to close in  from the north, along the east side of the town, toward the  south. The RPF has already taken positions in the southwest of  the old city, by which the Rwandan army in town is becoming more  encircled.    Also the fact that the lines of the Rwandan army had  retreated just up to the airport building is a sign that the  rebel army is marching in.    [Verstraeten] The Belgian Government, Boudewijn, was in a  meeting the past couple of hours on the fate of our Belgian Blue  Helmets in Rwanda, but we don't know what the results are. The  United Nations in New York seems to be waiting with its  decision. How are these people doing in Kigali right now?    [Van Spilbeeck] Let me explain that there are actually two  kinds of Belgians soldiers, that is the ones wearing a blue  helmet, from the UNAMIR peacekeeping force and the Belgians who  left recently, our paratroopers. The Belgian paratroopers are  trying to evacuate everything on the double. They needed  another six flights and it could be completed today. But  Colonel Roman from the brigade paratroopers, who is in charge of  this operation, has said that he can only leave the airport if  it can be secured completely and be controlled by the UN  peacekeeping force.    Obviously, the airport is the key location in Kigali and he  wants to avoid at any price that the airport be taken by either  the RPF or the Rwandan army. He said that he will not withdraw  his last troops before the Blue Helmets take over control of the  airport.    The Belgian Blue Helmets detachment has already taken  positions all around the runway and the airport buildings, and  Bengali Blue Helmets have now arrived as reinforcement.    In the next phase, the Bengali and possibly other troops  will  control the airport, and then the Belgian detachment can start  withdrawing, provided the United Nations in New York has made a  decision.    This morning I have been talking to Colonel Marchal, the  commander of the Blue Helmets for the Kigali sector, and he  suspected that the withdrawal, once the signal has been given by  New York, obviously, could take between two and seven days.</p>

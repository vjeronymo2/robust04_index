			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Another long march to the next hurdle: China's dashed Olympic hopes Mr Chen Xitong, head of China's Olympic Bid Committee, sought to put the best face on what must have proved a crushing disappointment for Chinese officials. In the end, China's hopes were dashed not, one suspects, so much because the International Olympic Committee delegates had reservations about the technical aspects of Beijing's bid, but because a sufficient number were concerned about its human rights record. Speaking by satellite television to a subdued nation, Mr Chen, a politburo member, congratulated Sydney, and said the close result showed that China had commanded considerable support. 'It was a remarkable achievement, which underscored the success of our open door policy and programme of reform.' He said he felt 'calm', and reminded people that he had always said there were two possibilities: Beijing would either win, or it would lose. The latter, almost inconceivable, result had tended to be discounted in the last days before votes were tallied, since Beijing had become a hot favourite, and Sydney's price had lengthened. China appeared to have convinced itself that victory was a formality, hence the shocked reactions in Beijing and other Chinese cities when Sydney's name was called. The question is what effect the setback, and more to the point, loss of face, will have on a government which had invested so much in winning the nomination for reasons of politics and national pride. An early indication of fall-out from the bruising experience suffered by Chinese IOC delegates, many of them Communist party officials unused to the free-for-all of a democratic ballot in which the result cannot be preordained, may come as early as next Friday in New York. Then China's foreign minister Qian Qichen is due to meet Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, to discuss Hong Kong. The encounter may well be icy, since Beijing is certain to be highly displeased with Mr Hurd's strong intervention on the eve of the Olympic ballot in which he declared that China's human rights record should disqualify it from being awarded the Games. The fact that Mr Hurd made his remarks in Sydney will have sharpened China's displeasure. Raising the stakes ahead of the Hurd-Qian meeting was the publication yesterday on the front of a pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily of 11-year-old remarks by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in which he warned that China could take over Hong Kong before 1997 if 'serious disturbances' arose. At best, it would seem likely that difficult moments lie ahead in Sino-British relations as pressures increase for a resolution of the vexed argument over proposals by Hong Kong governor Chris Patten for greater democracy in the lead-up to the 1997 handover. But it seems unlikely that Chinese officials, even in the depths of their disappointment, would want to risk the accusation that they have been bad losers. Indeed, in their initial public statements they sought to put the issue behind them, and to look forward. These officials must know, however, that human rights questions will continue to dog China when it seeks to play a role on a global stage. A crackdown on dissent in the next few weeks would convey an extremely negative signal internationally, and would expose China to the charge that its apparent softening on human rights issues - it released several high-profile dissidents on the eve of the Monte Carlo vote - was merely a cynical exercise in window-dressing. If nothing else, the loss to Sydney poses a substantial challenge to China's propaganda machine, which faces the task of explaining what went wrong, after barely countenancing the possibility of failure. The People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, noted yesterday that this was the third Australian bid in recent years, and so China should not feel despondent. 'In the old society, China was a sick man,' it declared, 'but not any more.' The headline over the editorial also struck a note of defiance which was revealing perhaps of a feeling in Beijing that much of the rest of the world, and the west in particular, had ganged up against its Olympic bid. 'We unflinchingly face the world,' it read over a commentary vowing that China would not give up its goals of reform. There seems little doubt that Beijing will bid again in 2004 and, barring disasters of Tiananmen-like proportions, it will be difficult for IOC delegates to deny China's wishes a second time. What is certain is that if it does try again, its campaign will be even more awesome than its efforts on this occasion, and that would be saying something. Never in Olympic history had there been anything quite like Beijing's attempts to win the 2000 Olympiad. Like the scarcely believable times achieved by its women track athletes in recent days, it revealed an astonishing single-mindedness in pursuit of the nomination. Few national projects, including the construction in less than one year of the giant Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen square in the late 1950s, could match the effort devoted to winning the Olympic nomination. Mr Chen Xitong and his associates face an unenviable task over the next four years in their preparations for a second assault on the IOC summit. A second failure would be unthinkable.</p>

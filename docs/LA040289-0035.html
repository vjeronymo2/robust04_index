			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WAL-MART'S GREETERS MAKE SHOPPERS HAPPY  </P> <P> In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio plays a country ballad about a  "porch-swing state of mind." Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn  dogs and cold sodas.  </P> <P> Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off the small  merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says. "Mommy's got to go shopping  now."  </P> <P> Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the store. Her pout  gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets her with "Hi, Honey!" and fixes a  happy-face sticker on her hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Have Many Functions  </P> <P> Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town -- and Wal-Marts elsewhere  -- encounters such a person. The people greeters welcome shoppers, give advice  on where to find things and mark merchandise being carried in for returns or  exchanges.  </P> <P> On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for coming while  keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure there is no shoplifting.  </P> <P> The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in Wal-Mart Stores  Inc.'s highly successful recipe for retailing.  </P> <P> Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other stores, particularly at  discount houses with heavy traffic. What sets Wal-Mart's greeters apart is the  way they handle the task.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Feel Bullied  </P> <P> Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied when employees demand that  they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance, but not in Wal-Marts.  </P> <P> Wal-Mart "associates," as the company calls its employees, give the impression  that the security element of people-greeting is secondary to being a friendly  host or hostess. They appear to enjoy passing the time with patrons.  </P> <P> "I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart, and everybody in Upshur County  comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later," says Peggy Smith, on duty at the entrance  of the Gilmer Wal-Mart.  </P> <P> Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being the most  courteous employee in the county in February, speaks proudly about working at  Wal-Mart.  </P> <P> She's grateful to have the job. Other people around Gilmer, a town of some  6,500 people about 120 miles east of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are  less fortunate, due to deep staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged  slump in the oil industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not All Are Suited  </P> <P> Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited to people-greeting  duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful traits are patience and perhaps  a touch of inquisitiveness, some say.  </P> <P> Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found doing stints on  Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol.  </P> <P> One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter at the  Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Tex., fits his needs fine. After 20 years working in  the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys having less physically demanding  work.  </P> <P> The idea of manning Wal-Mart doors came from one of the hourly associates. Sam  Walton, company founder and chairman, liked the suggestion, and made it a  company-wide practice.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> VETERANS HEALTH SERVICES CUT  </P> <P> The Department of Veterans Affairs announced today that it will cut some  veterans health care services because "urgently needed" funds are tied up in a  congressional battle over an emergency spending bill.  </P> <P> VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski called the cutbacks "temporary" and said they  will be closely monitored. But he warned that unless the urgently needed new  funds reach the department soon, more drastic cutbacks will follow.  </P> <P> The department said the immediate steps being taken to save health care funds  include a freeze on accepting new patients whose eligibility depends on  available VA resources. Except in emergencies, the agency said, veterans  affected are those with non-service-connected conditions whose incomes are  above limits set by law.  </P> <P> Other actions include decreasing staff levels at VA facilities through  attrition.  </P></p>

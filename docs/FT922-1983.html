			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Union asks for check on Courage pension fund CITY regulators have been asked to investigate the pension fund manager of Courage, the brewer, after the fund was forced to write off a Pounds 10m investment in a company related to Foster's Brewing Group, Courage's Australian owner. The Transport and General Workers' Union has written to Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, asking for an investigation. The union also wants Imro to look at the separation of the fund management from the main company. The investment manager for the fund is Pyrford International, formed by the managers of Elders Investment Management in early 1991 in a buy-out from Foster's, then known as Elders IXL. Courage said that since the write-off in 1990-91 the trustees had decided to invest no further money in companies related to Courage and Foster's. The pension fund also owns the head office of Courage, at Staines, Middlesex, and part of another building but has no other internally related investments. Imro said it was considering the TGWU letter and had had talks with the Occupational Pension Board, Courage, the fund trustees and the union. It had not launched a formal investigation. The TGWU request follows the appointment of receivers earlier this month to Mr John Elliott's International Brewing Investments, which had a 32 per cent stake in Foster's. The receivers were appointed by BHP, the Australian energy and steelmaking company, following the end of a moratorium on interest payments on about ADollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) of debt acquired by IBI to finance the purchase of its Foster's shareholding. In a letter to Imro at the end of May, Mr Brian Revell, TGWU acting national official, said his union and its Courage members had been concerned for some time that the ownership structure had major debt problems.

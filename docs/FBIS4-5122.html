			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal of the Royal Government of Cambodia to the </F> officers, the rank and file, and the compatriots living under  the temporary control of the Khmer Rouge" [KR] dated 6 April --  recorded]    [Text] The Pailin region has a major economic, social, and  cultural position in the Kingdom of Cambodia. The recalcitrant  Khmer Rouge leaders still continue to occupy illegally this  region and continue to cause considerable damage to national  assets even after our country had entered the stage of national  reconciliation, unity, and peace; after our most venerated  monarch, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varman, had ascended the  throne to provide the coolest shade for all of us, his Cambodian  subjects; and after the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] had  come to power to lead and govern the nation in full legitimacy.  Thus, with the noble intention of preserving peace and  maintaining security for the people and preserving national  unity and national reconciliation, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  [KRAF] made monumental efforts and braved all kinds of  difficulties in entering and completely capturing the Pailin  region on 19 March 1994.    With a high sense of responsibility toward the destiny of  all  Cambodians, the RGC would like to make another appeal to the  officers, the rank and file, and the compatriots living under  the temporary control of the Khmer Rouge. The brothers are  asked to waste no time in finding all means to return to the  national community and join the great family of Cambodians.    The RGC always has the fate and destiny of all of you at  heart as already emphasized in previous appeals, especially in  the statement made by the RGC on 25 March 1994.    1. As a matter of fact, the officers, noncommissioned  officers, and men still serving in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge  are urged to hurry up and present themselves before the KRAF and  the competent authorities in the region. You will be accorded  all due attention and your rights, privileges, grades, and  duties will be assured in the same way as has been done by the  RGC toward the thousands of former Khmer Rouge officers,  noncommissioned officers, and men who have already awakened to  the call and joined the national community and the RGC.    2. As for the civilians who have been forcibly taken along  by Khmer Rouge leaders, they should hurry up and liberate  themselves from the claws of the Khmer Rouge by immediately  contacting the KRAF and the competent authorities protecting the  region. You will be welcomed and given all necessary assistance  by the RGC and you will receive land and houses in accordance  with the law.    3. As far as the compatriots who take temporary refuge in  Thailand are concerned, the RGC will continue to contact and  negotiate with the representatives of the Thai Government in  order to bring them back to our sacred Angkorian land with the  assistance of various international organizations. Concerning  the repatriation of these refugees, the RGC's good-will and  sincere stance is that the repatriation should proceed through a  negotiation between our RGC and the government of the country  concerned on the basis of humanitarian principles,  voluntariness, noncoercion, and respect for the right of the  concerned brothers to make a choice. Any brothers who wish to  remain in Pailin or to go to any other fully safe regions will  be allowed to do so with the assistance of the RGC.    The RGC is confident that the country concerned will do its  best to help and support this righteous cause by respecting  Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity  and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs as  stipulated in the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement.    [Signed] Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, first prime  minister    Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister    [Dated] 6 April 1994, Phnom Penh</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: Shrinkage at the top table - Why law firms feel the need to expand Like a shark that has to keep moving or die, there is a strong instinct and compulsion in professional law firms to grow. Why is this? Is it simply the egos of partners, or are there more fundamental strategic issues at stake? 'I'm not here to mark time or just collect my salary at the end of the month and leave it at that. I want to be a part of something that will be larger than it is now and more successful. I want to contribute to that success and to be rewarded for it. If I can't get those things here then I will go to a firm which can offer them to me.' This statement, by a young lawyer in a London-based law firm, points to a key management issue before many firms: the link between growth of the firm and retention of highly talented, ambitious and motivated people. To be successful, professional firms need to have people motivated to push just that bit harder and go that bit further in meeting clients' needs. Retaining people with these qualities and characteristics requires firms to have the potential and willingness to grow. There are two key reasons behind this 'growth imperative' in professional firms: the first is the cocktail of motivational drives in professional people; and the second is the need to sustain the profitability of the business. The motivation and psychological drives of professional people tend to differ from those who follow alternative careers in quite fundamental ways. Professional people have a greater need than the average person in an organisation for: influence over their own future; constantly meeting and overcoming new challenges; professional growth and development, to be able to handle better quality work and clients; recognition; and for a feeling of value. For many young lawyers the ultimate career prize is to become a partner. At a stroke many of their needs are met. As partners they have a say in the direction and thinking of their firm, and so satisfy their need to influence their own future. It can provide new challenges, and is certainly a mark of recognition by colleagues. Motivating high-quality people to remain with the firm and to perform highly therefore involves ensuring the goal of partnership is realistic and achievable. Maintaining this motivation requires firms to grow at a rate that results in a steady flow of new partners, in order to convey a sense to people that their ambitions can be satisfied. This does not mean everyone can become a partner but it does mean the prospect for talented people to achieve partnership must be evident. People understand the economic reality of life in a professional firm and that new partners can be appointed only if the business is growing. Hence if people do not see growth, they will seek alternative routes to meet their needs. The second explanation for the growth imperative is economic. The profitability of most medium to large law firms depends upon having an appropriate economic relationship between equity partners and other fee-earners, namely its leverage. If the leverage falls below a certain level then, assuming other economic variables remain constant, profitability will fall. Maintaining a steady flow of new partners requires a firm to increase the volume of work to sustain more partners without diluting earnings of the existing partners. For example, a firm with a leverage of 4 to 1 has to ensure that for each new partner it brings into the equity there is enough work to sustain another person at a partner rate and four other fee-earners. Each new partner must generate sufficient work to maintain the firm's leverage. Hence one way to reconcile the need to ensure people are motivated (by seeing that the 'ultimate prize' can be realised) with the need to sustain the economics of the business is to maintain a reasonable growth rate. This is not, however, an option available to every firm, and many will find growth very difficult to achieve in the latter 1990s. An analysis of growth rates of the medium to large firms across the country highlights quite stark differences between the top nine City-based firms and the rest, and also between the firms in the top nine. Growth rates among these nine firms over the last three years vary between 5 and 32 per cent. What are the implications for firms that cannot sustain growth comparable to the competition's? Are they to accept that holding on to good people is almost impossible and that they are likely lose their best people? This is not an option for any firm wanting to remain competitive. Even if the value of work is unlikely to grow much in the short term, the principles governing the motivational needs of people still apply. One short-term option for firms facing limited growth is to ensure there is a real sense of momentum in the firm so people can see a realistic possibility of advancement to partnership. This requires a rigorous approach by the firm to the performance criteria for both potential and existing partners. Firms need to engineer more room in the partnership to allow people with the requisite qualities to become a partner, to the extent of requiring existing partners to leave. Moreover, the ability to expand the business through increased revenue from existing clients or through attracting new clients must become a mandatory skill for every partner. Another option for non-growth firms is to enhance the effectiveness of the organisation itself. It needs to provide people with an environment in which they can satisfy their motivational drivers without achieving partnership. Achieving this requires a further, mandatory ability among partners - to provide high levels of leadership coupled with an ability to manage people more effectively than is the case among most professionals today. In a period of intense competition, when attracting and retaining high-quality people is so important, it is essential that firms achieve rates of growth equal to or above the average for those in their group. If they cannot achieve the growth required then partners will need to change their management style in a fundamental way. If they cannot do either, they run the risk that their most talented people will be attracted elsewhere and that this will trigger a steady decline in their fortunes.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 11 Jun (EFE) -- The  Ibero-American countries yesterday committed themselves in  Cartagena to step up measures to control and oversee the  production, marketing, and possession of chemicals used to  process drugs.    Justice ministers and judicial authorities meeting in  Cartagena de Indias announced that they will reinforce  surveillance operations at port, aerial, and ground terminals  and will register all producers of basic chemicals to prevent  their use by drug trafficking rings.    The "final document," which was signed in this city in the  Colombian-Caribbean region, contains the main recommendations  made to the governments. Its authors think that it is necessary  to keep track of the chemicals and for its importers to confirm  their final destination. Products such as caustic soda and  ether, among others, are indispensable for the production of  drugs such as cocaine and heroin.    As for money "laundering," the ministers reaffirmed the  advisability of introducing in the legislation of Ibero-American  countries provisions to facilitate investigations regarding the  origin of capital when there are signs that they are the product  of illegal drug trafficking. It also recommends cooperation  systems to allow measures to follow up on such capital and the  adoption of measures to intervene and, should it be necessary,  to seize them.    Among the "document's" recommendations is one forcing  financial institutions to identify their clients when  establishing business relations and to file documents on all  transactions for five years. They would have to advise the  authorities should there be signs of possible "laundering." The  meeting participants also recommended the drafting of a fiscal  and banking cooperation agreement against capital "laundering"  networks and the establishment of adequate procedures for  internal controls and communications.    The "final document" of the 10th Conference of Justice  Ministers of Ibero-America also recommended increased judicial  cooperation among the countries. They agreed to establish a  technical commission of experts to conduct a study on judicial  cooperation and to propose ways to update and modify existing  regulations.    Finally, the ministers called for the adoption of effective  measures to protect human rights and suggested appointing in  each country a "people's lawyer" or "ombudsman," who is  independent of political authorities.</p>

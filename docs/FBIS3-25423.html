			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Carel Boschoff, leader of the Afrikaner </F> People's Front, by Frederique Sprang in Johannesburg; date not  given: "Boycott of Legislative Elections by White Extremists"]    [Text] [Sprang] Son-in-law of the late Hendrick F.  Verwoerd, the South African president who hardened apartheid in  the 1960s, you are, at the age of 65, a leading figure of the  Afrikaner resistance, after having been grand master of the  secret society Afrikaner Broederbond for a long time. What do  you think of the order to boycott the elections issued by your  organization, the AVF [Afrikaner People's Front]?    [Boschoff] I do not think participation in the elections is  the main priority. What is important is to arrive at the  establishment of an Afrikaner nation in the existing  constitutional framework.    [Sprang] You are one of those who are demanding the creation  of an Afrikaner state. Why?    [Boschoff] Because of the right of peoples to determine  their  own fate. We are a minority in this country. What chance do we  have as European Whites to live in a state governed by Blacks?    [Sprang] You think that Blacks and Whites cannot live  together?    [Boschoff] It is not a question of the color of the skin,  but  of culture. We do not speak the same language, we do not have  the same way of living. I do not think that Africans can live  like Whites.    To live peacefully in this region, the Afrikaners must have  an independent state which they govern, just like Botswana,  where the Tswanas live; Lesotho, where the Suthus live; and  Swaziland, where the Swazis live. You fought the Germans to  remain Belgians or French.    [Sprang] But there is nowhere in South Africa where the  Afrikaners are in a majority....    [Boschoff] In the region around Orania where we have  established the foundations of an Afrikaner community, in the  Northern Cape, the density is two inhabitants per square  kilometer. Moreover, historically, this region did not belong to  anybody.    [Sprang] But there are many coloreds there and, moreover,  they speak Afrikaans, your language.    [Boschoff] Yes, but they are increasingly inhabiting urban  areas. It is perfectly possible to find a compromise with them  to divide up areas. The important thing for an Afrikaner, for a  Boer, is land. Next comes religion. We are strong Calvinists.    [Sprang] However, the government and the ANC [African  National Congress] do not seem prepared to divide up South  Africa into ethnic territories, which was the basis of  apartheid....    [Boschoff] It is not for Mr. Mandela to decide our future.  It is impossible to deny the demands of a whole people. But  these leaders must realize that the Afrikaners will never allow  their nation to be led by Communists.    [Sprang] What if the answer tomorrow is no. You are  boycotting the elections, but what then?    [Boschoff] We will take up arms. We have the power to  paralyze this country.</p>

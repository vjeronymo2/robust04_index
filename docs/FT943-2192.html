			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food's Pounds 7.6m acquisition from Hobson Yorkshire Food Group is to pay Hobson, the homecare and food products group, Pounds 7.6m for a packaging business. The packaging interests are part of the FE Barber food division which Hobson bought last April as part of a Pounds 111m deal for the food manufacturing business of the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Mr Andrew Regan, Hobson chief executive, said the move represented a re-focusing of the Co-op businesses to their core areas. 'We intend to concentrate on what the division does best,' he said, and added that Hobson expected to sell a further two subsidiaries from the Co-op deal. The final consideration for yesterday's sale will depend on the audited net asset value of the business, with a maximum consideration of Pounds 8m payable by Yorkshire Food. Hobson is also keeping Pounds 2.6m of trade debtors owed to Barber, said Mr Regan. The packing division made pre-tax profits after corporate charges of Pounds 238,000 on sales of Pounds 23m for the year to January 8. Mr Paul Haley, Yorkshire Food finance director, said the company had identified Pounds 750,000 worth of charges which it believed would not recurr under its new ownership. Net assets at the year end were Pounds 3.85m. The business consists of two sites, one in Manchester and one in Glasgow, and packs products including flour, rice, pulses and nuts. Yorkshire Food intends to close down the Glasgow site. Mr Haley said 'a small number' of the sixty people employed at the Scottish plant would be offered alternative employment.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Postal strike hits Germany Token strikes by thousands of postal and telephone workers disrupted services in Germany yesterday, as Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister, warned that the dispute threatened the entire privatisation programme for Deutsche Telekom. The minister held emergency talks with employers and trade union leaders in an attempt to restart negotiations between them, focused on the maintenance of workers' benefits after privatisation. He said he was now 'sceptical' about the chances of finalising the reform of the postal and telecommunications services before the October general election. Mr Kurt van Haaren, the postal union leader, said he expected negotiations to be resumed, but expressed little hope for a swift solution. If the dispute continues, it will put in doubt support for postal reform, including the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly, from the opposition Social Democratic party. The reform bill has to be approved by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, by June 29 if it is to stand a chance of becoming law before the end of the current legislative period in September.</p>

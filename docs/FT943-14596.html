			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Struggle for control of TV in Italy: Robert Graham in Rome surveys the battlefield as new RAI board takes over A new five-strong board yesterday took control of the RAI, Italy's state broadcasting corporation, amid a growing debate within the country over control of the media by the government. This is the first European administration whose prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, not only owns television interests but controls almost half the nation's airtime through his Fininvest media empire. The board was approved late on Monday as a result of a compromise between Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the other two main partners in the right-wing coalition - the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The members include a medieval historian, a prominent female stockbroker, and businessmen close to Confindustria, the industrialists' organisation. Their backgrounds reflect a sharp swing away from the cultural influences inspired by the left in the post-war era. They displace a transitional team, dubbed the professors because of their academic backgrounds, which was appointed last year to manage the RAI, pending the outcome of general elections and an eventual reform of broadcasting. Its mandate was due to run until 1995. As he prepared to hand over the chairman's office, Prof Claudio Dematte was less concerned at his enforced departure than that of the ill-defined future of television. 'A year ago, on July 13, I accepted this job - to act like a civil servant carrying out a transitional role at the RAI,' said the 52-year-old, Harvard-educated professor of business administration. 'The government is perfectly entitled to change the RAI. But the way it was handled was unfortunate.' President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was obliged to intervene so as to prevent Mr Berlusconi exercising direct control over the appointment, leaving it in the hands of the speakers of the two houses of parliament. As a result, the league has ensured that the board is not completely under the thumb of Mr Berlusconi. 'As a teacher of business administration, the first thing I tell students is that the shareholders of a company must entrust management with a clear mission .. But the new management has not yet had its role defined,' said Prof Dematte. So far, the government has only talked of improving the RAI's finances - the formal excuse for sacking the board. With losses of L479bn (Pounds 199m) and outstanding debts of L1,496bn in 1993, no-one disputes the financial fragility of the RAI. But a savage cost-cutting programme is under way that includes a 15 per cent reduction in staff and the ending of abuses of overtime and foreign travel. By 1995, a modest surplus is projected. With what seems a reasonable restructuring plan in place, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the government is more interested in exercising control over a medium which every Italian watches for an average of four hours a day. Control in this sense is not simply a question of the political content - just as important is the ability to shape the RAI's future and decide whether the state should retain a presence in broadcasting. 'RAI's three channels are too many,' said Prof Dematte. If changes are to be made, he argues, the government should clarify whether the RAI either continues to offer a broad base of programmes or concentrates on specific and minority interests. For instance, the focus could be on news, current affairs and culture, ignoring entertainment. Or it could operate one general channel and other specialised channels (sport, films, etc.). At present, Fininvest's channels are heavily oriented towards entertainment, presenting almost 40 per cent more hours of films, chat shows and soaps. Its news side loses money. Prof Dematte insists that any changes in the structure of the RAI must take account of Fininvest's own three commercial channels. 'There is an effective duopoly between the RAI and Fininvest, where both have been conditioned by competing against each other.' Ferocious competition in the late eighties forced up the cost of each other's stars and imported programmes. 'Whatever service you take from the RAI potentially benefits the competition,' claims Prof Dematte. This also applies to advertising, Fininvest being especially sensitive to the RAI's 7.2 per cent increase in advertising revenue when the market was stagnant in 1993. Thus the reform of the RAI inevitably raises a conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi reshaping state television and his continued ownership of Fininvest. Beyond this, as emphasised in a debate staged on Tuesday in Milan by Mr Indro Montanelli, a veteran newspaper editor, it raises the issue of the lack of an adequate system of checks and balances on government attempts to control the media.</p>

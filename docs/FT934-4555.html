			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Scots school vote is blow to opting out The government's policy of encouraging schools in Scotland to opt out of local authority control suffered a severe blow yesterday when parents at Paisley Grammar, a leading comprehensive school near Glasgow, rejected opting out by a big majority. Earlier this year Dornoch Academy in Sutherland became the first school in Scotland to have its application for self-governing status accepted by the Scottish Office. Paisley Grammar was considered a likely candidate for opting out. There had been suggestions that the regional council was starving it of resources, and it is regarded as a 'magnet' school in its area because of its academic record. In 1988 Mrs Margaret Thatcher intervened with the Scottish Office to prevent Strathclyde regional council from closing Paisley Grammar on the grounds that it was making another nearby school unviable. She acted at the prompting of Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, an old boy of the school. Legislation to allow schools in Scotland to opt out was subsequently introduced after earlier legislation had created school boards or governors A petition requesting a ballot on Paisley Grammar opting out was signed by 219 parents. The turnout was 76 per cent of the 1,630 people who received ballot papers. Eighty per cent of parents taking part in the ballot voted against opting out. Mr Tom Farrell, chairman of Strathclyde education committee, called the result 'a massive vote of confidence in the educational provision of the authority'. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish education minister, said he was confident the parents would come to recognise the benefits of self-governing status in the future.</p>

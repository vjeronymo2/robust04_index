			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MRS. KEATING'S PLEA FOR HER JAILED HUSBAND  </P> <P> In response to "Mary Elaine Keating Objects," letter, Oct. 9:  </P> <P> I grieve that such a good Christian and devoted family man as Charlie Keating  is incarcerated. After all, we all know the sacred tenets of Christianity  dictate that we "sell to the weak, meek and the ignorant" and to "memorize our  sales pitch as if it flows from our mouth like an exhaust pipe," as Charlie's  infamous in-house memo instructed.  </P> <P> Yes, Mary Elaine, your husband's mug should be hung in every corporate  boardroom in America, plus posted in every post office, police precinct,  government building, senior center and trauma clinic to remind us of what a  genuine swine (no offense to hogs), who has personally generated agonizing  lives among seniors and other savers fighting for economic survival, looks  like.  </P> <P> As a Lincoln bondholder, defrauded by my own bank, I suggest an immediate  auction sale of Mrs. Keating's house, antiques, furnishings, jewelry, wardrobe,  curios and other holdings, not to bail Charlie out, but to begin paying 15,000  of us back now.  </P> <P> TOM SHELLEY  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

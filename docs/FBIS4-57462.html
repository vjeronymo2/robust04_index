			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Freddy Torres] </F>   [Text] An old, weary Francisco Javier Jimenez, Commander  Ruperto, chief of the Americo Silva Guerrilla Front, has left  the Anzoategui Mountains where he spent the past 32 years  resisting successive democratic governments. Although he has  said farewell to arms, he affirmed that he was not surrendering.    "We are beginning another revolution in the streets, joining  the people. There was nothing left to do in the mountains," he  explained.    Accompanied by 100 men who have laid down their weapons and  are now seeking power through peaceful means, Commander Ruperto  noted that he was hopeful the people will support the Red Flag's  political program.    That organization tried to gauge its strength in the past  presidential elections by endorsing the candidacy of Gabriel  Puerta Aponte of the Popular Democratic Movement, but the  group's participation did not win it any elected office.    Ahead lies the arduous work of overcoming that defeat,  winning the support of the people, and facing the big party  machines in an area the group does not control and which it is  entering without significant changes in its language, which  remains orthodox.    The guerrilla represents a superseded phase that kept  activists apart from "the masses," Commander Ruperto  acknowledged.    The guerrilla chief does not deny that the leader of the  Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, financed the Venezuelan  guerrillas, at least during its most active years. "We did  receive economic assistance when we were MIR [Movement of the  Revolutionary Left], but that has not been the case for many  years. At any rate, we are deeply grateful for that aid.    The Front took its name from Americo Silva, a guerrilla  killed in Guayana in 1971 in a clash with the National Guard.  Its operations center was in Anzoategui and Sucre States.    Another member of the group is well-known Commander Gabriel  Puerta Aponte, who has a long history of armed struggle. It is  he who influenced the group's decision to demobilize the armed  Red Flag groups and engage in political activities in the  streets.    Commander Ruperto said the decision to abandon the armed  struggle was made in response to the different political  conditions under the President Rafael Caldera administration.    The guerrilla leader, who said he spent his life fighting,  reading, and preaching a revolution during his 32 years in the  mountains, notes that with President Caldera, the pioneer of the  peace policy of the 1970's, there is a new political picture.    As an example he mentioned President Caldera's dismissal of  charges against the officers who participated in the two coup  attempts.    Commander Ruperto confessed that he did not experience any  culture shock upon returning to the city because for the past  few years he maintained occasional contact with it, even though  he rigorously observed security precautions and took special  care to conceal his true identity. The man, who claims to have  experience in this type of thing, founded along with Americo  Silva (1965) the first Red Flag guerrilla front in Maturin.    He has five children, some of whom inherited his ideas but  not his fighting style.    He left his wife for the guerrillas but admits that a man  and  a woman need each other in more ways than one. It was for women  that he occasionally abandoned his hideouts. He said he is a  human being no different from the rest. "I left the mountains on  many occasions because of the women, but I found my true passion  in the mountains," says this peasant, who does not think he  wasted his time by dedicating three decades to the armed  struggle.    Commander Ruperto readily admits that "the people no longer  want guerrilla actions or military coups."    The Red Flag leader now says that "the people are mobilizing  themselves in the streets in defense of their rights and to  confront the vast array of socioeconomic problems resulting from  the crisis. The struggle is being waged in the cities, not in  the mountains."    The old guerrilla leader asks: How are we going to do it if  we want the people to know about the political program we offer  the country?    He asks: Are we going to achieve that goal by continuing the  armed struggle in the isolated mountains with no access to the  people?    We will now take to the streets. We are going to come into  contact with the people and explain this program of change. Our  goal is to convince the people to adopt our program.    Ruben Gonzalez, another member of the Americo Silva  Guerrilla  Front, admits that their efforts never achieved a national  character but said he is pleased with the work done by the  peasants and workers of Anzoategui and Sucre States.    "We are demobilizing because the people are demanding deep  changes," he said. "Caldera came to power as an expression of a  desire for change and thanks to the unity of the people who  demanded change."    Gonzalez claims that the "Caracazo" [violent looting and  disturbances in February 1989 after President Carlos Andres  Perez decreed stringent economic measures] and the two coup  attempts in which Red Flag activists participated are the result  of a desire for change in the country.    "We came to make our contribution toward change," he said.  "We could not have achieved that with our weapons in the  mountains."    The commander explained that "revolutionaries do not choose  their system of struggle; it is determined by the country's  political situation."    The demobilized guerrilla commanders are talking about the  need to convene a constituent assembly to implement the  unpostponable reforms the people hope for.    They favor a judicial branch that can effectively fight  corruption. They condemn the successive frauds such as those at  Recadi [Differential Exchange System] and Banco Latino.    Even though they say that the armed struggle has not been  entirely ruled out, they claim to have joined the project for  peaceful change and ask President Rafael Caldera's  administration to promote and convene a constituent assembly.    These men, who were demobilized only three days ago in a  ceremony attended by Sucre Governor Ramon Martinez, church  authorities, and congressmen, demand that the government draft a  policy of social justice, economic development, and  democratization of society.    The Red Flag leaders deny they have any responsibility for a  plan to disrupt public order and claim that the student  demonstrations shaking Caracas are an expression of the  "people's just struggle."    "They are typical expressions of the revolutionary movement  in which we live, characterized by the impoverishment of the  lower classes and by the impunity enjoyed by corrupt officials,"  they said.    The demobilized guerrillas maintain that the organizations  fighting for change in the country cannot remain isolated from  one another.    "Circumstances demand that we join the struggle  spontaneously  begun by the Venezuelan people," they said.    Commanders Ruperto and Gonzalez made a call on other  political forces (Third Path, Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement,  and so on) to join the civic, peaceful, and democratic struggle.    "No one wants violence any more," they said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, February 12 (BTA) -- STANDART NEWS and  DEMOKRATSIYA lead with yesterday's statement of the Turkish  ambassador in Sofia that Turkey has not asked Bulgaria for  overflight rights. The press reports on President Zhelev's  consultations yesterday with the political forces and with two  deputy ministers before his departure to Brussels on Monday,  where he is expected to sign the Partnership for Peace  initiative. According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, there were no  differences of opinion on this issue. This is confirmed by  statements by participants in the consultations cited by the  Socialists' DUMA and DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS), which marks its fourth anniversary  today.    "There is no change in Bulgaria's stand on Bosnia, MP's said  after a meeting at the Presidency," STANDART NEWS writes. The  daily adds that Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov confirmed  the stand of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry that "military  intervention would be admissible only if it localizes the  conflict and does not threaten the peaceful population."  "Zhelev Inclined To Support Air Strikes in Bosnia," a headline  in 24 CHASA reads. This daily writes that at yesterday's  meeting President Zhelev handed out a draft stand of Bulgaria on  the Yugo-conflict which sets forth in eight points the  principles of Bulgaria's non-involvement: non- involvement in  the war, observation of the sanctions, an appeal to the  neighbouring and Balkan countries not to get involved in the  conflict, and support of international initiatives for a  peaceful solution. "Mr. Zhelev is inclined to support air  strikes against military targets in Bosnia only as an extreme  measure and only if NATO guarantees that these strikes would not  affect civilians," 24 CHASA writes, adding that the Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP, of the former Communists) was  categorically against the final point and demanded its revision.  Nikolay Slatinski, chief of the Parliamentary National Security  Committee, is also against air strikes. According to 24 CHASA,  the president promised to hold a meeting of experts to finalize  the text of Bulgaria's stand after his visit to Brussels. TRUD  writes that yesterday President Zhelev received a negative  answer from representatives of the legislative and the executive  to his question on whether he should offer Bulgaria's indirect  participation in possible NATO operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  STANDART NEWS reports that Prime Minister Berov was also  invited to the meeting but did not come. Instead, "he met  Russian Ambassador in Sofia Aleksandr Avdeyev, who acquainted  him with the stand of the Russian Federation on NATO's proposal  for the solution of the Yugo-crisis," STANDART NEWS writes.    The press quotes a statement by the president's spokesman  that in Brussels Zhelev will reply to the letter of the Turkish  president asking him to support military intervention in Bosnia.</p>

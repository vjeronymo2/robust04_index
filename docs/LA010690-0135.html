			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS DISCUSS IMPROVING HIGHWAY  </P> <P> City officials this week discussed developing Imperial Highway into a "super  street," with improvements designed to help traffic flow in the city, which has  no freeways.  </P> <P> Tom Fortune, Orange County Transportation Commission public affairs officer,  said a super street is "something less than a freeway but the most efficient  surface street possible."  </P> <P> Possible improvements from Beach Boulevard to Santa Ana Canyon Road include  widening of the highway, addition or improvements to signals, construction of  bus turnouts, consolidation of driveways and removal of on-street parking,  Fortune said.  </P> <P> The council also appointed Mayor Beth Graham to act as liaison in the planning  process that is expected to be completed by September.  </P> <P> If the project is approved, construction is expected to begin sometime in 1992.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor entitled "Whom Should I Tell My </F> Troubles To?"]    [Text] Comrade Editor,    My name is Zheng Meiling [6774 5019 3781]. I am a member of  the Number 2 Brick Factory of Regiment 123, 7th Agricultural  Division in Xinjiang's Kuytun. I have had little education.  Since my divorce in 1988, I have been raising three children on  my own. Last year, I planted more than 70 mu of cotton down in  the farm. After handing over the farm's share, I took home the  remaining cotton and was going to sell it to Regiment 123's  processing plant. On 17 November of last year, I rounded up  several fellow villagers to load the cotton onto a cart. We  packed more than 4,000 kilos of cotton and covered the cart with  canvas. Night fell before the selling procedure was completed,  so I left the cart in front of my house. I was afraid someone  would steal the cotton, so I stayed up all night. That night  someone came and dragged the cotton cart away. Someone told me  that those people were from the local police station, because  they suspected that my cotton had belonged to someone else. I  went after them to get my cart back. They said, "You must pay us  a hundred yuan, hand over the cotton that does not belong to  you, and pay us back the wages we had paid to the men who got  the cotton, and then you can have the cotton back. We paid 100  yuan to hire that cart." I spent two days and went there four  times. They said, "We have weighed your cart already and  unloaded the cotton at the processing plant." I toiled for more  than a month, running back and forth more than 20 times. My feet  were badly frostbitten; I could hardly walk. During that period,  I have gone to the leaders of the 14th Company to prove that I  was a member of the brick factory, I had planted the cotton in  the farm, and that I was living in the 14th Company's family  compound. I have also gone to the farm's cadres. They said, "She  has delivered her share. We told her to take the remaining  cotton and sell it." But they still decided to fine me 500  yuan. At that time, they had not given me the ticket. On 16  December, I went to the police station to get the cotton ticket,  the deputy chief told me to hand over 500 yuan. In my present  condition, I could not come up with 20 yuan, let alone 500. I  did not give him the money, and they would not give me the  ticket, and without that ticket, I could not settle the account  and get my money, and without money, my children and I would  soon die. To borrow the 500 yuan, I ran around for two days. It  was no easy task, but I got the 500 yuan and got the ticket, but  it said I had delivered only 3,510 kilos. My big piece of canvas  was gone too. Now my family owes people more than 10,000 yuan.  We have no electrical appliances at home. There is only the four  of us and three beds. I singlehandedly raise three students. The  oldest is enrolled in the Bayi Agricultural College this year;  number two is enrolled in Dongyin Petroleum College. Both are  four-year, full-time college students. The youngest is in his  third year of junior high. I depend on the cotton I plant to  send them to school. The cotton was hard-earned! In the seven  months from 17 April when I sowed the seeds until the time I  picked the cotton, rain or shine, and no matter how hot, I  brought a steamed bun and a bottle of water, and at noon, I  worked and ate at the same time. In July, one after another, my  three children came home for vacation. Every morning, they came  down to the farm at 8 o'clock and returned home at 3 o'clock and  came down again at 5 o'clock and would not go home until 11  o'clock. They worked till school started again. They only took  one day off. I am 42 years old. Just watering the land would  take me several days and nights. All by myself, I picked the  cotton, had them weighed, paid for them, and delivered the  cotton. We worked hard for a whole year and bought everything  with our own sweat and blood, and in just one sentence, they  fined me 500 yuan. The leader even said, "You got off easy with  a 500-yuan fine. According to the regiment's regulations, your  cotton should have been confiscated."    Comrade editor, tell me, whom should I tell my troubles to?</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: HAPPILY, SHE'S DRIVEN TO MEMORIES  </P> <P> I remember what her face looked like in the delivery room mirror. I remember  seeing her bouncing up and down in her Jolly Jump-Up. I remember her in that  red, checkered party dress taking her first steps.  </P> <P> I wiped her nose. I counted her toes. I changed her nondisposable diapers. And  now, I am teaching my baby to drive.  </P> <P> "Where do you go to practice driving?" my friend asked.  </P> <P> "Up to the regional park," I said. "I figure if I'm going to die, I might as  well do it in a beautiful place."  </P> <P> Ju-u-u-st kidding, as my daughter Emma, now 15 1/2, would say. Actually, the  odd thing is I don't feel frightened with my baby behind the wheel. I feel  exhilarated. There are several reasons for this.  </P> <P> One is that driving with my very own Student Driver is no more frightening than  driving with myself. Not that I'm a terrible driver. I'm fine, really, once I'm  on the road. My main problem has always been those darned parked cars that  suddenly materialize while you're backing out of the driveway. You know, those  little phantoms that are always ducking out of range of your rear-view mirror,  taunting you with, "Hit us if you can."  </P> <P> The second thing I like is that Emma driving represents a certain amount of  freedom for me. Not only will I be off chauffeur duty for her, but she'll be so  eager to get in the car that she'll end up driving around her younger sister,  Hannah. Right? My days Driving Miss Hannah and being forced to listen to Paula  Abdul are numbered.  </P> <P> Another reason I like driving with Emma is that it gives us something to do  together. It's a chance to heal whatever wounds remain from our boxing-kangaroo  days of mother-daughter junior high hassles. And I like to be with her. She's  fun. When she's driving, boys pull up to the car and wave.  </P> <P> But most of all, what I love is the look on her face when she's driving. You  can see in her eyes when the light changes from red to green, the very gates to  the universe open up.  </P> <P> When she was little, we had so many nicknames for her. "Nucky" was the most  common, short for Nucknose, short for Nucknosed Nuckersucker. She hated that  one. "It's not even a common nickname," she complained once. "You know, like  Snugglebunny."  </P> <P> For a while, we called her "Sockeye," short for sockeye salmon. That came on a  trip to British Columbia when she was 9 months old. She accidentally gave her  dad a black eye by beaning him with her diaper-rash ointment jar after a  wonderful salmon cookout.  </P> <P> I won't tell you the names she's called me over the years. A sarcastic "Yes,  Your Majesty" was one of the nicest. Then there was the time she threatened to  write a tell-all biography of her mother, "Blankety-Blank, Dearest."  </P> <P> But when I see her behind the wheel, I think of another nickname we gave old  Sockeye, old Nucky, old Erma La Dooby. She used to have a rattle, one of those  Educational Playthings-type things. Maybe your baby has one. It was a flower  with a mirror in the middle.  </P> <P> We used to call her: Flower-With-a-Face-on-It. And she really did look like  that, wrapped in her blanket, with her peachy skin, her little black baby  bangs, her tufts of curls around her ears.  </P> <P> So today, when I see her maintaining an exact 25 on Spruce Street or executing  a perfect left onto Cedar, I just kind of look at her and sit back and gasp.  She's still my little Flower-With-a-Face-on-It coming into full bloom.  </P></p>

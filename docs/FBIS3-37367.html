Sergey Shakhray Has Obtained Special Status"]    [Excerpts] Sergey Shakhray, who has yet again performed a  balancing act between a boost or a fall in his career, has won  once more. He appears not only to have strengthened his  position in the reformed government, but also to have secured a  special status among his executive branch colleagues: Last  weekend Boris Yeltsin issued an edict elevating Sergey Shakhray  to the Council of Ministers Presidium.    Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent was told at the Council  of Ministers press service that the government presidium is made  up of Viktor Chernomyrdin himself and his deputies. Their  weekly meetings on Thursday are considered presidium sessions.  Now the only "regular minister" -- Sergey Shakhray, chief of  the ministry for nationalities and regional policy -- will  attend the meetings as a full member.    Not long ago Sergey Shakhray complained to journalists that  the most urgent problems, such as talks with Chechnya and  Tatarstan, have been resolved without him. According to  Shakhray, he obtained a copy of the draft bilateral treaty with  Kazan only after he publicly expressed his bewilderment in that  regard for the umpteenth time.    Sergey Shakhray, who has repeatedly said that he personally  and his Party for Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] support Viktor  Chernomyrdin, was nonetheless ready to quit unless the minister  for nationalities and regional policy was given special status,  because the situation in this area requires him to have the  broadest possible powers to resolve the most sensitive matters.    Given that Boris Yeltsin has been disapprovingly viewing  "all  those Shakhrays" setting sights on the presidential office, and  that the new structure does not envision the post of  nationalities minister/deputy Council of Ministers chairman, one  could surmise that Shakhray's days in the cabinet were numbered.  But this time around, as has already been the case a number of  times, it turned out that the high echelons of power cannot do  without this man, who has worked in the hottest spots of  political activity. [passage omitted]    It cannot be ruled out that Sergey Shakhray, who knows his  way around legal rules and office relations perfectly well, may  have himself proposed the compromise way out of the situation to  the president and the prime minister (who had said, as a matter  of fact, that he would not accept anyone's ultimatums when the  issue was Boris Fedorov). His joining the presidium -- a body  not envisioned by the constitution -- elevates the minister's  status and enables him to take part in decisionmaking on matters  concerning his ministry. At the same time, this step does not  require the president to amend his edict on the structure of the  Council of Ministers or to introduce yet another post of deputy  prime minister above the quota, as was the case with Anatoliy  Chubays. Understandably, such an appointment would only have  intensified talk about Boris Yeltsin's inconsistency, something  which does not add authority to presidents.</p>

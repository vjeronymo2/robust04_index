			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera and Carla P. Gomez] </F>   [Text] Come and get me. An alleged former official of the  Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] issued this dare  yesterday to CPP leader Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal in  reaction to reports that a "people's court" was set to mete out  death sentences to him and three former comrades in the  underground movement.    "Let them shoot me," Ricardo Reyes, an alleged former member  of the CPP Central Committee, told the INQUIRER. "I'm an easy  target, anyway, going around, leading a normal life."    A report emanating from a rebel base in Sierra Madre quoted  Rosal as saying a communist people's court was about to convene  and hand down judgment on the four alleged former CPP officials.    The three others are Romulo Kintanar, reportedly a former  chief of the New People's Army [NPA]; Arturo Tabara, alleged  former head of the CPP Visayas Commission; and, Felimon Lagman,  alleged leader of the CPP Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee.    Rosal, CPP spokesperson of the NPA Melitor Glor Command in  Southern Tagalog, reportedly said all four were likely to suffer  the same fate as Leopoldo "Ka Hector" Mabilangan, ousted leader  of the NPA Banahaw Command. Mabilangan was shot dead in Sto.  [Holy] Tomas, Batangas, on 3 April.    It was Rosal, too, who announced that Mabilangan had been  sentenced to death by a CPP people's court and that his command  carried out the execution.    "I will not be threatened by people who want to play god and  who have no respect for due process," Reyes said.    He said nothing could distract him from working for the  renewal of the rift-laden leftist movement.    Reyes is now identified with Siglo ng Paglaya [Century of  Independence] (Siglaya), said to be a breakaway group from the  Bagong Alyansang Makabayan [New Nationalist Alliance] (Bayan)  and described in some quarters as part of the "third bloc" in  the leftist movement.    Reyes, Kintanar, Tabara, and Lagman have become critics of  CPP founder Jose Ma. Sison, now on self-exile in the Netherlands.    Sison, in turn, has called them "renegades,"  "counterrevolutionaries," and "agents of the government."    Lagman and Tabara have openly declared "autonomy" from the  pro-Sison faction last year.    Tabara was captured on Negros Island in January. Blamed by  the military for a series of kidnappings in Tiaong, Quezon, he  is now detained in Fort Bonifacio.    Kintanar has kept a discreet silence since regaining freedom  in 1992.    Reyes said there had never been a "people's court" but only  a  party-appointed one.    "Their kangaroo court has no rules of evidence to go by," he  said, adding that he and the three others would likely be tried  in absentio without benefit of counsel.    The judges in the "court," he said, would likely include  Benito Tiamzon, allegedly the CPP vice chair; his wife Wilma  Austria- Tiamzon; and, Leo Velasco and Armano Teng, believed to  be top party leaders.    The four, Reyes pointed out, were the same people who had  long indicted him, Tabara, Kintanar, and Lagman as  counterrevolutionaries and agents of the government.    "We have this spectacle of the same people acting as  accusers, prosecutors, fiscals, and judges rolled into one," he  said.    Reyes said Rosal and his comrades must have forgotten one  very important revolutionary dictum: "They can kill people but  not ideas."    Rosal himself, along with several members of his command,  was  charged by the police last Friday with double murder and  multiple frustrated in connection with the killing of Mabilangan  and his aide, Alberto Remo, also known as Roberto Kumawan.  [sentence as published]    A policeman, SP0 [expansion unknown] 2 Jaime Rivera, and two  civilians were wounded in the attack.    On Negros Island, a CPP breakaway faction announced a plan  to  set up a new party and revolutionary organization to distinguish  itself from the "Stalinist leadership of Sison."    Juanito Montano, commander of the Negros Island Regional  Operational Command-Autonomous, said in a statement last Friday  that the consolidation of revolutionary forces under the CPP-NPA  "autonomous region" in Negros was going on "in preparation for  putting up a new party, its own revolutionary army and  alliances."</p>

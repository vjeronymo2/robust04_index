At a meeting with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim  today, Afonso Dhlakama spoke of the efforts being made to  prepare for the elections, with the establishment of the  National Elections Commission and the Elections Administration  Technical Secretariat. He also spoke of good relations existing  with President Chissano. On the occasion, the Renamo leader  deplored the canceling of logistical assistance to his movement  by the government, which he says violates the General Peace  Accord.    In turn, the OAU secretary general hailed the parties for  the  achievements made during the pacification of Mozambique. He  also promised to encourage the international community to assist  the Mozambican peace process in every way.    Radio Mozambique learned this from Raul Domingos, Renamo's  head of the political affairs department, in a telephone contact.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A top Japanese trade  official said Thursday [7 April] he expects Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata to agree with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor on resumption of stalled bilateral talks on a new trade  framework.    Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, on  April 15 as the two visit there for the signing of a new global  trade pact known as the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement. The  Hata-Kantor meeting is expected to produce "good results" as  there are signs that Washington is softening its stance on  bilateral economic issues, said the top official at the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry.    The official stressed the need to reach agreement by around  June 10 when Emperor Akihito visits the United States and  suggested that Japan should decide on "drastic" measures to do  so.    As for U.S. policy on Japan, the official said the issue of  how to deal with the nuclear problem in North Korea seems to be  given top priority in U.S. policy on Japan. "It seems that the  Clinton administration to date has separated security issues  from trade issues in trade negotiations with Japan but recently  they appear to have linked security issues with trade issues,"  the official said.</p>

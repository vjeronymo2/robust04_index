			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 16 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Two boats detained by  the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], in Costa Rican territorial  waters on Saturday, arrived today, Monday, at Barra del Colorado  on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast. Meanwhile, the tourists  returned last night on a commercial flight from Managua.    The capture of the yachts was downplayed by Costa Rican  President Jose Figueres, who said it was "an unfortunate  incident" that is a "residue of the more tense relations" Costa  Rica and Nicaragua have experienced in the recent past.    The Nicaraguan military released yesterday eight persons --  five U.S. tourists and three Costa Rican crew members -- who  were arrested by the EPS in the Barra del Colorado (Costa Rica)  coasts, 240 km northeast of San Jose, while they were sports  fishing.    Meanwhile, two "Navajo" aircraft sent by the Costa Rica  Expeditions tour company, owner of one of the yachts, remained  in Nicaragua because "fuel had to be transported from here  (Costa Rica), as the military did not supply us," company  executive Javier Salazar told ACAN.    The aircraft transported from Bluefields [Nicaragua] company  personnel and reporters "who had to return on a commercial  flight last night from Managua," with the released tourists,  Salazar assured.    The company executive said the Nicaraguan immigration  authorities released the tourists and the crew "without any type  of explanation."    All those involved in the incident from the Costa Rican side  said that the capture took place in Costa Rican waters off the  Barra del Colorado coast, in the Caribbean.    The Nicaraguan military version indicates that the tourists  were in Nicaraguan jurisdiction, 10 miles north of the border  with Costa Rica. Therefore, they proceeded to arrest them.    The detained, all U.S. citizens, were identified by Costa  Rican police as Ted Mucium, Frank Vanderburght, Brian  Brouckaert, and Erick and Parl Becker. They were travelling on  the yachts "Bull Shark" and "Guapote," commandeered by Costa  Ricans Luis Torres, Wally Wallace, and Roberto Graund.</p>

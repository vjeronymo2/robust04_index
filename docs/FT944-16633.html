			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: UAP slides 22% to FFr853m in first half Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday reported consolidated profits down 22 per cent to FFr853m (Dollars 161.55m) in the first six months of the year. Consolidated insurance income rose 14 per cent, or 9 per cent on a like-for-like basis, to FFr81bn, including a contribution from non-life business of FFr42.9bn. The figures included a substantial charge triggered by a jump in goodwill amortisation to FFr509m in the six months to June 30, against FFr384m in the first half last year. Mr Jacques Friedman, chairman, said the year-end results should be improved over those of last year, but admitted that they would not increase 'to the extent of the objectives we had set ourselves in very different conditions a few months ago'. He said the accounts showed a 'favourable trend in technical insurance conditions', which he believed were likely to be replicated in the second half of the year. He highlighted expanded activity, improved technical results and productivity gains. However, he cautioned about the uncertainty caused by current economic conditions, and said that the decline in the results was triggered by a deterioration of the financial and property markets. Premium income generated outside France represented 65 per cent of the total for the first half of the year. Overall, the company said there was an improvement in non-life insurance technical conditions and in the claims/premium ratio. It said worsening property and financial markets had led to greater property provisions in subsidiaries now under the control of UAP, UAP Vie and UAP Incendie Accident. Banque Worms, its banking subsidiary, incurred a loss of FFr394m for the first half, lower than budgeted and dragging down overall banking results for the UAP group to FFr438m from FFr4362m.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Honda to manufacture car parts in China Honda, the vehicle maker, yesterday became the first Japanese company to announce it would set up a joint venture to make car parts in China. Honda said that it had reached agreement with Dong Feng Motor to produce cast and forged parts. The deal is in line with Chinese government policy to develop the country's car parts industry and encourage foreign investments that will bring technology to China. Honda will establish a joint venture called Dong Feng Honda Automobile Parts to be equally owned by Honda and its Chinese partner. The company will invest Dollars 20m to build a new plant in Guangdong province in the southern part of China. The company will start producing parts in early 1996, which will be exported to Honda's Asian vehicle production facilities. The initial production target of parts for 50,000 cars in 1996 is expected to rise to 150,000 by the year 2000. Honda said that its decision to invest in parts production in China stemmed from a desire to be in a growing market rather than from a need to combat the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation. Although parts made in China will replace those made in Japan and exported to its other Asian facilities, the investment required will mean that initially costs will rise. Honda already has four joint ventures in China, but this is its first venture in the car sector. The others are in the motorcycle and power equipment sectors. Beijing has signalled its intention to strengthen the components sector, a weak link in its vehicle-building industry. Foreign car companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota have been told that to 'qualify' for entry to China as fully-fledged participants in passenger car manufacturing they must first invest in the components industry. Japanese companies are willing to go along with the policy in order to win entry into a highly promising market. Toyota, for example, is also in talks over the possibility of setting up a joint venture to manufacture car parts. Toyota has held discussions with Tianjin Automobile Industry, a partner of Daihatsu in the production of the Charade small car and minibuses. Toyota has a 16 per cent stake in Daihatsu. According to Japanese press reports, Toyota hopes by the end of this year to start building a factory near Tianjin to produce engines, transmissions and other main components for cars that would be sold domestically.</p>

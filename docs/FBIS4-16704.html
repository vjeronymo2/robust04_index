			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's ex-finance minister Boris Fedorov believes  that a merger of the Belarussian [Belarusian] and Russian  monetary systems will actually mean that every Belarussian  citizen, including infants, will receive $67 from the Russian  tax-payer's pocket.    He made this statement during the discussion "The Future of  the Russian Economic Reform," held in St. Petersburg on the eve  of the annual conference of the EBRD managers.    To quote Fedorov, the decision on the merger of the two  monetary systems reflects the Russian Cabinet's inconsistent  policies at a moment when Russia has approached financial  stabilization.    Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin admitted that by  signing this agreement with Minsk, Moscow was running a risk.  He noted, however, that Belarus had accepted Russia's key  demand for subordinating the National Bank of Belarus to the  Central Bank of Russia.</p>

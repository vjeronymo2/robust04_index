			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Peace Now leader Tzali Reshef in </F> Tunis, following his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on  10 June, by Yoram Ronen -- live]    [Text] [Ronen] 'Arafat will not be coming to Jericho next  week. Why has he put off his arrival in the autonomy?    [Reshef] We neither asked him nor got an answer to that  question. At the same time, 'Arafat and his men reiterated that  they intend to come to Jericho within the next few weeks. In  fact, we saw that the entire entourage has completed its  preparations for its arrival in the land....    [Ronen, interrupting] Their land.    [Reshef] Our land, their land; the land both of us will have  to share, as all of us realize at this point. I must say I  encountered a very optimistic approach and a great deal of faith  that as soon as they arrive things will work out, that their  dialogue with their people and our people will be better. The  atmosphere here is very encouraging for an Israeli. You expect  to arrive at the headquarters -- a quasi-military command -- of  an organization that fought you for many years, but you  encounter an administrative system getting ready to deal with  daily affairs as government ministries in our country do.    [Ronen] As you probably know, what worries Israelis is that  'Arafat and his men intend at a very early stage to try to bring  the negotiations forward, including on the question of  Jerusalem. Did you discern any such intentions in your meeting  with 'Arafat?    [Reshef] The purpose of our meeting was to convey a rather  tough message to 'Arafat concerning the reverberations in Israel  of his remarks in Johannesburg and elsewhere, and to tell him  that through such talk he is destroying the peace process with  his own two hands. We told him that the faith of the Israeli  people in the peace process and its willingness to make progress  was largely up to him. I think his answer to us, one of total  commitment to the peace process, was a kind of reaction to our  message. We explicitly asked him about the battle for Jerusalem  and when Jerusalem would be put on the negotiating table.  'Arafat categorically replied that all the administrative  functions of the autonomy would be located in Jericho and that  Orient House was going to keep a very low profile. He emphasized  that he does not want to create a crisis over the issue of  Orient House because there are no intentions to upgrade the  profile of its activities. Quite the contrary, he said, Jericho  is going to become the center.    [Ronen] Does 'Arafat plan to come to Jerusalem to pray at  the al-Aqsa Mosque, as he has said several times?    [Reshef] He did not say anything of the sort, and we did not  ask him about it. At the same time, the messages he conveyed  throughout the conversation were ones of great faith that the  process will advance. We also presented the difficulties  expected in the interim arrangement, such as the continued  existence of the settlements. He told us in English: Where  there is a will there is a way [previous nine words in English].  In other words, he believes all the difficulties, such as the  settlements and other issues, will be overcome. I have the  feeling that the very fact that they are getting a piece of land  to start administering and that they see some light at the end  of the tunnel puts them in a much more optimistic mood and they  see a rosier picture of the chances of pursuing the process than  we do. In this respect, we found a very conciliatory man who  very much wants to pursue the process. This far exceeded our  expectations before the meeting.    [Ronen] Tzali Reshef in Tunis, thank you very much and have  a safe journey home.    [Reshef] Thank you and see you soon.</p>

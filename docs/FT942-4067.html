			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper back on gravy train The copper market was back on the gravy train this week. By Tuesday's close what remained of the previous Wednesday's shake-out at the London Metal Exchange had been recouped, and after a Dollars 105 leap on Wednesday the three months delivery price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,384 a tonne, Dollars 42 below a fresh 21-month high reached in morning trading but still Dollars 140.50 up overall. Yesterday's early strength yesterday had been encouraged by the announcement of a 12,850-tonne fall in LME warehouse stocks, to 366,200. The figure was later corrected to 371,200 tonnes, but that still represented a 7,850-tonne cut - the 24th in succession. Subsequent selling was more influenced by the appearance of strong resistance above the Dollars 2,400-mark and the failure of the New York market to maintain the uptrend than by disappointment at the stocks revision, traders said. Part of the 40 per cent fall in LME copper stocks since they reached a 16-year peak in February had been due to re-location, industry specialists Bloomsbury Minerals Economics told the Reuter news agency. But copper demand would exceed production by about 155,000 tonnes in the first half of 1994. At the moment the aluminium market lacks such clear justification for its recent strength, which was resumed this week with a Dollars 51.50 rise to Dollars 1,406.50 a tonne for three months metal. LME stocks remain close to their all-time record after registering a modest rise yesterday, instead of the continued fall that many analysts had expected. Dealers point out, however, that much of the LME stockpile is unavailable to the market because it is tied up in long-term financing deals. At the same time the effects of capacity cuts agreed by producers in the US, the European Community, Canada, Russia, Norway and Australia are begining to show through. Provisional figures published yesterday by the International Primary Aluminium Institute indicate that total stocks of aluminium at western world smelters, excluding finished end-products, totalled 3.645m tonnes at the end of April 1994, compared with 3.69m in March. The examples of copper and aluminium have also been encouraging other LME markets to look on the bright side. Although additions continued to made to the exchange's historically-high zinc stockpile, that metal managed an Dollars 11 rise this week to Dollars 991.50 a tonne for three months delivery. Meanwhile, in anticipation of stock-building by car battery makers ahead of the northern hemisphere winter, traders pushed the three months lead price up Dollars 18.75 to Dollars 540.25 a tonne. At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market had another week of sound and fury, but this time signifying very little. As investment fund money ebbed and flowed in a basically thin market the September delivery futures price fluctuated between Dollars 1,985 and Dollars 2,183 a tonne, before ending Dollars 54 up on balance at Dollars 2,145. 'Many people are just standing aside because of the volatility,' one trader told Reuter. At the cocoa market, meanwhile, the September price dipped back below Pounds 1,000 a tonne in lacklustre trading. As the price surrendered Pounds 39 of its recent rally to end at Pounds 995 a tonne, one dealer commented: 'It will be hard for cocoa to pick up and it will probably move sideways for a while. . . Even if it does pick up, there will be origin selling coming in to put a lid on the market'.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium         +4,250  to  2,657,675 Aluminium alloy     -720  to     31,200 Copper            -7,850  to    371,200 Lead              +2,250  to    358,675 Nickel               -48  to    131,892 Zinc              +4,625  to  1,193,050 Tin                  +20  to     29,560  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Accountancy Column: Malignant virus plays havoc with numbers  -The profession risks losing credibility in the wake of the Lasmo-Enterprise battle A virulent numbers-eating killer bug is gnawing away at the body of British accounting, in an epidemic that threatens the profession's credibility. Experts believed they had starved out the mystery virus in a climate of reform following the harsh years of recession. But a fresh outbreak of cases in London in the last few days has raised fears that it is back with a vengeance and may have developed immunity to regulatory antibiotics. The latest manifestation came last week in a glossy 12-page defence document from Lasmo, the oil exploration company, called 'Enterprise Oil: the financial myth'. It attacks the accounting policies of Enterprise, its rival, which has launched a hostile takeover bid. The sub-title is more tantalising: a quote from Mr Graham Hearne, the chairman and chief executive of Enterprise, stating 'Earnings . . . the playthings of accountants'. A cynical observer of the battle between the two companies and their advisers might be more tempted to re-phrase that as 'Accountants . . . the playthings of their clients'. The Lasmo document accuses Enterprise of contravening UK accounting standards in its acquisition of several oil and gas assets in the past few years to inflate earnings. It also highlights a catalogue of what it maintains are financial weaknesses in its rival, such as poor dividend cover and high gearing. As in so many other areas, the details of the accusations are rather less important or interesting than what the attack says about those behind them. KPMG Peat Marwick, which provided clean audit opinions on Enterprise's accounts, indignantly defends itself and its client. Ernst &amp; Young, Lasmo's auditors, and in particular a team of corporate finance specialists at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are behind the accounting attack. While the wording has been carefully phrased by lawyers to suggest the accusations are made by Lasmo's board, both firms have confirmed that they stand by all the assertions in the document. No doubt other firms would have been equally willing to help. 'If this is the best that they can come up with, maybe I should go over and give them some lessons,' says a top partner in a leading firm of accountants who specialises in ripping apart accounts. Finding a firm of any appreciable size to comment publicly on the Lasmo-Enterprise bid is a different matter. Most have apparently had no problem in developing 'client conflicts' as auditors or advisers to one side or the other, which means professional ethics forbids them from speaking out on the subject. All this is good fun for financial journalists and other observers of business, of course, who nostalgically recall the corporate battles of the 1980s. Senior executives are suddenly available for comment day and night, while their advisers offer off-the-record 'objective' briefings and trade insults about their rivals. But it sits rather uneasily with an accountancy profession plaintively claiming that its reputation has been unfairly tarnished by critics and pleading to be trusted to act responsibly to exercise its own judgments rather than be hidebound by formulaic financial reporting standards. An unsavoury conclusion emerges from the Lasmo attack. Either Coop-ers et al is right and Enterprise has breached accounting standards - in which case KPMG should have qualified the accounts - or it has made a misguided accusation. At least one firm has therefore produced an opinion which ought to be seen as highly damaging to its integrity as a group of professionals with independent judgment. Even short of the issue of whether there has been an actual breach of standards, the back-and-forth between the firms suggests that the opinions provided by accountants are questionable and that the readers of accounts should be more wary than ever of the information in annual reports. At the extreme, that suggests we may as well dispense with the audit as a credible statement altogether. The minutiae of the Lasmo accusation are interesting, and certainly do not reflect well on accounting in the late 1980s. Enterprise bought an interest in the Beryl oil field properties in 1988 for Pounds 158m, but put it in its own books at just Pounds 9m allowing it to keep depreciation minimal and profits up. Enterprise says it used the merger provision in SSAP 23, the standard on acquisitions and mergers, which permits significant adjustments to the value of the assets. It argues this was the most 'prudent' approach. Some observers suggest that the presence of extensive footnotes in the accounts indicates KPMG was nervous about the treatment and insisted on significant disclosure to compensate. Lasmo, backed by Coopers, says it believes the Pounds 149m adjustment in the books baldly breached the standard - whether merger or acquisition accounting was used. The small print certainly shows the use of a rather tortuous scheme in lieu of paying cash for Beryl directly, which would have been treated as an acquisition. Warburg, Enterprise's merchant bank, paid Pounds 158m for all the shares in an off-the-shelf company registered in Jersey (with its limited disclosure requirements) called Tonmar Trading. Tonmar used the money to pay Pounds 158m in cash for Beryl. Meanwhile, Warburg underwrote a placing of Pounds 158m of new Enterprise shares, which it was given in exchange for handing over all the Tonmar shares to Enterprise. Warburg received a percentage commission on the placing, Enterprise acquired the Beryl assets through their transitory owner, Tonmar, which was rewarded by being swiftly liquidated. The practice is hardly the most conventional form of merger, though it appears to comply with the letter of SSAP 23. It was one of many financial engineering schemes practiced in the 1980s, and signed off unqualified by firms of auditors. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, says in a general reference to merger accounting that it was widely abused in the 1980s until advisers found it was even easier to exploit other rules in the standard on pre-acquisition provisions. He has now clamped down on both issues in draft standards. That might suggest that even if the criticism of Enterprise is valid and the tactic was widespread, it is at least a thing of the past. But the salvoes from advisers on both sides of the battle suggest accountants are as eager as ever to lend professional credence to the beliefs of corporate executives  -even when their views contradict. Take the latest statement from the Financial Reporting Review Panel last month. It 'welcomed' the decision by BET, the business services group, to restate in its 1994 accounts details from its 1993 profits. It said the original version did not fulfil the requirement of FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and loss account designed among other things to all but eliminate profit-massaging extraordinary items. BET chose to highlight in boxes both its operating profit before exceptional items, and the value of exceptional items. No such box flagged the all-inclusive figure of pre-tax profit (or, in this case, after exceptionals, the pre-tax loss). The chairman's and chief executive's statement made much of the early adoption of FRS 3, but also placed much emphasis on the figures before accounting 'adjustments'. Like so many of the review panel's previous judgments against companies in the last two years, the audit report was unqualified. And which firm of accountants provided the view that the accounts were 'true and fair'? None other than Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The killer bug lives on]</p>

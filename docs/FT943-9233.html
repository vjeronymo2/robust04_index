			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Henry VI - the Battle for the Throne - Katie Mitchell's new production for the RSC Listening to Shakespeare's three Henry VI plays, you can believe that they may indeed be his earliest extant work. The verse is remarkably regular in its iambic pentameter pulse, sentences almost always reach their close at the close of a verse line, imagery is eloquent but simply wrought. There are several striking characters - including the raging Queen Margaret, the deformed and ruthless young schemer Richard Duke of Gloucester, and the contemplative but ineffectual King Henry himself - but they lack the line-by-line psychological mobility of later Shakespeare creations. Several speeches are plainly set pieces; several scenes, too. I say this, but I have never previously felt that way while watching. Now, however, the director Katie Mitchell has mounted a version of Henry VI - Part Three for the RSC, in which she has elicited an unusually contained performing style from her actors. Gone is the searing intensity associated with these plays since the famous RSC Wars of the Roses staging 30 years ago (starring Peggy Ashcroft, David Warner, Ian Holm, Donald Sinden) and the vivid epic style that endured through to Adrian Noble's Plantagenets trilogy in 1988-89. Mitchell, it seems, wants to show this play's formality of pulse and structure; wants to hold the characters' intensity of feeling within the orderly forms accorded them; wants a style labelled 'Early Bard'. The characteristics of this style are evenness of rhythm, a generally muted andante moderato way of speaking, and a studious formality of gesture. It works - though it is close to being underwhelming. No individual performances make any special impact; the winner is Shakespeare (though his text has been stylishly adjusted, and cut), Shakespeare the historian. This staging, which will tour, is currently at The Other Place in Stratford. Most of the cast are new to the RSC, and lack Shakespearian experience. There are times, especially in Part One, when you wish Mitchell has urged them to greater dynamic variety. And why on earth has she (or her movement man Paul Allain) taught almost every actor the same contrived Slow Gesture? This involves taking two seconds in raising a formally extended arm to achieve a big pointing gesture (the way that Lapotaire does in Mitchell's 1993-94 RSC staging of Ghosts). The actors have also learnt how, when turning the head 30 degrees from looking at one character to another, to take two seconds about that too. And oh] De-dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dumb: they speak their iambic pentameters as if following a metronome. Jonathan Firth turns Henry VI's mildness into sheer dullness; Stephen Simms as Richard Duke of York is little better; and Lloyd Owen as Edward IV, despite a voice whose calm utterance is as charming as Miles Kington's, is worse. Is Mitchell telling us that Shakespeare means these characters to be history's pawns, not its makers? Maybe so, but he put more ichor in their veins than she allows them. Now and then, whenever the text suggests a more developed dramatic method, Mitchell lets some characters emerge more forcefully. (Mature Bard.) Richard's soliloquies loom out with surprising modernity. Yet Mitchell has scaled him down too. Tom Smith plays him as if he were Young Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, without wit or intelligence, lasciviously gratifying himself with his mean fantasies of future power. There is a certain amount of 'realistic' business. Richard of Gloucester has one physical shtick: he chews his finger meanly, even when it's clad in armour. The Duke of Exeter stammers over key consonants. And - in a time-honoured bit of RSC tradition that goes back to Ashcroft - Queen Margaret (the vehement Ruth Mitchell) retains some of her old French accent, especially some of her French Rs. But these devices are unusually laboured here. They stick out amid the widespread classical restraint, as if Mitchell were demonstrating that Shakespeare did not yet know how to make these characters more complex. For Mitchell, this play of civil war represents a break in style from the several domestic interiors (Vassa Zheleznova, The Dybbuk, Ghosts, Rutherford and Son) that she has recreated so finely. Rae Smith's designs are a model of expressive economy, and Tina MacHugh's lighting is beautifully atmospheric in its subdued way. Latin chants, arranged by Helen Chadwick, play an important role here. This staging makes me impatient to see the RSC put on the Henry VI plays and Richard III as a tetralogy; and though I am impatient with some features of Mitchell's direction it would be interesting to see her sense of history shaping all four plays. At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. Touring in England and abroad from September to December.</p>

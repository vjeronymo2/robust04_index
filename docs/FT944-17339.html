			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Long View: Shadow of a smile There was something strange about Dr Mortimer Duhm when he passed through town this week. He was smiling. Mort Duhm is intolerable during a bull market, but in bearish conditions he comes into his own. And you have to admit that this year he has been absolutely right. 'The US Treasury long bond yield has backed up from 6.2 per cent to 8 per cent since January,' he pointed out. 'It's proportionately almost as big a shift as before the 1987 stock market crash when the rise was from 7.3 to 10.2 per cent between January and October.' It is true, I said, that Fortune magazine has calculated this year's paper losses at Dollars 600bn on US bonds and Dollars 1,500bn on bonds world-wide. On average, everybody in the world has lost Dollars 280. But surely the leveraged hedge funds which caused a lot of the instability were out fairly early on. Why are we suffering a second stage in the collapse this autumn? 'They weren't the biggest players, even though they got most of the publicity,' said Duhm. 'There were also the proprietary trading desks of the big securities firms and banks. The bad news is still only trickling out, as with the profit warning from Hambros bank in London this week and the staff redundancy warning at Goldman Sachs. 'Then there were the US commercial banks, which were offered a free ride along the yield curve in 1992 and 1993 by the US Federal Reserve. Few of them have yet owned up to their true losses. They are what are called capitulation sellers. They hold on and hold on, hoping for a rally, but finally give up. They may be forced into a clean break before the calendar year-end.' The obvious weak point about the 1993 bond bull market, I said, was that the bonds were not going into firm, long-term hands. UK gilts were hardly being bought by British pension funds, which took just Pounds 2.7bn worth, but very largely by unspecified foreigners who vacuumed up gilts worth Pounds 16.6bn. 'And the OECD countries are trying to dump another Dollars 400bn-plus of bonds into these devastated markets this year,' added Duhm. 'It's crazy. Now, Italian government debt is yielding 12 per cent and there are scuffles in the streets in Rome outside the prime minister's office.' But, I pointed out, at least the US equity market had been holding up, almost against the odds. As recently as September 15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was only 25 points short of its all-time high, and it was still only 5 per cent off that peak. 'But haven't you noticed how artificial that performance is?' replied Duhm. 'The market leaders are being propped up by take-over speculation and maybe by actual manipulation. Elsewhere, the transports and the utilities are off more than 20 per cent since last winter. American investors have been selling some of the overseas stock markets like Hong Kong, which is down a quarter this year, and the European markets, many of which are down by between 15 and 20 per cent from the peak in local currencies. The US market is being shielded, but it can't last long.' There had been strong echoes of 1987 in all this, I said. That year's similar bond market collapse reflected the way investors became scared about rapid economic growth and rising inflation. Global economic growth was around 4 per cent, a level to which we are only now getting back. In 1987, however, the distortions were rather more extreme: the ratio of the US Treasury long bond yield to the US equity market dividend yield rocketed from under 3 to over 4, whereas it is now about 3.3. Although that is still much higher than at any time since 1987 it does not indicate another full-blooded crash so much as a more modest correction. 'You're an optimist,' Duhm declared. 'Remember that the scale of the required equity market adjustment seven years ago was moderated by a simultaneous bond market recovery. But conditions in the global bond market today are uglier. If the US long bond yield goes to over 8 per cent, then the required correction in equities on Wall Street could still be 25 per cent. 'Some of the other pieces of the 1987 jigsaw might also fall into place. The Federal Reserve could be just about to raise the discount rate again, as it did in September 1987. All we would then need would be an unexpected German tightening. 'And finally,' grunted Duhm, 'we have the derivatives factor. Portfolio insurance was another of the sub-causes of the 1987 disaster. In seven years, the rocket scientists have had plenty of time to plant some much bigger ticking bombs. We don't for sure know what they are, but we shall be lucky if none of them goes off. For instance, look at the billions in untradeable instruments in the mortgage-backed securities market, where Kidder Peabody is being bailed out by its wealthy parent, General Electric.' But a lot of this was just scare talk, I protested. There were many cases of foolish corporate treasurers caught by derivative positions that went the wrong way, but this was not the same as systemic collapse. Moreover, for every widely-reported loss, somebody somewhere was quietly making a profit. Mortimer Duhm snorted. 'The system can only learn from its mistakes,' he snapped. 'The derivatives markets are only as strong as their weakest links. They are going to be tested. So are governments, as they are pulled two ways. They know they have to stop burying the world in bonds and forcing real interest rates ever higher. On the other hand, they perceive their response in 1987, in cutting short-term interest rates and boosting liquidity, as a mistake which generated an inflationary boom and bust. The markets will have to decide for them.' He added: 'But when a big investment bank folds, or the first western country re-schedules its debt, that could be a major buying signal.' I swear that Dr Duhm almost smiled again.</p>

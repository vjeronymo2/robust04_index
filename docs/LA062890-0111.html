			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> DRIVERS TO GET SCOREBOARD FOR SPEED  </P> <P> The Ventura County Sheriff's Department unveiled a new radar-equipped trailer  Wednesday that will display the speed of approaching cars on Camarillo's  streets.  </P> <P> The speed scoreboard, donated by the Tri-County Traffic School of Thousand  Oaks, was demonstrated behind Camarillo's City Hall during the weekly City  Council meeting.  </P> <P> The school runs classes for traffic violators.  </P> <P> Besides showing an oncoming car's speed, the scoreboard also displays the speed  limit in the area, said Sgt. Bill Boyd, traffic supervisor of the sheriff's  Camarillo station.  </P> <P> "It's primarily an educational device, but if a driver is exceeding the speed  limit, he should remember that officers will be around to make sure the law is  observed," Boyd said.  </P> <P> The scoreboard, which cost $7,570, will be used throughout Camarillo starting  next week, Boyd said.

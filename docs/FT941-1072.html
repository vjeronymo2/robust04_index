			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Directors in Tinsley Robor finally have succumbed to the temptation to take some very handsome profits. Three of them have been dripping stock on to the market consistently over the past three months and, overall, they have disposed of 355,000 shares at prices ranging from 20p to 29.5p. Board members of the small printing and packaging group were heavy buyers of their own stock in September 1992 and six months later, at which time the shares remained near their low point of around 6p. Results for the year to end-March are due in June, but the market clearly is confident that the company will return to the black. SelecTV is known best for such television programmes as Lovejoy and Birds of a Feather but has had a high-profile boardroom dispute which kept the shares under a cloud. Looking at their relative performance over the past year, though, that period clearly is behind the company. Non-executive director Peter Laister has sold 130,000 shares at 33.5p, leaving him with just under 25,000. Brokers expect profits in the year to March 1994 to surpass Pounds 1m, producing earnings of about 0.5p. The estate agency business finally is responding to improved conditions in the housing market. Hambro Countrywide, one of the market leaders, has enjoyed a strong share price over the past year. Gerald Fitzjohn sold 25,000 at 73p, which still leaves him as the second largest shareholder on the board with more than 400,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                    Sector        Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Albion                     Text          10,000      13          1 API Group                  PP&amp;P          18,500      77          1 Bearing Power Intl         Dist         250,000      56          1 Casket                     Dist         100,000      54          1 Castings                   Eng            5,920      15          1 Ensor Holdings             BM&amp;M         135,000      20          1 Eve Group                  BCon           2,618      12          1 Fuller, Smth &amp; Turn        Brew           3,000      14          1** Hambro Countrywide         Prop          25,000      18          1 Heywood Williams           BM&amp;M         614,107   2,702          3* Laporte                    Chem          10,532      84          1* Lonrho                     DivI         210,149     322          1* Meyer International        BM&amp;M          26,038     142          1* RTZ                        ExIn         116,709     992          1* Sainsbury (J)              RetF          75,283     276          2* SelecTV                    Mdia         130,000      44          1 Tinsley Robor              PP&amp;P          60,000      18          1 Unilever                   FdM          124,480   1,347          2* Willis Corroon             Insu           6,945      15          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Barclays                   Bnks           4,600      24          1 Brunner Inv Trust          InvT           4,811      12          2 Court Cavendish            Hlth           6,000      14          2 Independent Insur          Insu           8,000      23          1 Lowndes Lambert            Insu          10,000      44          1 MacDonald Martin           SW&amp;C           4,950      22          1++ Parkdean Leisure           L&amp;HI          20,000      33          1 Persimmon                  BCon          43,585      77          1 Quadramatic                Eng           10,000      19          1 Sanderson Bramall M        Dist           5,000      12          1 Specialeyes                Hlth         500,000      50          1 TI Group                   Eng            5,000      20          3 Transatlantic              LifA          19,353      87          1*** Union                      OthF          12,000      21          2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

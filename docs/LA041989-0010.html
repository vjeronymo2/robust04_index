			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACISM ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> The Times is to be commended for its strong editorial.  </P> <P> We live in an increasingly multiethnic country. Long gone are the days when  predominantly white college students could graduate into a world where they  need not interact with nonwhites. That being the case, long gone are the days  when colleges could be a place where white students need not live with or study  about nonwhites. It was never right. Increasingly, it doesn't even make sense.  </P> <P> Your editorial cites a Stanford study recommending required ethnic studies  courses for undergrads. As you point out, few students take classes about  facets of American culture other than "their own." Many students experience  little or no interaction with other ethnic groups and learn little or nothing  about them in their elementary and secondary years.  </P> <P> This ignorance about others, combined with residential separateness during  their formative years, breeds much of the racial tensions we see growing on  increasingly multiethnic college campuses -- especially as young people are  just beginning to learn who they are themselves. Campus life is a laboratory  where more than academics must be learned.  </P> <P> Pro-active programs to encourage understanding and appreciation of diversity  must be accompanied by courses for undergraduates about people and cultures  other than their own. And they must be required courses, like English and  mathematics, to be effective and to round out a college education.  </P> <P> Many other pro-active steps are necessary, but at least let's give college  students an intercultural education and experience. This would be a great  contribution to reducing the alarming growth of racism in America. It's a step  we must take -- and soon.  </P> <P> JERRY FREEDMAN HABUSH  </P> <P> Associate Executive Director  </P> <P> National Conference  </P> <P> of Christians and Jews  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Intervention in Bosnia THE PLIGHT of the 300,000 people cut off in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo by Serb militias is now so serious that it is difficult for the international community to stand back any longer. More than 7,000 people have been killed in Bosnia during the three months since the beginning of the conflict and hundreds of thousands of others are on the point of starvation. Yet all efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the dispute undertaken by the European Community's peace conference chaired by Lord Carrington, or even to implement cease-fires, have failed. President Francois Mitterrand of France, who took the dramatic decision to visit the besieged Bosnian capital yesterday, clearly believed that he had a chance of bringing the combatants to their senses where others had failed, thanks to France's historically close relationship to the Serbs. It cannot be excluded that such shock therapy could have a beneficial short term effect and, indeed, late last night it appeared that the Bosnian-Serb leaders might be ready to hand control of Sarajevo airport over to UN peacekeeping forces. But it is, to say the least, disturbing that his personal initiative was undertaken without the prior knowledge or backing of EC colleagues who, just before he left the Lisbon summit, had adopted a common position on Bosnia. Even in the absence of a common foreign policy, one could have expected the French president to inform the other 11 heads of government of his intentions, particularly on an issue which demands the closest possible international co-operation if it is ever going to be resolved. One of Mr Mitterrand's ulterior motives could well have been to pre-empt US involvement in a matter which he believes is very much a European responsibility. Yet it is clear that no effective international action to tackle the Bosnian and wider Yugoslav crisis can now be contemplated without US participation. The EC has had the opportunity to act alone and has failed to find a solution. Military intervention The challenge since the very beginning of the Bosnian and entire Yugoslav crisis has always been to find an acceptable alternative to the failed policy of conciliation and negotiation. To advocate international military intervention without fully facing the consequences of such a course of action would be to court disaster. Military experts consider it would take hundreds of thousands of troops to enforce peace on the warring factions in Bosnia and even to guarantee that Sarajevo airport remained open in the absence of a cease-fire. How long would such an international force have to remain on the spot and what casualties would it have to bear over an extended period? The disastrous experience of the US and French expeditionary forces in Lebanon in the early 1980s should serve as a salutary example to those wishing to do something similar in Bosnia. Humanitarian airlift Neither the US, particularly in a presidential election year, nor any EC country can contemplate a prolonged international military presence on the ground in Bosnia for those reasons. They are moving instead towards an international humanitarian airlift, under the UN's aegis, on the assumption that such aid to the beleaguered population would be flown under conditions of at least a temporary cease-fire on the ground. It is not certain, however, that what is intended to be a more limited airlift operation would avoid all the dangers of a much more extensive military action. Neither the European Community nor Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, has ruled out the use of military means to ensure that the humanitarian aid arrives at its destination, if the fighting in Bosnia is not halted quickly. In practice, this would have to involve putting in troops at least round Sarajevo airport, along the road to the city and inside the city itself indefinitely. If such a longer term military commitment is undertaken under the UN umbrella, the ultimate political objective must at least be clear. Is it to partition Bosnia-Hercegovina into separate ethnic states or should it be to establish a UN trusteeship over the region? For the international community to decide on military intervention would be an extremely hazardous step. To do so in the absence of clear strategic and political goals would be sheer folly.</p>

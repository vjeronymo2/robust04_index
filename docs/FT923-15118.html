			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Bush says N-weapons outside US withdrawn THE US has completed its promised withdrawal of all ground and naval tactical nuclear weapons based outside the US, President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Nato said the US had informed it 'of the withdrawal from Europe of its land-based stockpile of nuclear artillery shells, Lance missile warheads and naval nuclear depth bombs'. The withdrawal included short-range nuclear weapons kept on US ships and attack-submarines. Nato says it will now rely exclusively on a few hundred nuclear aircraft bombs to guarantee peace.</p>

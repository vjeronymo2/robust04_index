			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE PLANS TO CHALLENGE ORDER TO REINSTATE PROFESSOR  </P> <P> The California State University system plans to ask the State Personnel Board  to reconsider an order reinstating a Cal State Northridge professor fired last  summer for allegedly offering students grades in exchange for selling raffle  tickets.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge President James W. Cleary said in a written statement that  the university "will pursue whatever course of action is available to have this  case reconsidered."  </P> <P> The professor, Eleazu Obinna, was suspended by the state board for 90 days for  unprofessional conduct, but the university was ordered to reinstate him in the  Pan-African studies department.  </P> <P> In its June 27 decision the board said attorneys for the Cal State system did  not present enough evidence to show that Obinna offered students "A" grades in  exchange for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets for the nonprofit United  Crusade Foundation that Obinna headed.  </P> <P> Obinna admitted that he asked students to sell the tickets on campus but denied  in sworn testimony earlier this year that the sales were connected to grades.  The board ruled that he had sold tickets in connection with an upper-division  field studies course last spring.  </P> <P> The five-member board could decide to hear all or part of the case again, said  Walter Vaughn, assistant executive officer. "If the board decides against  reconsidering the case, then that is the end of the process," he said.  </P> <P> Mayer Chapman, attorney for the Cal State system, declined to say on what  grounds the campus will ask for reconsideration. Generally, he said, such  requests question "whether all the evidence was properly considered."  </P> <P> Chapman said he did not know when the request would be filed.  </P></p>

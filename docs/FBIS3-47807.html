They also prattled that they would stage in August this year  a large-scale war game by integrating two military drills  codenamed "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens", in case the "Team Spirit"  was suspended.    Those remarks worsening the North-South relations and  carrying the situation of the Korean peninsula to the extreme  pitch of strain are an open manifestation of their criminal  intention to continue to run headlong towards confrontation and  war, not reconciliation and unity, inciting an atmosphere of  war, not of peace.    The South Korean puppets are making desperate efforts to  stage another joint war game, crying for "expansion of another  form of drill", at a time when a positive prospect is in sight  for the solution of the nuclear problem between the DPRK and the  United States. This is a sinister move to block the progress of  DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and lay another grave obstacle in  the way of the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula.    If another large-scale joint military drill were staged in  South Korea to replace the suspended "Team Spirit" it would  mean, as a matter of fact, its continuation.    Should they stage another joint military drill which would  be  equal to the "Team Spirit" in essence, though different in  codename, the nuclear problem could never be solved on the  Korean peninsula nor detente and peace be expected but a more  dangerous situation of potential war would prevail.    We are ready both for dialogue and for a war. If the puppet  clique recklessly provoked a war, we would determinedly control  them with fire.    The South Korean puppets must not act rashly, mindful that  their leading the situation of the peninsula to a phase of  confrontation will only result in their own destruction.</p>

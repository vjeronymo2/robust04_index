			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: USF&amp;G to bolster capital by Dollars 300m stock issues USF&amp;G, the large but troubled US insurance group, yesterday revealed plans to bolster its capital base by raising up to Dollars 300m through issues of convertible preferred stock. Last month, the Baltimore-based multiline insurer said that it would cut its workforce by around a quarter in a major 'downsizing' of its business. It is also in the midst of reorganising its operational structure so that its commercial and personal lines become two separate businesses with independent profit centres. The company announced a Dollars 569m loss last year, and has already cut its quarterly dividend from 73 cents a share to 5 cents a share. A new chairman, Mr Norman Blake, was brought into the company in November, and other management changes have followed. USF&amp;G said yesterday that the majority of the proceeds of the new issues would be used 'to strengthen the surplus of the primary unit, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company'. It anticipated that the funds would be raised via the issue of two series of convertible prefered stock. These would be sold to investors both through a public offering and through a separate private placement.</p>

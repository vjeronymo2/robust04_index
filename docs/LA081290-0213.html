			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: BOOSTERS BRING A LITTLE ANAHEIM TO GERMANY  </P> <P> Jason Pedro couldn't believe his luck.  </P> <P> Not only had the 22-year-old soldier received a citation for outstanding  inspection at his U.S. Army base in Darmstadt, Germany, he'd won a ticket to  American Bowl '90 to boot.  </P> <P> Sitting in Olympiastadion before Saturday's game between the Rams and the  Kansas City Chiefs, the former Cypress resident said he missed Orange County  and missed the football games at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> When his commanding officer addressed him during formation recently, Pedro  thought he might be getting a promotion. Instead, he was informed that he would  be going to see the Rams.  </P> <P> It took him eight hours on a train to get to West Berlin.  </P> <P> "It feels great to be here," said Pedro, who has been stationed in Germany  three months. "I look forward to watching the Rams win."  </P> <P> Pedro and Robert Huntly of Garden Grove were among a few hundred members of the  military sitting near members of the Rams Booster Club in the stadium built for  the 1936 Olympics.  </P> <P> Huntly, 31, a first lieutenant based the past 16 months in Germany, attended  the game with his wife, Grace, formerly of Garden Grove.  </P> <P> "My sister Jenny Kim is one of the Rams' cheerleaders," Grace Huntly said. "She  lives in Buena Park. It's fabulous to see her."  </P> <P> Robert Huntly was pleased 15 men from his battalion were able to come to West  Berlin for the game. "I think it's a great idea to bring a little (of) America  over here for the soldiers," he said.  </P> <P> While Huntly readied his video camera to film the game, the boosters unpacked  their blue-and-gold paraphernalia: pompons, horns and banners. One banner  proclaimed, "Smile, you're in Rams country."  </P> <P> "Go Rams!" yelled the boosters after queuing up to buy grilled bratwurst and  pretzels out of straw baskets perched on milk crates.  </P> <P> The boosters dress in blue and gold for Ram games. Carroll Connett wore a blue  knit cap that featured fur Ram ears. Michael Redfearn had plopped a pompon on  his head and topped it with a Rams' cap. But Joyce McHattie outdid them all.  She wore gold tights, football helmet earrings and had painted Ram horns in her  hair with gold gel.  </P> <P> Amid their cheering, some boosters yelled: "Georgia! Sign the check!"  </P> <P> "We want (Ram owner) Georgia (Frontiere) to sign Kevin Greene's check (renew  his contract)," Connett said. "Kevin is an animal. Beautiful."  </P> <P> The weather gods smiled on the Ram fans Saturday afternoon. The rain that had  drenched the city earlier in the day cleared and a California-like blue sky  hung over Olympiastadion. "It feels like we're in Anaheim," Ron Lais said.  "Amazing."  </P> <P> After the Ram victory, booster president Judy Matthews stood in front of the 90  boosters and said, "This is our third American Bowl win. Maybe we should play  all of our games out of the country."  </P></p>

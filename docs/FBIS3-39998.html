			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 24 (AFP) -- GATT tariff-cutting offers  made by the European Union on Wednesday [23 February] are  conditional upon other countries sticking to their tariff  commitments, an EU spokesman warned here Thursday.    EU officials said only 22 of 116 countries involved in the  Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks had submitted their final  tariff-cutting offers, which were supposed to reach the GATT  secretariat by February 15.    Member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade agreed last December 15 on the principle of significant  cuts in import tariffs under the Uruguay Round, which is due to  be signed formally in Marrakesh on April 15.    The GATT members were supposed to translate their general  tariff-cutting commitments into detailed product-by-product  reductions. The EU has done so but many other countries have not.    The EU spokesman said: "Our offers are based on the  condition  that the offers of the other parties are not diminished from  what was approved on December 15 in Geneva."    EU officials say they are worried by Washington's apparent  intention to reduce U.S. offers -- notably for utility vehicles,  electronics and non-ferrous metals -- in reprisal against  Japan's refusal to increase imports of U.S. goods.    They have warned that the Union might reduce its own tariff  offers if it is disadvantaged by any shrinking in cuts offered  by other countries.</p>

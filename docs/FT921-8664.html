			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Top Swedish banks downgraded SWEDEN'S two leading commercial banks had their long-term debt ratings lowered yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) and Svenska Handelsbanken were rated at AA and will now be AA-, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. S &amp; P said about Dollars 30bn of SEB's debt and Dollars 802m of Handelsbanken's debt would be affected. The changes reflected the deterioration of the banks' asset quality, caused by the continuing recession. The credit losses in 1991 stemmed from the banks' exposure to the troubled Swedish commercial real estate market. S &amp; P added that Sweden's lingering economic downturn was likely to 'cause further weakness in the property sector and elsewhere, prolonging the asset quality dilemmas of both banks until 1994, and perhaps beyond'. But S &amp; P said core earnings of the two banks before loan losses and provisions continued to be strong, primarily driven by healthy and increasing net interest margins.</p>

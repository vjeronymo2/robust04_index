In a New Year's message received by a  SAPA correspondent in Umtata, APLA commander Sabelo Phama said  on Friday the bullet and the ballot were to be used effectively  in 1994.    Mr Phama said his organisation was concerned about decisions  pertaining to security forces at the World Trade Centre. He  said political power without military and economic power was  empty and APLA should double its efforts both politically and on  the military front.    The statement made no mention of the attack on a Cape Town  pub around midnight on Thursday which killed four people and  injured others. A caller purporting to represent APLA claimed  in a telephone conversation with SAPA his organisation, the  armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, was responsible for  the attack.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors seeks greater EC democracy - European parliament address THE survival of the European Community depends on its becoming more democratic, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said yesterday. His speech to the European parliament emphasised a much greater role for national parliaments in monitoring EC decisions. 'Either Europe will become more and more democratic. . . or Europe will be no more,' he stated flatly, adding that this was 'the major lesson' of the battle to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, which can survive only if French voters endorse it by referendum on Sunday. Addressing a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the parliament, Mr Delors nevertheless addressed himself to the workings of EC democracy in a way which confidently assumed the treaty will survive. He said that 'the benign despotism' of EC institutions was over - a period in which the Commission in complicity with the 12 member states took decisions against a background of popular indifference, with a let-out clause for governments to blame Brussels if policies misfired. After an exposition of the ways in which Maastricht will strengthen the European parliament's control over both Brussels and the member states legislating through the Council of Ministers, he repeatedly stressed the need for national parliaments to hold EC lawmakers to account. 'We must join together these two expressions of popular sovereignty in a rational way, which is simple, accessible and reinforces the legitimacy of our institutions,' he said. Mr Delors' remarks, anticipated privately by Commission officials, presage attempts at EC level to draw national parliaments more closely into EC decision-making. The purpose is to develop 'subsidiarity' - the idea that decisions should be taken at the lowest practicable level. Assuming France does not follow the example of Danish voters in June, and approves Maastricht, the emphasis on national parliaments is also aimed at bringing Denmark back on board. 'We must exploit the legitimacy of national parliaments through ways and means which depend on each country,' a Commission official said. 'The idea that the European parliament is the only source of democratic legitimacy in the Community is dead, and for a long time.' Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, minister of state at the British Foreign Office who represented the UK presidency of the EC at the ceremony, also took up the theme of national parliaments' role, embedded in a thorough defence of Maastricht. 'One of the benefits of the Maastricht Treaty is that it does enjoin national parliaments and this parliament to find ways of working together,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OBITUARIES ;  </P> <P> ROBERT C. SHERMAN; SINGER'S FATHER  </P> <P> Robert C. Sherman, who for two decades delivered milk to Woodland Hills  residents and was the father of teen singing idol Bobby Sherman, has died in  Sepulveda. He was 70.  </P> <P> He died June 23 of a heart attack after suffering for years from emphysema,  said his wife, Juanita Sherman.  </P> <P> Born Nov. 28, 1919, in Chicago, Sherman came to Los Angeles when he was 16 and  worked as an usher at a movie theater. In 1943, he began delivering milk for  Arden Farms in Beverly Hills but shortly afterward was drafted into the U.S.  Army, serving less than a year because of health problems. Sherman returned to  his former occupation and moved to Van Nuys in 1951, when he began delivering  milk throughout San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Five years later, he launched his own milk delivery service called Woodland  Hills Dairy. Rising at 3:30 every morning, Sherman delivered milk to about  1,000 customers in Woodland Hills. He retired in 1975.  </P> <P> In the early 1960s he built a soundproof practice room in his home for his son,  who went on to record hits including "Hey, Little Woman" and "Easy Come, Easy  Go" in the late '60s and early '70s.  </P> <P> The elder Sherman is survived by his wife of 52 years; son Bobby of Encino; a  daughter, Darlene Mack of Hollywood, Md.; brothers, Herbert J. Sherman and  William Sherman of Oroville; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. A  private service and burial are planned.  </P> <P> Aftercare Funeral Service in Van Nuys is handling the arrangements. Donations  can be made in Sherman's name to the American Lung Assn. of Los Angeles County  or the American Heart Assn., Northwestern Division.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW: MT. HERMON'S RIBS TAKE THE HUNGRY AND MAKE 'EM BELIEVERS  </P> <P> Somehow, Pico Boulevard is a little small-townish along this stretch. Middling  traffic. Unpretentious little houses. Sea breezes. An egg store. Santa Monica  College.  </P> <P> OK, so there's a college. So we'll say this part of Pico Boulevard is like a  small college town.  </P> <P> Yes, of course, a small college town. Behold the old alma mater with its tall,  graceful trees; its wide, peaceful lawns; the tides of youth surging across the  lawns on paths that the landscapers disdained to foresee; baroque concertos and  reggae without end going out over the airwaves from the college's own FM  station.  </P> <P> Tour's over. Let's get serious: Where do we eat? A vegetable hut? A falafel  palace? A burgerteria? Mt. Hermon?  </P> <P> No question; let's go to Mt. Hermon. Very conveniently for our tour, it happens  to be right across the street from the Santa Monica College auditorium.  </P> <P> Mt. Hermon is not exactly a restaurant, though. It doesn't have -- well, there  isn't much point spelling out all the things the usual restaurant has that Mt.  Hermon lacks, starting with walls and a roof. It's actually just the parking  lot of a Baptist church. However, you can get some very good Southern barbecue  here.  </P> <P> The barbecue operation is a fund-raiser for the church, which is why there's a  list titled "Donations" instead of a price list. It's undoubtedly why the  people serving you are so sociable because they're clearly volunteering  parishioners rather than restaurant professionals. They're as genuinely  sociable, in fact, as the waiters who tell you their first names in real  restaurants are pretending to be.  </P> <P> The cooking is done in as many as three giant oil cans-turned-barbecues, which  billow impressive quantities of smoke whenever any of them is opened. You place  your order in the vicinity of the donations list, then somebody goes over to  the appropriate oil can barbecue, pulls out the requisite pork ribs, sliced  beef, chicken or sausage and brings it back to where you are, which is also  where the beans and the barbecue sauce are being kept hot.  </P> <P> Whatever you've ordered is put in a Styrofoam carton, and there are plastic  bags to help out if there's more than one carton in your order. You figure out  for yourself where to eat it all.  </P> <P> Here's what you get with your order of a dinner: meat with sides of beans and  potato salad, a slice of bread and a slice of pound cake. With a combination,  you get the same, but with two kinds of meat. With a sandwich, you get less  meat, no cake.  </P> <P> The beef is tender and extremely smoky, though I've had a report of less tender  meat at 3 in the afternoon one day, perhaps between shifts. The chicken is  moist and tender, and you can specify dark or light meat. And it's very smoky,  of course. The links are good ones, rich and slightly spicy, and very, very  smoky. The ribs are meaty and tender with just a little chewiness. And plenty  of smokiness.  </P> <P> The barbecue sauce is rather mild (after all, we're practically in church  here), sweet and sour and scarcely hot at all, but it's the real homemade item.  It's served out of the pot it's cooked in.  </P> <P> The sides are uniformly beans, meaning very plain boiled pinto beans with no  flavored sauce (they can be perked up by mixing in some of the extra barbecue  sauce available in little plastic cups).  </P> <P> The potato salad is the most variable thing. Sometimes it's the usual style  with a particularly eggy dressing and pickle relish, and sometimes it's more  like mashed potatoes with green onions (particularly good). The only dessert is  pound cake. If you want something to drink, you can buy a can of soda, making  your own selection from an ice chest.  </P> <P> There's usually one table around, sometimes apparently set up for people to  dine at and sometimes just as a place for somebody to keep the accounts. It may  seem that there is a spur-of-the-moment quality about all this, but Mt. Hermon  is serious enough to have its own telephone number (the telephone is on a  little stand toward the back of the parking lot, with the cords going into the  church).  </P> <P> Eating here is always a social occasion, once in a while spiced up by a genial  argument about the correctness of someone's views on barbecue (having been  brought up in Texas and always having had it such and such a way regularly  seems to be a decisive argument). Pico Boulevard is just a small town, after  all.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: chicken sandwich, $2.75; sausage dinner, $6; beef and rib  combination, $9.50.  </P> <P>  Mt. Hermon Baptist Church, 1827 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 450-1777. Open  for lunch and dinner 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays. No  alcoholic beverages. Street parking. No credit cards. Lunch for one, food only,  $2.75 to $9.50.  </P> <P> </P></p>

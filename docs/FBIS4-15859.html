			<p>BFN     [Text] Three people were killed and nine wounded as a  result of an Azerbaijani bomb attack on Karabakh's capital of  Stepanakert on April 10, the press service of the Karabakh  Defense Army told Interfax. Three bombs hit the center of the  city. A woman and her two children -- a 7-year-old boy and  12-year-old girl -- were killed. Many buildings were ruined.    On the same day, bombs were dropped on other populated areas  of Nagorno Karabakh. The number of casualties is being  verified. The air-raid warning was sounded seven times in  Stepanakert on April 11, but no bomb attacks were carried out by  Azerbaijani forces. Informed sources in Stepanakert report that  bombs might have been dropped on other populated areas.  According to the press service, fierce fighting has continued  for two days now in the north of Karabakh's Mardakert Region,  where the Azerbijani forces launched a large-scale offensive on  April 10.    Meanwhile, a source in the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry  reports that Armenian formations tried to launch an attack  yesterday in the southern section of the front, in the Fizuli  Region and on the border with Azerbijan's Beilagan Region. Baku  says the attack was checked and Armenian units were forced back  to their initial positions.</p>

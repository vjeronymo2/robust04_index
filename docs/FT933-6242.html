			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: New funds look East THE GROWING investment fashion for emerging markets was illustrated this week by the announcement of two new funds in the area. Emerging markets are favoured because of their high economic growth and relatively undeveloped stock markets which, enthusiasts believe, offer greater opportunities for profit. Foreign &amp; Colonial's new emerging markets subsidiary has launched an offshore, open-ended fund which will invest in India. Meanwhile, Robert Fleming is planning to launch a Chinese investment trust. The F&amp;C fund will be based in Luxembourg and will aim to invest in medium-sized growth companies. F&amp;C says that economic growth in India is predicted to reach 7-8 per cent by the middle of the decade. It adds: 'Low-cost, medium-sized companies are likely to find it easier to adjust to the changing policy framework and many have already begun to experience more rapid growth than their blue-chip counterparts.' IndSec Securities &amp; Finance Ltd, an Indian fund management group, will act as adviser to the fund. The launch price will be Dollars 10 a share and the minimum investment will be Dollars 10,000. As well as its Luxembourg base, the fund will invest via a wholly-owned Mauritius subsidiary. F&amp;C says the structure will reduce Indian capital gains tax to zero and dividend income tax to 15 per cent. Fleming's Chinese investment trust will use the Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming as investment adviser and SG Warburg as the stockbroker. Jardine Fleming is estimating that Chinese economic growth will be 12 per cent in 1993 and 8 per cent in 1994. The trust is expected to be launched at the end of September. Potential investors should realise that single-country emerging market funds are likely to be highly volatile because the stock markets involved are so illiquid. A more widely-spread emerging markets fund is likely to be a much safer bet for the small, or first-time, investor.</p>

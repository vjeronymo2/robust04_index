			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Australian inflation puts rates rise on hold Prospects for an immediate increase in Australian interest rates faded yesterday after publication of the latest consumer price index figures showed that inflation was running at 0.7 per cent in the June quarter, or an annualised rate of 1.7 per cent. The rise in the CPI in the latest quarter was at the lower end of analysts' forecasts, and the Treasury calculated that the increase in the 'underlying rate' was smaller still, at about 0.4 per cent in the quarter. During the April-June period the CPI was held back by deflation in the food sector, and only modest rises in clothing and household equipment prices. The data came as a relief to the Australian government which has been anxious to delay raising interest rates until there are clearer signs that business investment is picking up. Although the economy is growing at an annualised rate of 4.5-5 per cent, this has been largely due to a surge in domestic consumer demand. There had been fears that, if the CPI data showed that strong domestic demand was pushing up prices, the government would have been forced to raise rates - thus choking off the slow improvement in investment levels. Yesterday, Mr Ralph Willis, Australian treasurer, said that 'excluding fuel, tobacco and alcohol and mortgage interest charges, inflation for the quarter was around 0.3 per cent - further evidence of the absence of inflationary pressures in the economy'. Mr Willis, who talked to Reserve Bank of Australia officials after returning from a trip to Washington and New York yesterday, added: 'I don't see a rise in interest rates as a result of these figures'. He expected 'a good inflation outcome' in the September quarter. Bond yields and the Australian dollar both fell on the news. Nevertheless, most analysts still predict there will be some tightening of monetary policy before the end of the year.</p>

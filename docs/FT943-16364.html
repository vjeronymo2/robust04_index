			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Harwood leaves UBS Len Harwood has resigned as head of debt capital markets at UBS in London, a post he had held since November 1991. Simon Crisp and Tim Streeter will continue to act as joint heads of the bank's Eurobond syndicate desk. They will now report directly to John Giannotti, head of syndicate and origination for the European region. It has not yet been decided whether to replace Harwood. UBS rose to 4th position in the league table of Eurobond arrangers compiled by Euromoney for the first half of 1994, up from 8th place a year ago. The debt capital markets unit is part of the debt and treasury division run by Richard Briance, who was hired from CS First Boston in 1991.</p>

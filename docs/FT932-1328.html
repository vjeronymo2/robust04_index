			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley spurns 'big bang' assault on benefits EFFECTIVE structural reform of the Pounds 80bn social security system must involve either better targeting, more self-provision or both, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday. He added, however, that he favoured a sector-by-sector approach to reform rather than a 'big bang' exercise. Speaking less than a week after the cabinet agreed to set tough spending limits for 1994-95 and to 'sing from the same hymn sheet' on tax and spending, Mr Lilley used a lecture at the City University Business School to spell out the basis on which he approached his department's budget in the spending review. He emphasised that there were ways other than means-testing to target benefits. These included using categories other than income, such as age, targeting on the basis of objectively defined needs, and attaching conditions to particular benefits. He made clear that no one would be allowed to 'opt out of contributing to help those who cannot provide for their needs', but expressed strong approval for the incentives to earn and save where people made private provision for themselves. He also argued that there was already some effective targeting within the system, with about 70 per cent of benefits going to the 30 per cent of people with lowest pre-benefit income. Delivering the Mais lecture, Mr Lilley said that he planned to publish soon an analysis and projection of DSS spending, in order to stimulate an informed debate. Apart from unemployment, trend growth in the cost of an unreformed social security system is put at more than 3 per cent a year, taking account of inflation. Mr Lilley was very cool on the solution suggested by some, of a merged tax and benefits system. He argued that the two systems fulfilled different functions, and merger might result in less well-targeted and thus more expensive benefits.</p>

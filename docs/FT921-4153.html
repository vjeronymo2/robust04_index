			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Generali expects to post rise GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, yesterday forecast higher earnings for 1991, despite continuing heavy underwriting losses on non-life business, particularly in Italy. Releasing preliminary figures for last year, the company said the 'positive' trends stemming from life insurance earnings and a slight let-up in the rate of cost rises had failed to make up for non-life underwriting losses. However, investment income and extraordinary gains would allow it to report earnings above the L351.2bn (Dollars 282m) made by the parent company after tax in 1990, despite the additional burden imposed by a government requirement to bring forward certain property tax payments last year. Non-consolidated premiums rose by around 14.5 per cent to L7,200bn in 1991. Generali gave no indication of consolidated group premiums, which amounted to L13,670bn in 1990, but said premiums from other companies it controlled rose by around 12 per cent to almost L11,000bn in 1991. Non-life premiums rose by around 12.6 per cent, with premiums on the life side jumping by 17.2 per cent. No absolute figures were given. Domestically, non-life premiums rose by 10 per cent to almost L2,400bn, while life premiums rose by almost 19 per cent to L1,350bn. Investment income rose by 20.8 per cent, while the value of Generali's overall investment portfolio surged by almost 30 per cent to over L21,200bn from L16,300bn in 1990. No explanations for the increases were given. More detailed figures should be available on May 5, when the company's board meets to consider its 1991 results. Alitalia, the Italian state-controlled airline, wants to stay out of alliances, Reuter reports. 'Among all the alliances that have been announced I have not yet seen one that really worked,' managing director, Mr Giovanni Bisignani, said. 'Even the gurus of air transport seem to have changed their minds on the subject of link-ups,' he said. 'We at Alitalia prefer to achieve critical size by ourselves.'</p>

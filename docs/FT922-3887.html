			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese companies post Y2,237bn non-operating loss JAPANESE companies' non-operating profits were squeezed by losses on securities investments, the decline in cash-flow and the rise in interest payments due to increases in short and long-term borrowings. According to Wako Research Institute of Economics, 1,086 leading companies, excluding financials, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, posted a combined non-operating loss of Y2,237bn (Dollars 17.64bn) in the year ended March 1992. The non-operating balance reflects profits and losses from financial items such as interest and dividends and gains and losses through financial investments. Wako said the combined non-operating balance, which had risen for eight consecutive years since fiscal 1982, declined for the second year in a row. The sharp rise in Japanese share prices in the late 1980s and access to cheap equity-linked financing led Japanese companies to rely on non-operating profits to boost pre-tax profits. But the stock market slump has forced many companies to post losses on stock investments, and cash-flow declines due to sharp falls in operating profits have eroded non-operating balances at most manufacturers.</p>

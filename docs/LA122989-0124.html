			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HE JUST WANTS TO STAY IN GAME;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY BOWL: FRED WHITTINGHAM JR., SIDELINED BY SEVERE HEADACHES AT EL MODENA,  BECOMES A FIXTURE IN BYU'S BACKFIELD.  </P> <P> It's fitting that Fred Whittingham Jr. has played most of this college football  season for Brigham Young with a broken bone in each wrist. That's the type of  football player he is.  </P> <P> As a senior at El Modena High School, Whittingham proved just how difficult it  is to keep him away from the sport. He was hospitalized because of severe  headaches after a football game in October. The headaches were determined to be  caused by internal bleeding in his brain, and doctors recommended that he not  play the rest of the season. Some doctors said he shouldn't play football  again. Although he wasn't able to play for El Modena again, he did play in  college.  </P> <P> Now Whittingham is the starting fullback for BYU (10-2), which will meet Penn  State (7-3-1) in the Holiday Bowl tonight at 5 in San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium. He has been the Cougars' leading rusher for the past three seasons and  is one of two lettermen remaining from the 1984 team that defeated Michigan in  the Holiday Bowl and won the national championship. A psychology major with a  3.24 grade-point average, Whittingham is an academic all-American.  </P> <P> Whittingham, son of Ram linebacker coach Fred Whittingham, isn't an especially  fast runner, and at 5-feet-9 and 200 pounds, he doesn't have the ideal body for  a fullback.  </P> <P> "He's just not quite as tall or as big as other people but he's big enough,"  BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said.  </P> <P> He's tough enough, too. As a child, he would stare down other children just to  see what they would do. Consequently, he got in a lot of fights.  </P> <P> "I kind of grew out of wanting to fight," Whittingham said, "But I guess it  stuck with me on the field. Not the fighting but the competitiveness."  </P> <P> Whittingham broke a bone in each wrist in successive games early this season.  Despite the pain, he had his wrists wrapped, continued to play and avoided  having the injuries X-rayed until about a month later.  </P> <P> "All (the X-rays) would have told me was whether they were broken or not,"  Whittingham said, "and I really didn't want to know because if they were broken  I would have played anyway."  </P> <P> Whittingham doesn't volunteer information about injuries. "I try to stay away  from doctors," he said.  </P> <P> During his senior year at El Modena, five doctors told him he shouldn't play  football again. Blood was found in his spinal fluid, indicating that the severe  headaches he was suffering were caused by hemorrhages in his brain.  </P> <P> The headaches had started in early October after a game. They were persistent  but not especially severe. Still, they were bad enough that Whittingham went to  a doctor, who could find nothing wrong.  </P> <P> But after the next game, in which he took a couple of hard hits, the headaches  became severe on the bus ride home.  </P> <P> "He really got ripped several times, but that was the kind of ballcarrier he  was," said Bob Lester, his coach at El Modena. "He charged headlong into  everything."  </P> <P> His mother, Nancy, said Fred came home, said the pain was worse, then fell  asleep. When he woke up, Nancy said, "I think he kind of had tears in his eyes;  (he said), 'I don't know what I'm going to do. This is hurting so much.' "  </P> <P> That night, his parents took him to St. Joseph Hospital on Orange for tests.  The next day, he checked into Anaheim Memorial Hospital where the tests  continued. His head was X-rayed from all angles but the doctors could not find  the cause of the headaches. One neurologist suggested that he quit football.  Another said it might be migraine headaches.  </P> <P> "It was kind of frustrating to know that my head hurt that bad, yet all those  tests were coming up negative," Whittingham said.  </P> <P> Finally, Whitting ham was given a spinal tap, which showed that there had been  internal bleeding. The doctor told him to forget about football for at least  the season.  </P> <P> Despite this advice, Whittingham got antsy when the headaches subsided a few  weeks later. His team was driving toward the Southern Section playoffs and he  wanted to play.  </P> <P> He was allowed to practice before the first week of the playoffs. But the  headaches started to come back, and although they were mild, it was decided  that he wouldn't play.  </P> <P> He did play a month and a half later when El Modena defeated Foothill, 10-7, in  a Southern Section championship game at Anaheim Stadium. He was in for only one  play, as a decoy. It was meant to be a tribute to Whittingham. Lester said  Whittingham was in no danger.  </P> <P> "I was more frustrated to be in a uniform and not be able to play," Whittingham  said. "I almost wished I just dressed in street clothes."  </P> <P> Because the injury kept Whittingham out of almost half of his senior season,  almost all of the coaches who had been recruiting him backed off. But not  Edwards. The Edwards and Whittingham families had been neighbors in Provo,  Utah, when Fred Sr. was a BYU assistant.  </P> <P> "They really do watch that closely and they can tell the difference between  something that is a real problem and something that will pass by," Edwards  said. "If he were to have come in complaining of headaches, that would have  been picked up in a hurry."  </P> <P> Edwards said that although Fred didn't get a scholarship because he was a  Whittingham, the name certainly helped.  </P> <P> "There's something to be said for genes and competitiveness," Edwards said.  </P> <P> Nancy Whittingham tried to make it to every BYU home game during the 1984  season to watch Fred Jr. and another son, Cary, a senior linebacker. She said  she was worried every time Fred Jr. carried the ball.  </P> <P> "I just kept watching him every second after the play," Nancy Whittingham said.  "I kept watching the sideline, watching for any movement that might tell me  something."  </P> <P> Whittingham had only 25 carries in his freshman year.  </P> <P> But he did get hit in practice, harder than he was hit in high school. But the  headaches never returned.  </P> <P> "When I was getting hit as hard as I had in my whole life and my head didn't  hurt, I thought it was probably OK," Whittingham said.  </P> <P> Although Whittingham had been given clearance to play by a neurologist at UCLA,  he received no guarantees. "(Other doctors) just figured that any kind of a  head injury wasn't worth the risk," Nancy said. "That doesn't take into account  how badly the individual wants to play."  </P> <P> He certainly wants to play. Older brothers Kyle and Cary played linebacker for  BYU, and both played for the Rams as replacements during the NFL strike in  1987. His father played linebacker for BYU and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and for  the Rams, Eagles, Saints and Cowboys.  </P> <P> "If the tests had showed anything at all, we would have stopped him from  playing," his father said.  </P> <P> "It does put a little bit of a scare in you, but that's part of anything in  life."  </P> <P> Whittingham took two seasons off on a mission for the Mormon church in southern  Florida, and when he returned before the 1987 season, he became the starting  fullback.  </P> <P> Whittingham's single-game high this season has been 81 yards. Only once at BYU  has he rushed for more than 100 yards. But despite averaging only about 10  carries a game, he led the Cougars in rushing each year that he started.  </P> <P> "For our kind of offense, he fits right in," Edwards said, "he's an excellent  blocker, ballcarrier and pass receiver."  </P> <P> But it's carrying the ball that Whittingham enjoys most. When he does get hold  of the ball, he doesn't think of sparing his body.  </P> <P> "That's just the way I am out there. I could probably minimize the abuse I  take, but that's not the style I play," Whittingham said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> 'PERIODICAL PROBLEM' BRINGS READERS' POSTAL COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> We are a book publisher in Claremont, the eastern edge of Los Angeles County.  We have shipped a book via fourth class book rate mail on a Friday and had it  arrive in Syracuse, N.Y. on Monday.  </P> <P> Nationally, the Post Office is capable of great service at present rates and  staffing.  </P> <P> Why then is Los Angeles service so poor? Complaints have been pouring in to us  recently because books have not reached customers in Los Angeles, only 25 miles  away, more than three weeks after we mail them. Unfortunately, we can't solve  the Los Angeles delay problem by sending via first class mail, as one of our  first class letters recently took eight days to get to Long Beach.  </P> <P> I'd like some real accounting from Los Angeles Post Office management, and not  more whining about volume. Problems aren't solved by complaining about what is;  problems are solved by adjusting procedures to match that reality.  </P> <P> H.A. TONY HYMAN  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

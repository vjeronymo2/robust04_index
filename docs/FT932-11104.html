			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Chief of UN health agency re-elected DR Hiroshi Nakajima, controversial director-general of the World Health Organisation, was yesterday re-elected for a second five-year term as head of the 185-nation UN agency. But the vote, 93 to 57, displayed unexpectedly strong disapproval of his handling of WHO affairs, making it likely that his second term will be as turbulent as the first. The vote at WHO's annual meeting followed a heated debate on a report by external auditors which revealed 'shortcomings' in financial controls relating to contracts for executive board members. Dr Nakajima, a Japanese, was nominated for re-election by the 31-member executive board by 18 votes to 13, amid accusations by the US and other donor nations that Japan had used threats and inducements to win developing country votes. Western countries opposed to Dr Nakajima have made clear that they will insist on sweeping reforms in management and financial accountability at WHO, which has a two-year budget of Dollars 1.8bn. Mr Walter Broadnax, deputy secretary-designate at the US Health Department, warned in a speech that 'only managerial and leadership changes can prevent further erosion in programme effectiveness'. Britain called for 'a different management culture' to ensure funds were used 'with probity and provide good value for money'. Canada, France, Denmark and the Nordic countries were also highly critical. On Tuesday Dr Nakajima promised reforms 'to tighten up management and administration and to revitalise WHO's structure to achieve greater efficiency, transparency and accountability'. A reorganisation already in train will curb the powers and influence of three key members of staff implicitly criticised by the audit report. But Dr Nakajima is also criticised by western donors for lack of leadership and vision and by many of his staff for autocratic management. Critics say these concerns will not be assuaged by administrative changes, however desirable these are.</p>

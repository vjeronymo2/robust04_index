			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Small shareholders seek bank boardroom voice Shareholder meetings at Italy's state-controlled banks used to be brisk affairs. Once IRI, the state holding company, had voted its majority stake there wasn't much point in the 30 or 40 other shareholders present prolonging the agony. Privatisation seems to have changed all that, as 500 shareholders in Credito Italiano learned to their cost last Saturday in Genoa's converted cotton exchange. The first assembly since the December sell-off of IRI's 64 per cent stake lasted until 5am on Sunday morning. The prospect of spending most of the weekend in a half-empty conference hall, with only professional investors and a well-thumbed annual report for company, is still not a great draw for ordinary Italians. In Genoa, there was little sign of the fabled Piccolo Azionista, the small shareholder for whom 40 per cent of the bank's shares were reserved in the original sale. Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), privatised in February, faces an even tougher challenge attracting the small shareholder to its assembly in Milan tomorrow. But apart from disappointment about the low turnout - Credito Italiano had expected at least 800 people in the 1,500-seat hall - there is also concern about who will control strategy at the newly privatised banks. In particular, analysts point out that many of the main shareholders of Credito Italiano and BCI are old allies of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank. The theory goes that as the Italian banking system opens up to greater domestic and international competition, Mediobanca will need to protect its core activities of medium and long-term lending and corporate finance. Stakes in the privatised banks are limited to 3 per cent, but directors sympathetic to Mediobanca could still help ensure that relations with Credito Italiano and BCI, both of which already distribute Mediobanca financial products through their retail network, remain cosy rather than confrontational. Events since last weekend's Credito Italiano assembly seem to have confirmed this interpretation. Of the 11 directors elected on Saturday, at least five have strong Mediobanca links. Three, including the privatised bank's chief executive Mr Egidio Giuseppe Bruno, are also Mediobanca directors and were duly appointed to the Credito Italiano five-man executive committee at Monday's first board meeting. Observers expect Saturday's BCI meeting to yield a board similarly friendly to Mediobanca, helped by the fact that Mr Pietro Grandjacquet, BCI's chief executive, announced last weekend that he would not seek re-election. Mr Grandjacquet, in spite of having a seat on Mediobanca's board, was said to be the principal advocate of a more independent strategy for BCI. He could well be replaced on Saturday by Mr Enrico Beneduce, a senior manager of BCI and nephew of Mr Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca. Whether Mediobanca decides to use this influence, and how, remains to be seen. Other analysts believe the merchant bank's role has been exaggerated and the independent line will be championed by representatives of up-and-coming Italian companies not yet in the Mediobanca network, and by directors nominated by foreign shareholders. Mr Achille Maramotti, founder of the Max Mara fashion group, and Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio of Luxottica, maker of spectacle frames, also won seats on the Credito Italiano board. Still, they will have to fight hard if they want to assert a dissident line. Before last Saturday's meeting, Mr Gilberto Benetton, who looks after stakes in both Credito Italiano and BCI for Edizione Holding, the Benetton clothing group's parent company, said the purchase of shares reflected the group's belief in the aims of privatisation. But he added: 'Up to now it was a simple privatisation, but nobody knew who was in charge. These assemblies are the moment of truth.'  --------------------------------------------            PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS  -------------------------------------------- Credito Italiano                      %  -------------------------------------------- Ras Assicurazioni/Allianz             3 Franco Tosi International             3 Commercial Union                   2.05 Credito Italiano employees          4.5*  -------------------------------------------- Banca Commerciale Italiana  -------------------------------------------- Generali                              3 Commerzbank                        2.99 Paribas                            2.98 BCI employees                         4*  -------------------------------------------- * estimated  --------------------------------------------</p>

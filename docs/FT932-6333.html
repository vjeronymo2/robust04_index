			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Minolta to omit payout as profits plunge 38% MINOLTA Camera, a leading Japanese precision instrument maker, saw pre-tax profit decline by about 38 per cent to Y13.6bn (Dollars 125m) for the fiscal year ended March. It blamed patent dispute payments with US-based Honeywell, weak domestic demand and appraisal losses on inventories. Net profits plunged by about 76 per cent to Y6bn last year on sales of Y196.3bn, down 8.9 per cent. Minolta will pass bonus payments to board directors and annual dividend payments to shareholders. It estimates pre-tax profits at Y2.5bn on maintained sales for the current year. Kubota, the farm equipment group, unveiled a pre-tax profits decline of 5.4 per cent to Y30bn last year, a second consecutive drop, due to the economic downturn and global currency changes. Net profits fell by 13.1 per cent to Y16bn, while sales rose 2.7 per cent to Y748.5bn. The company set aside Y2.4bn in loss reserves for overseas investment in an effort to hedge against rapid foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Kubota expects similar pre-tax and net profits for the current year on sales of Y760bn.</p>

			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Missing an opportunity Sir, Knowingly or not, Ian Davidson ('Russia policy is vital', March 30) touches upon the power vacuum which a careful observer perceives and which the EU seems unable to fill. I have always marvelled at the UK's reluctance to accept a United Europe as an excellent opportunity to excel again by embarking on and leading a new venture in power.

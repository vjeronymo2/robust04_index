			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine motors arm moves ahead 6% at midway stage Jardine International Motors Holdings, the Hong Kong based car distribution arm of the Jardine Group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 38.1m for the six months to June 30, up from Dollars 35.8m in the same period last year. Gains were struck on a 55 per cent surge in turnover, to Dollars 717.5m from Dollars 462.4m, reflecting the acquisition of Cica in Europe. Sales and deliveries into China during the second quarter were hit by the mainland's additional tariffs on vehicles. The new taxes, effective from April, put a 150 per cent levy on top-range big-engine cars sold to joint ventures, which make up the bulk of imported car sales. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The strength of the Hong Kong market and continued recovery in most of the group's other operations will help to offset the effects of higher tariffs in China, and results for the full year are expected to be satisfactory.' Some 77 per cent of the group's profits before interest are generated in Asia. In spite of a strong market in Hong Kong, half-year profits from the colony slipped from the 1993 first half, when a large number of orders was carried forward from the previous year. Earnings per share for the half-year rose in line with after-tax profits, up 6 per cent to 7.98 cents from 7.5 cents last year. The dividend is to be held at 1.20 cents. Jardine International Motors, which is only listed in Hong Kong, has no plans to quit the exchange. However, the issue of a possible de-listing  - following the decision by Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic to sever their Hong Kong listings at the end of the year - is on the agenda at board meetings today and tomorrow for sister companies Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental and Hongkong Land.</p>

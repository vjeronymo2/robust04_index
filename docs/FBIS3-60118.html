Thanks to a skilfully planned operation, the underground  dealers were arrested with incontrovertible evidence--while they  were trying to sell over 20 kg of poppy haulms [makovaya  solomka].    A resident of Pskov Oblast, a native of Chechnya, was also  caught on Kolomenskaya Street. Some 17 kg of plant raw  materials for the production of drugs were confiscated from this  drug baron. Criminal proceedings have been instituted.</p>

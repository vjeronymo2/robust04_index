			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend moves hit index A clutch of big Footsie stocks were responsible for knocking just over 7 points off the value of the FT-SE 100 index yesterday as they went ex-dividend at the start of the new account. The companies that had the greatest effect were BAT Industries, which took 1.42 points off the index as it released a dividend of 14.6p, and ICI, which took nearly a point off the index with its dividend of 21p. BAT fell 12 1/2 to 710p xd, ICI lost 4 to 1120p xd and Barclays dropped 11 to 304p ex a 9.15p dividend. National Westminster fell 7 to 305p ex a 6.125p dividend, despite announcing its intention to acquire - subject to Bank of Italy approval - the business of Continental Bank's Milan branch. Volatile Rank Organisation closed a net 15 lower at 550p following a dividend of 10.25p. However, BP held up relatively well despite the pressure of its recently halved 2.1p per share dividend and the placing of a block of 1m shares at 181p in early trading. The shares closed up 4 at 187 1/2 p xd on heavy turnover of 18m, the busiest in the London market yesterday. Reuters also held up with a gain of 8 1/2 to 1027p xd. Granada lower Entertainments and leisure group Granada fell sharply after County NatWest turned seller of the stock and predicted the shares would underperform. The shares slipped 10 to 231p on turnover of 2.7m. County said that in spite of outperforming the market by 79 per cent over the past year, 'the prospects of the underlying Granada managed businesses do not deserve the implicit rating on which they currently stand'. The securities house added: 'There is significant scope for disappointment in the current share price'. Insurers firm Composite insurance stocks were up on the eve of their interim results reporting season. However, turnover was generally negligible and the gains had very little weight behind them according to insurance sector analysts. General Accident, which reports today, was the best performer with a rise of 10 to 390p. The group is expected to cut its losses significantly from Pounds 101m last year and maintain the dividend. However, analysts said the rise in the share price followed a fall from 492p at the end of June. Commercial Union, which reports tomorrow, gained 5 to 435p and Royal, which reports on Thursday and is the most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity, slipped 2 to 165p. Speculation in the press that conglomerate Hanson has been planning a demerger was denied by the company yesterday and the shares eased a halfpenny to 198p, assisted by the placing of a line of 1.3m shares at 196p. Hanson announces third-quarter figures on Thursday and profits for the period are expected to be down to between Pounds 275m and Pounds 325m against Pounds 379m for the same period last year. British Airways was sought ahead of today's release of its first-quarter results. The shares gained 7 to 261p on healthy turnover of 6.4m. Lehman Brothers is predicting profits for the period April to June at Pounds 85m. Also in demand was BAA, whose shares gained 8 to 625p. Weekend press suggestions that Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, might step down prematurely helped British Gas to firm a penny to 227 1/2 p. British Gas has been preparing a demand for the system of one-man regulation to be abolished. There was continued weakness in music and entertainment group Thorn EMI, the subject of several profits downgrades last week. The shares gave up another 16 to 696p, after Strauss Turnbull reiterated its sell recommendation. The general slide in the stock market and the low levels of activity in recent weeks reflected on the share price of merchant bank SG Warburg which fell 19 to 421p. Smith New Court was 3 lighter at 85p. Nervous trading was seen in the water stocks, ahead of Thursday's publication of a consultative paper on the cost of quality, by the industry regulator. The day's falls included Anglian Water down 6 at 394p, Thames Water 7 lighter at 397p, and Yorkshire Water 5 easier at 423p. Mobile telecommunications group Vodafone eased only a penny to 326p ahead of Thursday's announcement on a new cellular tariff system. Hoare Govett remained positive on the stock in the short term. Industrial gases group BOC closed a penny firmer at 597p, helped by its defensive qualities and by the announcement that it had completed the sale of its US-based healthcare business Glasrock for Dollars 72m (Pounds 37.6m) plus certain liabilities. Improved turnover for the first six months of this year helped Arjo Wiggins Appleton to hold firm at 215p. Among food manufacturers, Northern Foods, continued to suffer from Friday's profits downgrading by BZW and also more general worries about the company's potential earnings growth. After a one for one share split took effect, the shares ended 7 down at 253p. Pilkington, one of Europe's biggest glassmakers, remained in the doldrums, easing another 2 to 79p. The continued decline of the stock over the past few weeks has placed it at the bottom of the FT-SE 100 in terms of market capitalisation. The company announced yesterday that its US subsidiary had completed a private placement of Dollars 300m of long term finance. The stores sector continued to suffer from worries over the economy, which led to falls in some stocks, although bargain-hunting trimmed losses. Marks and Spencer ended 3 lighter at 300p, as did Boots at 421p. Great Universal Stores, however, fell 41 to 1323p. Aggregates and quarrying group Evered Bardon rose 3 to 30p after it said it had won contracts worth about Dollars 40m (Pounds 20.9m) to supply concrete for Boston's Third Harbour Tunnel project. A buy recommendation from Nomura helped Burton Group close steady at 31 1/2 p. Nursing homes group Takare performed well on the back of solid first-half results. Profits leapt to Pounds 5.63m from Pounds 2.99m for the same period last year and the shares gained 5 to 195p. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Joel Kibazo. Other market statistics, Page 21.

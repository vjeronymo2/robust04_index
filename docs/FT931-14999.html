			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / US retail spending surges in December US RETAIL sales rose 1.2 per cent between November and December, confirming anecdotal reports of a surge in consumer spending at the end of last year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. They rose 5.1 per cent during 1992 as a whole, making last year the best for retailers since 1989. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. The year-end spurt, however, masked significant differences in the fortunes of particular sectors. Car sales rose 3.2 per cent but general department store sales fell 0.7 per cent relative to November. Excluding car dealerships, retail sales rose by only 0.6 per cent. Separately, the department reported producer prices up by 0.2 per cent last month and by only 1.9 per cent in 1992 as a whole - the lowest rate of wholesale inflation since 1983. Weekly figures for state unemployment claims jumped 52,000 to 343,000, their largest increase in five months. However, weekly numbers are volatile and the new total is consistent with sluggish imp-rovement in labour markets. Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said yesterday's sales figures reflected a real increase in consumer spending at an annual rate of about 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.7 per cent in the third quarter. Most analysts, however, forecast a slower pace of consumer spending in the first half of this year. Spending last year ran well ahead of income and employment growth, resulting in a fall in the already low personal savings rate. President-elect Bill Clinton's advisers have refused to rule out a short-run economic stimulus in part because of worries about the sustainability of a consumption-led upturn.</p>

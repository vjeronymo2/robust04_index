			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles hits Pounds 39m and cash flow strong COURTAULDS Textiles yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits of almost 90 cent last year from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 39.1m. The company, however, warned that comparisons with 1991 figures had been distorted by the introduction of the new FRS 3 accounting standard. This meant that provisions against discontinued businesses previously taken below the line had been deducted from the published 1991 pre-tax figure of Pounds 42.2m. Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive, said that pre-tax profits comparisons, using the previous accounting basis, were static. Operating profits on the continuing businesses were 7 per cent lower at Pounds 42.9m on group turnover 3.5 per cent lower at Pounds 889.6m. The share price rose 3p to 593p following the announcement of a 9.2p final dividend, making a total for the year of 13.6p (13p). Earnings of 30.1p compared with a restated figure of 11.2p. Mr Taylor said that net cash flow during 1992 had remained strong at Pounds 33m (Pounds 38.7m). It had allowed the group to further reduce net borrowings to Pounds 17.7m at the year end, equivalent to less than 7 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 264m. He said that it was more realistic to look at average monthly borrowings which were Pounds 72.6m in 1992, still 35 per cent lower at constant exchange rates than during 1991. Mr Taylor added that the trading outlook remained mixed. Consumer confidence appeared to have stopped falling in the UK, which accounted for 60 per cent of Courtaulds' sales. The decline in sterling, since the currency departed the ERM last autumn, would make the company's products more competitive against imports from the Far East. The US market was also showing tentative signs of recovery but the lace market was likely to remain difficult. Continental Europe, which accounted for about 20 per cent of group sales, was likely to remain weak - particularly in France and Germany where retail markets were under severe pressure. The company yesterday announced purchases worth Pounds 7m, increasing the scale of its investment in joint ventures in Spain and Thailand. COMMENT The company's share price has more than doubled since textiles demerged from Courtaulds' chemical business three years ago. The management during that time has achieved substantial success in lowering gearing and overheads and raising productivity. The result has been to underpin profits in dreadful trading conditions. These appear at last to be moving in Courtaulds' favour. UK and US markets are looking better while sterling's devaluation makes British exports more attractive. The group says that prices of imported materials and components have risen relatively little because of the poor market in continental Europe. Forecast profits of between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m for the current year put the company on a prospective p/e of more than 16, on an increased tax charge of about 25 per cent. The company may be about to reap some reward, but this appears to have been already recognised in the share price. See People</p>

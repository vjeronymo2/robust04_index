			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the mention of a need to "abolish  the National Security Law," by one U.S. Government official  after another, the ROK Government stated on 4 March: "The  National Security Law is an inevitable and minimum apparatus for  defending the free democratic system in our country." Today,  the Justice Ministry released a statement on the "Government's  Position on the National Security Law." In the document, the  ministry states: "Continuous mention of a need to abolish the  National Security Law, when a delicate security situation  prevails because of the North Korean nuclear issue, is not  beneficial to our national interests."    Regarding the allegation that the National Security Law is  abused to violate human rights, the Justice Ministry also said:  "When this law was revised in 1991, the purposes of the  National Security Law were specified, and the scope of the  application of this law was restricted significantly, so that  the law ensures that people's basic human rights are defended to  the utmost." The ministry added: "The government will strictly  execute the law and make continued efforts to prevent the  violation of human rights."    Dissidents insist that, "The law describes North Korea as an  antistate organization, at a time when the North-South agreement  has been signed. Therefore, the law stands in the  reunification's way." In response, the Justice Ministry says:  "The National Security Law does not automatically consider  North Korea an antistate organization. Furthermore, the laws on  North-South exchange and cooperation positively guarantees  peaceful exchange and cooperation."    Tbe ministry also said: "If North Korea abandons its  strategy on perpetrating a communist revolution in South Korea  and if North- South relations develop into relations of  reconciliation and cooperation, the government will seriously  reexamine the law."</p>

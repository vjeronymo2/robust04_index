			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (2): A bad year for the big three - The problems facing the country's top banking groups For Switzerland's three big banking groups, CS Holding, Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland, 1994 will go down as a year they would rather forget. This not just or even mainly because of the epic row that the UBS board and manage- ment have been fighting with the bank's largest and most critical shareholder, BK Vision. Rather, it is because of the startling fall in their earnings performance from the record levels achieved last year, and the subsequent questions raised about the quality of their management and earnings. On the common basis of profits before taxes and provisions, the UBS result in the first half was down 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn, Swiss Bank Corporation down 45.1 per cent to SFr1.19bn and CS Holding, the group built around Credit Suisse, off 30 per cent to SFr1.97bn. The main cause of these profit slides has been big declines in income from trading, the money the banks make from dealing in foreign currencies and trading in bonds, shares and other securities for their own account. UBS was hit hardest, with a 68 per cent plunge in trading income to SFr493m, and SBC was not far behind with a 63 per cent fall to SFr537m. CS profit on trading was down 43 per cent to SFr1.27bn. The banks' leaders have been quick to point out that many of their international rivals, including JP Morgan of the US and SG Warburg of Britain, fared far worse in the difficult conditions that have prevailed in global securities markets this year. Nevertheless, analysts have concluded that the overall quality of the banks' earnings is not what it used to be when trading formed a smaller part of their overall profits. And that has been a main reason for a downward rerating of their shares. Bank Julius Baer, for example, sees the current prices of CS Holding as only 10.3 times projected 1995 earnings, about half a point lower than its rating a year ago. SBC has been similarly downgraded to 8.2 times. Baer's rating of UBS has held firm at 12.1 times, but that was distorted by the effect of the recent proxy battle. The banks themselves insist that the sharp decline in their trading results this year is within tolerable limits. It looks particularly bad, they argue, because last year was an exceptionally profitable year in this volatile area. They also say that they have little choice but to be involved in sophisticated derivative markets if they are to continue to be active in international corporate banking. The potential for that business is also coming under question. In the past few years, Swiss banks had a relatively easy time because many big American and Japanese banks had retreated from the field. Now they are returning, and competition will become tougher. The other disappointment this year has been in the domestic commercial banking market. There were hopes after the takeover by Credit Suisse of Swiss Volksbank last year that competitive pressures would ease and margins on retail and commercial lending could rise to profitable levels. However, this does not appear to have happened. The continuing rapid consolidation in the regional bank sector has, if anything, intensified the struggle for market share among the big banks. CS was again the main player in this process, with its SFr905.6m rescue package and agreed takeover bid for Neue Aargauer Bank (NAB), Switzerland's largest regional bank, in September. To make matters worse, both SBC and CS acknowledged that in the third quarter their hitherto resilient commission businesses, based mainly on their large portfolio management activities, had also weakened. This altogether unsatisfactory performance created a useful background for the extraordinary challenge by Mr Martin Ebner over the overall corporate governance of UBS. Whatever the ultimate result of the confrontation between Mr Ebner and the UBS board, it is already clear that it will have a big impact on the future of all three big banks. When UBS announced that it would eliminate its registered shares and create a single class of bearer shares with no restrictions, it said this would be a move that would be followed by other Swiss banks and companies. Both CS and SBC have two classes of shares and even more severe restrictions on voting them than UBS. At CS, no one can vote more than 2 per cent of the shares. At SBC, only Swiss citizens and legal entities with residence in Switzerland and Swiss control can vote up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the total share capital. Paradoxically, while UBS removed its restrictions to see off a challenge to its governance from dissident shareholders, CS and SBC will probably want to achieve the same end by retaining such curbs. CS has served its shareholders no better than UBS in the past decade and SBC has done much worse (see chart). But because of the voting restrictions, it would be very difficult for anyone to rally enough shares to put real pressure on the directors of these banks. Nevertheless, it will also become increasingly hard for the banks' directors to justify retaining the restrictions. As UBS pointed out, there will soon be other ways of ensuring that ownership does not fall into undesirable hands. From January 1, banking law provisions, which restrict the use of the word 'Swiss' in bank names, will be altered. Until now, a bank has had to prove that at least half its capital is held by Swiss interests. Henceforth, only voting interests of more than 10 per cent will be taken into account. Moreover, the law will for the first time oblige shareholders to notify the Swiss Banking Commission if and when they acquire stakes of more than 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 33 per cent and 50 per cent. The commission will have the right to suspend the voting rights of large shareholders if it considers their influence would hurt the proper conduct of the bank's management. A liberalisation earlier this year of the law restricting foreign ownership of Swiss property (and further steps pending) also makes it less important for the banks to be able to prove majority Swiss ownership. CS refuses to comment on the possible removal of voting restrictions, and SBC says no changes are foreseen. However, it is clear they have seen the signals. Mr Peter Wuffli, chief financial officer at SBC, said in a speech three days after the UBS vote that the bank was trying to transform itself, putting more emphasis on value for shareholders and less on the size of its balance sheet.</p>

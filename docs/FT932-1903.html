			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Shake-up for Humberside and N Yorkshire proposed HUMBERSIDE and North Yorkshire counties would be abolished and replaced by seven unitary local authorities under recommendations published yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England. Three of the authorities would revert to the ancient Yorkshire title of Ridings. But Lincolnshire's two-tier structure would remain intact, with the status quo unchanged. The commission's four reports so far this year have in all cases recommended abolishing county councils and replacing them with unitary authorities. Arguing for leaving Lincolnshire unchanged, Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, said: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' If, as some district councillors claimed, there was genuine popular feeling to replace the county with unitary authorities, he would expect protests. Consultation would test which view was correct. The commission recommended, as expected, the demise of Humberside, but arguments are likely over North Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Two of the new authorities being created out of Humberside are on the south bank of the Humber and were in Lincolnshire before 1974. The commission wants to call them North East Lincolnshire - founded on Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes - and North Lincolnshire - based on Scunthorpe, Brigg and Barton. But they would be unitary authorities, administratively separate from Lincolnshire. On the north bank of the river, the rest of Humberside would split into two unitary authorities - the city of Kingston upon Hull and East Riding, including Beverley, Goole and Selby. North Yorkshire would be carved up into the city of York, West Riding (Dales) - based on Harrogate and Skipton - and North Riding, into which the commission has controversially pushed Richmond, Northallerton and Scarborough. The Association of County Councils said the commission had not done a bad job. But Mr Robin Wendt, ACC secretary added: 'It is not clear that the new structure will be better in all respects than the existing two-tier structure.' However, the Association of District Councils was fiercely critical of the entire package. It said the new North Riding authority would be unworkable, being more than double the size of the next largest unitary authority in the UK. Sir John said the commission's first-tranche proposals had involved 75 councils covering more than 6m people and spending Pounds 6bn a year. The commission had proposed 25 new unitary councils, saving between 10 and 12 per cent a year in administrative costs.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: How to steer round both road tolls and evaders Sir, How lucky Mr Harley is to live in such a generous country as Switzerland (Letters, August 17). I do not believe that the majority of sensibly minded motorway users in the UK would 'rebel' over paying Pounds 15 a year, or defect to the side roads. But when figures of 1.5p per motorway mile are bandied around, that could make things different. In my own case, Pounds 15 would give me about 11 days' motorway use at 1.5 pence per mile. At a rough calculation, my annual motorway bill would be about Pounds 250 at the above rate. With regard to any additional revenue required being added to the fuel cost then being lost in the 'Treasury maw', what is to stop them 'losing' the motorway tolls? A fairer system would be to abolish completely the Road Fund Licence, and put everything on to fuel. This would achieve the dual aim of making the user pay for road use, whether it is a motorway or otherwise, and making the tax evader a person of the past. But that is a whole different can of worms.

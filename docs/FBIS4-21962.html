			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexican attorney Jose Enrique Gonzalez Ruiz and  U.S. attorneys Peter Erlinder and Leonard Weinglass have been  hired by the Shining Path [SL] International Emergency Committee  (CIE) for the Defense of Abimael Guzman's Life, which has  appeared before the Inter-American Human Rights Committee (CIDH)  to condemn the Peruvian Government for the way it is treating  the Maoist leader.    Colombian attorney Juan Jose Landinez, who travelled to Lima  to support the SL efforts to get a group of legislators to visit  Guzman Reinoso to check his health conditions, has joined the  group of attorneys.    A large group of SL members believes Guzman has either died  or is in a regrettable psychological state because they do not  believe he is the author of the letter addressed to President  Alberto Fujimori, and less still the person who appears on the  videos asking his supporters to uphold the peace accord.    According to the latest "emergency bulletin" issued by the  CIE, headquartered in London, so far five delegations of jurists  and activists have arrived in Lima to ask the government and the  Supreme Court of Military Justice to authorize a visit to Guzman.    However, despite the government's opposition, the SL abroad  continues its efforts: "Other attorneys are ready to travel to  Lima to continue working until an authorization to visit Guzman  is granted (and) donations specifically for this juridical  project are welcome. The (Peruvian) Government will not be left  in peace on the subject," according to CIE members headed by  Abimael Guzman's in- laws.    Moreover, a "Letter of Protest" that will be sent to  President Fujimori has been circulated within U.S. intellectual  and artistic circles. The letterhead reads: "I support the  world demand that you end the abuse and isolation to which the  president of the Peruvian Communist Party, Abimael Guzman, is  subject."    As if this were not enough, the CIE has sent a delegation to  the Philippines and Japan headed by Yuri Kochiyama and Carolyn  Hadfield.    The SL is particularly interested in this visit to Japan  because in view of the fact that "Fujimori is of Japanese  descent, the campaigns of slander and lies against Guzman and  the peoples' war have been very spiteful in the Japanese media.  Chauvinistically (sic), Fujimori has been adopted as a Japanese  hero."    But they also are concerned over the fact that "since  Fujimori assumed the presidency, financial ties between Japan  and Peru have increased. During their visit to Japan, the CIE  representatives will disclose Japan's true role in Peru."    The CIE, in its exhaustive effort, has got the Pakistani  Human Rights Organization and the Kerala Communist Party of  India [as published] to also start campaigns in Guzman's favor  and to send letters of support to the CIDH.    As part of the campaign, the SL international branch also is  distributing a video in English entitled "You Must Tell the  World," describing the war unleashed against Guzman and his  supporters.    The video includes clips of Guzman's address to the Dincote  [National Counterterrorism Directorate], actions perpetrated by  terrorists who infiltrated the Raucana settlement, and  interviews with attorneys Luis Arce Borja; Guzman's lawyer,  Alfredo Crespo Baygrac; and the leader of the International  Revolutionary Movement, MRI, Heriberto Ocasio, who was in Lima  praising Guzman and his outrageous actions.    The only obstacles the SL has found abroad was the Belgian  Government's decision not to allow Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas to  enter the country. Olaechea was supposed to attend an event on  Peru in Brussels organized by the Belgian Anti-Imperialist  League.    Olaechea ended up sending a video recording of his address  to  the event in which, for a change, he asserts that the people's  war will win despite everything.    Is that all the Foreign Ministry was able to do? Is it aware  of the Shining Path propaganda agents' presence in Japan?</p>

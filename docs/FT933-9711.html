			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: A lifetime pursuit of the Nazis THE WIESENTHAL FILE by Alan Levy Constable Pounds 18.95, 463 pages ALTHOUGH Simon Wiesenthal, the most vigorous pursuer of Nazi murderers, has published memoirs, this claims to be the first critical study of his life and work. While much of it - the capture of Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires in May 1960, the abortive hunt for Josef Mengele, the tangled mess of Kurt Waldheim - is familiar territory, it has fresh strengths, not least the interlacing of interviews with and reflections by Wiesenthal. Levy writes with gentle respect and historical authority, whether dealing with the appalling brutalities suffered by Jews, Gypsies, Poles, and all the other 'sub-humans' subjected to Nazi violence, or the more recent fratricidal conflicts within the leadership of the Jewish diaspora. The latter is a rather more challenging task, since the actors and the issues which divide them are mostly still alive. Levy's careful delineation of the guerilla war between Wiesenthal and the World Jewish Congress is naturally crammed with ironies. It is a thorny conflict which has detracted from their central task, that of combatting anti-semitism. Eichmann and the rest played Jew against Jew; it is almost incomprehensible that, despite the absence of the paraphernalia of National Socialist power, Jewish communities nevertheless manage to squabble bitterly amongst themselves. It is shaming to all the key participants, Wiesenthal included; courageously, Levy exonerates no-one. But despite the petty rivalries over who did or did not get a Nobel peace prize - the pugnacious Wiesenthal did not, the more diplomatic Elie Wiesel did - Wiesenthal's story is compulsive reading. He survived four years in different concentration camps, enduring beatings and starvation. Once he was pulled out of a line of prisoners awaiting bullets to the head; the next was for him. Almost his first experience after being liberated by the US army was to be beaten up once again - this time by a Polish future deputy minister of culture. All his family - 89 people - died in the war, and he lost touch with his young wife early on. Yet she too survived, and through a miracle they were reunited in the refugee chaos of 1945. It would be unfair to criticise this book for failing to consider the lingering riddle of what conjunction of events created the climate that allowed the Nazis to conduct genocide. Yet that riddle is still at the heart of this subject. Living in Poland in the 1980s (Wiesenthal was born in Galicia), I often tried, and always failed, to learn why the nation most scarred by the Holocaust - and, apart from the former USSR, the most dubious in its post-war treatment of its Jewish communities - was still so permeated by anti-semitism, a feature which of course was denied at every opportunity, both officially and otherwise. I once quizzed an ethnically Jewish but by religion Roman Catholic Polish friend. Why did Poles still hate Jews so much? Wearily, his shoulders and said, 'Why not?'. It was, he implied, absurd to seek rational answers in an irrational context. But the question needs to be put, endlessly. It cannot be dispelled, even by embarrassment, tempting though that is. ('Boy, they sure were big on crematoriums, weren't they?' said George Bush during a visit to Auschwitz as US vice president in 1987.) Nor can it be evaded, as Eichmann attempted in his notorious (and possibly apocryphal) comment: 'A hundred dead people is a catastrophe. Six million dead is a statistic.' Wiesenthal has lived a requiem. He has always denied that he was motivated by hatred, claiming only to have sought justice. This year he will be 85. He can have no finer interpreter and sympathiser than Alan Levy, who has dealt justly with him.</p>

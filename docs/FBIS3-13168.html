			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kanchan Gupta] </F>   [Text] Pakistan has only itself to blame for the virtual  defeat it has suffered at the UN Human Rights Commission [UNHRC]  conference in Geneva, where it has to unconditionally withdraw  its politically motivated resolution that was aimed at  embarrassing New Delhi and subverting India's sovereignty over  Jammu and Kashmir. Faced with a grim prospect of being found out  for playing a game of lies and half-truth that would have led to  a defeat of its motion had it been voted upon, Islamabad had  dropped the paragraph calling for a UN factfinding mission to  visit Kashmir from its resolution on Tuesday [8 March]. This  paragraph was substituted with one that called upon India to  ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu and  Kashmir. This was obviously done in the hope that there would  be more takers for the resolution and it would be carried  through.    India, of course, had repudiated this latest maneuver, and  as  much was evident when Dr. Farooq Abdullah, articulating New  Delhi's response to the latest twist in Islamabad's devious  gameplan, told the delegates that no resolution touching any  aspect of Kashmir was acceptable to India.    Obviously, the Indian message had more takers than  Pakistan's  misadventurism, because by yesterday it was clear that 43 of the  53 members of the UNHRC had decided not to have anything to do  with the resolution. As for the remaining 10, obviously the  majority were poised to vote against the motion. India owes its  moral victory to various factors, including the excellent work  done by its delegation in Geneva. The minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who stationed himself in  Geneva, valiantly fought against each and every charge that was  leveled by Islamabad and its agencies masquerading as NGO's  [nongovernmental organizations]. Back at home, the prime  minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, made it clear that the Government  of India is not lacking in resolve as far as protecting Kashmir  from predators is concerned. The home minister, Mr. S.B.  Chavan's spirited defense of India's case on Kashmir and its  pledge to stake everything to defeat the Pakistani gameplan also  contributed toward weakening Islamabad's resolve. Credit should  also be given to China and Iran for finally convincing Pakistan  about the folly of its action.    Will Pakistan learn a lesson from the humiliation it has  suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the conference shows that  while rhetoric as resorted to by the Pakistan prime minister,  Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it does not yield results.  India believes in peaceful coexistence with its neighbors and  has consistently reiterated its commitment to bilateral  dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having traversed the path of  defeat -- will now realize that there is no substitute for  peace, truth, and honesty. It is also hoped that Pakistan will  stop stoking the fires that it has lit in Kashmir and honor  India's territorial integrity. However, it remains to be seen  if Ms. Bhutto's government has the political courage to accept  defeat and mend its ways.</p>

The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $83,847.58, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Alameda Chevron,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (Alameda) on October 22, 1980. Under the Remedial Order, Alameda and the 15 gasoline retailers whose names appear in the Appendix immediately following this Decision were found to have violated the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products between August 1, 1979 and January 27, 1980 (the Audit periods).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of Alameda motor gasoline or gasoline from one or more of the retailers named in the Appendix will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of gasoline they purchased from one of the retailers named in the Appendix during the audit period. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. &sect;4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications have been set forth in Section III of the Decision immediately following this notice. Refund applications should be mailed to the address listed at the beginning of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless labelled as ``confidential'', all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George B.

Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of monies remitted by Alameda Chevron and 15 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order (hereafter, the Order) issued by OHA on October 22, 1980, to those firms and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. Each firm's name, case number and amount of money remitted to remedy its pricing violations has been set out in the Appendix immediately following this Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the Order, a total of $83,847.58 has been remitted to DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred during the relevant audit periods. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. See Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow Account,'' August 30, 1993. This Decision sets forth OHA's plan to distribute those funds. The specific application requirements appear in Section III of this Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

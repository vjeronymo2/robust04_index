			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Axa up 26% at mid-year point Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday bucked the trend in the sector by reporting group net profits up 26 per cent to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 293m) in the first six months of the year. Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, forecast that, in the absence of 'major catastrophes' in its insurance and reinsurance markets, full-year profits would be up on last year's FFr2.04bn. Axa's total consolidated revenues rose 10 per cent to FFr65.9bn during the first half of the year, while revenues, including unconsolidated mutual companies, stood at FFr71.2bn compared with FFr64.8bn in the same period last year. Consolidated premium income from the group's life businesses rose by a third to FFr7.2bn, while non-life premiums rose by just 8 per cent to FFr8.2bn during the first half. Axa's worldwide net group income from reinsurance increased nearly three-fold to FFr143m from FFr49m, with a 13 per cent increase in financial services and property to FFr304m. Losses from holding company activities dropped to FFr10m from FFr31m, while those from intra-group transfers from subsidiaries and equity holdings rose to FFr296m from FFr187m. Geographically, group consolidated net income from France rose 7 per cent to FFr393m, while that from the US rose to FFr224m from FFr4m as a result of the recovery in the Equitable, the insurer controlled by Axa. However, net income from the UK dropped 22 per cent to FFr200m, while falling 15 per cent to FFr88m for the group's activities in the rest of the world.</p>

'It is natural that after leaving Volvo, I should also leave the SE-Banken board so that I remain free for the future,' he said. Mr Gyllenhammar has been a board member at SE-Banken since 1979, and vice-chairman since 1991. He is expected to step down at the bank's annual general meeting in April.</p>

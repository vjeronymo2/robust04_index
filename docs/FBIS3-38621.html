			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Dausend: "Trend Changes: More and More </F> Move East"]    [Text] The direction of population movements between  eastern and western Germany is increasingly changing. The  number of western Germans taking up residence in the new laender  has been increasing from year to year, while fewer and fewer  eastern Germans are moving west. Whereas 395,343 people moved  from east to west in 1990, the figure for 1992 was about half  that. By contrast, in 1992, 111,345 people from the old laender  found a new home in eastern Germany --that is, almost three  times as many as two years ago.    In the first half of last year, this trend gained in  momentum. By the end of May 1993, the Federal Office of  Statistics in Weisbaden registered the departure of 75,588  people from the new laender. During the same period, 55,907  citizens from the western part of the country took up residence  east of the former demarcation line. Projected figures for the  whole year indicate that 180,000 people will have left the east  and 135,000 will have moved there --the gap is closing. The  main reason for this development is that many people starting  out in a career want to begin in the east: "Young lawyers and  doctors, as well as bank employees, can often make more rapid  career progress in the new laender than in the west," says  Stefanie Wahl of the Bonn Institute for the Economy and Society  (IWG). As a result, urban centers such as the "boom region"  Leipzig-Halle are particularly popular with those starting their  careers in the east.    However, the number of people returning to the east is also  continually rising, and that benefits the economy there.  According to Stefanie Wahl, in the west these people "often  obtained professional qualifications that they can now use."    For one group in the population -- that is, foreigners --  the  trend has already been reversed. In the first five months of  last year, 5,769 foreigners moved from the east to the west, and  6,177 moved to the east.</p>

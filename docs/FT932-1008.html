			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Observer: Bankophobia Henry Ford the First's aversion to borrowing from banks has infected flamboyant Frenchman Hubert Perrodo, majority owner of oil explorer Kelt Energy. One clash too many with Britain's financial community has resolved him to shun bank finance even if it slows up his ambitious plans for the company. After the disastrous takeover two years ago of another oil company, Carless, he was forced to hand over most of Kelt's exploration assets to a group of banks in return for writing off its debts. Now he vows he'd rather miss a deal than go back to the banks. 'The problem with them is that they aren't on the same wavelength as us. It's not their fault, but they want a pay-back within two or three years and I can't get oil out of the ground before five.' Perrodo, who as chairman of Kelt draws no salary, says he still has Dollars 60m in the bank from the sale of a drilling company. Kelt has just agreed a deal with Scottish Power for the electricity company to finance the development of a Kelt gas find which will then fuel a power station. 'We could have financed that ourselves if we'd gone to the bank, but no way] I'd rather take less of the production and let someone else deal with the banks.'</p>

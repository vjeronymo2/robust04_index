			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, April 30 (AFP) -- Rival troops clashed again  north of Sanaa Saturday [30 April], pushing formerly divided  north and south Yemen closer to civil war as both sides sought  help from Arab states to resolve the conflict.    A southern military spokesman in Aden said elite northern  Republican Guards "resumed criminal actions against elements of  the (southern) third armoured brigade," deployed in the 'Imran  region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa.    The northern troops wanted to dislodge the brigade from  positions it had occupied since ferocious tank battles Wednesday  and Thursday that left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others  wounded, according to journalists.    The defence ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed and  119 wounded in the 'Imran fighting, while an unknown number of  others had fled or disappeared.    A ministry spokesman quoted by the official news agency  SABA'  blamed "rebel elements in the (southern) Yemen Socialist Party"  for the clashes, saying they were part of a plan "aimed at the  partition of Yemen."    He said 159 homes were damaged in the fighting.    The clashes were the heaviest since former North and South  Yemen were unified in May 1990.    In the latest fighting the northern forces were backed by  tribesmen "hired by Sanaa," according to the southern spokesman.    The Bakil tribe has traditionally supported the south, while  the Hashid has backed the north. Both are well equipped and can  together raise forces of about 100,000 men.    The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000,  have never merged since unification.    The southern troops were "still resisting the attacks," the  southern spokesman said, and were backed by local people and  "patriotic tribesmen." Yemen's political crisis erupted in  August, when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner,  refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic  and military reforms.    Yemeni political observers said the chances for  reconciliation between al-Bid and his rival, President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, were diminishing as each side accused the other  of separatism.    Al-Bid urged Arab countries to intervene to prevent the  conflict escalating Saturday.    In a telephone conversation with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al  Qadhdhafi, quoted by the Libyan news agency JANA, al-Bid said he  was "worried about the deteriorating situation" in Yemen.    "The Arab nation should intervene to save Yemen from civil  war and fratricidal massacres," he said.    Meanwhile, Yemen's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani  arrived in Riyadh with a message for King Fahd from Salih on the  situation in Yemen and a bilateral border dispute.    The Saudi-Yemeni disagreement centres on the provinces of  Assir, Najran and Jizan, which were handed to Saudi Arabia under  an agreement signed in 1934.    Yemen, which claims the provinces, says the accord expired  in  1992.    Saudi-Yemeni relations soured following Iraq's August 1990  invasion of Kuwait, when Yemeni leaders voiced support for Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn.    Prior to unification North Yemen maintained close economic  ties with Saudi Arabia, while South Yemen was staunchly Marxist.    In Sanaa Saturday six small Yemeni opposition parties called  for a "national salvation government" to be set up to implement  a reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid in Amman  on February 20.    They accused the northern and the southern leaders of  "plotting against unity."    Meanwhile the YSP accused President Salih of personally  "directing the war" against supporters of al-Bid, and demanded  that Salih's brother, Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, be tried for  "war crimes."    In a statement broadcast on Aden radio and television the  YSP  said Salih had "ordered the destruction" of the southern brigade  based in 'Imran by northern forces led by Ahmar.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Vykolov] </F>   [Excerpts] Stockholm, 2 Jun -- The second day of Russian  Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha's visit to Denmark began  with a speech at a meeting of environmental protection and  finance ministers of the countries of eastern and central  Europe. [passage omitted]    The reduction in industrial production, A. Zaveryukha noted  in particular, has not led to a corresponding reduction in  environmental pollution in Russia. One-fifth of the population  lives in conditions where there is a permanently high level of  air pollution, and there has been no improvement in the quality  of drinking water. Research into the consequences of the  Chernobyl accident show that the border of the zone with soil  contaminated with radioactive caesium-137 in excess of one curie  per cubic kilometer has increased by 8.8 square kilometers.  This zone today includes the territory of 17 oblasts.    The increase in soil erosion -- which affects 56 percent of  agricultural land in differing degrees -- is particularly  worrying.

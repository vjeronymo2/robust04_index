			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "There Will Also Be a Parliamentary Press </F> Club"]    [Text] Bratislava--On the basis of ideas raised at the  working meeting of the Slovak Television Council with the STV  [Slovak Television] management and representatives of 13  political parties on 7 April, the Council arrived at the opinion  that it is necessary to set permanent rules with a view to  enhancing objectivity and plurality in STV's news and current  affairs programs. This is stated in a statement that the Slovak  Television Council made available to the TA SR yesterday.    In the spirit of the Law on Slovak Television, the Council  decided that, after every concluded meeting of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic, a "parliamentary press club"  will be broadcast, to be attended by representatives of all  clubs of deputies. At the same time, the Council asks the STV  central director to ensure in the program, as of May, 60 to 80  minutes a month for the views of representatives of those  extraparliamentary political entities that achieved at least 2  percent of the electoral vote in the parliamentary elections.  The Council also approved the principle that the first  "Aktuality" program [main newscast broadcast at 1930 local time]  will be exclusively news-oriented (without commentaries), with  greater emphasis on coverage of developments across Slovakia.    The Council asks that the idea be reconsidered of returning  to the operation of the Television (as well as Radio) Council  according to the principle of proportional representation of all  decisive political entities. The statement draws attention to  the fact that this would once again turn the Slovak Television  Council into an object of political contest.</p>

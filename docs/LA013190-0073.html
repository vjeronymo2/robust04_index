			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ISAAC STERN PERFORMS AT PHILHARMONIC BENEFIT  </P> <P> It was time for the Los Angeles Philharmonic pension fund concert, Monday at  the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and the call of "Round up the usual suspects!"  must have gone out. The names may change, but the faces -- and the music -- are  always familiar at these annual benefits.  </P> <P> For this edition the guests were conductor Leonard Slatkin and violinist Isaac  Stern, and their subject matter was three middle-period Beethoven classics.  </P> <P> The good news was that the occasion found the 69-year-old violinist near the  peak of his form. There were patches of mechanical disinterest and technical  lapses, but for the most part Stern played with consistent spirit and control.  </P> <P> His tone was bright and clear, seldom edgy, and the bravura bits  well-articulated. He seemed more concerned with expressive elegance than  muscular extroversion. He found particular passion in the Kreisler cadenzas,  which he shaped with vigorous purpose and integrated into the concerto with  rare authority and point.  </P> <P> A miscalculation was the slow tempo for the Larghetto. Mining the wistful  subtext, Stern projected affecting moments, but couldn't sustain a sense of  connectedness and direction. The Rondo was also taken somewhat deliberately,  but there the feeling was one of relaxed brio.  </P> <P> Slatkin and a reduced band of beneficiaries accompanied gracefully, with  tellingly deployed reserves of power. Occasionally they overwhelmed Stern's  efforts, but the whole was a cohesive joy.  </P> <P> For their own, Slatkin and the orchestra had the "Egmont" Overture and the  Eighth Symphony. Slatkin's Eighth was swift, limber and dramatic, marked by  strong dynamic contrasts and articulative punch. His "Egmont" -- the distortion  of the opening sarabande rhythm aside -- was similar, both expressive and  illuminative.  </P> <P> The musicians responded with alert, balanced strength. Ensemble values were  surprisingly high, given the limited rehearsal, in performances that repaid the  benefaction with interest. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

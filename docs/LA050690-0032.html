			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOG-WALKERS' DUTIES  </P> <P> I continue to be amazed and angered at the actions and non-actions of some dog  owners. I personally love dogs and have had many over the years.  </P> <P> But I don't understand how people continue to parade by my home and others and  joyfully leave the smelly evidence of your trek practically at our doorsteps.  What do you think happens to it?  </P> <P> To those of you who scoop after your dogs: thanks. To those of you who keep  your dogs leashed and scoop on our beaches: bravo. To those of you who don't  care about the awful odors and unhealthy conditions you subject us and our  children to on our beaches, sidewalks and streets: enough and beware! There's a  group forming that is tired of holding its noses, and we're not going to take  it any longer.  </P> <P> ED GAZICH  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

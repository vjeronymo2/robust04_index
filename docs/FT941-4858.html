			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs hit MR-Data MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing group, reported lower interim pre-tax profits reflecting one-off reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in its Memex software division. In the six months to December 31 profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 2.66m (Pounds 4.02m) on turnover up 5 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 18.6m). Earnings per share declined to 3.21p (4.89p). However, the interim dividend is being raised by 20 per cent to 2.076p (1.73p) reflecting the group's strong balance sheet and cash position. Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'During the past months we have reorganised our business resulting in significant one-off costs which have been absorbed in the first half. Additionally profits have been affected by the on-going development costs at Memex. 'However, we are operating in high growth markets and, in particular, prospects for our software products and our laser printing and document scanning service bureau are extremely good. We therefore remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.' Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m) mainly reflecting the development costs at Memex. The 1992 figure was boosted, following accounting rule changes, by the writing back of Pounds 651,000 of acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by reorganisation costs of Pounds 382,000. Mr Redmond said the redundancy and reorganisation costs in the document image processing division would result in annual savings of Pounds 710,000 and were necessary to reposition the business for growth. In the core data transcription division the COM and laser printing bureau services both increased production volumes, turnover and profit. Margins in both businesses also improved. Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 212,000 (Pounds 365,000) although the group ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 9.57m, up by Pounds 2.69m from June 30, partly reflecting the crystalisation of a Pounds 1.05m exchange gain.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Supreme Council Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze to </F> television viewers and Supreme Council deputies on the occasion  of Christmas from the studio in Tbilisi on 9 January--recorded]    [Text] Dear television viewers, Merry Christmas and a Happy  New Year! I wish you joy and happiness. As you know, our  parliament will not resume its work until 18 January, and there  are some acute, pressing issues that have to be discussed by  both the deputies and the public as a whole. Therefore, let me  address you and the members of the Georgian parliament with a  short speech.    Dear colleagues, friends. Merry Christmas and a Happy New  Year. I wish you happiness, together with Georgia. If Georgia  is not happy, then God forbid our happiness.    We have lived several months through an illusion reminiscent  of a temporary mitigation of acute pain through the use of  painkillers. The war with the invaders has stopped by our  joining the CIS. A definite chance for our survival has  emerged. We must use every minute, but we are still slow. Once  again, we are facing the danger of physical self-destruction,  and we are watching with folded arms how intense Cain-like  actions are becoming. There still is the fear: What if we lose  the title of a patriot? What if I do not come across as a good  man?    The question is whether the country and the people are going  to survive. It is a question of life and death. All of us have  forgotten that we are living in an age of technical  civilization, when the global danger of destruction is greater  than ever before. If a long time used to be needed to destroy a  country, now it requires only a matter of hours. I do not mean  a weapon of mass destruction.    Georgia has lost thousands of lives in recent years. We have  over 200,000 refugees. Georgia has suffered huge financial  losses. The country that was built badly--or maybe well--has  been destroyed, Marriage and birth rates have dwindled  dramatically. Drug addiction is on the rampage. Children's  lives and health are in danger. The hereditary potential of the  nation is in danger. Every normal citizen must think of only  one thing: to save the country somehow from the current  catastrophic process of autogenocide. Those who think that this  is just excessive panic have ambition that is more important to  them than the fate of the country.    I may be mistaken, but there is no time for doubts now.  Waiting and useless postponement is the evil today. It is not  like me to look for the culprit who drove the country to this  state and to blame someone or a group of people. We must stop  passing the buck if we want to avoid the fate of the Biblical  [word indistinct]. Yes, we are all to blame for whatever has  happened to us. God will judge us for our sins very soon. It  is the punishment for a lie. If we do not stop telling lies,  then our judgment will continue. It is clear. All it takes is  normal reasoning, an elemental conscience, and a sense of  responsibility.    The war has changed its face today. It has been socially  reincarnated. Our own compatriots--by carrying out a  sabotage--are trying to slit those vital arteries that are still  pulsating, to break the power and engineering system, to get  hold of fuel, and to deprive the country of a possibility for  life. The country is being brutally murdered by bandits wearing  either ties or guns. The treasury has been destroyed. In  effect, we are a country that does not have money. People are  dying of hunger. Children and women have become miserable and  poor. Moral norms, which still exist, are dwindling day by day.  If Davit Guramishvili [Georgian poet] were looking at our  conditions today, he would forget the trouble that Georgia was  living through in his time. We all know it very well.    What will save us? Only telling the truth. We must give our  condition a name and an accurate diagnosis and think about  tomorrow. Before we say something, compare the thought with the  inner voice of our conscience. I will tell you directly what  nearly 99 percent of the population thinks, but not a single  percent says what they are thinking aloud. I will tell you what  I have to say, irrespective of what you do. Trample me over or  embellish me with different epithets of a traitor. I prefer to  die rather than live such life. Therefore, do not let anybody  think that I will be afraid. Neither should they think that  they will traditionally go down in history as patriots or  traitors. This time it will be God who will decide who is a  traitor.    God forgive me for using his name so frequently, but even a  poisoned atheist must see now that God is near us, and he is not  stroking us but is here with fire and a sword because we are  telling lies and are lying to the country. If we do not  comprehend this, then more disaster will come. It is wrong to  say what additional disaster can happen to us.    By joining the CIS, we have made one step forward toward  Russia, and Russia toward us. They are not throwing their hats  up in the air exclaiming: What happiness! Georgia has honored  us! Russia is telling us directly that she will move forward to  us by as many steps as we move toward her. We will be your  brothers if you want to be our brothers.    We are talking with Russia by issuing ultimatums, however.  We can talk to Russia in the language of brotherhood and trust,  and it will be more honorable. Personally, I will be proud to  be Russia's brother, but those who will not probably have a  better brother. I will tell you honestly that we will not find  a more reliable brother than Russia. There are no states or  families who do not have brothers or allies.    I call on you to talk to Russia in the same language as the  great Ilya Chavchavadze [Georgian 19th century writer] used to  talk to Russia. Ilya is more alive today than any of us is  alive. I call on you to talk to Russia in the language of trust  and friendship. If we are late, however, then we will cease to  exist. If we were to survive, then nobody would want to be our  brother. Let us talk to Russia in the same way as our fathers  and grandfathers did. Russia saved us once. She united a  country torn asunder. If we do not admit it, then let me remind  you that God does not like either an ungrateful man or people.  It is a Biblical truth.    I know that I will irritate you, but may you be irritated. I  would rather kneel before Russia than see my people kneel. If  somebody else has a talent to do the contrary, then may God  judge them. I support talking to Russia in the language of  brotherhood, trust, and openness. I am asking her to support my  country actively in order to save it and to help get to its feet.    I would like to ask those who have a different view not to  waste time by talking about my treachery but to give us, not an  alternative for Georgia's heroic self-destruction, but a  specific program for saving Georgia honorably.    I will be more specific. Let those who have a different view  present to us an alternative view, but not the traditional  rigmarole like: Some resolution must be found. Let them present  only specific views.    The issue of joining the ruble zone must be put on the  agenda  as soon as possible. I am not sure whether we will be accepted,  but we must try. We are the country where there is no money,  and there are no salaries. History has not seen a country  without money for a long time. If anybody knows of other  financial sources and possibilities, then I admire him. I will  remind you once again. I am talking specifically about cash and  not an indulgence. Clever politicians will favor this point of  view, but those people whose pockets are lined with dollars and  rubles will, of course, oppose it. They are making a mistake  here, however, because their dollars or rubles will go down the  drain if the country is destroyed.    Those who say that order can only be maintained by using  law-  enforcement bodies are mistaken because a penniless policemen is  a potential bandit and maybe a real one. A hungry policeman  will be thinking of getting food, and he will not be thinking  about high ideals and state order.    Deputies, it must not be difficult either for you or for  Russia to guess about the tragic state of the author of these  lines. I wanted and still want the kind of Georgia that will be  able, not only to defend itself, but also to defend others. I  repeat: Georgia has to be saved today. I call on all of you to  stop labelling me and to think about the way to save Georgia, a  way that can be seen.    Vakhtang Goguadze. Thank you for your attention.</p>

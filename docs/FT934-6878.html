			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Hungary for UK exports Britain is to export its know-how on enterprise agencies to Hungary in an attempt to help the former communist country foster entrepreneurship. Final plans are still being worked out, but the main principles were revealed last week in Budapest by Tony Faint, a senior civil servant involved with the UK's Know-How Fund for assisting the development of market economies in the former eastern bloc. Faint was addressing a conference organised by the OECD and B'nai B'rith, a UK-based Jewish charity which frequently lends its own members - many of them former refugees from eastern Europe - as small business consultants Three years into market reforms, the conference was told, many of Hungary's small and medium-sized businesses are short of working capital. Many have already mortgaged their assets so they have little collateral to offer their banks, which are themselves short on liquidity. 'But we need partnership, not assistance,' Peter Szirmai, president of the Association of Hungarian Entrepreneurs, emphasised. 'We don't have enough experience.' What he says his members do not want, however, are more consultants with services to sell; they cannot afford them. Kata Koves, vice-president of the Hungarian women entrepreneurs' association, said: 'My experience is quite frightening. Most of our 400 members live without a business plan and from hand to mouth.' The UK's enterprise agencies developed out of a similar need. Sponsored by government, local authorities and the private sector, their role was to offer free advice. Hungary is already following the UK pattern by planning a network of similar agencies. Faint said the UK would concentrate on making the Hungarian network strong, with proper training, using Durham University Business School and links to experienced agencies in Britain, possibly with exchanges of staff. 'We also want to help development of entrepreneurial attitudes and practice in the general population,' he added. He cited Shell's Livewire scheme, which helps train young entrepreneurs for self-employment, as an example.</p>

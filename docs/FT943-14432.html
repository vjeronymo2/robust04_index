			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bilfinger &amp; Berger emerges as Buderus shareholder Bilfinger &amp; Berger, one of Germany's largest construction groups, yesterday emerged as the surprise owner of a 15 per cent stake in Buderus, the German heating equipment and engineering group. The news follows last month's placing of 80 per cent of Buderus on the German stock exchanges by Metallgesellschaft, the troubled conglomerate. Buderus shares were suspended yesterday. The move is widely seen in Germany as a prelude to a possible battle for control of the highly profitable Buderus. Both Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank each have a 10 per cent stake in the engineering group. Mr Christian Roth, Bilfinger chairman, disclosed the news of the shareholding at Bilfinger's annual meeting yesterday. He said that Bilfinger was in talks with Buderus management board. Although a Buderus official statement said that it welcomed Bilfinger as a long-term shareholder, Mr Reinhard Engel, a director of Buderus, said there had been no talks with Bilfinger and there was no possibility of business co-operation. 'There is no evidence to suggest that there is anything suspicious about this holding,' said Mr Engel. 'We see it in a neutral light: we are not enthusiastic but we are not disappointed either.' Secret stake-building is shortly to become illegal in Germany under the terms of the Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz, the second Financial Markets Promotion Act, which is likely to come into force on August 1. The law will oblige companies to disclose stakes once they reach 5 per cent, providing an early warning system for German companies. There are no takeover rules in Germany akin to the UK Takeover Code. The stake-building also appears to contradict the terms of the placing of Buderus shares last month, in which Metallgesellschaft obtained DM1.2bn (Dollars 788m) for its 80 per cent shareholding. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank arranged the placing of Metallgesellschaft's Buderus stake with the declared aim of ensuring that Buderus would be owned by a broad spread of shareholders. Deutsche Bank said it had been told about Bilfinger's purchases yesterday by Dresdner, a 25 per cent shareholder in Bilfinger. Dresdner refused to answer specific questions about its role in helping Bilfinger buy the Buderus shares. Buderus made pre-tax profits of DM133m (Dollars 81.5m) last year on sales of DM2.77bn.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Retention of fraud conspiracy law is defended The controversial offence of conspiracy to defraud should be retained pending the outcome of a wider review of the law of dishonesty, the Law Commission said yesterday. The commission, which has been examining the offence since 1989, said its abolition at this stage would leave 'major gaps in the criminal law'. The law reform body does, however, call for an immediate change in the law to make it possible to convict people obtaining loans, such as mortgages, by deception. Mr Stephen Silber QC, the law commissioner, said this would aid the fight against mortgage fraud. Conspiracy to defraud, which is a common law offence, has had a chequered history. Between a House of Lords decision in 1984 and the 1987 Criminal Justice Act a person could not be charged with it unless what was alleged did not amount to a conspiracy to commit a substantive offence such as theft. Prosecutors said that such limitations on the use of the offence hindered the fight against serious fraud. The Roskill fraud trials committee agreed with them and the restrictions were removed by the 1987 act. Prosecutors still say the offence has practical advantages. It reduces the chances of separate trials being ordered where a number of defendants are involved. Sometimes it is the only offence that can reasonably be charged. Critics say over-reliance on the offence by prosecutors is responsible for many of the problems which have dogged long and complex fraud trials in recent years. They say that it can apply to agreements between one or more people to do something which is in itself lawful. The offence is said to be too wide because it overlaps with statutory conspiracy and substantive offences such as theft and obtaining by deception. Its breadth also means it covers conduct which arguably should not be criminal at all. Critics say the scope of the offence is vague and uncertain and this infringes the principle that it should be possible to ascertain in advance whether any particular conduct is criminal. But the commission says pending a review of dishonesty, which is under way, it would be wrong to remove it. It says the offence often paints a more accurate overall picture of a fraud than a list of specific offences, and if it was removed thieves who stole confidential information, gaming swindlers and people who dishonestly delayed payment of debts would go unpunished.</p>

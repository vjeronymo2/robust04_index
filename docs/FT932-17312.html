			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ocean profits plunge Pounds 35m - Losses on disposals and heavy restructuring costs hit hard OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services company, yesterday reported a fall in profits due to recession and restructuring costs. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 51m to Pounds 16m in the year to December 31. The profits shortfall included a Pounds 16m loss on a disposal and Pounds 8.4m of restructuring costs. At the interim stage Ocean reported a 10 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 20.8m. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the company remained cautious about the outlook for its markets. Turnover increased 6.2 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn. But higher costs, and the restructuring charge saw operating profits fall 30 per cent to Pounds 38.1m. The loss on disposal referred to the sale of Ocean's non-UK bulk liquid storage business. Freight and distribution services, which includes MSAS and McGregor Cory, reported a slight fall in operating profits from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 16m, mainly because of depreciation and other costs associated with MSAS's new computer systems. Operating profits from marine services fell more than Pounds 6m to Pounds 24.1m amid falling demand for offshore oil services. Mr Barber said a downturn in the North Sea prompted the company to shift its exploration vessels, mainly to the Far East. Environmental services announced a 21 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 4m. Earnings on a FRS 3 basis were 2p (24.6p). Ignoring the losses on disposals and restructuring costs, earnings were 17.5p. The company is proposing a maintained final dividend of 9.62p to make an unchanged total of 14.33p. The shares closed up 2p at 283p. COMMENT These results were well flagged so the frightening profits fall - in headline terms - caused few ripples in the City. Analysts were slightly disappointed the company was less upbeat about freight forwarding, where computing costs are likely to continue to drag. However, after a gloomy picture at the interim stage, oil services performed creditably thanks to the timely move east. This year a number of factors will work in Ocean's favour, even if the company's caution about its markets proves correct. The company should recoup most of last year's restructuring costs through greater efficiencies while, if the dollar remains stable against sterling, there should be a currency benefit of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Forecast profits of Pounds 44m put the shares on just under 14 times. Until there are more signs of life from its markets, that rating looks about right.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>   [Text] La Paz, Baja California Sur, 28 Feb -- The Chamber  of Deputies and the Senate, through a special committee, will  soon present to the Foreign Relations Secretariat a legal  proposal to renegotiate with the United States the International  Treaty on Limits and Waters [Tratado Internacional de Limites y  Aguas] signed by the two countries in 1944, because the  neighboring country has flooded the soil of Mexicali and Tijuana  with saltpetrous water and infected it with agrochemical and  fecal residues, thus rendering all that territory uncultivable.    A total of 30,000 hectares have been affected, and this  caused not only huge losses to wheat crops but also to human  life (from 1979 to 1992) due to the emergence of new and  fulminating diseases such as acute meningoencephalitis, which  attacks the brain directly and kills in less than 72 hours.    Legislators of all parties met here today with jurists,  researchers, and specialists on this issue to discuss the  problem and determine the terms and juridical recourses that  could be used to renegotiate and renew this treaty with which  the United States has failed to comply for the past 20 years.    In 1993 alone Mexico received from tributaries of the  Colorado River in the United States 10 million cubic meters of  mud in which large concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and  calcium were detected. They "have ruined the productivity of  the land and have irreversibly contaminated human life, flora,  fauna, and aquatic life." Moreover, as was already mentioned,  also detected in those waters were the free-living protozoan  amoebas [protosoario amiba de vida libre], which reproduce when  in contact with organic matters, such as feces, and cause  diseases such as the aforementioned acute meningoencephalitis  which affects people swimming in such waters. This problem  worsened last year when the Colorado River overflowed into the  Mexicali Valley. This nearly flooded the city. As a result,  the Permanent Committee of the Chamber of Deputies instructed  the Border Affairs Committee to verify the scope of the damage  and determine whether the overflowing of the Colorado River  violated the treaty in question.    A special subcommittee chaired by Deputy Javier Cital  Camacho  conducted the respective study and concluded that "the  provisions contained in the International Treaty on Limits and  Waters signed by Mexico and the United States are inadmissible  and unfair to our country."    The document was also signed by Ernesto Enciso Clark and  Rafael Morgan of the National Action Party [PAN]; Marta  Maldonado of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Jorge  Tovar Montanez of the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]; Rogelio  Appel Chacon, Oscar Garzon, and Luis Moreno Bustamante of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party; and Javier Colorado Pulido of  the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution. In this document  they concluded that there is no compatibility between the  hydraulic systems of the two countries, and thus, the flow  [desfogue] of solid matters that ends up at the Morelos Dam  "provokes permanent storage and contamination of our waterways  [vasos]." This is "highly and dangerously harmful to the  Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys."    For these reasons they proposed renegotiating the treaty to  turn it into a document that "promotes the principles of good  neighborliness, international respect, fair treatment, and good  intentions." They also pointed out that a new treaty should  include the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, Sonora, and the Gulf  of California Mar de Cortes. They said that the United States  must expand its ability to retain solid matters at water bodies  above the Gila River and promote the construction of reservoir  systems and regulators to prevent the flow of mud, among other  things.    These proposals were revealed today during a forum to  analyze  the treaty. It was headed by Governor Guillermo Mercado Romero  and Agustin Basave Benitez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies  Border Affairs Committee. Also present at the forum were Jose  Ramirez Roman, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Health  Committee; PAN members Tomas Esparza Carlos, Ernesto Encizo, and  Rafael Morgan; PRD member Marta Maldonado; PPS member Jorge  Escobar; and specialists Rodolfo Moreno Dahma, Maria Valdes,  Luis Flores Lui, Manuel Ortega, and Jesus Roman Galleros.    The latter, who is a researcher at the School of the  Northern  Border and in charge of the Environmental Studies Department,  said that this issue is extremely delicate and requires an  urgent solution because concentrations of salt of 2 kg per cubic  meter of water coming from the United States have been detected.  This, he added, is without taking into account the organic  residues and mud coming from the other side of the border.  "Water coming from the United States is completely contaminated,  and this is so because the dam system along the Colorado River  is the most controlled system in the world." It contains 2,500  km of water flow controlled by 39 dams that at the lower end  release into Mexico a heavy load of contaminants from  agroindustrial residues.    In a speech Agustin Basave warned that this string of  problems with the United States threatens to deteriorate our  bilateral relationship. He added that in this case a definitive  or "lasting" [de largo aliento] solution must be sought, because  it is no longer advisable to postpone discussion or a possible  renegotiation of this issue.    [Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish on 3 March carries a  600-word article on page 4 stating that: "Following more than 11  hours of negotiations, the Chamber of Deputies Border Affairs  Committee has decided to propose to the government of the  republic a `review' of Act 242 on limits and waters signed with  the United States instead of proposing a 'renegotiation' of the  entire treaty, because the latter would create more conflicts  between the two nations." Committee Chairman Agustin Basave  points out that this issue will be brought up at the upcoming  Mexico-U.S. binational meeting in April at the Port of Huatulco,  because this problem "is increasing tension in the relations"  between the two countries.]</p>

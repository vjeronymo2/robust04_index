			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Phil Collins wins court case - European court rules to prevent sales of bootleg recordings PHIL Collins, the British rock performer, yesterday won the backing of the European Court of Justice in his attempt to prevent the sale in Germany of unauthorised recordings of his music. The court in Luxembourg held that the non-discrimination provisions of the EC Treaty meant that Germany had to grant copyright protection to all Community citizens and not just to its own nationals. The case arose from an unauthorised recording of a Phil Collins concert in California in 1983. The recording was made on a cassette tape recorder. It was used to make bootleg vinyl records, cassette tapes and compact discs which were sold through legitimate retail outlets in Germany. Phil Collins asked a Munich court to allow him to take action against the recording company, Imtrat Handelsgesellschaft. German copyright law would have allowed a German performer to prevent the distribution of unauthorised recordings. The Munich court referred the case to the European Court for an adjudication on whether EC law required the protection to be extended to other Community nationals as well. The Luxembourg court held that it did. Warner Germany, Phil Collins's record company, said yesterday's ruling should result in revenues from pirate recordings in the country being halved from their current level of DM200m. The company said DM85m of unauthorised sales come from bootleg recordings made at live performances. The remainder of the pirate market consists of unauthorised copies of legitimate albums, as well as parallel imports. Warner said it had decided not to put pressure on retailers to stop selling the recordings until the European court ruling was announced. It said the decision ended a period of uncertainty for German music outlets and it expected that they would comply with it. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents record companies worldwide, said the Collins decision was a 'landmark ruling'. It added: 'This effectively closes a gap in EC legal protection. This gives artists the right to say if and how their recordings are released.'</p>

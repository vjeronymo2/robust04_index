			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / BAe sells stake in truck group BRITISH AEROSPACE has severed its ownership link with Daf through the sale of its 10.9 per cent stake in the failed Dutch truckmaker for a nominal sum. The BAe holding in Daf had become almost worthless following the truckmaker's collapse into receivership three weeks ago. In information filed with the stock exchanges in Amsterdam and London, Daf said that BAe had sold its entire holding of 10.9 per cent of the Daf issued share capital via the Amsterdam stock exchange to unknown buyers. BAe confirmed the share disposal last night and said that it had received only a 'modest amount'. Mr Friso Meeter, one of Daf's two Dutch receivers, said earlier this week that shareholders in the old Daf would not receive anything for their shares. 'It is definite that shareholders will not have a turn' when it came to dividing the company's assets, he said. The core heavy truck manufacturing operations of the old Daf company in the Netherlands and in Belgium are to be transferred later this week into a newly capitalised company Daf Trucks NV. BAe announces today its 1992 financial results, which will include an amount for the write-down of its Daf stake. Overall BAe has done well out of the 40 per cent stake in Daf it acquired in 1988 when it took over Rover for Pounds 150m. In 1989 it disposed of more than half of the Daf stake for Fl 321m (Pounds 90m).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> OMI asserts that given the limited time remaining on the ODSAs, the lack of negative effect of permitting it to continue operating foreign flag vessels and the substantial benefit it can derive by spreading overhead costs associated with its U.S.-flag vessels, good cause and special circumstances should be found for the requested waiver. In order to retain its growth possibilities, OMI requests that its section 804 waiver permit OMI to operate up to 60 foreign-flag vessels for the time remaining on the term of the ODSAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Permission To Operate Coastwise Vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> OMI also requests permission pursuant to Section 805(a) to continue operating vessels in the coastwise trade following OMI's approval as operator of the ODSAs for the limited time remaining on the ODSAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMI currently owns in its U.S.-flag fleet one crude oil tanker, three chemical/product tankers, four product tankers, and three dry bulk carriers. The crude oil tanker operates primarily in the Alaska oil trade. The three chemical carriers are operated through a joint marketing arrangement and carry cargoes primarily from the Gulf of Mexico to the east and west coast. The three dry bulk carriers operate in the cargo preference trade and in the subsidized foreign trade under the subsidy sharing arrangements of the ODSAs. The four product tankers, bareboat operated by Vulcan, participate primarily in the vegetable oil trade in South America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In OMI's view, simply changing the operator of the ODSAs will not change the competitive marketplace for any U.S.-flag vessel operating in markets with the U.S.-flag vessels operated by OMI. These vessels, according to OMI, will face exactly the same competitive conditions after the transfer of the ODSAs as they did prior to the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMI states that permitting it to continue to operate U.S.-flag vessels following the transfer will not be prejudicial to the objects and policies of the Act. OMI states that it is a well established vessel owner and operator with a history of U.S.-flag operations. Thus, OMI asserts that permitting it to continue in that endeavor for the duration of the ODSAs will further the operation of the U.S. merchant marine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMI advises that no subsidy received by it pursuant to the ODSAs will be used to benefit OMI's non-subsidized coastwise operations. In this connection, OMI points out that under current accounting practices, the use of subsidized funds can be audited easily and companies can provide needed assurances that funds will not be used for non-subsidized purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, OMI notes that its request for permission under section 805(a) does not involve any issue of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of available information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in the application for section 804(a) waiver and/or section 805(a) permission and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written comments in triplicate, to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, by the close of business on November 30, 1994. The Maritime Administration, as a matter of discretion, will consider any comments submitted and take such action with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If such comments deal with section 805(a) issues, they should be accompanied by a petition for leave to intervene. The petition should state clearly and concisely the grounds of interest and the alleged facts relied on for relief. If no petitions for leave to intervene on section 805(a) issues are received within the specified time, or if it is determined that petitions filed do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will take such action as may be deemed appropriate. In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues are received from parties with standing to be heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence under section 805(a) relative to whether the proposed operations (a) could result in unfair competition to any person, firm or corporation operating exclusively in the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (b) would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act relative to domestic operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=2 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs No. 20.800 Construction-Differential Subsidies (CDS) and No. 20.804 Operating-Differential Subsidies (ODS)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> By Order of the Maritime Administrator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: November 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Joel C.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Adsteam provision leads to ADollars 61m loss THE ADSTEAM group of companies, formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins, announced substantial losses yesterday, indicating that interest costs and falling property prices continue to plague the group. Adelaide Steamship, formerly the group's flagship, announced a net loss of ADollars 61m (USDollars 43.5m) for the six months to the end of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 69m for the comparable period of the previous year. The company said earnings before interest and tax rose 23 per cent to ADollars 241m, while financing costs fell 13 per cent to ADollars 290m. However, the deficiency in shareholders' funds grew by 13 per cent to ADollars 620m. Mr George Haines, managing director, said the result included an abnormal loss of ADollars 107.8m, mostly related to provisions against the value of the group's UK property portfolio, held through Markheath, a 61 per cent subsidiary. 'Adsteam directors have deemed it prudent to make a one-off full provision against the group's Markheath involvement,' Mr Haines said. Mark-heath's discussions with its banks were 'proceeding constructively'. Other companies in the group also fared badly. David Jones, the up-market retailer, lost a net ADollars 59m, compared with ADollars 53m, and Tooth and Co, the industrial group, lost a net ADollars 58m, compared with ADollars 40.5m. The bright spot was Industrial Equity (IEL), owned by Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, which re-ported an improvement in net profit to ADollars 79m from ADollars 27m. IEL said the improvement would have been larger but for the ADollars 19m cost of deferring the flotation of its Woolworths supermarket subsidiary, and ADollars 6.4m in other abnormal charges.</p>

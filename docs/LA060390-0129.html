			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEM'S NOT WITH THEM, IT'S WITH US  </P> <P> There is an irony in your article regarding Chrysler Corp.'s huge losses and  its attempt to regain the buying public's confidence ("Iacocca Back in  Spotlight, but It's Just Not the Same," May 18).  </P> <P> Hardly a day goes by without reading the public outcry over the Japanese buying  America piece by piece, yet the very voices that cry are likely to own a  Japanese car, camcorder, television or compact disc player.  </P> <P> So where do these people think the money to buy America is coming from?  </P> <P> We have seen the enemy, and he is us.  </P> <P> R.

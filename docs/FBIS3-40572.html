			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Goals Will Fulfill Goals"] </F>   [Text] It is generally believed that the real reason for  tension with the United States is Pakistan's nuclear program.  The United States does not believe that this program is for  peaceful uses and suspects that Pakistan wants to make atomic  bombs. Because of this suspicion, it stopped military and  economic aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. The  United States is not satisfied with Pakistan even after the  nuclear program was frozen. It is pressing us to roll back the  nuclear program, to permit the inspection of nuclear  installations, and to unilaterally sign the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty]. However, this is plain blackmail.  Actually the United states wants to make Pakistan dependent on  it. Since Pakistan is not willing to become dependent, the  United States at times accuses it of making nuclear weapons, and  at other times threatens to declares it a terrorist nation. What  the United States wants is clear from the U.S. Ambassador John  Minzo's speech at the American Association of Pakistani Doctors  last Saturday.    The U.S. ambassador said that relations between the two  countries would be very good if Pakistan agreed with the United  States. He said in his speech that relations between the two  countries have improved compared to the past, and there is the  possibility that these relations will become more stable if  Pakistan supports U.S. international policies. What the U.S.  ambassador has said is very true. If Pakistan was dependent on  the United States, and had become its ally, the United States  would have no complaints or accusations against Pakistan. U.S.  international policies are not hidden from any one.    The United States cannot tolerate the idea of Pakistan's  friendly relations with China. It does not like Pakistan's  brotherly relations with Iran, Iraq, Libya, and other Muslim  nations either. It also wants Pakistan to recognize Israel and  to establish diplomatic relations with it. However, the U.S.  ambassador should fully understand that Pakistan is an  independent nation. The Pakistani people are Muslims with a firm  faith in their religion. They cannot break up their traditional  friendship with these countries for U.S. happiness and aid.  Opportunistic and cowardly nations change their ideologies and  policies. The Pakistani people are not cowards and will not  compromise their principles under pressure or for greed.  Pakistan's relations with China can become more stable. Pakistan  will continue its efforts toward unity and cooperation among  Muslim nations. Israel will not be recognized at all. Similarly,  Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program under any  pressure or for any greed. The United States is indeed a  superpower, and it can blackmail and harass Pakistan. However,  it cannot force us to cooperate with it. No Pakistani government  can compromise national prestige and pride. Pakistan also has  courageous and patriotic leaders like Imam Khomeini, Saddam  Hussein, Colonel Gaddafi, and Farah Adid who are capable of  being firm with the time of test.</p>

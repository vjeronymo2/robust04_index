These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally around the middle of each month. A premium of 0.2 per cent is to be added to the credit rates when fixing at bid. Interest rates may not be fixed for longer than 120 days. SDR-based rates of interest are the same for all currencies but must be used only for the OECD-defined poor countries. The SDR-based rate was changed on February 15. It will be subject to change on January 15. Last month's table incorrectly reported the rate for the US dollar for credits up to five years at 6.18 instead of 6.81.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOM CLANCY ON U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> Clancy rambles on about "principles" we are defending in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> He failed, however, to explain why the U.S. has fielded most of the troops and  why we may or will suffer the most casualties in defending these "principles."  </P> <P> He failed to say what he will do if war breaks out there. Will he be on the  front lines with our GIs reporting the combat action while dodging Iraqi gas  bombs, or will he be seated at a word processor in his comfortable home writing  a novel about war that could add a few million dollars to his already sizable  wealth?  </P> <P> JOE HOFERR, Los Angeles  </P></p>

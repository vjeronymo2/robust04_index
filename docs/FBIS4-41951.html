			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Orlov under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F> "Bloc-Based Security System Necessary, Leonid Ivashov, Secretary  of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council, Believes"]    [Text] The Collective Security Treaty signed by the CIS in  Tashkent 15 May 1992, Leonid Ivashov stated, proved to be a not  really effective barrier to the process of military  disintegration and, in the broader sense, defense  disintegration. Defense alliance is the most acceptable of all  the possible forms of cooperation in the military sphere, in the  view of the secretary of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council.  The aims of that alliance would be not only to prevent and  repel potential aggression against alliance states but also to  resolve the problem of establishing mutual trust. The  Collective Security Treaty does not prevent the creation of a  defense alliance.    What are the priority tasks to be resolved when forming the  defense alliance? First of all, Mr. Ivashov believes, it is  necessary to create a system of legal guarantees for the  agreements reached by the allies and a mechanism to monitor  violations of them. It is then necessary to develop  mobilizational plans and plans for the stockpiling of resources.  The creation of armed groupings and their deployment on the  borders of the CIS will also become an urgent need if an  alliance is formed.    For the effective functioning of the collective security  system it is proposed to extend the provisions of the Tashkent  Treaty and divide the system into regional subsystems. Each  subsystem must have a political and military leadership and  military groupings. Their titles are hypothetical at the moment.    The East European Subsystem (Belarus, Kaliningrad Oblast,  and  the western oblasts of the Russian Federation). The center  would be in Minsk, the commander in chief -- the president of  the Republic of Belarus.    The Transcaucasus Subsystem (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and the North Caucasus region of Russia). The center would be  in Rostov-na-Donu, the commander in chief would be the leader  [rukovoditel] of the Russian forces.    The Central Asian Subsystem (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan). The tentative center would be Tashkent.    The Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem (Kazakhstan, the Russian  Federation Urals Military District). The center would be in  Alma-Ata [Almaty], the commander in chief -- the president of  the Republic of Kazakhstan.    The secretary of the Defense Ministers' Council explained  that the subsystems are necessary for the following reasons: To  deter the Afghan opposition (the Central Asian Subsystem), to  create a military grouping to counteract China's Xinjiang Group  of Forces (the Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem), to establish  lasting peace in the Caucasus (the Transcaucasus Subsystem), and  to form forces analogous to the troop structures of the NATO  countries in Europe, first and foremost the Bundeswehr (the East  European Subsystem).    There is no unity yet within either the military leadership  or the diplomatic leadership of Russia on the question of  creating the bloc-based collective security system necessary in  the Russian Federation. The Russian Foreign Ministry leadership  objects particularly to this concept. Meanwhile, Leonid Ivashov  stressed, the most powerful military grouping -- the NATO bloc  -- still exists and Russia's affiliation to it is, at the  moment, highly problematic. The adoption by the CIS member  countries of political decisions aimed at creating an effective  collective security system will serve as a guarantee of  political stability in all the CIS countries.</p>

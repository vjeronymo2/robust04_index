			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IT WAS 4 FOR TEA -- FOR 4 MONTHS  </P> <P> What began as a pleasure cruise of Pacific islands turned into a long ordeal  for an American and three New Zealanders as they spent nearly four months  adrift aboard their overturned boat, police in New Zealand said. The three New  Zealanders -- skipper John Glennie, 48, Phillip Hoffman, 41, and Rick  Hellriegel, 31 -- told their story to reporters in Auckland. The American crew  member, Jim Nalepka, 38, did not speak at the news conference. The four men  drifted ashore on New Zealand's Great Barrier Island late Sunday. Their  trimaran, a craft with three parallel hulls, capsized June 4 in high seas about  140 miles off New Zealand, they said. Coast Guard officials said that apart  from loss of weight, all four were in good physical condition. "We had a lot of  food in the boat and we rigged up a plastic sheet to catch rainwater. We were  able to have cups of tea in the mornings," Glennie told reporters. The men  built a platform above the water level to form a cave-like shelter under the  cockpit -- but living in such close quarters took a toll. "I don't really care  if I don't see the other three again, ever, but I suppose that feeling will  pass," Glennie said.  </P> <P>  -- Jim Robinson has also made a journey of sorts -- from homelessness to a new  home and a new job. Three weeks ago, Robinson, 42, was an unwelcome intruder in  a Miss America contestants' photo session. The discovery of Robinson and  another homeless man beneath an overturned lifeguard boat interrupted the Sept.  9 beach photo session at Atlantic City, N.J., and an Associated Press  photographer captured the scene as police hustled them away. A day after that  incident, Robinson's colleague, Jeff Hall, was found dead on the beach (the  cause has not been determined). Robinson said Hall's death inspired him to try  to turn around his own life. He has moved in with a cousin in Bogota, N.J., and  is working in the mail room at Penguin USA, a publishing company in  Bergenfield, N.J.  </P> <P>  -- Cowboy singer and actor Rex Allen, 68, is going to have a place to hang his  hat -- and the rest of his wardrobe, movie posters, silver saddle, record  jackets, comic books and other mementos -- in his hometown of Willcox, Ariz.  The Rex Allen Arizona Cowboy Museum will open during the 38th annual Rex Allen  Days, Saturday and Sunday. Exhibits will touch on local history in addition to  Allen's life -- from his youth in the southeastern Arizona town through his  singing and movie days and his numerous narrations for Disney "World of Color"  TV specials.

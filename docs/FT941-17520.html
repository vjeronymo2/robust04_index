			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep it clear, quick and stress-free Venture capitalists competing for a decreasing number of attractive management buy-out deals need to become more attuned to their clients' needs, according to a survey carried out by Warwick Business School. Managers who have been through the gruelling process of an MBO said venture capitalists sometimes behaved in a manner that made the deal unnecessarily stressful. A particular cause for complaint was the tendency for venture capitalists to make unilateral changes to the deal at a late stage in the negotiations. Other concerns included the amount of lengthy documentation, which was often duplicated by different parties to the deal, and a poor initial explanation of the nature of the funding process which left managers feeling ill-informed and frustrated by apparently inexplicable delays. The research was carried out by Warwick Business School for ECI Ventures, the venture capital group, from MBOs of Pounds 2m to Pounds 10m between January 1991 and June 1993. The survey showed that nearly three-quarters of those interviewed said the impetus for the buy-out had been the parent company's decision to sell the managers' enterprise. Because of time pressures, management teams approached, on average, only three venture capitalists before deciding who would fund them. The managers tended to rely on their 'own initiative' in deciding where to go for external equity. Forty per cent of management teams had already approached venture capitalist financiers before they recruited a financial adviser. Nearly half the teams did not rate their financial advisers as influential in the selection of a source of equity while only nine per cent said the advisers were 'highly influential'. Bank managers did not rate as an important source of advice. Managers said their ideal venture capitalist would conclude the finance negotiations speedily and would have resources available for future expansion.

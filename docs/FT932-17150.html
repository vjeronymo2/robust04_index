			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Pakistan takes steps to avoid the terrorist label: Islamabad wants to get off the US 'watch list' THE PAKISTAN government, stung by the latest allegations that Islamabad supports terrorism, has intensified its efforts to avoid being listed as a terrorist state by the US. Mr Shujaat Hussain, the interior minister, said yesterday the government had detained nine suspected Arab guerrillas and would try to decide the fate of all Arabs in Pakistan within a month. Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state, claimed at the weekend he had evidence that those responsible for the bomb blasts that shook Bombay last month were supported by a group in Pakistan, possibly the elite Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI). Other politicians have claimed that six members of a prominent Bombay underworld family known as the Memons were paid by the ISI agency for organising the blasts. The ISI is widely known to have supplied western arms and training camps for the Afghan mujahideen to support them first against Soviet troops and subsequently against Moscow-backed governments. Islamabad is fighting to clear its name after the US in January added Pakistan to a 'watch list' of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism. The US is due to report on the situation at the end of this month. Islamabad claims that the Indian allegations are meant to encourage Washington to press ahead with the terrorism charge, and the bombings could be the work of Indian intelligence agencies trying to malign Pakistan. 'Pakistan is under threat constantly of being declared a terrorist state,' says Mr Akram Zaki, secretary general of foreign affairs. 'For India there is greater motivation to shift the attention from violation of human rights in Kashmir, from the communal riots and killing of Moslems in India to an external factor, and therefore if any one of the intelligence agencies is involved, Indians are more likely to be involved than the Pakistanis,' he adds. These charges seem bound to sour already strained relations between India and Pakistan. But some Indian politicians have held back from directly venting anger against Moslems or Pakistan, fearing fresh communal riots similar to those after last year's destruction of the Babri mosque at Ayodhya. Both countries have traded similar charges in the past. India has accused Pakistan of supporting terrorism in Punjab and Kashmir, where dissident Sikhs and Moslem activists are struggling for independence. Indian authorities allege that the ISI has being trying to link dissidents in the two troubled states in an attempt to create widespread instability in their country. Pakistan has countered by alleging that India is responsible for extending large-scale support to dissident nationalists in the troubled southern province of Sindh and is trying to destabilise the economy through creating unrest in and around Karachi, the country's commercial capital. Even before the latest accusations, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government embarked on a diplomatic initiative to convince western countries that the terrorism charges are false. Last month Pakistan invited foreign journalists and human rights groups to travel freely across the country and verify any charges. It has also set up an anti-terrorist cell in the Interior Ministry to counter violence in Pakistan. While the government has gone out of its way to present what one senior diplomat describes as 'a very clean image', that has not put to rest concerns over the activities of Islamic nationalists. The Uzbek foreign minister last month accused Pakistan's Jamaat-i-Islami of fomenting unrest in the central Asian republic of Tajikistan, where Islamic nationalists are waging an anti-government campaign. The Jamaat is a political party of Moslem activists with minor representation in parliament but with strong control over a section of clergymen. Its members are seeking introduction of Islamic values in the country's legal system, as well as in other areas, such as through the elimination of bank interest. Other groups whose activities are being watched are Kashmiri militants such as the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front and Arab Moslem activists who came to Pakistan during the Afghan conflict to join the jihad (holy war). The war opened a new pipeline of money and CIA-supplied arms to be used by the Afghan mujahideen. Islamabad has been trying to clamp down on the activities of such groups. The government has tried to close down suspected non-governmental organisations working with Afghan refugees, after allegations that they were fronts for activists. But senior officials say that a long trail of arms and ideologically motivated men left behind by the Afghan war cannot be eliminated overnight.</p>

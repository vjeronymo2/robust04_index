			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) EPA retains the right to require additional Tier 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing pursuant to the procedures in &sect;79.54.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New fuel and fuel additive notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Within six months following its receipt of the Tier 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Tier 2 submittal for a new product (as defined in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(3) of this section), EPA shall notify the manufacturer of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of such submittal in compliance with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) through (c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA notifies the manufacturer that testing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retesting, or additional information is necessary to bring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal into compliance, the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall remedy all inadequacies and provide Tier 3 data, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required, before EPA shall consider the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration to have been met for the product in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal within six months following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submittal, the manufacturer shall be deemed to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactorily completed Tiers 1 and 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Within six months of the date on which EPA notifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer of satisfactory completion of Tiers 1 and 2 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a new product, or within one year of the submittal of the Tier 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Tier 2 data (whichever is earlier), EPA shall determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether additional testing is currently needed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of Tier 3 and, pursuant to &sect;79.54(b), shall notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer of its determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If the manufacturer of a new fuel or fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product is notified that Tier 3 testing is required for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, then EPA shall have the authority to withhold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration until the specified Tier 3 requirements have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactorily completed. EPA shall determine whether the Tier 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements have been met, and shall notify the manufacturer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this determination, within one year of receiving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's Tier 3 submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 3 requirements within the prescribed timeframe, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional testing at the Tier 3 level is deemed currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary and the manufacturer shall be considered to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complied with all current registration requirements for the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or additive product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Upon completion of all current Tier 1, Tier 2, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 3 requirements, and submission of an application for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration which includes all of the information and assurances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by &sect;79.11 or &sect;79.21, the registration of the new fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or additive shall be granted, and the registrant may then sell,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer for sale, or introduce into commerce the registered product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as permitted by &sect;79.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Once the new product becomes registered, EPA reserves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to require additional Tier 3 testing pursuant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures specified in &sect;79.54.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inspection of a testing facility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A testing facility, emissions analysis or health and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare effects, shall permit an authorized employee or duly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated representative of EPA, at reasonable times and in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be maintained regarding studies to which this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies. The records inspection and copying requirements shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems, or to actions recommended and taken, except the EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seek production of these records in litigation or informal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a test substance does or does not present a risk of injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to health or the environment any data developed by a testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with this section. The determination that a study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

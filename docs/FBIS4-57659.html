			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Melina Villasana from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Secretariat of National Defense has said there  are no secret weapons in Mexico and there should be no  speculation on the purchase of equipment. The Secretariat of  National Defense has presented its military industry: factories  of weapons, cartridges, and vehicle assembly. Amid an atmosphere  of reports and information on purchase of foreign-made military  equipment, the Army has shown what it has: armored vehicles  equipped with cannons and machine-guns with long firing  capability. If water cannons were placed on these vehicles,  they would be underutilized, the Secretariat of National Defense  said.    General Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, director general of  National Defense Factories, affirmed the Army's equipment  guarantees national sovereignty. He added there are no secret  weapons in Mexico and the purchase of weapons has nothing to do  with what has taken place in other countries.    [Begin Cervantes recording] It is not convenient to  extrapolate events in other regions to those in our country. We  have our own experiences and our own institutions. [end  recording]    Regarding arms supplies, we are self-sufficient.    [Begin Cervantes recording] It would be contradictory for us  to ship out weapons and ammunition to areas where conflicts  appear, when we promote peaceful solutions to conflicts. That  is why we do not sell weapons. [end recording]    These are high-powered German-made weapons purchased in 1980  for exclusive Army use. This is a vehicle assembly plant where  military vehicles, some of which date back to 1942, are  refurbished. Here is a 2,500 RAM truck, of which cabin and  engine are used and mounted on a military vehicle. This is a  vehicle manufactured in Mexico that will be presented to  authorities.    In addition, cartridges of various calibers are manufactured  in Mexico. Some 160,000 cartridges are manufactured daily, but  the facility has a capacity to manufacture 300,000 cartridges.  They are used to fight drug trafficking and are also sold to  the country's high security ports. They are manufactured with  automated machines.    Here is a factory of plastic and paint, ice picks and  matrixes, which are marketed to obtain revenues. The gunpowder  factory was closed in 1990 by the Sedue [Urban Development and  Ecology Secretariat] for damaging the environment. Currently,  gunpowder is imported into the country.    The Secretariat of Defense concluded by saying the opening  of  military factories is intended to calm the population and to  instill confidence in their institutions.</p>

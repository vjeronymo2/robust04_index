			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton prices under pressure in Pakistan PAKISTANI COTTON prices have slumped in the past two weeks amid signs of a big crop after last year's poor harvest, Reuter reports from Karachi. High domestic interest rates have exacerbated the situation by keeping buyers out of the market, analysts say. Prices for the 1993-94 (July-June) crop had fallen by nearly Rs200 (Pounds 4.40), or 17 per cent, since the season officially started on September 1, said Mr Akbarali Hashwani, chairman of the private Karachi Cotton Association. He forecast a further drop in prices on the good crop. 'Quality is good and quantity is large,' he said. Mr Hashwani explained that the crop was doing well because of recent hot dry weather in cotton-growing areas in the south and centre of the country.</p>

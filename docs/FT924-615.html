			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Asprey and Mallett take first step towards merger TWO OF London's oldest and most respected firms of antique dealers are taking the first steps towards a merger. USM-quoted Asprey, of 163 New Bond Street, best known as a silver, jewellery, and luxury goods specialist, has acquired a 6.8 per cent stake in Mallett, the English furniture dealer based at 40 New Bond Street. Asprey is run by Mr Naim Attallah, who is building up a small conglomerate of companies trading in up-market accessories. In the past year Asprey has acquired Watches of Switzerland from Ratners for Pounds 23.2m and Hamilton &amp; Inches, the Edinburgh-based silversmiths, for Pounds 1.3m. It also owns Garrards and Mappin &amp; Webb. Negotiations are in a very early stage but Mallett does not seem opposed to a full bid. 'We look favourably on people who are going to improve our share value,' said the company yesterday. Started in Bath 125 years ago, Mallett has been in Bond Street since 1908. Mallett of Bourdon House, an associate company, operates nearby in Davies Street and specialises in continental furniture and decorative objects. In 1991 Mallett acquired Christopher Wood, one of London's leading dealers in Victorian art. Wood's stock of pictures now occupies two of Mallett's five floors in Bond Street. As a furniture dealer Mallett has not suffered as badly during the recession as dealers in paintings, but its 1991 turnover of Pounds 8.39m and net profit of Pounds 200,000 compared with Pounds 14.6m and Pounds 1.56m respectively in 1990. Mallett incurred a small loss in the first half of 1992. Its stocks are valued at Pounds 11.8m. Along with Partridge, its Bond Street neighbour, Mallett is regarded as the leading dealer in antique furniture in the UK. Both Asprey and Mallett are stressing that negotiations have barely started but Mallett would certainly fit neatly into Mr Attallah'sprogramme of luxury acquisitions. Mallett's shares rose 19p to 73p yesterday.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Oftel chief prefers price caps to profit ceilings SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, gave a clear warning yesterday that he would not hesitate to take tough measures to stamp out market abuse. Sir Bryan indicated in his first speech since taking up office in June that he intended to continue the policies he used when director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog. Price-capping or divestment should be considered where it proved difficult or impossible to inject competition into a market, Sir Bryan said at an anti-trust conference in Cambridge. He did not favour a profits ceiling even though high profits were often an indication that a dominant position was being exploited. He would prefer a price cap of the type he imposed on British Telecommunications when at Oftel. A cap would require a company to limit price rises enough to allow the expectation of a reasonable rate of return while avoiding direct limits on profits. That would encourage improvements in efficiency. Sir Bryan said measures to introduce competition by lowering entry barriers to competitors sometimes worked slowly, and dominant businesses tended to dominate for long periods. The role of competition authorities was to create the conditions in which effective competition could take place so that its benefits could flow quickly to consumers. Sir Bryan also indicated that he would pay particular attention to complex monopolies and duopolies. While simple monopolies were easily recognisable, he said, difficulties could arise where a market was shared among a few companies. A duopoly could be an unsatisfactory arrangement unless one of the parties was a dynamic, competing new entrant. Kodak and six other film manufacturers have been released from undertakings originally given in 1966 after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the colour film market. The undertakings required Kodak not to discriminate between retail outlets. They also required all seven companies to make colour film available to retailers at prices both including and excluding the cost of processing. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading had concluded that the undertakings, last reviewed in 1983, were no longer relevant. Undertakings given by CMB Foodcan, formerly Metal Box, in 1970 in relation to the supply of metal containers have been revised after a review last year by Sir Gordon Borrie, who was then director-general of fair trading.</p>

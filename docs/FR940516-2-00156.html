How To Apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cooperative agreement has been determined as the appropriate funding instrument because of the substantial involvement of NMFS in (1) developing program research priorities, (2) performing cooperative research jointly with eligible applicants through the NMFS unit at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory, (3) evaluating the performance of the program for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for Chesapeake Bay oyster conservation and restoration, (4) monitoring the progress of each funded project, (5) holding periodic workshops with investigators to encourage inter-disciplinary dialogue and forge synthesis of results, and (6) working with recipients in preparation of annual reports summarizing current accomplishments of the Oyster Disease Research Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for cooperative agreements under the oyster disease research program may be submitted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this notice, by any state game and fish department, college or university, or other nonprofit organizations relating to cooperative research units. Eligible applicants outside the northeastern United States (Maine to Virginia) may submit proposals, as long as their objectives support the technical and management priorities of the Northeast Region, as defined in sections II.A.1. and II.A.2. above. All solicited proposals received by the closing date will be considered by NMFS. Applicants will be expected to identify the principal investigators who will be conducting the research. Curricula vitae should also be provided for all essential personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigators submitting proposals in response to this announcement are strongly encouraged to develop interinstitutional, inter-disciplinary research teams in the form of single, integrated proposals or as individual proposals that are clearly linked together. Such collaborative efforts will be factored into the final funding decision. These efforts may be among external eligible applicants, as well as with NMFS scientists at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory. NMFS personnel may participate in joint efforts with non-NMFS persons or groups in these projects, as long as these non-NMFS persons or groups have applied and successfully competed for oyster disease research funds through the process outlined in this announcement and as long as these applications refer to, or include, an internal NMFS proposal that details how NMFS personnel plan to cooperate. Any activities to be undertaken by NMFS personnel under such cooperative agreements will be funded by direct transfer of oyster disease research funds or regular appropriated funds within NMFS. No such NMFS activity is to be funded by non-NMFS persons or groups using oyster disease research funds other than those who have successfully competed for funds under this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Amount and Duration of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this solicitation, NMFS will fund American oyster disease research projects under this program for 1-year cooperative agreements. Project dates should be scheduled to begin on December 1, 1994. Cooperative agreements are approved on an annual basis but may be considered eligible for continuation beyond the first project and budget period subject to the approved scope of work, satisfactory progress, and availability of funds at the total discretion of NMFS. However, there are no assurances for such continuation. Publication of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate any part of the entire amount of funds available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Cost-Sharing Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or donations. Cost sharing is not required under the oyster disease research program. However, cost sharing is encouraged to enhance the value of a project, and in case of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an applicant chooses to share cost, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicants will be bound by the percentage of cost sharing reflected in the grant award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

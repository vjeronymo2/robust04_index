			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Birmingham's budget attacked BIRMINGHAM City Council has been told by its own advisers to shift its spending priorities from the provision of international facilities, such as its convention centre, to a crash programme on improving education. The Birmingham Education Commission, set up by the council to advise on future educational needs in England's biggest local authority, said yesterday: 'Birmingham can be proud of its international facilities. But the state of its school buildings brings shame to the city.' Since fiscal 1989-90, the city council has spent Pounds 236m less on education than the government, in its standard spending assessment, assumed it would. This period covered the opening of the convention centre, indoor sports arena and an extension to the National Exhibition Centre. The commission is suggesting the council should spend Pounds 300m more than its standard spending assessment figure over the next five years. The council yesterday welcomed the report and Ms Theresa Stewart, the Labour leader, promised that school repairs would be 'a priority in our budget planning process'. Britain's economic performance lags behind that of its European competitors because of insufficient craft training, says a paper published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, John Authers writes. Professor Sig Prais, of the institute, says 64 per cent of Britain's workforce has no vocational qualifications. In Germany this figure is only 26 per cent, and in Switzerland 23 per cent. Britain's deficiency is most marked in 'intermediate' craft qualifications, at the level of City and Guilds Part One and above, and BTec national diplomas.</p>

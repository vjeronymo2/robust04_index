			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Don't touch that dial . . . yet! The latest in the continuing saga of classical  music programming on Los Angeles radio finds KKGO-FM retreating from its  decision to devote daytime hours to classical music. General Manager Saul  Levine said Wednesday he will wait to see if KFAC-FM does indeed dump its  classical programming as expected before he devotes FM air time to Bach and  Beethoven instead of Brubeck and Basie. "I feel in fairness to Los Angeles the  posture must be to give KFAC a chance to evaluate their position," Levine said.  "If they keep a classical format, we will not go classical on FM. What we're  saying is we hope KFAC stays classical." Last week, Levine announced plans to  play classical music on KKGO-FM from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. starting in January and  keep jazz on after-hours. KKGO-AM, which is scheduled to be operational in  January, would play all jazz. Now, however, Levine says that if KFAC-FM does  remain classical, he will play mostly classical music on his AM station but  none on KKGO-FM which now is all-jazz. Should KFAC change formats, he said,  both of his AM and FM outlets will feature a combination of classical and jazz,  with jazz still dominating the FM station. Levine noted that KKGO begun as a  classical station in 1959 but quickly changed to all-jazz in 1960 after losing  in the ratings to KFAC. Stay tuned . . . ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

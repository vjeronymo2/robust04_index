			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Russian debt crisis worries World Bank: Moscow considers price freeze The World Bank began yesterday to offer Russian ministers advice on how to resolve the country's fast-growing debt crisis amid fears that Moscow is planning a prices freeze. Russia's growing inter-enterprise debt, estimated by officials to exceed Rbs90,000bn (Dollars 42bn at the market rate), is at the top of the government's agenda and could determine the fate of Russia's fragile economic reforms. In a heated meeting over the weekend of the emergency government commission convened to discuss the debt crisis one suggested solution was to freeze wages and prices. 'A wage and price freeze is one idea that is floating around,' said Mr Ardy Stoutjesdijk, director of the World Bank office in Moscow, who met Russian officials yesterday. But Mr Stoutjesdijk, who said the Russian government considered the debt problem to be 'urgent,' advised Russian ministers not to adopt such a strong-armed state approach. While Russian officials and western financial institutions consider how to resolve the debt crisis its negative effects on the Russian economy are becoming increasingly apparent. The Russian rouble hit a new low of 2,190 roubles to the dollar in trading yesterday amid market fears that the government will continue to bail out insolvent enterprises. The Russian central bank announced yesterday it was cutting its three-month refinancing rate to 130 per cent from 150 per cent, despite the rouble's fall. It is the second rate cut this month and the seventh this year. The new rate is effective immediately, a bank official said. The cut continued previous policies and brought the central bank rate closer into line with money market rates, currently around 105 per cent for three-month cash. The bank was also concerned about non-payments in every sector of the economy and about falling production, the official added. 'This is a continuation of our existing policies'. At the meeting yesterday between Russian ministers and the World Bank, Mr Oleg Soskovets, the deputy prime minister who heads the debt commission, spoke out against the idea of an absolute price freeze. But, in an attack on radical market reformers who argue that heavily indebted enterprises should all simply be allowed to go bankrupt, Mr Soskovets criticised 'those politicised economists who believe that the formation of a market should occur in circumstances of total chaos'. Mr Soskovets outlined a few immediate measures the Russian government will take to alleviate the debt crisis. He said Russia intends to pursue 'a more severe policy with regard to the countries of the near abroad,' a reference to the former Soviet republics whose unpaid bills to Russia are one source of the galloping debt. Mr Soskovets also said that the Russian government would assume responsibility for that portion of the debt owned by state ministries and would help pay workers salaries, which in some factories are more than four months late. He also said the government might impose price ceilings on monopolist energy suppliers and transport companies. Mr Stoutjesdijk warns that 'there is no magic solution' to the debt crisis, but says it is crucial that the government should avoid the mistake it made in 1992 when Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's bold market reforms were sabotaged by the decision to bail out indebted enterprises. One proposal put forward by the World Bank at yesterday's meeting was that the Russian government develop a separate strategy to deal with that portion of the debt - estimated at one third - owed to energy suppliers.</p>

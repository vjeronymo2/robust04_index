			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Quicker tax refunds agreed UP TO 8m people will be able to receive repayment of tax on bank and building society interest and on share dividends more quickly under new measures announced by the Inland Revenue this week. Non-taxpayers and those eligible for partial tax relief against bank and building society interest income can now claim repayments worth more than Pounds 50 immediately rather than having to wait until the end of the tax year. Those eligible for tax relief against income from share dividends - including an estimated 2.5m married women who are independently registered for tax - can also claim back payments on dividends without waiting until after April 5 1992. About 15m non-taxpayers have been entitled to register with their banks and building societies to receive interest gross since composite rate tax was abolished last April. However, a large number of those who are eligible have not done so. Only 12.5m accounts, representing an even smaller number of people, have actually registered for this facility. The remainder can now apply for repayment directly under the new arrangements. But the Revenue stresses that it would be simpler for those who pay no tax to apply directly to their bank or building society to pay interest gross. The Revenue has now opened 24 repayment centres ahead of schedule, and will be able to process any claims for relief above Pounds 50 immediately. Those with reimbursements below this level must wait for the end of the tax year. Inland Revenue leaflet IR 112 'How to claim a repayment of income tax' explains the procedure for repayment of tax on share dividends; and leaflet IR 111 'How to claim a repayment of tax on bank and building society interest' explain the procedures required for repayment.</p>

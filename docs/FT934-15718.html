			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Gardening: A garden of unearthly delights - Patricia Morison visits Scotland's subtropical paradise / the Logan Botanic Gardens STRANGE and monstrous plants flourish at Logan Botanic Gardens, Scotland's subtropical paradise. Logan belongs to the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, but it is lies far to the west in the centre of the poetically named Rinns of Galloway. A mile to the east are the gentle waters of Luce Bay; to the west is the Irish Sea. Getting to Logan is an expedition (Stranraer is the nearest town), but worth it for a garden which is a plantsman's paradise. Walking under the famous avenue of Chusan palms, sniffing the leaf of a 20-year-old lemon verbena growing in the open, you pinch yourself to think that this is Scotland. If it seems too far-fetched, think instead of Ireland. Galloway, too, is warm and wet, a pastoral landscape where the air is deliciously relaxing and smells of muck. As in Ireland, hedgerows at shore level are bright with the orange gold of crocosmias. This summer, there were even escaped white daturas growing wild on Glen Luce Bay. Logan's soil is sandy and slightly acid; rainfall is high, an average 40ins and fairly from month to month. Because Logan is warmed by the Gulf Stream, chief curator Barry Unwin and his team can grow plants out of doors all the year round. Such tender specimens as myrtles and trachelospermums flourish at Logan, which provides a home for the rarities brought back by the Royal Botanic's plant-hunting expeditions to the southern hemisphere. Lashing salt-laden winds were always Logan's enemy as well as rare but devastating freak periods of icy weather such as occurred in the winters of 1962 and 1978. As years pass, Logan's protection grows denser with its outer shelter belts of spruce and pines, and behind them attractive groves of pittosporums, griselinias, and olearias, New Zealand daisy-bushes. Two hundred years ago, according to a local historian, cheap foreign labour gave the garden at Logan its first really stout barrier against the salt spray. French prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars were apportioned to the great houses of Scotland. The McDoualls of Logan, settled in the Rinns since 1300, set their unfortunate Frenchmen to work with a vengeance. Down at Port Logan, the prisoners excavated a huge saltwater fishpond to provide the McDoualls with fish for the dinner-table. From the granite spoil they erected the massive, pink walls of the Walled Garden. Like other 18th century lairds fortunate enough to live in Scotland's mildest regions, the McDoualls were already doing nicely from sales of fruit and vegetable. Thanks to the fortunes of war and higher standards of living, they proceeded to do better still form their working garden. The exotic place we see today is the creation of two generations of McDoualls passionate about adventurous botanising. Agnes McDouall and her two sons, Kenneth and Doublas. They contributed funds handsomely to the great botanisers of the last century, Forrest, kingdom Ward, Farrer, and Ernest Wilson, and took their reward in plants - magnolias, rhododendrons, the famous tree-ferns and Chusan palms. A good number of the specimens they planted still survive. The brothers themselves went on expeditions. They brought back species like primulas and meconopsis, and invented the peat bed technique for growing them in acid-free, moist, conditions. When next I go to Logan, it will be in late spring to see the meconopsis whose blue brilliance is, they claim, finer at Logan even than at the Botanics in Edinburgh. The McDouall brothers' failure was to perpetuate their own line. Logan passed to a cousin, then to Sir R Olaf Hambro who greatly restored the gardens. On his death in 1969, most of the garden was handed over to the nation. So although fairly new as a botanic garden, Logan has its historic pedigree and no other can beat the romance of its setting. Dominating the Fenchmen's walls is the ruined medieval tower of Bailzieland where the McDouall lairds had clung grimly on through a murderous 15th century. Beneath, in the Walled Garden, high summer under the huge tree-ferns, Dicksonia antarctica, always sees a magnificently colourful display of semihardy and tender perennials. The Edinburgh garden introduced South African diascias to British gardens, so you find them in abundance, together with turquoise felicias, argyranthemums, tawny vendidiums, verbenas, and several dozen different tender sages. This is the part of the garden to gather ideas. For the rest, the walls, terraces and wooded slopes are the place to marvel at rarities and pine for plants which, short of emigration, one will never grow. In late summer, Fascicularia bicolor develops huge rosettes of pillarbox red with a silver centre and lilac-flowered middle, the plant world's answer to the baboon's bottom. Monstrously tall variegated phormiums send up 18ft spikes of flower on stems as black as coal. They are overtopped with ease by the drying flower heads of the incredible echiums of Madeira. Strange fuschias disconcert as well as delight. Tiny yellow-flowered blooms point purple stamens up from a 2in procumbent New Zealander. If ever there was a nightmare plant it is Fuchsia excorticata which pushes its purple blooms straight out from the suppurating brown bark of stems thick as a tree. No child will forget the Gunnera Bog with its monstrous leaves looming 20ft tall and 10ft across. No adult will forget the splendour of a scarlet-flowered metrosideros Umbellata, a New Zealand Christmas tree, in full bloom. Logan is Scotland's antipodes, its garden of unearthly delights. There is something to see all the year round, and probably something you will never have seen before on these shores. From October 31 to March 14 you must ring to arrange a visit.

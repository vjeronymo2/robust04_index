			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in stock index futures was volatile, with volume in the June contract meagre, writes Joel Kibazo. June was soon squeezed forward, sending it to 2,697 by 9am when a 50-point premium over the cash market was recorded. However, profit-taking coupled with the early dullness in both short sterling and the gilts market caused a retreat, with June falling to 2,676 by mid-morning. Sporadic buying and selling continued into the afternoon, until a large buying order from BZW late in the session triggered a squeeze, pushing June up to 2,699, the high of the day. Finally, a sell-off in the dying minutes saw the contract relinquish some of the gain from the squeeze. June closed at 2,690, just 2 ahead of Friday's close and 13 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 5,700 contracts. In traded options, volume returned to quieter levels, totalling 32,075 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option reached 9,627 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE option recorded a mere 1,223 lots. British Steel was the top traded stock option with a total of 2,165 lots, the July 90 calls being particularly busy.</p>

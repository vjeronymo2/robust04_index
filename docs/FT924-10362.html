			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins buys shares in RHM TOMKINS, the industrial group which entered the bidding for Ranks Hovis McDougall on Thursday, bought RHM shares worth nearly Pounds 16m in the market that day. Yesterday RHM's shares rose 3p to 275p, just out of reach of Tomkins' offer price. Hanson, RHM's rival suitor, does not have any shares in its target. Hanson was yesterday considering whether to increase its offer to top Tomkins or to walk away. Tomkins' shares, which fell heavily on Thursday were unchanged yesterday at 212p, only 12p above the price for the rights issue, launched to help finance the acquisition. Tomkins bought 2.59m shares at 260p, the level of its cash offer, and another 3.37m shares at 269.54p, the maximum price it can pay in the market, which includes the 9.54p dividend RHM has promised its shareholders. Added to the 14,000 shares it already held, Tomkins has a 1.68 per cent stake in RHM, the milling, baking and grocery products group, which has recommended the Tomkins bid.</p>

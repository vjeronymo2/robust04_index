			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Close race forecast in serious Wisconsin WISCONSIN'S primary today may prove a closer contest than New York's for the two remaining contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Governor Jerry Brown of California. Mr Brown held an early advantage, gaining from some early visits to the state while Mr Clinton was still concentrating money and time on New York. Local opinion polls, however, have produced wide variations: a poll from St Norbert College Survey Center, in Green Bay, showed Mr Clinton ahead with 44 per cent of the vote, to 33 per cent for Mr Brown, but a later sampling by Mason-Dixon, a Washington-based research group, reversed this picture, with 46 per cent for Mr Brown and 37 per cent for Mr Clinton. Private polling by the two campaigns suggest the ballot could be very close and both candidates took quick breaks from New York to campaign in Wisconsin on Friday. Mr Clinton left his wife, Hillary, behind to represent him at a state Democratic party dinner, while Mr Brown's 83-year-old mother, Bernice, flew in to help her son. Wisconsin has played a critical role in many presidential elections. In 1944, it killed off the candidacy of Mr Wendell Wilkie and, in 1976, it helped Mr Jimmy Carter head off the challenge of Mr Morris Udall. But Wisconsin is also unusual political territory, drawing on its Germanic roots to devise its own brand of activist and scrupulously honest politics, a brand which found its expression in Mr Robert LaFollette, who was elected governor in 1900 and then went on to the Senate before running for president in 1924. 'What makes Wisconsin a little bit unusual is its old progressive populist tradition, which has always appreciated the renegade outsider who wants to run against the system. Clean politics, clean government, that has always been a tradition here,' says Professor John Johannes of Marquette University, in Milwaukee. This tradition ought to benefit Mr Brown, but Wisconsin has also often helped somewhat more conservative Democratic candidates. It favoured Mr John Kennedy over the more liberal Mr Hubert Humphrey in 1960, and Mr Michael Dukakis over the Rev Jesse Jackson in 1988. Wisconsin has also elected, in the person of Governor Tommy Thompson, perhaps the most activist Republican governor in the country, and appears to have swung behind his often controversial experiments in welfare reform. As in so many states previously, Mr Clinton has assured himself of the backing of most of Wisconsin's Democratic hierarchy, from the chairman of the state party, Mr Jeffrey Neubauer - who describes Mr Brown as 'a charlatan' - to former Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson. Clinton campaign managers in Milwaukee also say they have received a substantial boost from Senator Tom Harkin from the neighbouring state of Iowa, who threw his weight behind Mr Clinton after abandoning his own candidacy. But Mr Brown has become skilled at the political ju-jitsu of turning his rival's strengths to his own advantage, by depicting such endorsements as proof that Mr Clinton is the candidate of the status quo. Neither candidate, however, has captured Wisconsin's imagination, and their duel has aroused far less passion than the concurrent elections for mayor of Milwaukee and judge of the county court. Nor have Mr Brown or Mr Clinton overcome the widespread distrust of politicians that has marked this election year. 'We have our politicians and we have our murderers. They're all together, same difference,' said a waitress at Schuster's Family Restaurant in Milwaukee. She knows something about both species, for she counted among her regular customers, until he was elected senator and went off to Washington, Mr Herb Kohl, owner of a Wisconsin supermarket chain and of Milwaukee's less than spectacular basketball team; and also Mr Jeffrey Dahmer, until he went to prison for at least 17 grisly murders - one of them Schuster's third-shift cook. Wisconsin boasts one of the most active and serious electorates in the country. Turnout is typically 10 to 12 percentage points higher than the national average, and even in primaries voters have tended to favour electable candidates, rather than using their votes to send a general message of discontent. This time, however, the protest vote could be a factor to be reckoned with. 'Voters are resigned to the fact that Clinton is going to win the nomination so they can afford to be reckless,' concludes Prof Johannes.</p>

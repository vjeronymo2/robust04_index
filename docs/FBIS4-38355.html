			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has become the fourth country following  Israel, Egypt, and Russia, which will receive considerable U.S.  financial aid in the near future. Oleh Bilorus, Ukraine's  ambassador to the United States of America declared this at a  meeting with journalists. He pointed out that the Ukrainian  Embassy in the United States managed to convince the U.S.  Government that Ukraine requires aid today, when the first steps  toward a market economy are being made. Bilorus underlined that  President Bill Clinton's attitude toward Ukraine changed for the  better and the United States of America was ready to support  Ukraine politically and economically to consolidate its  independence.</p>

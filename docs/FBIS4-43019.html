			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["M.G." report: "Eight F-18's From Zaragoza Seek </F> Accommodation at Italy's Aviano Base"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Air Force has chosen 31 Wing, based  at Zaragoza, to take part in the mission to provide air support  for the UN forces in Bosnia, under NATO control. This wing  comprises two squadrons of fighter bombers and two of transport  aircraft, from which will come the eight F-18's and two Hercules  resupply aircraft which will take part in the operation.    Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas yesterday discussed  with Defense Chief of Staff Lieutentant General Jose Rodrigo the  details of the deployment, which will be approved within the  next few days, once the outstanding problems have been resolved.  One of them is identifying the base where the aircraft will be  stationed. According to military sources, this will quite likely  be that of Aviano in northern Italy, since eight U.S. F-18's are  deployed there, and this would enable the Spanish fighters of  the same model to share logistic support.    The Defense Ministry is also seeking to secure assurances  that the Spanish unit's presence in the area will not be  prolonged indefinitely, but will be on a rotating basis and will  be limited to three months in principle. According to the Air  Force plans, the contingent will comprise around 200 military  personnel -- including pilots, mechanics, and support personnel  -- commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The eight F-18's, six of  which would operate simultaneously, will go with their crews,  relieved each month, and with the commander of the squadron of  origin in charge.  <H5>  Repeated Request </H5>   The aircraft will join the air operation deployed by NATO in  Italian bases and aircraft carriers in the Adriatic, comprising  100 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom, France,  the Netherlands, and Turkey, under the command of the commander  of the Fifth Tactical Air Force, based at Vicenza (Italy).  Spain, which had hitherto refused to take part in the  operation, reconsidered its refusal after NATO repeated its  request a few days ago.    Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas said yesterday that  the  decision to send the aircraft will be taken "in the middle of  this week, when some logistic problems have been resolved," EFE  reports. "There are problems of maintenance and effectiveness  which we must discuss" with the United States, he explained.    Garcia Vargas stated that the countries taking part in the  operation "are at the limit of their means, especially as far as  contributing crews is concerned. That is why we are discussing  the possibility of our providing this relief for three months."  He added that he informed the opposition last weekend, although  "not all the groups as yet, because their leaders are engaged in  an election campaign." United Left spokesman Antonio Romero,  who was informed by the minister yesterday, declared himself  opposed: "We do not agree with taking part in NATO actions, and  still less with sending F-18 fighters which guarantee not  peacekeeping but a military escalation."</p>

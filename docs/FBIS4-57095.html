			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban sugar industry workers  intensified their efforts to improve production levels of the  current sugar harvest and to ensure a good harvest next year.    An official report released today announced that Havana  Province will complete its production plans this Tuesday, thus  becoming the first to achieve its goals in the country this year.    Havana Province leaders also said that they have planted 50  percent of the lands assigned for next year's harvest and  surpassed the historic records set for clearing sugar cane  fields.    Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba for the region, emphasized that these achievements were  attained despite the difficult working conditions resulting from  the lack of such vital resources as adequate clothing and foot  ware and despite the cane workers' poor diets.    At this stage of the season, sugar workers are  simultaneously  doing cutting and grinding work as well as field cleaning and  planting chores for next year's harvest.    Besides the progress achieved in Havana after 150 days of  the  harvest season, Ciego de Avila Province, in central Cuba, has  reported the completion of its planting work. Granma, in the  east, defied unfavorable weather conditions and set out to grind  all the cane available. It will soon complete the spring  planting phase. Rain and residual humidity are, in fact, two  more obstacles to overcome for those brigades entrenched in the  battle for higher yields.    While reviewing work progress in the field, Sugar Industry  Minister Nelson Torres praised the determined attitude of the  sugar workers. He underscored the need to harvest and grind all  the available sugar cane in order to reach the planned sugar  production volume. He suggested that the strategy is not to  loose hope because of the rains and to keep the industry working  at its potential, while looking at the harvest as a whole and  doubling efforts.    According to reports released by the Sugar Ministry itself,  the task also includes maintaining the cane planting process at  the current pace, which is what will guarantee a better harvest  next year.</p>

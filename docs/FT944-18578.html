			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Dresdner and BNP strengthen ties Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris plan to strengthen their partnership, established last year, by making joint acquisitions in European countries. The banks want to boost their position in markets where they are under-represented. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner's managing board, said yesterday that they also intended to merge their operations in Spain in the first quarter of next year, the first such move they have made. He told a press conference in Madrid during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings that the banks planned to form a joint subsidiary in Spain and buy out minority equity holders in BNP's operation. He said the banks, which hold small stakes in each other, intended to make joint acquisitions in addition to opening joint operations outside their home countries. There were no acquisition targets, but in countries such as Italy where neither has a strong presence, they might try to acquire an existing commercial or investment banking operation. The BNP/Dresdner co-operation deal has been investigated by the European Commission on competition grounds, but no decision has been taken. The banks want to raise their cross-share holdings to 10 per cent in the long term. The most concrete move the two banks have undertaken has been to open joint subsidiaries in eastern Europe, including Prague, St Petersburg, and Budapest, but Spain would be the first operational merger. Because BNP's operation in Spain is 23 per cent owned by minority shareholders, the restructuring would have to be accompanied by a public offering for their shares. The two banks have established a joint working group to plan the future of the Spanish operation. It is expected to concentrate on large and medium-sized companies, and on private banking for rich individuals. FT banking conference, Page 29</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Lure of the billion-buyer market - With 1.1bn people, the world's biggest consumer market is eyed increasingly seriously. Foreign investment doubled last year and is projected to surge again this year MR YE DISHENG, the lively vice-mayor of Tianjin and the man in charge of attracting foreign investment to the north-east industrial city, had no reservations about his mission in life. Asked if he was concerned about problems of economic overheating, Mr Ye observed: 'It's not nearly hot enough in Tianjin. We want more heat.' While his words may cause a shudder among Beijing bureaucrats charged with restraining China's runaway economy, they also neatly reflect sentiments among Chinese provincial officials who see a rapid inflow of foreign investment as bringing jobs, raising living standards and overcoming acute infrastructural problems. Mr Ye and his colleagues in China's coastal regions and in a handful of inland industrial centres could hardly complain about new investment contracted in 1992, which reached astonishing heights and confirmed China as the main destination for new funds in the world's fastest growing region - and as the recipient last year of about one quarter of funds invested in developing countries worldwide. According to official statistics, China signed agreements in 1992 involving Dollars 68.5bn in foreign capital, two and a half times that for 1991. Foreign funds actually flowing into China last year totalled Dollars 11bn, more than double the year before, and the surge is continuing. Figures this month from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (Moftec) showed that in the first quarter 17,500 projects involving foreign capital - and worth nearly Dollars 25bn - were approved, up 320 per cent on 1992. Western economists urge caution in assessing Chinese statistics, which are invariably accompanied by highly optimistic official interpretation. For a start, China often builds into the investment figures equity from the Chinese side, thus giving an exaggerated impression of the size of the capital inflow. Also, some investment is of Chinese origin but has been routed through offshore entities to take advantage of tax breaks. Many so-called agreements are also little more than memorandums of understanding that stand little chance of yielding projects on the ground. An allied problem has been Chinese sluggishness in absorbing investment due to bureaucratic blockages, infrastructure deficiencies and cultural and political hesitancy. Between 1978, the first year of the economic 'open door' policy, and 1991 China signed contracts worth Dollars 48bn, of which less than half was actually invested. But circumstances are changing, not only in go-go Guangdong province in the south, but also in other cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and now even staid, bureaucratic Beijing, all of which have joined the scramble for investment funds. It is perhaps hard to believe that one man could have such an effect in a country of 1.1bn people, but there is no doubt that a visit to southern China early last year by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's supreme leader, in which he urged swifter growth, employing the simple slogan 'Do it faster', has galvanised a nation. The 'emperor' spoke and officials rushed to do his bidding, culminating in a frenzy of activity in the last quarter of 1992 in which more than Dollars 30bn of contracts were signed, equivalent to figures for the rest of an extraordinary year. Among the more amazing statistics regarding foreign investment to have emerged from China's ever-grinding statistical mill recently were those revealing that in 1992 alone 47,000 joint ventures, co-operative enterprises, and wholly owned foreign ventures were established, exceeding the total number of the previous 14 years. In all, 100,000 enterprises with foreign involvement were registered by the end of the first quarter this year, most of them small businesses such as restaurants and hairdressing salons employing a handful of people each. Hong Kong and Macao investors are behind the bulk of these smaller businesses. But an emerging trend involves increased Japanese, Taiwanese, US, and South Korean investment in larger-scale projects. Japanese companies, which had proved reluctant in the 1980s to become involved in China, are now beginning to make more substantial investments. Taiwanese and South Korean groups, both late starters, are following suit. By the end of 1992, Taiwanese businesses had signed contracts valued at Dollars 8.5bn. Companies from South Korea, which form-alised relations with China last August, had initialled agreements worth Dollars 616m, and much more is in the pipeline. 'More large projects, whose average total investment stands at over scores of millions of US dollars were set up in the first three months,' Mr Yang Xiaogong, a spokesman for Moftec was quoted as saying this week by the official China Daily. Of the actual direct - as opposed to simply contractual - investment recorded by Moftec of about Dollars 37bn to the end of 1992, Hong Kong and Macao head the table with a little more than 50 per cent, or an investment of Dollars 21.2bn, followed by Japan with Dollars 3.9bn, the US on Dollars 3.2bn, Taiwan Dollars 1.9bn and Germany Dollars 471m, to name the top five. Big increases in contracted investment were also recorded by Singapore and Thailand, a reflection of the growing involvement in China of wealthy overseas Chinese in those countries. Interestingly, investment is also beginning to trickle into China from Russia, eastern Europe and the Middle East. Among factors fuelling the investment surge, apart from a bout of 'China fever' that appears to be sweeping the international business community, is the relaxation of restrictions on investment in real estate. Overseas Chinese-controlled companies, especially those based in Hong Kong, have been pouring funds into real estate projects in the hope of capitalising on huge projected demand for commercial and residential property. In Shanghai, for example, the Municipal Investment Commission approved 750 new projects in the first three months of this year worth about Dollars 1.8bn. About half this new investment will be channelled into property. Local investors have also plunged into property development throughout China, especially in the southern regions like Guangdong and Fujian, in the expectation of riding a speculative wave; some of these local property developers may be in for a shock with the government squeezing credit to try to calm an overheated economy. Another factor driving the investment surge is China's embrace of build-operate-transfer infrastructure projects such as those in the power sector. Hong Kong investors such as Mr Gordon Wu of Hopewell Holdings have been active in this area, no doubt encouraged by the bounty earned by early investors in Hong Kong utilities such as China Light and Power. The explosion of activity has contributed to an atmosphere in China somewhat akin to that of a gold rush, with businessmen and their overseas Chinese agents pouring in from all over the world, negotiating deals and signing contracts with apparent abandon.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: DEALING WITH VET LEAVES HIM, HIS WALLET AS NERVOUS AS KITTENS  </P> <P> If members of your family tell you they're sick as a dog, you'd best pray it  isn't so.  </P> <P> Or, anyway, not as sick as a cat.  </P> <P> Or at least not as sick as one of our cats was over the holidays.  </P> <P> This animal, whose name I'm not even sure of, became uncharacteristically  lethargic a few days after Christmas, exhibiting little interest in eating, or  much of anything else.  </P> <P> What he did eat reappeared in odd areas of the house, leading to a great deal  of concern among the kids, particularly in my older son, who wasn't feeling  well himself.  </P> <P> It became obvious that both my son and the cat needed medical attention, so I  made appointments with our family doctor and with the vet.  </P> <P> The family doctor diagnosed my son as having a severe case of laryngitis and  prescribed antibiotics and lots of rest.  </P> <P> The vet was much more ominous in his diagnosis, warning about an AIDS-like  virus sweeping the feline world and asking questions about the cat's personal  life -- intimate items that what's-his-name certainly has never shared with me.  I mean, the truth is I barely know him.  </P> <P> "We had better keep him for a few days and hope for the best," he said. "I'll  have to do some tests.  </P> <P> "The problem is the regular lab isn't open New Year's Day, so I'll have to  personally run the blood samples and stuff over to the emergency lab.  </P> <P> "Which I'm happy to do."  </P> <P> My wallet did a little involuntary jump.  </P> <P> I waited until the kids were out of the room and asked something I would never  ask about their care, especially in an emergency situation.  </P> <P> "Uh, can you give me some kind of estimate?"  </P> <P> "Well," he replied, obviously not understanding the question, "if all the tests  are negative and we're talking about just an intestinal disorder, I would hope  we can have him home in a few days.  </P> <P> "Of course, if it's something more serious. . . ." He sighed, and suddenly  looked very helpless.  </P> <P> "Let's just cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's try to be positive,  shall we?"  </P> <P> He apparently had misinterpreted the little beads of perspiration that had  appeared on my upper lip, so I tried a more direct approach.  </P> <P> "Uh, I don't want to sound uncaring or indelicate, but in terms of cost, uh,  could you give me some idea, uh, of. . . ."  </P> <P> He stared out the window for a few minutes (possibly, but I can't be absolutely  sure, to determine what kind of car I was driving).  </P> <P> "Well, at this point, of course, it's hard to say, but if you'd like, I could  do some figuring."  </P> <P> He left the room for a few minutes and reappeared with a piece of paper he  handed the receptionist, who then spent an inordinate amount of time with her  calculator.  </P> <P> She handed me a yellow printed sheet with items checked -- "fecal flotation,"  "blood test," "medications" and "in-patient accomd.," among others.  </P> <P> The bottom line -- actually, the third from the bottom line -- was somewhere  between $135 and $360, or what used to be a down payment on a congressman.  </P> <P> "You will keep me informed at each stage of his treatment?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, why?" he replied, raising his eyebrows slightly, as if he expected me to  say something like, "Well, when you get to $200. . . ." and then yank my tie  straight up, jerk my neck to the side, cross my eyes and make a gagging sound.  </P> <P> Instead, I repeated his suggestion that we cross that bridge when we get to it.  </P> <P> He called two days later. "Good news," he said. "Your cat only has an  intestinal infection and he can go home Tuesday morning."  </P> <P> The upshot is the cat is fine now, or as fine as $192 can make a cat. My son is  better, also. His bill was $35, plus $16 for some antibiotics.  </P> <P> There's probably a message there somewhere, but I'm not sure I'm in the mood to  go into it. At least not right now.  </P> <P> I mean, after all, we are talking about a cat here, although I have to admit  that he's changed since his illness and become something he never was before.  </P> <P> Valuable.  </P></p>

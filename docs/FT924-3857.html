			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Crude oil Cynics might regard last week's fall in crude oil prices as the natural response to the latest Opec agreement. Clearly the deal was hard to reach, even though it involves only a nominal cut in output to 24.6m barrels a day. And even that cut is only temporary. Indeed, with most members producing at or near full capacity, it is questionable whether the oil producers are really acting as a cartel at all. The subtext to the latest tensions within Opec is the desire to keep output as high as possible before negotiations begin to re-admit Iraqi oil to the market. Once that occurs quotas will have to be cut, so the race is on to establish benchmarks. That is not to say, however, that even a badly co-ordinated Opec will let crude prices slide indefinitely before acting. The memory of the 1986 collapse is still burnt deeply into Opec psyches. Besides, supply and demand are not far from balance at present. If there were a cold snap on either side of the Atlantic, or an interruption in supply, the rebound in crude oil prices could be sharp. The assumption of a gently falling trading range is a dangerous one.</p>

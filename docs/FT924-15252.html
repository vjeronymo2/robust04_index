			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / US legislators rush for home: Re-election for many is growing more elusive MEMBERS of Congress have rarely been so eager to leave Washington and return to their districts. But incumbent US legislators have also rarely been so vulnerable to challenge. With both the Senate and the House of Representatives now ready to recess, the congressmen are rushing home to devote themselves to getting re-elected. The congressional ranks have already been strikingly reduced by a string of voluntary and involuntary departures. These include such familiar faces as Senator Warren Rudman, co-author of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that tried vainly to keep the budget deficit in check in the 1980s, and Representative Dante Fascell, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee. Next year's new Congress will see an unprecedented number of new faces taking up residence on Capitol Hill. Turnover always seemed likely to be high with the passing of an elderly generation of lawmakers and with the 10-yearly redrawing of district boundaries to take account of new census data. Redistricting alone has been projected by some to cost the Democratic party up to 40 seats from their 266-seat majority in the House. Besides faster population growth in Republican party areas, and the likely undoing of some of the more egregious gerrymanders of 1982, new court interpretations of the Voting Rights Act compelled the creation of more districts with predominant populations of ethic minorities. This has resulted in the drawing of some overwhelmingly Democratic districts, but left the Republicans stronger in many others by siphoning off black voters who remain, for the most part, strongly Democratic. Taking a heavier toll, however, has been a growing feeling of disillusionment among the people at large. Within Congress, this has been translated into the retirement of some young and promising members. Outside, it has fed an anti-incumbent wave that has brought the downfall in party primaries of established politicians like Sen Alan Dixon of Illinois or Rep Beverly Byron of Maryland. The November 3 general election could sweep out many more. The worst mark against incumbent members, in many parts of the country, has been the House bank scandal. Members who abused the lax overdraft privileges at the House's private bank have faced fierce political attacks from their opponents, and even a handful of overdrawn cheques has been enough to bring some members to defeat. The plight of the incumbent was epitomised by Rep Stephen Solarz of New York, for years one of the most important foreign policy voices in the House. Forced by redistricting into a Hispanic majority district, Mr Solarz struggled bravely to learn Spanish. Foreign policy expertise, however, does not provide the same kind of armour as old-fashioned constituent service; his impressive total of overdrawn cheques put paid to his hopes, and he was duly defeated in a primary ballot last month. President George Bush has tried to capitalise on anti-Congress sentiment by urging voters that the best way of breaking the 'gridlock' in Washington between his Republican administration and the Democratic-controlled legislature is to elect a Republican majority. Events have not, however, turned out all the Republicans' way. They, too, have lost incumbents in the wake of the House bank scandal, including Rep Vin Weber, an intellectual leader of the younger right wing of his party. Many Republicans, too, have simply given up the struggle of being an apparently permanent minority. Perhaps most significantly, the Republicans' chances of reducing the Democrats' majority in the Senate, which two years ago seemed at least fair, have evaporated. Unlike in the House, where members must stand for re-election every two years, only a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs each election year (although the number has risen to 36 this time because of special elections to fill the remaining terms of senators who have died or resigned). Nevertheless, at least four Senate seats currently held by Republicans are, on the latest polling data, tipping the Democrats' way, and two more look vulnerable. Only two seats held by the Democrats show the same vulnerability. All told, the Democrats are now generally expected at worst to hold their 57-to-43 Senate majority. In the House, where the Democrats' 266 seats loom over the Republicans' 166, Rep Vic Fazio, chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, says he expects a loss of between 20 and 35 seats, which would certainly not be enough to threaten the Democratic majority. On the other hand there is little prospect of the Democrats winning a two-thirds majority in either house, the amount that would enable them on their own to override presidential legislative vetoes. If there is to be a change to break Washington's partisan gridlock, it seems more likely to come in the White House. Yet, with deaths, retirements and primary defeats, the House is assured of seeing at least 130 new members, and the Senate nine. With this turnover the new Congress could be ready for radical institutional change and a fresh approach to working with the administration.</p>

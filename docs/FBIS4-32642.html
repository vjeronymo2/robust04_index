			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, received today General Michael  Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, at his request. Army General Rasim Delic,  chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Viktor  Andreyev, chief of the UNPROFOR civilian sector for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the talks. General Rose  complained about the increase in the number of attacks on  UNPROFOR by both sides.    President Izetbegovic said that our policy is full  cooperation with UNPROFOR, and that everything will be done to  provide them with normal conditions for work. He stressed that  the cease-fire had to hold on the entire territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not partially, as it suits the  aggressor. Military observers for the monitoring of the  cease-fire should be deployed in a reciprocal fashion on both  our and the aggressors' side, but the presence of the  aggressor's liaison officers on our territory is unacceptable.    General Rose said that intensive work was under way in  Gorazde to solve the problems with the return of the population  to their homes in the zone within 3 km. Asked by Rose about the  possibility of extending the cease-fire for another four weeks,  President Izetbegovic said that this would depend on the  progress made in the political negotiations.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Terminal plan will fly in face of local opposition: The need for expansion at London's main airport A fifth terminal at London's Heathrow Airport is an important but only partial step towards giving the London region capacity to meet passenger demand forecast to rise from just over 60m people this year to 170m by 2016. Although BAA, formerly the British Airports Authority, yesterday tried to focus attention on its plans to build the Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m terminal at Heathrow, it conceded that it would have to consider building a second terminal at Stansted Airport in Essex to cope with passenger growth in the next century. The Civil Aviation Authority also believes a new runway will be necessary in the south-east soon after the turn of the century. A working party is studying possible sites for the additional runway, which many in the industry believe is likely to be built at Stansted. But the fierce public debate and local opposition traditionally provoked by airport expansion has forced BAA to adopt a softly-softly approach to its long-term plans for its London airports. Local authorities reacted strongly to BAA's announcement. They fear that the new terminal would increase the number of flights at Heathrow, cause even greater noise and disturbance and worsen traffic congestion on the over-crowded M25 and M4 links to the airport. However, for BAA and the air transport industry as a whole, an additional terminal at Heathrow has become an urgent priority if the airport is to maintain its position as a leading international aviation hub and accommodate the steady growth in passenger numbers and a new generation of large wide-body aircraft. Mr Gunter Eser, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, said: 'Terminal 5 is the key to the continued development of air services to the UK. Without the terminal . . . Britain alone would stand to lose a billion dollars of economic activity every year.' Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, warned that if the terminal was not built, the UK air transport industry risked facing 'the general decline we have seen in other industries'. Other European airports such as Paris or Amsterdam would take over some of Heathrow's share of the international passenger market, he added. The tortuous process of planning applications (there are expected to be several public inquiries) is expected to take five years. BAA hopes the government will give the go-ahead for the project in 1997. That will enable the first phase of the terminal to be completed by 2001. The new terminal would provide additional annual capacity at Heathrow for 10m passengers from 2002, giving the airport total capacity of about 60m passengers a year. The second phase would be completed by 2016, adding room for an extra 20m passengers a year. Even with the completion of the first phase of the project, demand is expected to exceed capacity in the London area by 2005. With the completion of the second phase, there would still be a capacity shortfall of 27m passengers by the year 2016, according to current traffic forecasts. That is likely to lead to construction of a second terminal at Stansted. Although the Pounds 400m Stansted complex opened last year is still struggling to attract traffic, BAA remains confident that the airport will eventually fill up as passenger growth recovers from last year's downturn in air travel caused by the Gulf war and the recession. Demand at Gatwick is also expected to grow during the next few years. Although a further runway will be necessary in the south-east, the expansion of Heathrow will not involve construction of a fourth runway there. 'The new generation of larger, quieter aircraft will help to deliver many more passengers without the need for any extra night flights or an additional runway at Heathrow,' Sir John said. Apart from accommodating the forecast 3.8 per cent annual growth in passenger traffic between now and 2016, the project will also be closely integrated with a broader scheme to improve road and rail access into Heathrow. In addition to the proposed fourth lane for the M25, BAA is discussing with the Department of Transport plans to improve other road links to the airport including the M4 and the A4. BAA is expected to be involved in the funding of these crucial infrastructure projects. BAA also intends to go ahead with its plans to open a Pounds 235m express rail link between Heathrow and central London in 1996. But BAA's original rail link project in partnership with British Rail has now been overtaken by the government's privatisation plans for BR. Sir John said he saw no big obstacle to halt the project, although it is likely to lead to a different partnership to finance and eventually operate the link. The new terminal would also be connected to the Piccadilly Underground line. Without improved road and rail links, the new terminal would do little to ease the growing stress levels of air travellers.</p>

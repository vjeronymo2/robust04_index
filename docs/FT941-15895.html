			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Kiev offered missile-debt swap A key factor in clinching the deal due to be signed tomorrow between the US, Russia and Ukraine on the return of Ukraine's warheads to Russia was the promise by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, to supply Ukraine with oil and gas below world prices, senior US officials said. The Russians have also offered to wipe out at least part of Ukraine's energy debt to Moscow. However, the deal is already causing controversy within Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk confirmed last night after meeting President Bill Clinton, who had made a stopover visit in Kiev, that he would go to Moscow to sign the deal. Officials had earlier in the week suggested he would not initial a full agreement because of insufficient consensus on details. Mr Kravchuk was upbeat on prospects that parliament would back him on the missile issue. He said: 'I hope the parliament will see present-day realities, see the essence of this agreement and the wishes of the three states. When they understand this they will support the agreement.' A senior official of Gasprom, the Russian monopoly gas producer, yesterday said that if a gas-for-weapons swap and an agreement on debt forgiveness had been agreed 'at the highest level', Gasprom would have to be compensated, and the state had no resources to do that. Ukraine owes the Russians Rbs1,000bn for gas supplies, one-third of their total debt to Moscow. Mr Kravchuk's willingness to sign the nuclear missile accord, even at the price of strong domestic opposition, has demonstrated Russia's growing influence over its Slav neighbour, now racked by hyperinflation, falling production and energy shortages. The promise of lower oil and gas prices has also been used to get agreement between Russia and Belarus on economic union between the two states. Mr Yeltsin yesterday met Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarus head of state, but the official communique issued after the meeting made no mention of the agreement signed in principle last week by the two countries' prime ministers and central bankers.</p>

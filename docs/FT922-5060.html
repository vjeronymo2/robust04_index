			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Lenders will defend record CHIEF executives of the top 10 UK mortgage lenders will today try to persuade ministers that they have managed to prevent evictions of thousands of homeowners unable to maintain mortgage payments. The Pounds 800m mortgage rescue programme announced last December has nevertheless so far failed to get off the ground. At the meeting will be Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Sir George Young, housing minister. They will tell lenders of their disappointment that only a dozen households seem to have been spared eviction by the mortgage rescue schemes agreed between lenders and the government. Lenders say legal and commercial snags have delayed full operation of the schemes, but that they have saved tens of thousands of homeowners from eviction by negotiating easier terms. About 275,000 mortgage borrowers were six months or more behind with payments at the start of the year, but evictions by the end of the year are likely to be close to last year's 76,000. That suggests that lenders have found ways of saving about 200,000 homeowners.</p>

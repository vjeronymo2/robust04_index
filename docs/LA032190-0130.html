			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DETAIL IS THE KEY TO ARCHITECTURE, STEVEN HOLL TELLS UCI FORUM  </P> <P> New York architect Steven Holl had not been to Newport Beach for 24 years, he  told his listeners at the start of a lecture Monday night in UC Irvine's  Beckman Center. His last visit was a post-high school surfing adventure during  which the powerful waves pulling against his paddling suddenly made him feel  his life was about to end.  </P> <P> The obligatory anecdotal opener was oddly revealing. In a talk filled with  abstruse ideas and illustrated with slides of arresting images that sometimes  had no apparent connection with architecture, Holl's big theme was the  importance of understanding the way spaces are experienced by the body.  </P> <P> The subject (with fellow architect Emilio Ambasz) of an exhibition at the  Museum of Modern Art in New York last year, Holl is considered one of America's  leading young architects. Founded in 1977, his firm has won seven citations  from Progressive Architecture magazine. He is the author of "Anchoring," a book  about his work published by Princeton University Press.  </P> <P> "People don't experience (architectural) plans," Holl said. "They experience  the detail."  </P> <P> In the design of a clothing shop in New York, Holl said he wanted to create the  maximum sense of density on the exterior and the maximum quality of lightness  on the interior. For the storefront, he used cast glass ("almost a kind of  ice") and created door handles that were literally peeled out of the brass  plates that form the door, revealing the thickness of the door. Inside, he used  "the thinnest" countertops and reveled -- in his spare, disciplined way -- in  the "tactility" of wire mesh.  </P> <P> In an attempt to explain his intellectually complex yet innately poetic  approach to architecture, the 42-year-old architect rambled freely through the  broader world of culture and everyday life.  </P> <P> One slide of a woman biting into the stone toe of a statue from a film by Luis  Bunuel evoked Holl's notion of "the physicality of material." A captioned image  of a Japanese man brushing his teeth "using only a finger and a little salt"  illustrated Holl's awareness of the forms of traditional culture when he set  about designing a Japanese apartment building.  </P> <P> One of the guiding lights of Holl's particular vision is the phenomenon of  parallax, according to which an object appears to change position depending on  where you are when you look at it. A fanciful-sounding project of his for the  city of Paris involves "ultra-thin towers" that create changing spatial  relationships among themselves as the viewer walks through neighboring streets.  </P> <P> Designing an addition to a public library in Berlin, Holl was intrigued by what  he called the "browsing circuit": the paths visitors take as they seek out  books that might interest them. The ramps and asymmetrical boxes that surround  the original building take the circuit into account while "shearing" the space  to create a sequence of different views.  </P> <P> A retail-office-residential complex in Seaside, Fla., was a routine project;  the problem, as Holl saw it, was "how to intensify meaning." He imagined five  of the apartment-dwellers as "boisterous types whose balconies face the  (public) square, who toast the sunset and have Jacuzzis." Each unit would be  identical since the residents all drive BMWs.  </P> <P> But the other three residents would be "melancholic types who face the rising  sun." He conceived of one as a tragic poet whose apartment had skinny windows  and a skimpy awning on the roof like a rag on a pole. Another would be a  musician, and the third, a mathematician in whose living spaces "everything is  slightly warped."  </P> <P> Other dreamlike solutions are everywhere in Holl's work. "Hinged spaces" in a  Japanese apartment building can open up select portions of the walls to create  shifting patterns of light and space. ("The sun brings (these apartments) to  life, not the architect's gesture.") Grandest of all is a visionary plan for  Phoenix, Ariz. -- part of a project to reverse the creeping sprawl of cities --  to "bracket the desert" with a Maginot Line of 30-foot-wide adobe-like  buildings.  </P> <P> Holl's talk was part of "California and Beyond; the State of Design in the  '90s," a series presented by the Architecture and Design Council of the Newport  Harbor Art Museum. Next on the schedule is graphic designer April Greiman,  speaking at UCI on March 28 at 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

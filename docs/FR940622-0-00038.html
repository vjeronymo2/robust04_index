			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that section 1867 of the Act also applies to all individuals who attempt to gain access to the hospital for emergency care. An individual may not be denied services simply because the person failed to actually enter the facility's designated emergency department. To read the statute in such a narrow fashion would in our view frustrate the objectives of the statute in many cases and lead to arbitrary results. For the same reason, a facility may not prevent an individual from gaining access to the facility in order to circumvent these requirements. If an individual is on a facility's property, which includes ambulances owned and operated by the facility, even if the ambulance is not on hospital property, and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, we believe the statute reasonably requires the facility to provide a screening examination and treatment or transfer in accordance with section 1867 of the statute. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department. However, an individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance located off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department if someone staffing the ambulance contacts the hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment. This is in accordance with the recent court decision that, for purposes of section 1867 of the Act, a hospital-operated telemetry system is distinct from the same hospital's emergency department. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Johnson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> University of Chicago Hospitals,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992 U.S. App. Lexis 25096 (7th Cir. 1992).) Thus, the hospital may deny such access when it is in ``diversionary'' status because it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients at that time. However, if the ambulance disregards the hospital's instructions and does bring the individual on to hospital grounds the hospital cannot deny the individual access to hospital services whether or not the hospital is in ``diversionary'' status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters noted that these requirements could have a greater impact on some hospitals than on others. For example, rural hospitals would have a greater recordkeeping burden in documenting transfers because they have smaller emergency room (ER) staffs; hospitals with high ER rates for non-Medicare or Medicaid patients would have to provide care for which these programs will not directly compensate, and some hospitals will have to accept larger numbers of indigent patients presenting themselves for treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law specifically applies to all hospitals that participate in Medicare and that offer emergency services. We have, therefore, inserted the following definition in &sect;489.24(b): ``Hospital with an emergency department means a hospital that offers services for emergency medical conditions (as defined in this paragraph) within its capability to do so.'' It is also clear that the statute only requires hospitals that offer emergency services to provide screening and stabilizing treatment within the scope of their capabilities (sections 1867(a) and (b) of the Act). We acknowledge, however, that any participating hospital providing emergency services, regardless of size or patient mix, must provide screening and stabilizing treatment, as needed, to individuals who present themselves for examination or treatment. We recognize that this could create uneven uncompensated care burdens on some hospitals because of larger than usual concentrations of indigent patients; however, we do not believe that this will often be the case. Since the requirements apply to all 6,700 Medicare participating hospitals, among 7,000 U.S. hospitals offering emergency services, we also believe that the statute will lighten the burden on some hospitals now subject to increased patient loads due to inappropriate transfers because patients are more likely to be treated and stabilized at the hospitals where they first present themselves for treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Medical Screening Examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

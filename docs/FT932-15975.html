			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Legal aid restrictions to go ahead: Law Society wins leave to challenge Mackay's move LORD MACKAY, the lord chancellor, is to go ahead with cuts in legal aid eligibility from next week in spite of a High Court ruling yesterday allowing the Law Society to challenge the validity of his proposals. The solicitors' governing body was granted leave to seek a judicial review of the lord chancellor's plans after Lord Mackay decided not to oppose its application. Mr Justice Macpherson said the case should be heard as soon as possible in view of the 'enormous public interest'. The hearing is expected to take place at the end of May. Mr Michael Beloff QC, for the society, told the judge both sides had reached 'a combined view' that the issues raised by the case should be argued at a full High Court hearing. He said that 'in the circumstances' the society would not be applying for a court order suspending the changes - due to come into force on day - until after the legal challenge had been concluded. The society maintains that the changes, which will reduce the qualifying disposable income limit for free legal aid to income-support levels and increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases, could affect up to 14m people in England and Wales. Lord Mackay has dismissed those figures as 'absurd'. He maintains that in practical terms about 120,000 of the 3m people who receive financial assistance from the scheme each year would be affected. After yesterday's hearing the Lord Chancellor's Department said the challenge would be 'strongly opposed'. It added: 'In the meantime the lord chancellor does not propose to delay the April 12 implementation of the regulations, which were debated and approved in the House of Commons on March 31.' It was 'administratively too difficult' to withdraw the regulations at this stage, it said. If they were eventually ruled unlawful only a few people would have been affected in the weeks they were in force. Mr Mark Sheldon, the society's president, last night wrote to Lord Mackay urging him to think again and suspend the regulations. 'If the regulations come into force on April 12, many people who have an urgent need for legal advice - perhaps to avoid eviction or to obtain an injunction in a domestic violence case - will be irreparably prejudiced, whatever the court's final decision,' he said. This is the second time in a month that the society has won permission to challenge the legal aid proposals. In March the same judge gave the society leave to seek a judicial review of the lord chancellor's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts. That challenge will be heard on April 29. In both cases the society alleges that Lord Mackay has acted outside his powers under the 1988 Legal Aid Act. The society claims his proposals on standard fees for criminal work are contrary to the principle set out in the act that a solicitor is entitled to 'fair remuneration' for a case. In the latest case the society says the regulations were made without proper consultation as required by the act.</p>

A 22-year-old Thai, Natachai Jencharoenwatama, stood proudly  next to Korean cadets on the campus of the Air Force Academy in  Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Tuesday as a member of the  46th class.    Natachai, born in Kanchanaburi, was selected as one of 14  cadets given the privilege of studying abroad while a freshman  at the Thai Air Force academy in 1992.    He arrived in March last year and took a one-year Korean  language course at the Seoul National University Language  Institute before moving on to the North Chungchong campus in  January.    He underwent five weeks of basic military training and tried  to get used to the unfamiliar language and environment.    "I like chicken and pork, but I don't know about kimchi  yet,"  he said in broken Korean.    Natachai has four years of regular courses still ahead and  will most likely get used to kimchi and many other things Korean  by then.    "I'm prepared to learn the advanced studies and skills of  the  Korean Air Force to be an excellent Thai hawk," he said.    The Korean Air Force Academy said it will continue to open  its doors to foreigners as well as recruit female cadets from  next year.</p>

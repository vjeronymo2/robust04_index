In order to wring concessions from North Korea, China's  aggressive efforts to persuade North Korea are indispensable  because it has maintained friendly relations with North Korea.  President Kim is set to pay a visit to China on 26 March and how  he wins cooperation from the Chinese leadership has become a  focal point.    One year has already passed since North Korea was found to  be  suspected of developing nuclear weapons, but North Korea's  insincere attitude has deepened suspicions that it is developing  nuclear weapons. As Prime Minister Hosokawa stated in Beijing,  the international community is losing its patience with North  Korea. The UN Security Council appears to be adopting a  resolution calling on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our view is that if  North Korea continues to take the tough stand, it will be  inevitable for the UN Security Council to discuss slapping  economic sanctions against it. Needless to say, enforcing  economic sanctions would be met with various difficulties. To  make the economic sanctions effective, Japan probably needs to  ban the remittance of money by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North  Korea, but it is not easy for Japan to completely ban it. A  humanitarian issue would be raised depending on the way the  Japanese Government deals with ethnic Koreans in Japan. If a  sea blockade is imposed against North Korea, Japan would face  the question of how far the Self-Defense Forces should cooperate  with the sea blockade. Full discussions should be held to look  for ways to resolve those problems without keeping them secret.    There still remains another course of action. Attempts  should be made to persuade North Korea to the last without  closing the door for a dialogue with that country.    In that instance, China holds the key. How earnestly will  China persuade North Korea? It exports more than 1 million tons  of oil to North Korea a year. It is in a position to exercise  great influence on North Korea if it wants to.    On the present state of North Korea's nuclear development,  China takes a different view from those of Japan, South Korea,  and the United States. It is opposed to applying hasty  international pressure on North Korea. As for persuading North  Korea, it has said, "We will make efforts to persuade North  Korea, but there is a limit to our role in persuading that  country."    President Kim will visit China on 26 March and the  international community will pay close attention on how he will  urge China to abandon its passive attitude and make more  vigorous efforts than ever to persuade North Korea. We hope that  in response to President Kim's call, China will cooperate a  little more vigorously with Japan, South Korea, and the United  States.    If there were a forum to discuss the issue of security in  Northeast Asia, a summit meeting would be held to focus its  attention on the issue of North Korea's nuclear development.  Given the present situation in which such a forum does not  exist, neighboring nations have no choice but to work to resolve  the issue through frequent exchange of visits.    This time, South Korea is playing an important role as a  spadeworker and we would like to note its role. South Korea  could not play such a role before that country and China  normalized their relations. If Japan and South Korea had  continued to stick to the issue of their past history, it would  have been difficult for the two countries to take such concerted  steps. We hope that a forum will be created to discuss security  of Northeast Asia after the issue of North Korea's nuclear  development is resolved.</p>

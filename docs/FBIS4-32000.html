			<p>BFN     [Text] Poznan, June 16 -- Deputy Prime Minister and Finance  Minister Grzegorz Kolodko stressed in Poznan on Thursday that  according to Polish businessmen, the "Strategy for Poland"  provides for a credible economic programme. Kolodko met with  businessmen, bankers, and scholars during the Poznan  international fair to discuss the future of the Polish economy.    "The programme is credible for the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), that is for the people who can count money much  better than us. The programme is also credible for the  ministers responsible for the economy and finance in countries  of the European Union," Kolodko added.    Deputy President of the Polish Business Council Jan Kulczyk  stressed that its members were satisfied with the way the  government solved the question of taxes in the programme. He  called on the minister to ensure the same conditions for Polish  capital as there are for foreign investors in Poland. Foreign  companies should play a complementary role in Poland's economic  development and new companies should be protected by the  government.    Polish businessmen also talked about the possibilities of  cooperation with companies in the east, including China. It was  emphasised that without the support of the government policy it  would be difficult to regain the previous position on the  markets of the former Soviet Union. The finance minister said  the government had already adopted some regulations aimed to  boost economic cooperation and not only export expansion to the  east. The government assumes that exports and imports with the  east will increase faster in the years 1994-1997. Kolodko also  spoke about the government's efforts to solve the problem of  mutual debt.    Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Leslaw Podkanski,  who  also participated in the meeting, told Polish businessmen that  his ministry keeps a data bank on eastern markets. He also said  that his ministry is planning to set up eight trade centres east  of Poland.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays For all its ambition in speciality chemicals, English China Clays is shackled to the business its name describes. Yet supplying kaolin to paper makers is thankless when the industry is blighted by recession and over-capacity. Since many ECC customers are in countries with weak currencies, even sterling's exit from the ERM brought scant relief. The bleak message is that attempts to hold the line on pricing have been abandoned. Margin benefits from earlier rounds of rationalisation have been lost. While that justifies ECC's decision to look for growth elsewhere, the commitment to pay an unchanged dividend which accompanied June's rights issue now looks a burden. Sales of surplus land underpin the cash cost of the pay-out, but it may not be covered by earnings. The picture is worse if profits from disposals and building materials, which is to be demerged, are stripped out. Demerger might get ECC out of a tight spot, as it did for ICI. Loading building materials with more than its fair share of the dividend would provide relief for the parent without loss of face. But that relies on a recovery in aggregates, which is far from evident. The gamble then is that ECC can buy or conjure earnings growth before the cracks start to show.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / MMC perfume report due today THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is due to hand its report on perfume prices to the Department of Trade and Industry today. The Office of Fair Trading asked the commission to investigate nine months ago after complaints that leading fragrance houses were maintaining prices at an artificially high level. The Superdrug chain, which had been cutting as much as 30 per cent off recommended retail prices, complained to the OFT that fragrance manufacturers were refusing to supply stores. Officials at the department are expected to consider the report for three to four weeks before publishing its findings and deciding whether any trading rules have been violated. Superdrug was supported in its complaints by Asda and Littlewoods.</p>

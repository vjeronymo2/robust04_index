			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Shake-up pushes CPC into loss The cost of a restructuring plan recently announced by CPC International, the US food manufacturer, resulted in a net loss of Dollars 14.9m in the second quarter, compared with net profits of Dollars 116.9m a year earlier. Last month CPC said it would shed 2,600 jobs from its international workforce of 39,000 during the next two years, as part of a plan to increase efficiency by consolidating some of its manufacturing operations. The company had warned that the restructuring would produce a pre-tax charge of Dollars 227m to second-quarter profits, equivalent to Dollars 137m after tax, and the shares closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 5/8 yesterday. CPC, whose brands include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, said net income would have risen by 4.7 per cent to Dollars 122.4m without the restructuring charge, and earnings per share from 76 cents to 81 cents. The growth was driven by a 9.9 per cent increase in worldwide sales to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.69bn. Part of this came from acquisitions, but CPC also suffered from the negative effect of exchange rates on European currencies, which continued weak against the dollar in the second quarter. CPC said the European operations had resumed strong earnings growth in spite of exchange rate weakness. Asian volumes increased substantially, and Best Foods, its North American operation, 'turned in an acceptable performance in a difficult environment'. The second-quarter loss per share was 11 cents. For the first half, net income fell from Dollars 207.3m to Dollars 83.2m after the restructuring charge, and earnings per share dropped from Dollars 1.34 to 52 cents.</p>

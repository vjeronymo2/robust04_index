			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nissan forced into further cut in capital expenditure NISSAN, Japan's second-largest carmaker, is cutting capital investment further this year as its attempt to emerge from losses is hindered by weak domestic demand and the appreciation of the yen. The group aims to reduce capital outlays by some Y20bn more than planned, bringing the total for the year to next March to around Y150bn (Dollars 1.44bn) - down by a quarter from the Y199bn in the 1992 financial year. Capital spending for 1994 and 1995 would be held at this year's level. A streamlining plan announced in February had envisaged a Y170bn capital budget for the year, but that was based on an assumed Y112.5 average exchange rate to the dollar. The rate is now nudging Y104, and Nissan says it suffers Y11bn in exchange losses for every Y1 by which the yen strengthens against the US currency. Last year Nissan slid into losses of Y26.25bn before tax (Y15.05bn net), its first deficit since just after the second world war. When it announced the loss in May, the company said it aimed to break even this time both at pre-tax and net level. Yesterday the company said it 'strongly hoped' to achieve that forecast, but cost-cutting had to be stepped up by about Y30bn, of which the extra capital expenditure savings would form the biggest part. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president, said yesterday: 'We expected that vehicle sales (in Japan) in the second half of 1993 would recover. But the yen's appreciation against the dollar is likely to damage the economy and sales during this period.' Nissan is also squeezing margins further at its suppliers, and is placing some hope in two new sports models for the domestic market. Sales of securities holdings may boost the bottom line, but Nissan will have to draw about Y17.6bn from reserves in order to make dividend payments. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, the tyre and sporting goods maker which owns Dunlop in Europe, reported interim profits down 14.2 per cent to Y4.13bn. Sales were 5.7 per cent lower at Y116.3bn. For 1993 as a whole it projected profits of Y10bn before tax, down 15.3 per cent. It aims to maintain a Y9 dividend, of which Y4 is being paid now.</p>

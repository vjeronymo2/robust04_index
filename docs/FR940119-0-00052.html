If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility for a limited access scallop permit, based on one vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access scallop permit and the DAS allocation according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A limited access scallop permit for 1994 will not be issued unless the application for such permit is received by the Regional Director on or before December 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility in 1995 and thereafter.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be eligible to renew or apply for a limited access scallop permit after 1994, a vessel must have been issued a limited access scallop permit for the preceding year, or the vessel must be replacing a vessel that had been issued a limited access scallop permit for the preceding year, and, if applicable, the vessel must meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility to apply for a limited access scallop permit based on one vessel's fishing and permit history after 1994, the Regional Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access scallop permit and the DAS allocation according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change in ownership. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The fishing and permit history of a vessel is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Replacement vessels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To be eligible to replace a vessel that has been issued a limited access scallop permit, the replacement vessel must meet the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The replacement vessel's horsepower may not exceed by more than 20 percent the horsepower of the vessel it is replacing as of the date the vessel it is replacing was initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified on a valid application for a permit under this section; except that, the horsepower of the replacement vessel may not exceed the horsepower of the vessel being replaced if the horsepower of the vessel being replaced has been increased through upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a 1994 limited access scallop permit; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The replacement vessel's length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage may not exceed by more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the vessel being replaced, based on specifications provided in the initial 1994 application for a limited access scallop permit; except that, the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the replacement vessel may not exceed the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the vessel initially issued a limited access scallop permit if any or all of these specifications have been increased through upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a 1994 limited access scallop permit. For purposes of this paragraph, a vessel not required to be documented under Title 46, U.S.C. will be considered to be 5 gross registered tons. For undocumented vessels, net tonnage does not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Upgraded vessel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To remain eligible to retain a valid limited access scallop permit, or to apply for, or renew a limited access scallop permit, a vessel may be upgraded, whether through refitting or replacement, only if the upgrade complies with the following limitations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The vessel's horsepower may be increased, whether through refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase may not exceed 20 percent of the horsepower of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified in that vessel's permit application for a 1994 limited access scallop permit; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The vessel's length, gross registered tonnage and net tonnage may be upgraded, whether through refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase shall not exceed 10 percent each of the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified in that vessel's application for a 1994 limited access scallop permit. This limitation allows only one upgrade, at which time any or all three specifications of vessel size may be increased. This type of upgrade may be done separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

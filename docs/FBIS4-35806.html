			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated that Egypt has not  supplied the Government of Rwanda with any weapons or ammunition  since the outbreak of the conflict in Rwanda. No contracts for  the supply of weapons or ammunition have been concluded since  the start of the Rwandan conflict. Egypt has suspended the  delivery of weapons contracted prior to the outbreak of the  conflict in Rwanda, the source added.    The source made this statement to comment on reports  broadcast by the Rwandan Front's radio that Egypt has recently  sold 33 tons of weapons worth $765,000 to the Government of  Rwanda. The responsible source concluded his comment by saying  that what has been delivered under earlier contracts preceded  the outbreak of the conflict and was part a commercial deal  concluded with Rwanda, similar what has been done with other  countries. The implementation of the remainder of the contract  was suspended immediately after the outbreak of the internal  conflict in Rwanda. The source added that Egypt is eager to  stop the bloodshed in Rwanda and halt anything that may subject  the Rwandan people to further destruction.</p>

Vernadskiy, Moscow; UDC543.70]    [Abstract] The control of trace quantities of organic  substances of industrial origin, such as petroleum and petroleum  products, in natural, potable, and waste waters is becoming more  and more significant from the environmental standpoint.  Luminescent methods are normally used to detect contamination  from petroleum products. The visible fluorescence of petroleum  and petroleum products results from the presence of aromatic and  heterocyclic compounds absorbed in the ultraviolet region of the  spectrum. However, it bears noting that modern  spectrofluorometric methods for detecting traces of petroleum  products in water are encumbered with lengthy sample preparation  (extraction, sorption) in order to separate the polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU). In natural waters, PAU fluorescence  is recorded against a background of dissolved organic substances  (ROV) and a spontaneous Raman spectrum of excited illumination  on the water molecules, thus making it impossible to determine  trace quantities of PAU directly without their preliminary  separation. Synchronous spectrofluorometric methods are an  exception, although they require costly equipment and specially  trained personnel. Thus the problem of an express method for  detecting and assaying the degree of contamination remains in  essence the as the isolation of a fluorescence signal of PAU  against a background of ROV illumination. In the present work an  express laser-luminescent technique was developed which makes it  possible to conduct spectral fractionation of PAU contamination  without supplemental treatment of the water sample. The use of  periodic pulsed excitation in conjunction with signal gathering  enables determination of PAU within the range 5 X  10[.sup]-10[/] - 1 X 10[.sup]-7[/] g/ml.

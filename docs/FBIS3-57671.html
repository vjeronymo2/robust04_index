What can you say regarding his statement?    [Patsatsia] Unfortunately, it has become a tradition here  for young people to try to acquire high positions by using the  most unacceptable methods. Kardava's statement testifies to  this. I am sure that, if I were to offer Kardava the post of,  say, procurator in Zugdidi, he would not dare say those things.  I consider the statement to be wholly without foundation and  not supported by any kind of proof. Perhaps I am being  reproached for the fact that, in my time, I conducted a  conciliatory policy in Zugdidi. However, even today, I adhere  to the same view: There are not so many of us that we should  kill one another and that brother should wage war against  brother. This does not signify in any way my alliance with the  Zviadists. Incidentally, I agree that Zviadism is a problem  that has been artificially implanted in western Georgia.  Throughout my life, I have proceeded from the belief that I  should serve my people and not certain individuals. I would  like to ask my opponents this question: What have they  themselves done for Georgia? Apart from fighting fiercely and  without scruples for the top position, forgetting that there is  only one such position. Are there not more important problems  facing Georgia such as economic and social problems?    [Ambrosova]In this respect, as far as we know, has  Russia not granted Georgia 10 billion rubles credit? How will  this money be spent?    [Patsatsia] Some of this money has already been used to pay  our debts. We have also bought gas and fuel oil. We assume  that the credit will be spent on paying for fuel and energy  resources that are essential so as finally to activate industry  and, at the same time, revive the economy. The means for this  will be drawn in general from official long-term credits and not  only those from Russia. This will enable us to implement work  at the Tbilisi State Rayon Power Station that will be able to  produce an additional 300 megawatts of electric power and, after  putting into operation a new power bloc, to regulate the  functioning of the network of Ingurskiy power stations.    [Ambrosova]The oil-prospecting work that is already in  progress in Georgia should certainly be a boost to the  economy.    [Patsatsia] Yes, you are right. In this respect, contacts  have been established with Britain and Australia. In July, we  are planning to install processing units at the sites. Of  course, the initial extractions will be insufficient for  Georgia's needs but there are great prospects for the future.  In addition, exploration work is going on into new deposits in  which Georgia is undoubtedly rich.    [Ambrosova]Batono Otari, you are often called an  opponent of the market economy. With what is this  connected?    [Patsatsia] This is connected with the fact that people here  have a false understanding of many things, including the market  economy. I am an advocate of the so-called Korean model of a  state-controlled market economy. According to this model, a  number of branches, those that are strategically important,  should be controlled by the state. After all, if the state  loses its monopoly on, for example, the food industry, how are  we to exist? General privatization or rather misappropriation  [prikhvatizatsiya] is taking place here, which will not bring  the state anything; it is only being robbed. Ten percent of the  population, in whose hands state property has been concentrated  as a result of this misappropriation, has brought the entire  nation to a state of impoverishment. The mafia rules here, if  only as far as those coupon credits are concerned. As a result  of the policy conducted by the previous government, huge sums of  coupons, most of which were issued to private firms and  individuals, have not brought the state a single kopeck and,  what is more, most of these sums have not been returned.    [Ambrosova]Do you think that we will be faced with the  threat of total collapse if Georgia does not join the ruble  zone?    [Patsatsia] In principle, entry into the ruble zone is  necessary. However, this remains just one question connected  with the multitude of problems both here and in Russia.  Economic relations between the countries of the former Soviet  Union have changed radically. If, up to now, we have been  living on subsidies, we can expect no one to feed us for free  both in the CIS and the ruble zone. Yes, we will receive help  with material and technical supplies. However, we will have to  conduct financial policy ourselves. In order to do this, the  economy has to be put back on its feet.    [Ambrosova]For how long will our government function  without being approved?    [Patsatsia] I hope that the government will be approved  within a month. I do not rule out changes in its composition.  One can expect anything nowadays.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Gauge of 'green' damage launched Seven environmental groups yesterday joined forces to produce the first comprehensive index of damage to the country's environment. The new 'green gauge' index covers 10 sensitive areas, such as river pollution, rural land loss and biodiversity. According to the sponsors, which include the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Friends of the Earth, standards have fallen steadily in six of the 10 sectors examined. By contrast, the situation has improved in just one sector, while matters have remained stable in the remaining three. The environmentalists want to develop the green gauge into an annual study of environmental standards. The next issue, due in January 1996, should come shortly before the establishment of the UK's planned Environment Agency. Legislation for the agency has been tabled in the House of Lords and is expected to take effect next year, leading to the creation of the new body in 1996. The green gauge is a cross-section of 46 environmental standards tracked in a wider study, produced for the sponsors by the New Economics Foundation, a recently formed environmental, social and economic policy think-tank. The 10 areas were selected on the basis of degree of public understanding, ease of assessment, reliability of data and public interest. In presenting their findings the sponsors called for more reliable and consistent data on environmental factors, such as animal stocks, to allow accurate measurement of future changes.

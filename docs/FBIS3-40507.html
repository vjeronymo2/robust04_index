For instance, one type of tunnel is required for  fundamental tests of the cascades; a second is required for high  altitude engine performance tests. Experimental models for these  tests consist of real engine components or of close replicas.  Certain effects may not be adequately addressed in wind tunnel  tests, for example, the effects of high speed revolution, flow  properties in unmeasureable regions, realistic boundary  conditions.    The twofold object of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for  internal flows is to predict the performance of models before  expensive wind tunnel tests are done and to provide information  of the internal flow that is inaccessible to experiment  measurement. CFD is already useful for improving designs or  making new ones. As computers and CFD technology advance, CFD  can expand from the role of prediction and design to that of a  numerical wind tunnel. This paper shows how features of  numerical wind tunnels parallel those of experimental wind  tunnels. The paper also assesses future trends for the use of  numerical wind tunnels.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Wind tunnel testing in aircraft engines involves widely  diverse configurational elements, wind tunnel scale, and  computation volumes, from the basic turbine and compressor blade  cascade tests to the high-altitude performance tests of the  complete engine in the wind tunnel. Usually wind tunnel tests  and CFD are used together in blade cascade tests and duct tests,  but the scope has broadened in recent years with the phenomenal  advances made in computers and analytical techniques. We here  look at the different wind tunnel tests used on aircraft engines  and discuss how CFD fits into the picture.  <H5>  2. Wind Tunnel Testing of Aircraft Engines </H5> <H5>  2.1 Types of Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>   As diagrammed in Figure 2-1, the wind tunnel tests used on  aircraft engines include high-altitude performance tests (Figure  2-2) to determine overall engine performance, ground performance  tests (Figure 2-3 [photo not reproduced]), element tests on  fans, compressors, combustors, and turbines (Figure 2-4), and  configurational element tests such as blade cascade tests and  strut tests.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-46A>           Figure 2-1. Wind Tunnel Tests </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-47A>           Figure 2-2. High-Altitude Performance Test Facilities </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-48A>           Figure 2-4. Fan Element Test Apparatus </FIG>    Then these configurational element problems are further  divided for investigation into wingtip clearance tests, cooling  hole effect tests, and the like, and we also do basic testing on  aft surface step flows and shear flows, etc., in analyzing basic  internal flows.    The ultimate purpose of wind tunnel testing is to improve  the  performance of the whole engine. For this reason it is not  enough for these tests merely to be reliable. There must also be  a structural rationale to the entire series of tests, and they  must also match the development resources and time allowed.  <H5>  2.2 Correspondence With CFD </H5>   Compared to the wind tunnel test facility, which ranges  widely in size, the test sample [i.e. model] is almost always  made of the same material and in the same shape to withstand  high speeds, high temperatures, and high pressures. Because this  is so, it is more important that there be an equivalency between  the actual craft's operating conditions and the wind tunnel  tests than that of the actual craft and the test sample be  similar in the flight tests and wind tunnel tests. The issue of  equivalency in wind tunnel tests includes such things as  similarity in the supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnel tests,  and in the environmental impact tests for noise and  NO[.sup]x[/] generation and propagation. However, if we limit  the problems to the flows inside the engine, then the issue of  the degree to which the wind tunnel inlet/outlet and side walls  coincide with the actual operating conditions becomes very  important. Even when we break the whole engine down into element  tests, blade cascade tests, and basic tests, setting the test  conditions is still a very important issue. When we consider the  correspondence with CFD, we try to achieve correspondence  primarily in element tests and blade cascade tests, depending on  the scale of the computer and test equipment, and the time  allowed for the wind tunnel tests, and we are working very hard  to improve the precision with which we set the boundary  conditions.  <H5>  3. Roles of Wind Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5> <H5>  3.1 Role of CFD </H5>   We have simplified the engine design and fabrication  processes in Figure 3-1, and attempted the following broad  classification of the role CFD plays in research and  development, design, and verification.    1) Prediction of R&amp;D results; prediction of problems,  possibilities prior to design, testing    2) New design, modification design; designing by adding CFD  technology -- which analyzes important design points with  suitable means in the limited time allotted -- to conventional  means    3) Numerical/mathematical wind tunnel testing; narrowing the  focus of wind tunnel tests and substituting for wind tunnel tests    The object of analysis will vary with the size of the  computer, the reliability of the analysis, the time allotted,  and the costs allowable; and we think it will take on the same  type structure as the wind tunnel tests described above.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-48B>           Figure 3-1. Role of CFD </FIG>  <H5>  3.2 Predicting R&amp;D Results </H5>   In Figure 3-2 we have diagrammed the prediction of R&amp;D  problems and possibilities by wind tunnel testing and CFD. With  correspondence to wind tunnel tests, CFD is being used to verify  the presence or absence of separation in flows generated by  simple blade cascades, and in elucidating pronounced flows which  interfere complexly in internal flows, with the number of  subject elements increased, so as to match the subject elements  of wind tunnel testing in terms of everything from predicting  two-dimensional flow effects to inter-blade interference and  dynamic and static blade interference analysis.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49A>           Figure 3-2. Prediction of Problems, Possibilities </FIG>    In Figures 3-3 and 3-4 [not reproduced] we exhibit the  analysis grid and analysis results for flows around fan outlet  guide blades and struts. The guide blades do not have a uniform  shape, and the strut shapes are each different too, so analysis  is done all around the circumference, and relatively good  agreement with the experimental values is obtained in the  pressure distribution at issue, even though this is non-viscous.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49B>           Figure 3-3. Grid for Fan Outlet Guide Blade and Strut Flow Analysis </FIG>    In Figure 3-5 we add flow velocity vectors by analyzing the  flows inside the combustor liner. This is a useful tool for  studying the flow of cold air inside the combustor.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49C>           Figure 3-5. Flow Velocity Vectors Inside Combustor Liner </FIG>    We believe that increasingly more importance will be  attached  to predicting the performance of these shapes, that are  extremely close to the experimental configurations, prior to  actual testing.  <H5>  3.3 New Designs, Modification Designs </H5>   In new design and modification design work, one basically  uses analysis techniques which are thoroughly verified by  comparison with wind tunnel tests.    In Figures 3-6 and 3-7 we diagram the results of CFD and L2F  measurements on moving fan blades, and in Figure 3-8 we compare  the tests on static fan blades. We now see relatively good  agreement in terms of performance at design points, even in  cases of reverse pressure gradients as in fans and compressor  blade cascades. In Figure 3-9 we show a comparison in the case  where the injection angle is varied, inclusive of non-design  points. We believe that this has become useful in estimating  qualitative trends, particularly injection angle limitations. In  Figure 3-10 we give an example where these were used in a  modification design, and in Figure 3-11 a comparison with wind  tunnel test results. By these means we can verify the propriety  of both our predictions and our modification designs.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-50A>           Figure 3-6.

Comparison of Oil Flow Patterns in Modification Design </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-52B>           Figure 3-11. Modified Design Wing Aerodynamic Performance Characteristics Comparison </FIG>     What is urgently needed now is the development of techniques  for analyzing blade cascades which involve secondary flows in  reverse pressure gradients.  <H5>  3.4 Numerical Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>   We now need numerical wind tunnel tests which will be nearly  as reliable as, and serve in part as substitutes for,  conventional wind tunnel tests. To create such numerical wind  tunnel tests, we must perform more of the verification checks  discussed earlier, do detailed studies on turbulence models and  schemes, and improve our measurement techniques. This will  require us to cooperate widely with other research institutions,  as we do with basic wind tunnel tests.  <H5>  4. Measurement and CFD </H5>   One of the advantages of analyzing an internal flow such as  found in an engine is that this permits us to estimate flows  that cannot be conventionally measured. Accordingly, this  foundational measurement of internal flows contributes greatly  in improving the precision of our estimations of internal flows.  In the past the focus has been on measuring the pressures on  wing surfaces and in blade cascade inlets and outlets, but the  scope of applications is broadening to such things as the  photographic effects of the behavior of shock waves at the  leading edges of rotating fans by means of holographic  measurements, depicted in Figure 4-1, and the measurement of  cooling efficiency distributions in cooling paths inside  high-pressure turbine wings using liquid crystals. We hope that  such advances in measurement technology as these will pave the  way for improved CFD reliability and wider CFD applications.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-53A>           Figure 4-1. Inter-Wing Shock Wave Shape Based on Holographic Measurement </FIG>   <H5>  5. Concluding Remarks </H5>   The scale of wind tunnel tests in aircraft engines varies  widely from high-altitude performance testing on the high end to  basic blade cascade tests on the low end, where the test samples  (models) used are either full or nearly full-size models. Thus  other things are of greater importance than wind tunnel testing  and CFD being mutually complementary in high Reynolds number  regions, namely how CFD can be used to estimate wind tunnel  tests with good precision, providing information which cannot be  measured in a wind tunnel, and reflecting this in the design.  And, as CFD technology, computers, and measurement technology  become more advanced, the concept of using numerical wind  tunnels in place of conventional wind tunnels is gaining  acceptance. We believe that it will not be long before further  technological breakthroughs give numerical wind tunnel testing a  more important role to play. We would like to take up the  matters of environmental impact survey testing and  supersonic/hypersonic testing in a subsequent article.    We are deeply appreciative of all the help we received in  drafting this article from the National Aerospace Laboratory and  from universities and other public research institutions.</p>

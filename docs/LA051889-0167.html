			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERSONICS SIGN MCDANIEL FOR FIVE YEARS  </P> <P> The Seattle SuperSonics, who lost unrestricted free agent Tom Chambers to the  Phoenix Suns last year, announced Wednesday they have re-signed restricted free  agent Xavier McDaniel to a five-year contract.  </P> <P> Two years ago, center Alton Lister of the SuperSonics was a restricted free  agent and got a multimillion dollar offer from the Suns. Seattle matched the  Suns' offer sheet.  </P> <P> SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt said McDaniel's signing was essential to the  team's future because "he's one of the players we've said we want to build this  team around.  </P> <P> "We made a commitment to him and to his teammates. We're just going to keep  going toward our goal and that's to win a championship."  </P> <P> McDaniel, a 6-foot-7 forward from Columbia, S.C., and Wichita State, had said  he knew he would sign again with Seattle. He said he did not think about going  out and getting an offer sheet.  </P> <P> "A lot of things go through your mind during the course of a year," he said.  "But we pretty much had everything agreed on and it was just a matter of time  until we got everything done. By All-Star break, I knew I would be a Seattle  SuperSonic. I should (be) set for life."  </P> <P> McDanielaveraged 18.7 points in the playoffs this year and 20.5 points during  the regular season.  </P></p>

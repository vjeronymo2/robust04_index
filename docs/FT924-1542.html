			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Bulmer expands 18% to Pounds 10.7m - Marketing expenditure on main cider brands pays off HP BULMER Holdings, the cider and soft drinks maker, reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to October 23 on the back of a strong performance from its main cider brands. Profits rose from Pounds 9.07m to Pounds 10.7m on sales of Pounds 131m (Pounds 116m). The increase reflected Bulmer's strategy of marketing its main cider brands, Strongbow and Woodpecker, and sharply higher operating profits of Pounds 740,000 (Pounds 478,000) from the Australian cider business, which has a near monopoly on the country's cider market. In the UK, where operating profits rose from Pounds 9.65m to Pounds 11.6m, the cider market grew by 7 per cent in spite of a decline in the drinks market as a whole. Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said he was confident that the cider market would continue to expand. He welcomed the decision from main rival, Taunton Cider, to go public, which he predicted would further expand the market. Cidrerie Stassen, the recently acquired Belgian branded company, would export its own cider to the UK while facilitating the import of Strongbow to the Continent. In spite of its Pounds 47,000 loss, mainly due to start-up costs, Mr Rudgard was confident that the Belgian company would contribute profits by the year end. Lower demand in Russia for Pectin, a gelling agent, led to a decline in Pectin operating profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 584,000. Capital expenditure for the year to April 24 is expected to increase by Pounds 1m to Pounds 13.3m. Net debt is expected to have risen from Pounds 17m to Pounds 25m, representing gearing of between 35 and 40 per cent. Earnings per share in the half-year rose from 10.8p to 12.99p. The interim dividend is increased from 3.45p to 3.75p. COMMENT The big increase in marketing its brands, such as Woodpecker and Strongbow, which depressed profits in 1989, is now paying off. The marketing spend is running at about Pounds 12m a year - more than double what it was four years ago. A 20 per cent increase in the sales of Orangina justifies its decision to broaden activities into soft drinks. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 19m, giving earnings per share of 22.8, the shares - up 9p to 400p - are on a prospective multiple of 17.5. Whether that premium to the market is justified depends on one's view of the cider market. If its growth continues unabated then Bulmers's shares are still good value. If the market slows down, as it did in the mid eighties, the shares may look expensive.</p>

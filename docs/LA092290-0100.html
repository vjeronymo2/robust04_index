Henley, 54, a tenured professor, was offered his adviser job back last  week and received a letter of apology from Cal Poly's administration. His job  as head of the school's journalism department was unaffected by the adviser  flap.  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona officials said Henley opted not to return to the student  newspaper until the 1991-92 school year because another adviser already had  been hired for this year.  </P></p>

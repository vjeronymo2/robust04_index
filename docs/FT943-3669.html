			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crisis helps advance ideological positions on population growth Sir, Edward Mortimer's article ('False alarm in Cairo', September 7) on the Cairo conference on population misses the point in arguing that the delegates miss the point by focusing on ideology rather than on population growth which, in any case, can be expected to become 'nearly stationary' on current trends. As it happens, the complacent and comforting population projections that Mortimer accepts are as fragile as the alarmist ones, if past projections are any guide, which is why it has become customary to work with alternative scenarios. Nor is Mortimer well advised to rely on economists who dissociate hunger and destitution from population explosion. These scourges occur despite the per capita availability of enough food to avoid them since need and demand are two different things, but it is a non sequitur to conclude that therefore they cannot occur due to pressure of population: in a raft at sea with the last bottle of fresh water, Robinson Crusoe would do well without Man Friday, you bet. Even if you do not believe the alarmist estimates, however, it may be prudent to rely on the precautionary principle. But many go with the estimates for a different reason. They seek to create and then use a sense of crisis to advance ideological positions, exaggerating in turn the impact of their preferred policies to advance them as cures to the crisis. Just as John Stuart Mill shrewdly observed that 'a good cause seldom triumphs unless someone's interest is tied up in it', the women's groups that properly seek empowerment and abortion rights see political value in a sense of crisis (no matter how weak its intellectual underpinnings) that creates ferment, fuels urgency and fertilises the ground for their causes to take root. In fact, even the suggestion that female education - and Mortimer may well have added female participation in the workforce - rather than ideology aids population control draws a false contrast. Female education has generally advanced because of ideology, not because of a cost-benefit calculation by us economists of its value for population control or growth rates. That we can simultaneously argue, thanks to the research of economists such as Robert Repetto, that it advances these other causes, while being a good in itself, is splendid: it enables us to do well while doing good. But we must not forget that a good society will address precisely these ideological questions at every opportunity, seeking progress in the well-being of women that, astonishingly, still eludes them in every part of the world.

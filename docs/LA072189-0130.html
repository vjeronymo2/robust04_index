			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEADERSHIP TRAINING FOR LATINO YOUTHS SET  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre and film producer Moctesuma  Esparza have announced that a community educational group will hold leadership  training sessions this year for Latino high school students as one way to lower  the school dropout rate.  </P> <P> Both Alatorre and Esparza attended similar conferences in the late 1960s and  early '70s. The goal of the conferences, Esparza said, will be to motivate and  train students who have demonstrated leadership ability and students who might  be on the verge of dropping out of school.  </P> <P> Alatorre and Moctesuma are members of the governing board of the National  Hispanic Arts, Educational and Media Institute, which will sponsor a Latino  music special Aug. 3 to raise funds for the leadership conferences.  </P> <P> At a Los Angeles press conference on Wednesday, the two also unveiled an  "educational bill of rights" and called for more effective teaching methods,  better teacher-student ratios, bilingual and bicultural programs, greater  financial support and other programs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 2 (MTI) -- "The fact that Hungary  was the first among the Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) to submit its membership request  to the European Union does imply a particular advantage. We  still have much to do prior to membership. This opportunity is  mainly accompanied by obligations," Hungarian Foreign Minister  Geza Jeszenszky said on Saturday [2 April], in Pacin, along the  Hungarian-Slovak border.    The foreign minister held a press conference at the new  building of the border station on the Hungarian side.    Jeszenszky visited the border town to view the planned  border  station, meeting an invitation from Richard Horcsik, the  region's parliamentary MPs and chairman of parliament's European  Affairs Committee, and the mayors of 21 villages along the  Bodrog River.    The foreign minister exchanged views with the locals about  the opening of border stations in Satoraljaujhely, Pacin and  Lacacseke, and the off-shore area planned to be created in the  Lacacseke-Perbenyik region.    In Pacin, Mayor Attila Barati guided Jeszenszky through the  completed and furnished border station and customs building.  The facility will also ensure smooth work for Slovak border  guard and customs authorities.    The mayor said people on both sides of the Bodrog are  awaiting the opening of the Pacin-Velky Kamenec border station.  Jeszenszky said it was regrettable that a struggle is needed to  open a border station on the Slovak border, where families and  relatives live in different countries. The demand of people  living on both sides of the border for the immediate opening of  the station is understandable, he said. The new Central Europe  should be without borders, with local authorities cooperating in  issues as this.    "We have opened many border stations towards the  neighbouring  countries, and in the case of Slovakia it is unfortunate that we  were unable to meet the expectations. I very much hope that the  fine words of the new, genuinely good intentioned Slovak  Government will be followed by actions. We have replied to  words with action, as we have built the border station,"  Jeszenszky said.</p>

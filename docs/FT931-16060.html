			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Sellafield 'a poor site' for N-waste THE SITE selected by UK Nirex for its proposed pounds 2.5bn underground nuclear-waste repository at Sellafield, Cumbria, is a 'poor site' with inherent hydrogeological problems, according to a report by independent consultants. The report, published yesterday is the latest and most critical in a series commissioned by Cumbria County Council from Environmental Resources. It suggests that groundwater from the repository could reach the surface in around 300 years. Cautioning however against attaching too much significance to this calculation, the report says that only further investigation will show if the site is safe. The report criticises the timetable proposed by Nirex, the nuclear waste consortium, as unrealistically short, and says the application for the repository, to be built half a mile underground and to operate for 50 years, will be made before a complete assessment of information can be provided. Nirex yesterday criticised calculations in the report as 'off-beam'. It said the Sellafield site continued to 'show promise as a repository location' and the claim it was a poor site was not supportable. British Nuclear Fuels admitted yesterday that it had made errors in figures in its application to operate a new reprocessing plant in Sellafield. The errors were announced only four days before the end of an eight-week consultation period for objections to new radiation discharge levels for the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) to be received. That period will be extended by two weeks following the release of the amended figures on the discharge of radioactive gas.</p>

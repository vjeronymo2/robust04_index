			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Thorn likes pumpkin in its pie - The Bottom Line If you cannot hum a tune by the Smashing Pumpkins, you are not alone. Even Bottom Line's tuned-in secretary turns vague when the group is mentioned. The Smashing Pumpkins hail from Illinois. This week Thorn EMI announced that the group's success had helped its music division increase half-year operating profits by 48.3 per cent to Pounds 89.9m. A trawl of the rock reviews reveals that the Smashing Pumpkins' lyrics are 'full of regret and unfulfilled desires'. The description could be applied to Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman. Sir Colin's unfulfilled desire is for his work in recasting Thorn to be recognised. He has concentrated on turning its two largest businesses, music and rentals, into world leaders. Yet, when he bought Virgin Music last year for Pounds 510m, making Thorn one of the world's three biggest recording groups, the critics complained that he had overpaid. What they ignored was that there were others waiting to buy Virgin. It was an essential purchase if Thorn was not to be relegated to the second rank. As it happens, this week's results were a vindication of the acquisition. Virgin's profits of Pounds 36.5m accounted for 41 per cent of Thorn's total music profits. The rental business, which rents out anything from video recorders to jewellery, also saw profits rise 17.7 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Overall pre-tax of profits Pounds 105m were unchanged on last year, but were depressed by a Pounds 10m exceptional charge arising from the sale of Thorn lighting and Thames Television. Operating profit from continuing operations rose to Pounds 121.3m from Pounds 97.6m. Net borrowings of Pounds 399.2m were Pounds 98.8m lower than at the half-way stage last year. Debt fell to 56.4 per cent of shareholders' funds from 103.6 per cent a year ago. Yet Thorn's shares have had a rocky ride. They have gone from a high of 1,009p at the end of August, to 895p last Wednesday, the day after the results were announced, before recovering to 923p yesterday. Thorn has two problems. The first is that its rental division has been under a cloud since a report on its US operations in the Wall Street Journal last September. The newspaper alleged that the debt collection procedures of Thorn's US staff ran to guns and gangs of Hell's Angels. Sir Colin's reaction to the article should be on every business school curriculum as a lesson in how not to handle bad publicity. If the charges were false, he should have denied them. So far, he has not done so convincingly. If they were true, he should have said the group would deal with the perpetrators. Instead, he said how hurt he was. Any sympathy understandably went to Thorn's allegedly persecuted customers. Seven weeks after the article appeared, Thorn announced that former Senator Warren Rudman would investigate the allegations. The second problem is that Thorn cannot sell its defence subsidiary. The General Electric Company had a look at the business earlier this year, but was not prepared to pay enough. It is difficult to see the value of the business rising, however. It lost Pounds 14.7m in the first half, compared with Pounds 1.4m last time. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has a habit of biding his time. He often wins his prize, usually paying a price considerably lower than the number first thought of. If Thorn does get rid of its defence business, thoughts will turn to a demerger, or the prospect of a buyer for the music division. Much attention is being focused on multi-media, or the idea that we will watch a group play on our screens, while our speakers pump out compact disc quality sound and our printers spew out copies of the lyrics. A computer or cable television or telecommunications company could buy Thorn for its collection of music copyrights. This sort of thing has been talked about for years, without amounting to much. It might be different this time, but the multi-media business is as full of unfulfilled desires as a whole stage of Smashing Pumpkins.</p>

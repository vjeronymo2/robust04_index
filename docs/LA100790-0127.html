			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE  </P> <P> It is 1990, isn't it? I wasn't sure after I read the article on Shane Black and  all the other nice, young, white, male successful screenwriters. For some crazy  reason, I figured that in 1990 we must have a few females and minority groups  represented in one end of the business or another.  </P> <P> But Greenberg's article did not mention one female or ethnic group in any facet  of the industry -- no writers, no agents, no producers, nobody. Was there no  one who suggested to your writer that in the year 1990 he might be able to find  a few newly successful female or minority writers? And if he couldn't, wouldn't  that be a fact worthy of mention?  </P> <P> It was an interesting contrast to Robin Wright's excellent article on South  Africa, to say the least.  </P> <P> NANCY RECHTMAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

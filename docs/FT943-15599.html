			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / People: Leeds BS fills one of its gaps Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has proved that it can still make senior appointments, even though its chief executive's seat remains empty. John King has been named as chairman-elect of the society, to succeed Malcolm Barr who will retire in January. 'The fact that we have decided on the chairman does help in the appointment of a chief executive officer,' King says. The arrival of a chief executive will clearly affect the extent to which King (above right) has to be involved in the society. He sees the job as taking up two to three days a week of his time, fitting in with his other roles as chairman of Analysys, a telecommunications consultancy, and a director of Olivetti UK. King, 61, has been a director of Leeds since April 1991, and was a main board director of BT until 1988. The challenge for societies over the next year or so, he says, will be to develop within a greatly changing environment after a period when the market in traditional society activities has been quite dull. Meanwhile, Bradford &amp; Bingley, the UK's seventh largest society, is aiming to meet those changes by appointing John Wriglesworth (near left), 37, societies analyst with UBS for the past seven years, to a new post as general manager in charge of strategy and communications. The first change for Wriglesworth, who will join the society in October, will be to open a B&amp;B account. His lack of one at present is, he says, no reflection on the society but simply a matter of the location of its London branches. This problem will presumably be eased when he spends a proportion of his time in Yorkshire.</p>

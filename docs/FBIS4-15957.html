			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Terese Staniulyte: "The Americans Will Design </F> the Oil Terminal. The Search for Builders Continues"]    [Excerpts] TIESA has already reported that the government  announced the U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" the  winner in the competition for designing the oil terminal in  Butinge. We are acquainting the readers with the results of  this competition in greater detail. [passage omitted]    The winner was expected to emerge in the first round of the  competition in early February. However, the government decided  then to continue negotiations with the first three winners: The  U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" which scored 91.5  points, the Italian company "Snamprogetti" (82 points), and  "Techint" from Argentina (80.7 points). The same proposal also  came from the consultants of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development and the London-based Rothschild  Bank.    The Butinge oil terminal will be designed to import and  export oil and its products -- the total of 12 million tonnes a  year. Its construction was estimated at approximately $170-200  million in February. If Lithuania had announced one winner, the  latter could have dictated its own terms, which was  unacceptable. Lithuania expected to reduce the costs of  construction by extending negotiations.    A. Vazgilevicius, representative of the oil terminal  construction management in Vilnius, has explained to TIESA how  negotiations were arranged, and whether it was expedient to hold  them if the winner was the same company as in the first round.    According to him, the three companies received packages of  questions, while their responses were assessed by the same  commission of government experts. The firms had to repeatedly  specify some financial and technical terms of the terminal  construction. Moreover, they had to indicate how they intended  to use local building materials, labor force, to study the  possibility of assembling the floating system at the Klaipeda  shipyard, and to provide conclusions whether an additional port  for service boats was necessary in Butinge.    As has already been said, all comparisons were made with the  aim of reducing construction costs, which is important both for  our state and the company that will design and build the oil  terminal. After assessing the layout of the port, the subsidiary  facilities, storages, and other criteria, "Flour Daniel" again  emerged as the winner. In the opinion of the commission of  experts, this company presented the best project and devoted the  most attention among all firms to the employment of our building  companies.    Attempts to "knock down" the price were also successful.  Although A. Vazgilevicius could not tell the exact price, which  is understandable, according to him, however, the costs  "approximate $135-140 million" with a few-million-dollar error.  The sum will be specified with design work under way.    On 11 April, "Flour Daniel" representatives are coming to  Lithuania to prepare and sign a contract. A. Vazgilevicius  stated that this work might take about a week. The text of the  contract is as yet nonexistent, and it will take shape during  negotiations by coordinating every issue. Although the  Lithuanians have no experience in drafting such large projects,  however, they are not afraid of this. According to A.  Vazgilevicius, "we have official consultants of the British  Government and support from other companies consulting on energy  issues and working on the preparation of such typical  contracts." Thus, the Lithuanians are not expected to lack  competence.    Lithuania is also planning to invite a foreign engineering  company that will examine proposals of design work. Asked by  TIESA to explain the meaning of this assessment, A.  Vazgilevicius replied that experts hired for small payment, who  work in the sphere of supplies and building materials, will  establish whether the prices offered by "Flour Daniel" are not  overly high. Although these prices were linked with European  costs, it might be possible to reduce them even more by way of  negotiations. [passage omitted]    At a press conference last Thursday [31 March], Prime  Minister A. Slezevicius said that the possibility of oil imports  is the most important for Lithuania. Therefore, the first stage  in erecting the oil terminal will be the construction of the  floating platform in the sea and the laying of oil pipelines  and, maybe, of one for oil products to Mazeikiai. This work  will cost around $70 million. The second stage will be the  construction of storage facilities for oil and gas products on  the sea coast and in Butinge, and the creation of facilities for  the export of oil products.    The prime minister confirmed that construction will have to  begin in the middle of this year and will last for a year and a  half.    `Flour Daniel' intends to prepare the design documentation  in  four months. Thus, it should be ready by August. Asked by  Tiesa whether any construction work will be performed over those  four months, A. Vazgilevicius explained that he could not answer  this question. "It will depend on our agreement with `Flour  Daniel'," he said. "It might happen that excavators will arrive  in May and that an agreement will be reached to do something.  Everything will become clear after representatives of the U.S.  "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers," which will design and build  the oil terminal in Butinge and perform its technical  supervision, arrive to Lithuania, sit down to negotiating table,  and `untangle all the details'."    While the preparation of design documents is under way, the  government will have to make its choice about the foreign firm  to which it would entrust the construction of the terminal.  According to Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, "Flour Daniel"  could also be the subcontractor. [passage omitted]</p>

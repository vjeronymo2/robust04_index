			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEA PROBE TO CLEAR ARTISTS INVOLVED IN ANTI-SHOOTING ADS  </P> <P> Four San Diego artists who used federal funds to pay for bus-bench ads that  protested deadly force shootings by police soon will be exonerated as a result  of an investigation by the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA sources said.  </P> <P> The NEA agreed to investigate the artists in early November, after a request  from Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), who said that it was "highly unusual and  improper for artists to take NEA money and buy commercial advertising,  regardless of its content."  </P> <P> At the time, Jack Lichtenstein, the national spokesman for the embattled  federal arts agency, called the bus-bench ads "a most inappropriate use of NEA  funds." But documents later obtained by The Times showed that the artists were  operating within NEA guidelines and that, in fact, money for advertising space  was specifically spelled out in their grant.  </P> <P> And, on Thursday, a high-ranking official with the NEA, who asked not to be  identified, said the agency's inspector general had concluded his report and  found "no wrongdoing" on the part of the artists. He said the findings of the  investigation might not be officially released until March.  </P> <P> "The inspector general has turned over his findings to the general counsel,"  the source said. "The general counsel has determined that he'll wait for the  final report from the art gallery that sponsored the artists," the Installation  Gallery. "But essentially, they will be exonerated. After all, they did nothing  wrong."  </P> <P> Karl Higgins, a spokesman for Lowery, said Thursday from the congressman's San  Diego office that he believed "the only reason" the artists would be exonerated  was because they were operating under "old guidelines."  </P> <P> Lowery is one of several conservative congressmen -- the most outspoken critic  being North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms -- who called for a reappraisal of the  NEA that led to new procedures for the agency.  </P> <P> "My understanding is that the new guidelines will prohibit artists from using  taxpayer dollars for that kind of advertising," Higgins said. "If they want to  create art and display it as part of their freedom of expression, fine. . . .  But to use taxpayer dollars for commercial advertising to circulate such art  was and is, in our view, inappropriate.  </P> <P> "The new guidelines simply won't allow that, so, if they are exonerated -- and  I'd prefer to comment more fully after the announcement is official -- they  will be exonerated purely on a technicality . . . permissible only under old  guidelines."  </P> <P> Deborah Small, one of the artists involved, said Thursday that neither she nor  her colleagues will be surprised when the NEA clears them in a controversy that  she said "didn't make much sense from the start."  </P> <P> "We knew all along that it would be no problem for us," Small said, noting that  the NEA grant, which functions as a contract, allotted the artists $4,000 for  "media advertising." The ads cost $3,662.50.  </P> <P> Given that the controversy arose just days before the November election, Small  said she suspects that Lowery used it to enhance his bid for reelection against  Democrat Dan Kripke, whom he defeated by 12,000 votes.  </P> <P> "What Lowery was doing was helping himself get elected," Small said. "He used  the issue as a smoke screen to mask what the work tried to address, which was  police misconduct, the need for change, the need for a police review board with  real power. . . . To complain about tax-dollar funding for political art was, I  think, a red herring."  </P> <P> Small said the ads, appearing on 25 bus benches throughout the city, showed up  in late October and were removed Dec. 1. Many of the ads have been replaced by  pro-police messages.  </P> <P> "Season's Greetings to San Diego's Finest from the San Diego Crime Commission,"  reads one of the new ads, on a bus bench on Broadway, near the San Diego police  station.  </P> <P> The controversial art drawn by Small and fellow artists Elizabeth Sisco, Scott  Kessler and Louis Hock featured the outline of seven human bodies silhouetted  in black against a red background. Within each human figure was a target,  similar to those at police shooting ranges.  </P> <P> Within one target was a trowel, within another a baseball bat and within a  third a garden stake. A pair of upraised hands and a question mark were drawn  within others.  </P> <P> Among those killed in shootings by police in 1990 were men wielding a baseball  bat, a garden stake and a trowel. Another man was unarmed.  </P> <P> Small noted that, since the ads appeared, even since the controversy has died  down, two other people have died in so-called deadly-force shootings. Both  occurred in December; one man was unarmed, and the other, police said, pulled  out a gun before being shot.  </P> <P> The San Diego Police Department acknowledges that, since January, 27 people  have been shot, 12 fatally, in what it labels deadly-force shootings.  </P> <P> "The situation won't change until the police change their practices," Small  said. "Or, the City Council calls for greater accountability in the form of a  review board with teeth. I have to laugh at Lowery's call for an NEA  investigation. Think about the tax dollars that must have been spent on that,  and for what? So that another Republican could get reelected?"  </P></p>

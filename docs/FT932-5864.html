			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / San Marino in no mood to change RESULTS of last weekend's general election in San Marino have demonstrated that the world's smallest republic (population 23,000) is in no mood to change, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The fortunes of the ruling Sanmarinese Christian Democrats have not followed those of their discredited patrons in neighbouring Italy. They gained 41.4 per cent of the vote compared to 44 per cent in 1988. Their Socialist allies held on to 23.7 per cent. Between them these two parties have 40 of the 60 seats in the Great and General Council which dates back to medieval times, ensuring that they will form the next 'government'. The main losers were the reorganised Communists, rechristened the Progressive Democrats. They won only 18.9 per cent against 28.7 in the previous election.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Ciampi says he is ready to leave office Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, said yesterday he was ready to leave office, having completed his government's mandate. The 73-year-old former governor of the Bank of Italy also told a news conference he would not stand in forthcoming general elections. Mr Ciampi's comments are in line with promises made in May when he agreed to be Italy's first non-elected premier this century. Then, he said his two essential tasks were to obtain approval for an austerity budget for 1994 and to complete the process of electoral reform. Both were achieved just before Christmas. However, Mr Ciampi was careful yesterday to point out that the decision on the dissolution of parliament was out of his hands. 'This executive has no authority to decide whether or not the current legislature should be prolonged. . . This is in the hands of the head of state having consulted with the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies.' The timing of his departure has been complicated by intense backstage political manoeuvring in the past few days. Originally, it had been expected that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would announce the dissolution of parliament in his end-of-year address, fixing at the same time a date for early general elections in March. This timetable had now been undermined by Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader, who just before Christmas managed to persuade many of the current Christian Democrat-led majority in parliament to sign a motion of no confidence. This was sufficient for President Scalfaro to postpone any statement and arrange for a week-long parliamentary debate beginning on January 12. The aim of the no confidence motion was to prolong the life of parliament as long as possible, perhaps as late as June with a new government installed to replace Mr Ciampi. This would give more time for the disintegrating Christian Democrats and other groupings to form a viable alliance to oppose the electoral prospects of a coalition dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. President Scalfaro is reported against such a solution and the debate may not be a formal no confidence motion if a number of Christian Democrats can be persuaded to withdraw their support. Nevertheless, Mr Ciampi in his closing days has been placed in an awkward position in relation to the parties that have notionally been backing his administration.</p>

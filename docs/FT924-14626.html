			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Specialist keeps an eagle eye on the pula's rate: Tour operators WHILE much of British industry is preoccupied with sterling's gyrations against the D-Mark or US dollar, Mr Bob Winder, finance director of travel company Abercrombie and Kent, spends anxious hours monitoring the exchange rates of the Botswana pula and Seychelles rupee. A specialist in organising upmarket holidays in exotic locations, Abercrombie and Kent does about a third of its package-tour business in developing countries where outgoings have to be paid in what Mr Winder calls 'funny currencies'. These are thinly traded, so it is impossible to obtain forward cover against exchange rate fluctuations. Indeed, Barclays Bank is the only source of Botswana pulas in London. 'This creates quite a problem,' says Mr Winder. 'We can either seek to protect ourselves by buying a big pile of currencies like the Seychelles rupee and putting them in the bank, or sweat it out. We are tending to sweat it out.' Many developing countries, including India and Tanzania, have started to shift their tourism transactions to a hard currency, usually the US dollar, so they reap the benefit of any fall in their own currencies. In these cases, Abercrombie and Kent has routinely hedged its risks by buying forward. But Mr Winder says the company has stopped taking out such cover since sterling was floated and is waiting for trends in the foreign exchange markets to become clearer. Instead, it is delaying fixing final prices for its package tours - average cost Pounds 2,500 - for as long as possible.</p>

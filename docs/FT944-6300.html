			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Making the economy work better - At a glance guide FISCAL STANCE The Budget is designed 'to ensure that the improvements in the public finances announced in 1993 are delivered and to introduce further structural reforms to make the economy work better'. Spending squeezed Government spending plans in 1995-96 to be reduced by Pounds 7.2bn, with further reductions of Pounds 9bn in 1996-97, and Pounds 9.8bn in 1997-98. This reflects a fall in the projected levels of inflation and government savings. The control total has been reduced to Pounds 249.6bn in 1994-1995, Pounds 1.3bn below the level announced last November in current prices. The control total is forecast to rise to Pounds 255.7bn in 1995-1996, Pounds 6.9bn lower at current prices than last year's projections, and Pounds 0.5bn lower in 1993-1994 prices. As a share of national output total government spending is projected to fall from 44 per cent to 41 per cent over the three years. Page 20 Limited tax changes Tax changes in the Budget are relatively limited. Changes in income tax reliefs and VAT announced last year and scheduled to come into place in April next year will raise taxes by a further Pounds 2.75bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 0.75bn in the following year. This will be partly offset by measures to help businesses and the unemployed, and ease the impact of the imposition of value added tax on fuel. These will cost Pounds 1bn in 1995-96. As a result, the total level of taxes received by the government is projected to be Pounds 252.5bn in 1994-95, and rise to Pounds 278.9bn in the following year. Taxes and social security revenues as a proportion of GDP will rise from 33.75 per cent in 1993-1994 to 35.25 per cent in 1994-1995. Page 23 PSBR cut further Public borrowing, including privatisation proceeds, is forecast to fall from Pounds 34.4bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96. The public sector borrowing requirement is then projected to fall further, to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97, Pounds 5bn in 1997-98, and then return to balance at the end of the decade. Consequently, the PSBR as a proportion of gross domestic product is forecast to fall to 5 per cent in 1994-95, and then 3 per cent in 1995-96, and then 1.75 per cent in the following year.

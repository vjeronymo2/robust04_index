			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Choe Chong-hon: "Achieving the Goals of the </F> Party's Economic Strategy Is a Key Factor in Defending and  Adding Luster to Our-Style Socialism"]    [Text] At the moment, all of our workers are staging a  vigorous struggle to add more luster to our-style socialism  under the banner of singleheartedness and self-reliance, by  upholding the party's leadership. The key factor in achieving a  victory in this solemn struggle is to achieve the goals of the  party's economic strategy by all means.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: "We  should thoroughly achieve the strategic goals put forth by the  party by thoroughly carrying through the revolutionary economic  strategy under any circumstances."    Our party has put forth the struggle goals to suit the  demands of the developing revolution and the actual conditions  of the country with a view to wisely leading the struggle to  achieve such goals. This is the principle of leadership that our  party is consistently sticking to in socialist construction.    In the previous period, we were able to see our country's  socialist construction march forward victoriously and  unflinchingly even amid the formidable maelstrom of history.  Today even in such a complicated and harsh situation, our  people are vigorously struggling unshakably, overflowing with  faith and optimism. There is a bright future of victory  unfurling in the future path of our- style socialism. All of  this was possible because our party is wisely leading the  struggle to achieve the goals by putting forth correct goals.    Our party has established an adjustment period for the next  three years on the basis of a scientific analysis of the present  status of the changed international environment and our  country's socialist economic construction. Our party put forth  its basic goals of economic strategy to decisively solve the  problems in people's livelihood by concentrating strength on the  development of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade;  to normalize production in all sectors by giving priority to  preceding sectors in the people's economy; and to help fully  display the might of the existing economic foundation. Such  goals put forth by the party are the most aboveboard goals for  our-style economic strategy which completely meet the basic  interest of our revolution and correctly reflect the aspirations  and demands of our people. They serve as a milestone to further  consolidate the self-reliance of the national economy and  develop our country's socialist economic construction to a new  higher level.    Today, the victory in the struggle to defend and add luster  to our-style socialism depends on how the goals of the party's  economic strategy are achieved. At the moment, the imperialists  and reactionaries are strengthening their political and military  pressure as well as the maneuverings for economic blockade in an  unprecedented way in order to crush our republic which is  marching on under the socialist banner. The key factor to smash  such vicious maneuverings of the imperialists and reactionaries  and to fully display the invincibility and vitality of our-style  socialism lies in thoroughly achieving the party's economic  strategy goals. Only when we achieve the party's economic  strategy goals and gain great revolutionary upsurges in all  sectors and all units of socialist construction can we smash any  military provocations by the imperialists, their economic  blockade, and their maneuverings for ideological and cultural  disintegration, and can we more firmly consolidate our-style  socialism as an ever-victorious fortress.    To achieve the goals of party's economic strategy is an  important guarantee to increase the might of the country in  every way.    The might of socialism is a political, ideological, and  economic one; and confrontation with the imperialists is  confrontation in economic power as well as confrontation in  political and ideological strength. To win victory in  confrontation with the imperialists, it is necessary to increase  the country's strength in every way. To this end, it is  necessary to firmly strengthen the country's economic and  material foundation in conformity with the socialist demands as  well as to firmly arm all people with the chuche idea of  socialism. No matter how wonderful the socialist system is, and  no matter how high the level of people's ideological sense is,  we cannot firmly back up the political, ideological, and  military might economically and materially, nor can we highly  display the genuine superiority of socialism if we do not exert  appropriate strength in harmoniously developing the present  self-supporting economy through fortitude and if we do not  strengthen the country's economic might.    The goals of the party's revolutionary economic strategy  are a blueprint for firmly deepening the economic and material  foundation of our country. To strengthen economic might it is  imperative to regularize production in all sectors with emphasis  on leading sectors of the national economy, and to fully enhance  the might of the existing economic foundation.    To regularize production in all sectors of the national  economy it is imperative to give priority to the coal industry,  power industry, and railway transportation, which are the  leading sectors of the national economy, and to develop the  metal industry. Without giving priority to the leading sectors  of the national economy, problems concerning raw materials,  fuel, electricity, materials, and transport, which are necessary  for implementing the agriculture- first, light industry-first,  and trade-first policies, cannot be smoothly solved nor can  production be carried out in a timely manner in all sectors of  the national economy.    Only when priority is given to the leading sectors of the  national economy can agricultural production, consumer goods  production, and foreign exports be increased rapidly; production  be regularized in all sectors of the national economy, so that  the might of the self-reliant socialist economy is highly  enhanced.    The goals of the party's economic strategy make it possible  to give priority to the leading sectors of the national economy  in conformity with the specific situation of our economy which  is developing on a high foundation, to ensure a smooth  production cycle by realizing reasonable production-consumption  linkages and balance with related economic sectors and units,  and to regularize production at a high level in overall economic  sectors. The goals of the party's economic strategy also make  it possible to see to it that the production potential of the  existing economic foundation is fully demonstrated so that the  existing economic foundation not only serves the development of  the rural economy and light industry more fully, but also  smoothly meets the constantly increasing material demands of  society.    Accordingly, only when we realize the goals of the party's  economic strategy can we correctly maintain the balance between  econcomic construction and the people's living and overall  economic balance, including the balance between production of  means for production and production of consumer goods, and push  ahead with overall socialist economic construction in a vigorous  manner. We can also rapidly increase production in all sectors,  further strengthen our economy's self-reliance, and, thus, make  our economy invincible. In this way, we can not only firmly  deepen the revolutionary position of our socialism as an  invincible fortress and as an impregnable position by adding our  economic and technological might to the political and  ideological might of our style socialism, but also vigorously  demonstrate the invincible driving force of chuche socialism.    Realizing the goals of the party's economic strategy without  fail is also an important guarantee for firmly building our  revolutionary ranks.    Our socialism is the most superior, popular, mass-centered  socialism in which the people are the master of everything and  everything serves the people. It is imperative to firmly build  the revolutionary ranks to enhance the superiority of socialism  and to glorify socialism of our own style. To do so, it is  imperative for all members of the society to deeply recognize  the true superiority of of the socialist system through their  practical life. What is important in this is to see to it that  the people feel that socialism of our own style is the basis for  their true life and the cradle of their happiness, and we should  ensure that the people enjoy a more affluent and happier life to  their hearts content.    Rapidly increasing the level of the people's material and  cultural life which is increasing in conformity with the  socialist demands with each passing day is an important task  arising before us today. The goals of the party's revolutionary  strategy are precisely the blueprint to outstandingly realize  this task.    The rapid expansion of the production of consumer goods is  imperative to improving the standard of living. This depends on  the level of might demonstrated by the existing means of  production.    When the might of production of means of production  increases, in other words, when we readjust and strengthen the  existing economic foundation and effectively utilize it while  giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy,  we can have a bright prospect for constantly increasing the  production of consumer goods.    Today heavy industry bases have been firmly built in our  country. The party's economic strategic goals enable us to  decisively resolve the problems of people's living by  concentrating efforts on the development of agriculture, light  industry and trade that have just as great a potential as heavy  industry. Therefore, when we achieve the party's economic  strategic goals, we can constantly develop all domains in  agricultural production, including grain production, by further  consolidating and developing socialist rural economy in our  country. We can satisfactorily produce and supply various raw  materials for light industry, including chemical fiber and  synthetic fiber, by actively pushing ahead with modernization of  light industry. As a result, all units in the light industry  sector can produce a larger quantity of various good- quality  consumer goods. In particular, we can provide firm export- good  production bases by developing trade and by actively pioneering  overseas markets. We can also better guarantee raw materials  and materials required for enhancing the people's living  standard by increasing production of export goods. Thus, we can  vigorously accelerate production of consumer goods and attain  greater achievements in all domains of agricultural production.  Moreover, the party's economic strategic goals enable us to  further enhance the people's living standard by concentrating  efforts on the development of agriculture, light industry, and  trade. The goals also enable us to achieve, ahead of schedule,  our people's desire to eat rice food with meat soup, to wear  silk clothes, and to live under a tile-roofed house. These  goals make all the people fully enjoy worthwhile lives and  happiness under the most superior our- style socialist system.    If we further enhance the people's living standard by  achieving the party's economic strategic goals without fail, all  the people will realize, from the bottom of their hearts, the  benevolence of the great leader, and dear comrade leader who are  making all possible efforts, and taking pains to provide them  with a more abundant, and happier life, and will absolutely  worship, and accept the party, and the leader. They will attain  firmer single-hearted unity with the party, and with the leader  [suryong] with determination to share the destiny of the leader  [yongdoja] to the end. Besides, they will cherish more solid  faith in, and affection of our-style socialism, which is our  life [saengmyong], and living [saenghwal]. They will have the  ideological and mental resolve to devotedly struggle to defend  and glorify the grateful socialist system even at the risk of  their life. As a result, our revolutionary ranks will be  further strengthened into loyal ranks based on firm, unswerving  unity between the leader [yongdoja], and people,, and our  fatherland will prosper forever with the people's devoted  struggle.    By demonstrating an indomitable sense of dedication in the  struggle to achieve the party's revolutionary economic strategic  goals, all functionaries, and workers should tenaciously defend  and protect our-style socialism, and should further glorify its  superiority.</p>

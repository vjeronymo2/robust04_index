			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Customers could be the winners in AT&amp;T and BT battle WHAT DO AT&amp;T's plans to challenge BT in the UK telecommunications market mean for its customers? Cheaper calls for a start, as competition erodes the cosy 'correspondent' arrangements where national carriers co-operate rather than compete across national boundaries. Instead there could be head-to-head rivalry in international and domestic markets. There is the prospect of cost-effective, 'seamless' international communications services with only one company and one set of bills. AT&amp;T says it intends to offer British business customers virtual network services and digital private lines for high-speed data and voice communications. Assuming AT&amp;T's request is granted, what effect will new competition have on the UK telecommunications market? Analysts yesterday argued that Mercury was more likely than BT to suffer from AT&amp;T's presence in its home market. BT, for example, intends to offer similar services in the US to those AT&amp;T plans to offer in the UK. It believes that access to the lucrative US market will give it advantages well worth the risk of extra competition from AT&amp;T in the UK. Mercury, on the other hand, is much smaller and has specialised in the business market where AT&amp;T is focusing its efforts. AT&amp;T's application is the latest move in a complex regulatory game of give and take being played across global telecommunications markets. It is no surprise that AT&amp;T is trying to use its influence with the Federal Communications Commission - the US watchdog - and the Clinton administration to block BT's application as a bargaining measure. AT&amp;T's stand is similar to that of the large US airlines, which recently tried to prevent British Airways buying a stake in USAir on the grounds that US carriers should first have greater access to the UK market. It would offer business customers with locations in the UK and US a variety of 'competitively priced, seamless services' between the two countries. The principal telecommunications carriers such as AT&amp;T and BT are resigned to these changes and are preparing themselves for the battle for customers that will ensue. What remains to be thrashed out are the terms on which the various players will have access to each other's networks and markets. This is what lies behind calls for 'equivalence' or reciprocal access arrangements, guaranteeing a level playing field. For BT and AT&amp;T to fulfil their goals of becoming global 'supercarriers', they must have access to each other's markets. Both complain about the regulatory regimes they have to surmount. Mr John Berndt, president of AT&amp;T business services, said the greatest challenge in providing advanced services in the UK was that BT in effect controlled the local distribution of almost all phone services in the UK and dominated the British long-distance market. 'As a result, in order to terminate calls to customers, would-be competitors not only have to invest substantial time and money in building their own networks, they also have no alternative but to negotiate with BT for access to customers.' He said this contrasted with the US where years of pro-competition regulatory policies had given competitors such as BT the opportunity to enter the market with limited investment. Mr Berndt added that the US regulator's approval of BT's plan could adversely affect the US balance of payments, as more calls are made from the US to the UK than vice versa. US carriers paid BT more than Dollars 65m last year.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Personal View: Worthy sacrifice Should the government change course on the economy? Not, we are told, if we want to beat inflation. But does the cure have to be so tough? And is controlling inflation worth the pain? These are surely the summer's most important economic questions. Inflation has become deeply embedded in our psychology and behaviour over the past 30 years, and adjustments to deeply engrained habits of mind are required as we move into a non-inflationary world. Moving out of inflation requires nothing less than a reassessment of all assets and liabilities in the country - a revision of the balance sheet of every business and every family. Levels of debt which are prudent to hold under inflation become foolhardy and dangerous once inflation can no longer be counted upon to erode the real value of assets. So levels of debt have to be slashed. There are only two ways to reduce debt levels. One is by saving a higher share of current income and using it to retire debt. That, of course, means that a smaller proportion of incomes will be available for investing and buying goods or services. In other words, demand falls and recession ensues. The alternative is the writing-off of debt through default and bankruptcy. But that creates great strains in the financial system, reducing the capital of banks and constraining their ability to lend. That further damps demand and deepens recession. What of the asset side of the balance sheet? In an inflationary economy, all real assets carry a premium - the additional sum that people are prepared to pay for them based on the protection against inflation they appear to offer. But revising asset prices downwards has its pain. Where businesses have borrowed money on security, or families have taken out high mortgages, they may find themselves in technical default with the value of the borrowing higher than that of the security. The result is more bankruptcies, foreclosures and human disappointment. This is exactly what is happening today in the UK. Is it avoidable? No, it is an essential, inevitable part of the process of adjusting to a non-inflationary world. The government would be unwise to halt the process in mid-stream for two reasons. Firstly, a great deal of the pain has already been incurred. Secondly, we almost certainly have a better chance of licking inflation now than we have had for a generation. We have a government that is committed to the task. And we have the European exchange rate mechanism, which provides credibility to our monetary discipline. But is the fight against inflation worth it? The answer is yes. Inflation imposes great penalties on any society. There is the unfairness to millions of pensioners and others with fixed incomes. There are the economic costs as well. Businesses react inefficiently or perversely to changes in prices. Investment decisions are more risky. Savings are directed into unproductive stores of value, such as property. Worst of all, our national self-confidence would be threatened if we find that, after so many failed attempts in the past and after all the sacrifices of the present recession, we are condemned to return to an inflationary economy. A final question remains: can the government do anything to alleviate the pain? It is facing several constraints: it must not leave the ERM or devalue within it; it must not reduce interest rates until the foreign exchange markets signal that it is safe to do so; it must do nothing that would undermine the credibility of its monetary policy. However, when monetary policy has to be tight, it is a good moment to see whether fiscal policy can take some of the strain. I think it can - and should. There are calls for the 'toughest ever' public spending round in the autumn. That is right if the intention is to squeeze recurrent - what local authorities call 'revenue account' - spending. If spending is too high, total public debt may rise to a point where only inflation would enable any government to sustain the burden of servicing it. That would destroy the credibility of present monetary policy. That fear will be much reduced if the markets accepted that any additional public spending was genuinely non-recurring, as in the case of the German government's accounts over the past three years. Such would be the case if the government were now to increase investment spending in a move to take advantage of lower construction and capital goods costs. The problem is that the Treasury's accounts have never distinguished between recurrent and non-recurrent spending, including capital expenditure. It is not a semantical change that I am suggesting. It is the introduction of a new rigour into the Treasury's rules - the need, which any well-run business accepts, to distinguish between recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure. There may never be a perfect time to change the rules. But there is no time like the present. The author is a Conservative MP and a member of the House Treasury Select Committee.</p>

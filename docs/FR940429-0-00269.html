			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency action against any institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after an emergency action becomes effective, an institution or third-party servicer, as applicable, may not_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of aid to a student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or other funds as assistance to a student under that Title IV, HEA program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the case of an emergency action pertaining to participation in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Certify an application for a loan under that program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Deliver loan proceeds to a student under that program; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Retain the proceeds of a loan made under that program that are received after the emergency action takes effect; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) In the case of an emergency action against a third-party servicer, administer any aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency action, the authority of the institution or servicer to commit, disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds, or the authority of the servicer to administer any aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program, except in accordance with a particular procedure specified in the notice of emergency action, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may not take any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except in accordance with the procedure specified in the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer, as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency action that the initiating official has begun. The show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution or servicer may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal meeting with the show-cause official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified because_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the misuse described in the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and the initiating official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, after the official receives all the material submitted by the institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party servicer, the official also notifies each institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of emergency action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer, as applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is issued in that proceeding, as provided in &sect;668.90(c), as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the initiating official, or, if a show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the show-cause official to demonstrate that because of facts occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating official or the show-cause meeting, continuation of the emergency action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official considers any written material submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The expiration, modification, or revocation of an emergency action against an institution or third-party servicer does not bar subsequent emergency action against that institution on grounds other than those specifically identified in the notice imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include violation by an institution or third-party servicer of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the prior emergency action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1094) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23.

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / London Transport jobs may be cut Hundreds of jobs are likely to be lost under a restructuring of the top level of London Transport management announced yesterday. Some highly placed staff face compulsory redundancy in the shake-up which follows the sale of London Buses. LT would not comment on how many jobs would be lost, but said: 'A detailed survey of senior appointments and staff levels in each area has begun. Clearly, there will be redundancies.' LT has about 1,300 management and clerical staff at its central London headquarters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Nation and the </F> Emigrants: Common Sense Has the Floor"]    [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- The first requirement to  understand the deeper meaning of the meeting, which begins on  Friday between Cuban authorities and emigrants, is not to assess  the meeting apart from the circumstances, both within and  outside the country in which it will take place. One of these  circumstances, aspects of the Cuban question in the United  States, deserves to be considered briefly as an illustration.    Although it is difficult for some people in the world to  understand, the Cuban issue in the United States basically is  not a matter of foreign but domestic policy because of interests  involving winning the Florida elections.    The fact that there are in this American state some 260,000  people of Cuban ancestry with voting rights has created the  fiction that this number, which constitutes a minority in  relation to the rest of the people with voting rights, is  "essential" for victory in this state, the fourth most important  in U.S. elections.    This makes it clear that influence, big or small, in this  context is determined by the correlation of forces among people  of Cuban ancestry residing in the United States, particularly in  Florida.    What organization still exerts the greatest influence in  this  scenario? The Cuban-American National Foundation [FNCA],  created in the early 1980's under then President Ronald Reagan's  warm sponsorship, is an ultraconservative organization with  ample financial resources and a well-oiled mechanism of  influence in the Congress.    The FNCA holds a very intransigent position regarding Cuba,  rules out all possibilities of dealing with Fidel Castro's  government, defends to the utmost the so-called Torricelli Law,  and accepts only the surrender of the Cuban revolutionaries.    Although the foundation's greatest influence was observed  during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George  Bush, the FNCA's ties with Washington have not been severed, and  there is official interest in not taking any steps that could  cause significant clashes with the organization.    On several occasions, the U.S. press, THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL  on 3 August 1992 for instance, have reported that the FNCA and  its head, Jorge Mas Canosa, have turned the Cuban issue into a  profitable political affair, not without certain irregularities.    Another peculiarity of Mas Canosa's organization is the use  of subversive methods against everyone in Miami who dares voice  an opinion even slightly different from the FNCA's far-rightist  ideas regarding Havana.    Some people still remember what happened to THE MIAMI  HERALD,  which Mas Canosa accused of serving Castro's government only  because the paper expressed an opinion that contradicted the  Torricelli Law to some extent. Later, paper officials received  death threats, and some of the paper's distribution centers were  seriously damaged by terrorist actions. This explains the harsh  attacks that the far-rightist sector of the Cuban community  living in the United States has unleashed against the "The  Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which opened today. The  meeting's central goal, to advance on the road to normalizing  relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad, is unacceptable  to the intolerant who alienate themselves from the true feelings  prevailing in a community that is gradually abandoning them.    Maybe this is why the initial shouting of those who act like  this is an accurate indication of how right this conference is.  And perhaps this shouting is also a noisy introduction to the  emergence of new approaches which, though not ideologically  coincidental with those of Cuba, could form a commonsense bridge  in the civilized dealings between the nation and its emigrants.</p>

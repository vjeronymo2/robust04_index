			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elisa Betias Otero; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Excerpt] I would like to report that President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari indicated this afternoon that his  administration is unflinchingly taking on the commitments agreed  during the process for peace and justice taking place in  Chiapas. He also announced that the necessary decisions to  guarantee the execution of these commitments will be made in the  next few days.    The president expressed his optimism with the conclusion of  the peace and reconciliation talks in Chiapas and he indicated  that the dialogue has already provided evidence of positive  results. In this respect, he called for the support of society  in order to reach to the signing of a peace agreement.    The president's statements were made public through a  communique issued by the Presidency of the Republic. The  communique stresses that the list of demands presented to the  government through Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho was  acknowledged with the true disposition of listening and solving  the Indians' demands for justice, welfare, and dignity.    With regard to the letter the communique points out that the  government has decided to seriously honor its commitments and  that the necessary decisions to ensure the execution of said  commitments will be made in the next few days. We expect  society's support on the points agreed upon and that by backing  these points we will all be looking out to ensure that all  details are honored which will allow us to reach to the signing  of a final peace agreement.

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips sinks by 18% after profits warning A PROFITS warning from Philips sent tremors through the Dutch market, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was shocked by Philips's announcement that it was making a sharp reduction in its 1992 earnings forecasts. A wave of sell orders wiped over 20 per cent off the stock before a close Fl 6.90, or 18 per cent lower at Fl 31.10 in volume of 6m shares. The CBS Tendency index ended 1.4 lower at 127.4. Analysts were taken aback, as many had attended a meeting with the electronics group last week during which the company made no hint that it was about to take this step, which it blamed on weakness in the consumer electronics division. Yesterday most analysts cut their 1992 EPS forecasts from an average of Fl 3.50 to around Fl 2.70. However, some believe that the group will pay a dividend this year, estimated at between 50 and 75 cents. Polygram, in which Philips has an 80 per cent stake, shed Fl 1.10 to Fl 50.90. MILAN recovered from a weak start to the new account on news that the socialist leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, had withdrawn his bid to become the next prime minister, paving the way for the formation of a government. The Comit index, which reached a 1992 low on Tuesday, rose 0.9 to 469.69 in turnover estimated at more than Tuesday's L104bn. The Craxi news prompted short-covering and lifted shares which had already been officially fixed. Buying more than made up for the payment of dividends by 56 companies yesterday, which took more than 1 per cent off the index. Stet, whose placement was oversubscribed, closed L102 down at L1,810 but rebounded to L1,859 later. PARIS eased ahead of the Irish referendum on Maastricht and a further batch of negative company announcements made traders nervous. The CAC 40 index fell from a high of 1,915.64 to close 22.57 or 1.2 per cent lower at 1,908.84 in turnover of FFr2.45bn. Suez dropped FFr11.80 to FFr302.20 after the company said it would have to make another FFr1.2bn in property provisions this year. Synthelabo dropped FFr127 or 11.1 per cent to FFr1,020 in heavy volume of 149,650 shares after the company said clinical tests on its anti-anxiety drug, Alpidem, had been halted. Its parent, L'Oreal, lost FFr21 to FFr869. FRANKFURT moved tentatively into today's Corpus Christi holiday and Friday's options expiry. Turnover fell from DM4.1bn to DM3.8bn as the FAZ index fell 2.71 to 706.39 at midsession, and the DAX by 7.32 to 1,771.78 at the close. Lufthansa, a perceived victim of the airfares war, fell DM6 to DM129, approaching its low for the year. AEG, down DM9 to DM193.50, might have been carried down by Philips. Hoesch, DM11 lower at DM277, reflected a general downturn in steels on talk of another broker's downgrade for the sector. Preussag fell DM4.20 to DM417 and Thyssen lost DM2.60 to DM234.50. ZURICH saw Swissair bearers fall SFr7 to SFr732 as the SMI index fell 8.2 to 1,873.1. After hours the airline said that it was cutting 400 jobs from its 6,000 administrative workforce. BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index lost 12.41 or 1 per cent to 1,189.99. Barco, the electrical group, shed BFr48 to BFr1,312, reflecting the fall in Philips. COPENHAGEN saw Baltica Holding drop DKr77 to DKr460 after Hafnia Holding, which owns 33.5 per cent of Baltica, said its equity capital was down to DKr400m, Hilary Barnes writes. The all-share index fell 3.89 to 319.02. Hafnia Holding B fell DKr9 to DKr102. Banks were also hit, with Danske Bank declining by DKr5 to DKr271 and Unibank by DKr7 to DKr159. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index ended 6.8 lower at 943.3. The insurer, Trygg-Hansa saw its B shares down SKr4 to SKr53, having insured the loan portfolio of the banking group, Gota, in which it is a major shareholder. Gota A, however, rose SKr1.50 to SKr17.50. OSLO registered its 12th consecutive decline, the all-share index falling 4.83 to 423.79.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1158.75  1158.17  1159.36  1160.43  1159.46  1159.20  1158.90  1158.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1160.77    Day's Low  1158.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Jun 16      Jun 15      Jun 12      Jun 11      Jun 10         1165.38     1159.75     1167.48     1162.52     1174.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION SPENDING PLUNGES 2.8% IN SEPTEMBER; SHARPEST FALL IN 8 YEARS  </P> <P> Construction spending sank 2.8% in September, its sharpest plunge in more than  eight years, the government said today. Declines in all categories led to the  worst showing since the last recession.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government  spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $428.7 billion. That was  the lowest dollar level since $423.1 billion was spent in November, 1988.  </P> <P> The 2.8% decline was the sharpest since spending fell 3% in January, 1982, in  the midst of the 1981-82 recession.  </P> <P> Spending was virtually unchanged in both July and August and has not increased  since March, when it advanced 0.4%. July turned out to be weaker than  previously thought. The department first reported construction actually turned  up 0.3% that month.  </P> <P> Construction spending in September was 1.1% below the $433.4 billion spent in  the same month of 1989.  </P> <P> Analysts have said declining confidence because of the Persian Gulf crisis has  exacerbated an already weakened construction industry.  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (25): Not for quick income seekers - European PEPs / Dividend yields tend to be lower than those in the UK, because of the different shareholding structures that are found on the continent THE PEP investor is no longer dependent on the vagaries of the UK stock market. Since the Budget of 1991, the qualifying rules for Peps have required that a minimum of 50 per cent of a plan's assets be held in the European community, not, as previously, in the UK. A holding of European shares gives the investor a sensible measure of diversification and a chance of foreign currency gains if the value of the pound declines (as it did in 1992). Of course, the corollary is that the investor risks both a currency loss and the possibility that European shares might underperform the London market. For the vast majority of investors, the best way of gaining exposure to the European markets is via unit and investment trusts. There are plenty on offer - 14 general, and six single-country, investment trusts; and 133 unit trusts. Such trusts have not produced particularly sparkling performances since the 1991 Budget, as the euphoria engendered by German reunification has turned into the recessionary gloom caused by the Bundesbank's high interest-rate policy. But investing in Europe has proved advantageous over the longer term. The average European unit trust rose by 60.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested) over the five years to December 1, whereas the average UK growth trust grew by just 42.5 per cent over the same period. In the investment trust market, the comparison was the same; the average European trust grew by 73.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income reinvested), while the UK general trust rose by 56.8 per cent. How does the investor choose a trust? The first distinction to make is between the general European funds and those based on a single country. The latter offer greater rewards if you get your country selection right, but much higher risk. Take the Aetna Iberian Growth fund: over the three months to December 1, it was the worst-performing unit trust in the European sector, but over the month of November, it was the best trust in the sector. General European trusts will spread their investments across a range of markets, and thus be protected against the effects of a political or economic crisis in one country. Consequently they are far more suitable for the small investor. Among unit trusts, GT European was top over 10 years (with growth of 607.5 per cent), Fidelity European over seven years (290.5 per cent) and Baring European Growth over five years (118.2 per cent). In the investment trust world, F &amp; C Eurotrust was top over 10 years (647.5 per cent), while Second Market Trust was best over five (133 per cent). But consistency is probably more important than being top of the table over an individual time period. The following unit trusts had above-average performances for the sector, according to Finstat, over the one, two, three, five and seven years to December 1: Aetna European Growth, Barclays Unicorn European Growth, Baring European Growth, Eagle Star European, Gartmore European, LAS European, Provident Mutual European, Scottish Life European and Scottish Mutual European. NM European carries the distinction of an above-average performance over all those periods plus the last 10 years as well. However, it (like the Scottish Life fund) is only available to those using a self-select Pep. Because of the small size of the European investment trust sector, analysis of average performances would not be particularly meaningful. However, investors should be aware of some important factors before venturing into this area. The first is that dividend yields on European shares tend to be lower than those in the UK, because of the different shareholding structures found on the continent. Hence the yields on most European unit and investment trusts are only around 1 or 2 per cent. These trusts are not designed for investors seeking immediate income. They are suitable only for those who are prepared to invest for the very long term (a decade or so) in order to benefit from dividend growth, or for those who are likely to use up their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93). The second point is the size of the bid-offer spread on unit trusts. The sector average is 6 per cent - not particularly high when compared with the 6.1 per cent average in the UK growth sector. But the range is wide: from 1.09 per cent on Lazard's European trust, to 8.19 per cent on Bell Court's UK and European fund. In other words, the investor who chooses Lazards instead of Bell Court is getting a 7 per cent start. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, while the Lazards trust is top of the sector over three years, the Bell Court trust is 98th. (Alas for small investors, the Lazard funds require a minimum of Pounds 5,000). For those who prefer investment trusts, a vitally important factor is the discount to net assets at which the shares trade. If this discount widens, the investor can lose money, even if European shares are rising. In early January, the average discount in the sector was around 16 per cent. Such a discount allowed investors to buy assets relatively cheaply and gave scope for additional profit, were the gap to narrow.</p>

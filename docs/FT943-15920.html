			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Gatt joins battle for right to protect - Frances Williams on differences with Wipo over intellectual property jurisdiction It is no trade secret that relations between the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its near-neighbour in Geneva, the World Intellectual Property Organisation, have been strained in recent years. Wipo, a UN agency which administers 16 international intellectual property treaties, lost with bad grace a crucial turf battle to Gatt when intellectual property protection went on the agenda of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in 1986. After years struggling unsuccessfully to negotiate new and revised treaties for the protection of patents, copyrights and trademarks, Wipo watched Gatt members put together, in record time, the biggest and most comprehensive intellectual property agreement this century. The Gatt accord on trade-related aspects of intellectual property (Trips), which will operate under the aegis of the new World Trade Organisation from next year, plugs some gaping holes in the existing system. It lays down minimum standards of protection and enforcement for all types of intellectual property - for example, unlike Wipo's 1883 Paris Convention on patents, it defines what is patentable and sets a minimum patent term of 20 years. The rules will be binding on all WTO members, though developing countries have been given a five-year transition period (11 years for the poorest) to adopt new legislation. Thus India, the most notable absentee from the Paris Convention, will have to provide basic patent protection. Most important, the accord's obligations will be enforced through the WTO's revamped disputes settlement mechanism, which will require offending countries to mend their ways or face retaliation from trading partners. Wipo has no enforcement powers. Trade experts are predicting a rush of disputes once the new system comes into force, as governments test the ability of the Trips agreement to resolve current disagreements. It also provides the first opportunity to test divergent national interpretations of the Paris Convention and the equally venerable 1886 Berne Convention on copyright, whose substantive provisions are incorporated in the WTO accord. With negotiation and interpretation of international rules on intellectual property now apparently annexed by the WTO, Wipo's influence is being questioned. Wipo's main activity, which occupies two-thirds of its 450 staff, is in any case not negotiation but registration of patents, trademarks, industrial designs and appellations of origin. Registration earns Wipo almost SFr90m (Pounds 43m) a year, three-quarters of its SFr115m 1994 budget income. And business is booming. Nearly 29,000 international patent applications were filed in 1993 under the Patent Co-operation Treaty which enables inventors to apply for registration in several countries with a single application. This is five times the number a decade ago, while the average number of designated countries per application has jumped from 10 to 31. The UN agency's other important focus is giving advice to developing countries on such matters as running patent offices or drafting intellectual property legislation. Wipo's technical co-operation and registration activities are, if anything, likely to receive a fillip from the Trips accord by encouraging developing countries to upgrade intellectual property protection. In a separate move, Wipo has established a mediation and arbitration centre to handle disputes between private parties which is due to begin operations this October. Nor is it a foregone conclusion that Wipo's negotiating role has ended. Washington railroaded intellectual property rights on to the Uruguay Round agenda because developing countries were blocking negotiations in Wipo. They eventually accepted a Trips agreement in return for benefits in other areas of the round, including textiles and farm trade. But, with no further all-embracing trade round in prospect, trade-offs between sectors may be less important than in the past. Developing countries have mostly come round to the benefits of intellectual property protection and within the WTO, the initial emphasis is expected to be on implementing the new agreement, which is virgin trade territory. Though the Trips accord provides for a review after five years, trade officials do not envisage big changes early on. This leaves the way clear for Wipo, which already has several negotiating projects on the stocks. These include two new treaties to supplement the Paris Convention, a Patent Law Treaty and a Trademark Law Treaty which aim to harmonise national norms. Wipo is also considering a protocol to the Berne Convention to deal with new media and information technologies. Wipo officials admit that these are proving difficult negotiations. Talks on the Patent Law Treaty, which have been going on for 10 years, are stalled because Washington refuses to drop its first-to-invent filing system (the rest of the world uses a first-to-file system). But 'no one is saying the issues should go to Gatt,' notes Mr Francois Curchod, Wipo's deputy director general. The future of a draft treaty on dispute settlement (though without any sanctions provisions) will be discussed by Wipo's 147-member general assembly in September in the light of the Uruguay Round deal. Wipo officials point out that, outside those specific provisions of the Paris and Berne Conventions embraced by the Trips accord, Wipo agreements are not enforceable by the WTO. Still undecided is what role Wipo should have in the WTO's disputes procedure. Gatt members have so far shown a strong disinclination to boost substantially the number of staff working on Trips from the present one and a half. Paradoxically, to make the new procedure work, the WTO may need all the outside help it can get.</p>

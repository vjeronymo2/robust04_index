Yang, 50, a  Shanghai-based dissident who is also a founder of the Peace  Charter movement created last November, said by telephone that  he had been released at 9:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) after being held  for more than 13 hours.    Another CHRA leader, Li Guotao, who was picked up with Yang  on Saturday evening, was released at 1:00 a.m. (1700 GMT), Yang  said.    Yang and Li were the latest dissidents to be taken in for  questioning during a police sweep in Beijing and Shanghai that  has netted around 15 activists in the last 10 days. The  detentions coincided with the opening in Beijing of the annual  session of the Chinese parliament and the arrival of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Romania's President  Ion Iliescu presided on April 11 a meeting of the country's  Supreme Defence Council. Two drafts were examined and initialed  on the occasion, namely "The Integrated Outlook of Romanian  National Security" and "Romania's Military Defence Doctrine."    The former includes the fundamental tenets, objectives and  trends defining the general policy of security of Romania. The  latter has been drafted with observance of the provisions of  Romania's Constitution and laws, the basic principles,  objectives and guiding lines of the security policy of the  Romanian state, the current stage and the tendencies of the  political-military affairs at a world, continental and regional  scale, risks and threats that appear as likely against Romania's  national interests, the short- and middle-term evolution of the  country's military integration with the European and  Euro-Atlantic security structures.    The country's Supreme Defense Council decided that the two  documents be referred to parliament for endorsement.    The agenda included debates and approval of a draft  "Presentation Document: Romania," written by the Romanian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Romania's Ministry of National  Defence, in consequence of Romania's joining the "Partnership  for Peace" plan. The document includes the measures proposed by  Romania, necessary for fulfilment of the political objectives of  the Partnership and the aspects of military character or of  other type that Romania can made available for NATO, which is  going to be forwarded the draft.    Romania reasserts in the document its determination to be  faithful to all the principles and targets of the "Partnership  for Peace" to the assertions in the "Declaration of the Heads of  States and Governments Who Attended the Sitting of the  North-Atlantic Council Held in Brussels on January 10-11, 1994."    Political and organisation measures have been enlisted in  the  document intended to secure a democratic control on the Army and  facilitate transparency in planning national defence and  drafting the budget, fields of cooperation, human and logistic  resources that Romania can contribute to the Partnership for  Peace plan.</p>

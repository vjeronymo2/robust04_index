			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Gazans struggle in the wake of border closure: Julian Ozanne surveys the economic damage to Palestinians and the threat to the peace process Hisham el-Absie usually plasters walls in Israel but yesterday he was in a pool hall in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Like 25,000 other Palestinians living in Gaza, he has been unable to work since Israel closed the borders of Gaza and the West Bank last Wednesday in retaliation for a bus bombing by Islamic militants which left 21 Israelis dead. The closure, which Israel has threatened to make indefinite to separate Arabs from Jews, will cripple Gaza's economy and undermine efforts by the Palestinian authority and international donors to demonstrate to Palestinians that there is an economic benefit from peace. The move also has serious implications for the fragile political stability of Mr Yassir Arafat's authority. The continuing failure of the Palestinian authority to meet expectations for economic benefits plays into the hands of the Islamic opposition. 'Nobody can predict what will happen. It is a very fragile time in terms of stability,' said Mr Nabil Abu Irdaina, an senior adviser to Mr Arafat. 'Without economic advancement, without jobs, without investments the situation is very dangerous because the peace process means nothing to the ordinary Palestinian - no results.' Migrant labour remains the backbone of the Gaza economy and PLO officials have condemned the closure as an 'economic war' on Palestinians. The Palestinians from Gaza who normally work in Israel sustain extended families who, even in good times, live close to the poverty line. Their income supports hundreds of small shops and businesses. In an economy where unemployment can be as high as 50 per cent and annual per capita income is around Dollars 800, the loss of this vital source of earnings is devastating. According to Mr Alex Pollock, a United Nations economist, the immediate effect on small businesses is a break down in the credit system and the economy moves to a cash-only basis. Businesses have to lay off local workers, exacerbating unemployment. Furthermore the closure makes its difficult for Gaza to export to Israel and reduces the tax, value added tax and customs revenue base of the Palestinian treasury. Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian 'minister' for planning and international co-operation, said the closure also sends negative signals to investors and tourists. 'The closure creates an extreme form of anxiety among investors and gives the feeling that anything can happen,' Mr Shaath said. 'It destroys trust and confidence and deals a heavy blow to our prosperity, stability, credibility and viability.' Palestinians have developed survival mechanisms during previous Israeli closures ranging from borrowing money from extended family members to selling electronic goods and gold saved for dowry payments. But successive closures have eroded the coping mechanisms. The crisis could have been less acute if the PLO and international donors had got the emergency economic programme off the ground. The World Bank has released less than 10 per cent of Dollars 720m emergency funding promised for 1994. The Bank blames the PLO for lack of transparency, accountability and division of responsibility among competing economic ministers. The PLO blames the Bank for excessive bureaucracy and what it calls 'donor fatigue, myopia and arterial sclerosis'. The only real job creating programmes have been Dollars 52m of projects in education and health carried out by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and a Gaza clean-up campaign funded by Japan and the European Union which created 3,000 jobs. Donors and PLO officials hope Israel will start to ease the closure soon. But this time it might be different. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has spoken of a possible formal and permanent separation of Arabs and Jews - a negation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements which foresees increasing economic integration and the continuing presence of Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas. The Israeli cabinet yesterday formally agreed 19,000 new permits for foreign workers to replace Palestinian migrant workers. The new permits bring Israel's foreign work force, mainly from Eastern Europe and Asia, to 53,000 and consolidate Israeli moves to lessen its dependence on the Palestinian workforce. Every time Israel lifts a closure it whittles down the Palestinian work force. In 1987 80,000 Palestinians from Gaza were working in Israel. At the time of the Gulf War the figure was down to 56,000. Since 1993 Israel has unofficially set the Gaza migrant work force at 20,000-25,000. Israel's policy of labour substitution will have severe economic effects. International and local economists agree that economic growth in Gaza will depend, at least for five years, on continued migrant labour to Israel. Permanent closure of borders would cause a massive economic slump and force Gazan integration into the much poorer Egyptian economy. Mr Shaath said if Israel really wants separation it should remove Israeli settlements, define borders and allow Palestinians to have their own state in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 'Separation means independence but what we have at the moment is separation with occupation which doesn't make any rational sense,' he said. 'Either we must choose separation or marriage which means continuing the peace process and economic integration. The closure is like marriage but with wife beating.' Israel has consistently said it wishes Palestinian self-rule to be an economic success. The Jewish state knows the dangers of growing poverty and extremism on its borders. Israeli ministers are fond of saying 'The only good neighbours are prosperous neighbours'. But a prolonged closure increases economic desperation, defeats donor efforts and erodes the fragile credibility and legitimacy of Mr Arafat in the eyes of his own people.</p>

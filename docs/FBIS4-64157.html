			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of the Cabinet of Ministers  released a statement for the media. The statement says:    The government shares the anxiety concerning the social and  economic situation in the republic which was expressed in the  Supreme Kenges statement of 27 May 1994. At the same time the  policy of expressing no confidence in the government, in fact,  is not constitutional.    In accordance with our main law [the Constitution] the  Cabinet of Ministers is answerable to the president of the  republic. The government hoped that the Supreme Kenges statement  would contribute to constructive dialogue between the government  and the executive. However, unfortunately one can trace in the  statement some slogan-type pronouncements which are rooted in  the emotions and passions of the recent election campaign.    In the present social and economic situation a painful  transition period is unavoidable but the necessary prerequisites  have not shaped themselves in our country yet to overcome it.    The government acted in conformity with the anticrisis  program suggested by the Supreme Kenges. Structural changes of  the economy are under way: the conversion of defense  enterprises, the development of entrepreneurship. Under the  most severe crisis of nonpayments the government has written-off  the debts of republican enterprises. The sowing campaign is  nearing its end. Under the present difficulties farmers have  managed to sow grain on an area of 15 million hectares, they  (?are trying) to observe the deadline of the potato and  vegetable sowing campaign [word indistinct].    The government has submitted about 60 draft laws to the  Supreme Kenges on urgent and topical issues of economic reform  -- strengthenning [word indistinct], law and order, and others.  Adoption of these and other documents could have made it  possible to improve the legal basis of the reform, to increase  purpose- orientated social protection of the population.    The government calls on the Supreme Kenges to carry out its  constitutional prerogatives -- to pass laws -- as well as [word  indistinct] in order to preserve political stability,  interethnic accord, and strengthenning Kazakhstan's prestige on  the international arena.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 14 KYODO -- A Japanese-owned factory  in Dalian, northeast China, was hit in March by a massive strike  by Chinese employees seeking wage hikes, senior officials of the  company disclosed Saturday [14 May].    The officials said the strike, which rocked the wholly owned  subsidiary of Mabuchi Motor Co., ended after the company agreed  to a 45 percent wage increase.    They said about 6,000 of the company's 7,000 workers  participated in the strike, which began on the night of March 24  with female workers walking out of the workshops.    The factory's operations came to a complete standstill for  the following two days, they said.    Workers demanded an average hike of 300 yuan (23 U.S.  dollars) in their monthly salaries, but agreed to a compromise  proposal worked out by municipal labor authorities, calling for  a monthly wage hike of 135 yuan (10.50 dollars) to an average of  about 435 yuan (33.80 dollars), the officials said.    They said the demand stemmed from the inflation rate  exceeding 20 percent recently.    The company offered a regular raise of about 10 percent in  April in recent years.    In a related development, a Hong Kong newspaper reported  Saturday about 2,400 local workers at a home appliances  manufacturing firm in Dalian, which is partially owned by  Japanese precision instruments maker Canon Inc., have threatened  to walk out. A strike was averted when they accepted a raise of  135 yuan (10.50 dollars) in their monthly salaries.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Takeover Panel Two clouds darken the Takeover Panel's horizon. The panel worries that the proposed EC takeover directive will result in a statutory body superseding its informal role. Such a change would indeed be a shame if it lessened the flexibility of the UK's takeover regime. But the directive's shape is unclear. Besides, it will take some time to wend its way through Brussels' corridors. A more immediate concern is simply the dearth of takeovers, at a 25-year low in 1992. The panel is already shedding staff. It may yet end up having to cut its fees.</p>

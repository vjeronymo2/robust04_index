			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Rabin rules out direct PLO talks ISRAEL'S government yesterday ruled out direct talks with the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation and said it would keep negotiating with a Palestinian peace delegation from the occupied territories. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's comments followed a threat to resign by three top members of the locally-based Palestinian delegation and speculation that Israel might agree to direct talks with the PLO because it appeared to be taking a more moderate stand. The three negotiators - Mr Faisal Husseini, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Saeb Erekat - were last night locked in negotiations with senior PLO officials including Mr Yassir Arafat, the organisation's leader. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, continued to refuse to deny or confirm resignation reports, fuelling speculation that the Palestinians from the occupied territories were using the threat of resignation as a way of increasing pressure on the PLO leaders. Mr Haidar abdel-Shafi, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, was due to arrive in Tunis from Amman to join the talks. 'It is a Palestinian problem,' Mr Rabin said. 'It is not our business what is the composition of the Palestinian delegation as long as it is composed of residents of the territories.' Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, when asked whether Israel should negotiate directly with the PLO, said: 'Everything has its time. This question too has its time and it is not now. At this stage, there is a delegation we can negotiate with.' Mr Rabin's government, which has already ended a ban on private contacts with the PLO, has faced a growing clamour from the left wing of his Labour party and the Meretz party within his coalition to agree to talks with Mr Arafat.</p>

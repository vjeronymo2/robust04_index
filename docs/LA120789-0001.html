			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS PROBING CRANSTON VOTER SIGN-UP GROUPS  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether voter registration groups  that received millions of dollars solicited by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)  violated their tax-exempt status by engaging in partisan activity, law  enforcement sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> IRS auditors in Los Angeles are looking into allegations that the ostensibly  nonpartisan groups placed undue emphasis on registering more Democrats than  Republicans. Possible violations would be civil, not criminal, said the  sources, who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The main group, the Center for Participation in Democracy, has been operated by  Cranston's son, Kim, in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Cranston, who has come under fire for soliciting contributions from the owner  of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, reacted angrily to a reference  to his son in a New York Times report saying that the groups were being  investigated by "federal law enforcement authorities."  </P> <P> "It makes my blood boil to see attempts to smear my son and drag him into the  mud," Cranston said in a statement that he read at a news conference in Los  Angeles. "I know personally from Kim of the exquisite pains he took to ensure  that registration drives he was associated with were legal, proper and  bipartisan."  </P> <P> Cranston called on FBI Director William S. Sessions to find out who had leaked  word of the inquiry. Cranston's attorney, William W. Taylor III, suggested in a  letter to Sessions that the anonymous sources were "motivated . . . by  political rather than law enforcement objectives."  </P> <P> It had been reported earlier that the FBI is conducting a separate criminal  review of intervention by Cranston and four other senators on behalf of Lincoln  S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating Jr., who contributed heavily to their  campaigns as well as to the voter groups.  </P> <P> Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating on behalf of three voter registration  groups at about the same time that the senator met with federal officials in  1987 to discuss regulatory actions involving Lincoln. Cranston has also  received $47,000 in direct campaign contributions from Keating.  </P> <P> The other senators who participated with Cranston in the sessions with  regulators -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), John Glenn  (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- received a total of about  $475,000 in contributions from Keating.  </P> <P> The question of whether the five senators performed favors in exchange for  Keating's donations is being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee, at  the request of Common Cause, a citizens' lobbying group.  </P> <P> The government seized Lincoln last April, more than two years after regional  S&amp;L regulators had advocated a federal takeover. Its financial collapse  will cost taxpayers an estimated $2 billion or more, making it the most costly  thrift failure ever.  </P> <P> Cranston has raised a total of more than $7 million in recent years for six  voter registration groups, of which five are tax-exempt.  </P> <P> The IRS inquiry focuses on indications detailed by The Times in October that  the five tax-exempt groups backed by Cranston might not have lived up to their  nonpartisan label.  </P> <P> Interviews, public records and even some of the working documents of the groups  showed that special pains were taken to register voters who would be likely to  vote Democratic.  </P> <P> IRS officials have said that it is permissible for groups to concentrate  registration activities in certain areas as long as people are not pressured  into signing up with one party over another.  </P> <P> Cranston has acknowledged that his groups targeted areas likely to produce  large numbers of new Democratic voters, but he has insisted that potential  Republican voters were not turned away.  </P> <P> In a 1986 letter soliciting funds for the first of his tax-exempt groups,  Cranston cited "keeping my Senate seat in the Democratic column" as the first  of four issues of "great national significance" at stake in the 1986 elections.  </P> <P> Terrie Monaghan, a former business manager at the Center for Participation in  Democracy, said that leaders of the group "got upset if too many Republicans"  were registered.  </P> <P> Center leaders expected that Democrats would make up about three-quarters of  the names that each worker collected, said Monaghan, herself a Democrat.  </P> <P> Carl Pope, a member of the group's board, said that about 70% of the 233,000  voters that the group registered last year were Democrats, with the rest  divided among Republicans, independents and those who refused to state their  affiliation.  </P> <P> Kim Cranston, a top aide to California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, was on vacation  Wednesday and could not be reached for comment on the IRS inquiry.  </P> <P> Staff writers Keith Love and Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

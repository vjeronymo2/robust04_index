			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Danish bonds tumble as currency pressures resurface DANISH government bonds tumbled yesterday as the Danish currency came under heavy selling pressure, reigniting the tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. The Danish central bank raised the rate on its repurchase operations from 11.5 per cent to 13 per cent in order to defend the krone, and several European central banks intervened in the foreign exchange markets to help support the currency and prevent a devaluation. Denmark's economy minister ruled out a devaluation of the krone, saying it would be defended at all costs against increasing attacks from currency speculators. THE German government bond market ended higher on the day, buoyed by hopes that the public sector unions would agree to a low wage increase this week, allowing the Bundesbank to ease rates. Dealers noted strong demand for medium-dated paper, which led to a steepening of the yield curve. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 93.26, moved up to a high of 93.38 before ending at around 93.35. FRENCH government bonds closed higher, even though the currency came under pressure again and money-market rates remained relatively high. The Bank of France announced yesterday it had reopened its 5-10 day lending facility - which was suspended on January 5 - offering funds at 12 per cent for five-day periods. The yield on the 8 per cent bond due 2003 moved from 7.84 per cent to 7.80 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bonds rallied on news that the Dutch finance ministry plans to allow open-market trading in stripped components of publicly-issued 30-year government bonds. UK government bonds closed slightly higher after a volatile day in which the market shrugged off sterling's weakness in the foreign exchange markets. Dealers noted some foreign interest in gilts, suggesting that overseas investors think sterling may be close to its low and expect to see an appreciation in sterling assets. The Bank of England said two of its tap stocks had been exhausted yesterday. JAPANESE government bond prices fell sharply yesterday as investors sold futures ahead of the interest rate cut announced early today. The bond market had been anticipating the Bank of Japan's decision to cut the Official Discount Rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 per cent. Hopes of a cut pushed rates on three-month certificates of deposit to a record low of 3.25 per cent, down from 3.43 per cent. The Japanese government bond market climbed to a five-year high earlier this week and the prospect of a rate cut prompted investors to take profits yesterday. The futures contract fell half a point from 109.73 to end at 109.24, the low of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.3 per cent and closed at 4.355 per cent, just off the low price of the day. US Treasury prices yesterday firmed at the long end after the Treasury - as some investors had hoped - announced it was cutting the size of the long bond issue in next week's refunding auctions. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 104 7/8 , yielding 7.218 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100, to yield 4.233 per cent. There was much speculation recently over whether the Treasury would change the refunding mix by cutting the size of the long bond issue (and increasing the amount of shorter-dated securities sold accordingly) in order to reduce the cost of financing the budget deficit. That speculation proved on target and prices gained further ground at the long end after the Treasury announced that for its latest refunding round, it was cutting the amount of its 30-year bond issue from Dollars 10.25bn to Dollars 9.25bn. The Treasury also said it would study the possibility of further changes in the borrowing mix at a later date.</p>

However, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev's unexpected  announcement on Monday that he would not seek reelection for a  second term may cause a new heightening of tensions. [passage  omitted]    The 27 February elections themselves, despite the incumbent  president's short stay in office, did not come as a surprise:  As soon as he assumed office, Ruslan Aushev promised to work  out a new constitution and to hold new presidential and  parliamentary elections in accordance with it. It always seemed  obvious, however, that it would be he who would be the main and  in fact the only actual candidate for a new presidential term.  This is why Aushev's announcement surprised even many people  from his inner circle, the Ingush president's press service told  KOMMERSANT-DAILY.    The reason given by the president himself does not appear  very plausible, though: He and his government could have hardly  done everything they wanted and were able to within one year.  In addition, the "emergency rule" Ruslan Aushev referred to  cannot be dismissed as a thing of the past -- at least the  problem of refugees has not lost its urgency. Some observers  attribute Aushev's exit to the election of his main rival,  Akhsarbek Galazov, as North Ossetian president, implying that by  doing so the Ingush leader recognized his inability to cooperate  productively with his Ossetian counterpart. Given that there  are no more or less prominent and authoritative figures behind  Ruslan Aushev's back, however, one may state with assurance that  any of his successors will be much less experienced and may  bungle by breaking the fragile stability that has currently come  about in the region. Nor will he enjoy so unanimous a support  in society as the incumbent president. Still, it is too early  to talk about Aushev's definitive departure, because his refusal  to run for office has left only one candidate in the field, for  which reason the elections may simply not take place at all.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES dealers hung fire ahead of the chancellor of the exchequer's keynote speech tonight, writes Peter John. One trader summed up the general view with the comment: 'Everyone knows the market is going to move but nobody can decide which way.' The FT-SE 100 index contract for December delivery saw interest in the morning but activity petered out and, by the official close, only 6,653 lots had been dealt. December opened marginally off and was subsequently sold down to 2,680, its low of the day. By the 4.10pm close it had rallied to 2,683, a net fall of 27 on the day. The premium above fair value (currently around 20) narrowed to 12. The polarisation of views on the short-term future of the economy was reflected in the day's business. Dealers optimistic for a rate cut were matched by those who argue that lower interest rates have been factored into the market and, without a cut, the market will focus on political uncertainty and fall sharply. Business was brisker in traded options, where more than 31,000 contracts were traded, a big increase over the past two days once extraordinary individual trades are deducted. J. Sainsbury, a very good performer in the underlying market and now at the top of its trading range, was the top stock option with nearly 2,500 lots dealt.</p>

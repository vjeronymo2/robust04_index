He said that this agreement breaks the circle around the  coca  market. He added: "It will now be possible to take the  products from the central markets to the different departments  of greater consumption. This will help consumers because prices  will fall."    He also said that branch markets will be established to  allow  producers to take the coca there directly. He said: "This will  not affect middlemen, it will only serve to open up free  marketing in the different parts of the country."    Tarqui indicated that during the meeting held on 6 January  important progress was made in favor of coca growers, but that  there are still several points pending on which the government  must provide answers to the COB by 25 January, so that both  sides can study them together on 3 February.    He said: "The regulation for marketing coca was approved,  although some additions based on agreements for the Chapare  region of Cochabamba must still be made. The only thing left to  be done now is to promulgate the law based on the agreements  reached with the government minister (German Quiroga)."    He added that another important point of progress was the  government's full acceptance of the issuance of a supreme decree  for marketing coca.    Regarding the pending points, Tarqui said that the  government  asked that the revision of Law 1008 on controlled substances,  which coca growers have demanded be made permanent, be left  pending.    Tarqui recalled that as a result of Law 1008 many peasants  were subjected to abuse and attacks "because coca and cocaine  are in the same bag."    He said that the decree on the participation of peasants is  also pending.    Decree 22270 establishes the "equal" participation of  peasants and officials of the National Committee for Alternative  Development (Conadal), the Regional Committee for Alternative  Development (Coredal), and the Local Alternative Development  Committees (Colodal).    Tarui added: "We are demanding that equal participation in  this case be maintained. That is, five government  representatives, five peasant representatives, and one official  who in this case would be the government minister."</p>

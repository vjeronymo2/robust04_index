			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (15): Cautious toes dip into equity markets / Noting a shift from cash to capital markets in fleet financing Greek shipowners spent almost Dollars 3bn last year on acquiring some 400 secondhand ships, totalling 23m deadweight tons. The figures sound startling, even by shipping industry standards. What is more surprising, a high percentage of transactions were in cash, with no financing raised. The extent of Greek shipowners' liquidity is proverbial, but it cannot be accurately estimated, according to bankers. Yet few would dispute a market rumour that a well-known owner recently came up with enough cash to fund a new building order for three vessels. However, Greek owners less well provided with cash are more likely to raise funds for ship purchases through bank financing, often on more stringent terms than in the past. Spreads are now higher and loan periods shorter. Some lenders also attach a requirement to generate fee-paying business for the bank. Nevertheless, the unprecedented surge in sales and purchases by Greek owners in the past couple of years has generated concern about the cost of fleet renewal. There is growing interest in tapping both domestic and international capital markets for funds. So far, the shipowners' efforts to find new sources of financing have concerned debt rather than equity. Last year, Eletson Corporation, the Piraeus-based product carrier operator, launched the first public bond to be issued by a Greek shipping company, raising Dollars 140m in first preferred ship mortgage notes against six of its vessels. Priced to yield accrued interest of 9.25 per cent, the 10-year notes are not redeemable before 1998. The US offering, underwritten and sold by Citibank Securities, was more than twice oversubscribed. Credit agencies gave the bond a rating considered encouraging - BA2 from Moody's and BB from Standard and Poor's - given institutional investors' suspicions of the shipping industry. Eletson said it would use Dollars 100m of the funds raised to write down outstanding ship mortgages and the remainder as working capital. The company is considered a good risk because of the age of its 17-vessel fleet. With five new ships due to be delivered over the next two years and seven disposals of older vessels, the fleet will have an average age of 2.5 years, compared to an average of more than 10 years for the industry. However, only a few Greek companies are expected to tap the international capital market for long-term funding. Ms Marianna Moschou, general manager of Citibank Shipping Bank in Piraeus, says: 'Few companies will meet the prerequisites for a public offering, and even fewer will want to go through the gruelling procedures involved, including full disclosure and the due diligence process required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.' Shipowners worldwide raised only Dollars 1bn last year in the US market through public bond offerings, suggesting that they are still a fledgling instrument for the shipping industry. Nor are private placements common, although they are sometimes used in restructuring debt. Adriatic Tankers Shipping, which operates a mixed fleet of chemicals, product and crude oil carriers, completed a Dollars 80m private debt placement earlier this year. The 10-year facility, carrying a 9 per cent interest rate, was secured by first preferred mortgages on 20 of the company's vessels. Nevertheless, Greek shipowners are also dipping a cautious toe into the equity market. The Tsakos Shipping Group, which set up the US-listed Global Ocean Carriers, a bulk carrier operation for which the group acts as technical manager, now has another investment vehicle, listed on the Norwegian stock exchange. Shares in the Maritime Investment Fund, a tanker operation also managed by Tsakos, started trading on Oslo's small board at the end of 1993. Another manager, Stelmar Tankers Management, was set up in 1992 with the aim of going public once it acquires a track record that can attract investors. Trying to dispel the accepted image of shipping as a high-risk investment, Stelmar has geared its operation to the requirements of a stock market listing, acquiring Greece's first-ever ISO 9002 management qualification, together with its first certification under the International Ship Management Code. 'Going public is the way to raise money from the market. I'm not in favour of public debt issued by a private company,' says Mr Stelios Hadji-Ioannou, Stelmar's owner. The Athens Stock Exchange, despite its comparatively small size, is starting to attract passenger shipping companies. Two 'back door' entries were achieved through the acquisition by shipping concerns of holding groups already listed. One, Attica Enterprises, bought and sold a package of shares in Strintzis Lines, a ferry operator that has since obtained approval for a listing on its own account, and disposed of a chain of household goods stores before focusing on passenger shipping. It has placed a Dollars 146m order for two ro-ro ferries and has an option on building two more. The other, Cosmos Maritime, is a subsidiary of the Cosmos Group, with interests in textiles and food processing. It is controlled by Mr Dimitris Hatzis, a shipowner who has been diversifying in recent years. Cosmos Maritime indirectly links ocean-going vessels with the Athens exchange, through a co-operation agreement with the Monaco-based Vlasov group to handle shipbuilding and repair activities in Greece, together with bareboat charters on two dry cargo vessels. However, the Capital Markets Committee, the watchdog for the exchange, is tightening its regulations to prevent more shipping companies from following suit. While passenger shipping operators will be admitted to the bourse, though under more stringent conditions than they might have expected, the committee is reluctant to permit other shipping concerns to join the market. Strintzis Lines, which operates passenger ferries in the Adriatic and the Aegean, as well as a passenger line between Swansea and Cork, had to restructure its operation, increasing its liabilities, to secure approval for a Dr5.1bn public offering. There are problems, too, with Dane Shipping Lines, a joint stock company with a limited number of shareholders, which wants to raise Dr2.5bn through a flotation on the bourse. The company, based on the island of Rhodes, operates passenger ferries in the eastern Aegean islands. Dane is being forced to restructure after its original application for a listing was turned down.</p>

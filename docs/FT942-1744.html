			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Hundreds of companies in Czech sell-off The Czech Republic is to begin a big sell-off in the next two months of stakes in several hundred companies where the state remains a majority shareholder, Mr Roman Ceska, deputy privatisation minister and chairman of the National Property Fund, the state holding company, said yesterday. It is expected that up to a third of the Kc150bn (Pounds 3.5bn) worth of assets, involving mainly commercial and industrial companies in which the NPF retains a majority stake, will be offered for sale to domestic and foreign buyers by the end of this year. Some of the offers will be advertised internationally. Companies to be included in the sell-off include Chemicke Zavody Sokolov, one of the country's biggest chemical companies, in which the US company Dow Chemical attempted to buy a stake two years ago. The deal fell through after the two companies failed to agree a price, and the NPF has remained as the company's majority shareholder. Mr Ceska, who took over from Mr Tomas Jezek as NPF chairman 13 days ago, said the state intended to offer each stake in its entirety to a single buyer and sell to the highest bidder. The move is likely to be the last big sell-off by the government. Its voucher privatisation system, in which an estimated 6m Czechs bought vouchers enabling them to bid for shares in two tranches of companies being privatised, has so far resulted in the partial or complete privatisation of nearly 2,000 Czech enterprises, representing over 80 per cent of the country's economic activity.</p>

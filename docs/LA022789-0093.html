			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA MUSEUM EXHIBIT IS NOT QUITE 'FULL SPECTRUM'  </P> <P> Last weekend, at the College Art Assn. conference in San Francisco, I ran into  an old friend from graduate school who said wearily, "I never send my students  to museums anymore. You can learn everything you want to know about art from  slides."  </P> <P> It isn't likely that many people would agree with him. Looking at the actual  object created by an artist gives you a tangible appreciation of the way the  artist handles materials, not to speak of a true sense of scale and depth and  color.  </P> <P> But in an era of soaring art prices, museums are increasingly hard put to  acquire the works they need to fill the historical gaps in their collections.  </P> <P> That dilemma is apparent at the Laguna Art Museum, which is displaying selected  works from its collection through March 5. There, museum officials have never  had a big money tree to shake for acquisitions. A glance at the labels on the  art tells the story: Take away all the donations and the walls would be almost  bare.  </P> <P> The museum's "war chest," as director Charles Demarais calls it, now totals  $73,976 -- about enough to buy, say, a single Edward Ruscha painting. The  Contemporary Collectors Council has put together another $8,000. And these days  the Historical Collectors Council is using its funds to conserve the paintings  already in the collection rather than buying more.  </P> <P> Money is a sticking point, and potential donors are not necessarily likely to  give the museum what its heart desires. So Bolton Colburn, the curator of  collections, has had to do some fancy dancing to try to come up with a show  that sketches in the history of Southern California art. (Despite occasional  detours to the Bay Area, the show utterly fails even as a "skeletal" view -- in  Colburn's words -- of California art history.)  </P> <P> "The Full Spectrum" begins on the lower level of the museum, with 19th-Century  landscapes by newcomers to California who were awed by purple-mountain  majesties and other natural wonders great and small. Many of these paintings  are part of a single 1974 gift from the Carl S. Dentzel estate.  </P> <P> The self-taught painters of the early days are represented by Mary Bailey's  simple, matter-of-fact view of a wooded campsite from 1840. (Someday, it might  be appropriate to acquire at least one painting that memorializes the Spanish  heritage of California's other early settlers.) Then come the academy-trained  East Coast visitors. In his dryly descriptive style, Thomas Hill picks out a  bear motionless on a log amid fallen timbers in Yosemite. Three nondescript  William Keiths are lined up on one wall like the Three Bears -- tiny, bigger,  biggest.  </P> <P> After this, the deluge: canvas after canvas by the so-called California  Impressionists and their somewhat bolder followers, the plein air painters. The  usual suspects are here -- Guy Rose, William Wendt, Edgar Payne, Franz  Bischoff, Elmer Wachtel, George Gardner Symons, Jean Mannheim, Hanson Puthuff  -- doing their thing with bright color and bouncy brush strokes in honor of  spring and sunlight and flowers and hills and trees.  </P> <P> However derivative and bland most of these works are, the group as a whole  illustrates the values held dear by painters in a particular time and place.  History is not only made of great moments. But the offerings get stingier just  at the point when California art really began to give the rest of the world a  run for its money.  </P> <P> During the 1930s and '40s, Lorser Feitelson, his wife Helen Lundeberg, Karl  Benjamin and the Dynaton group (Lee Mullican, Gordon Onslow Ford and others)  were key figures in progressive Southern California painting.  </P> <P> But the museum's holdings either skip over these artists entirely (no Dynaton  folks at all) or consist of their work from later years, albeit in such fine  examples as Feitelson's "Magical Space Forms" from 1953 (in which oddly shaped,  brightly colored flat forms poke toward the center of the painting) and  Lundeberg's "Sundown Shadow" from 1983, which literally pauses at the threshold  separating realism from abstraction.  </P> <P> The collection is also deficient in strong work from the '50s and '60s, when  Southern California art really started on its roll. From these years, the most  significant (albeit wildly different) pieces are "No. 4," a sober canvas by the  Los Angeles master of geometric abstraction, John McLaughlin, and DeWain  Valentine's 1964 insouciant "Pink Top."  </P> <P> That piece is one of very few sculptures on view, and one suspects the problem  is lack of inventory rather than lack of space. (The importance of video,  "light and space" and installation art in Southern California is also  impossible to discern from this show.) But the absence of photographs comes as  a surprise, given the museum's ownership of vintage images by Paul Outerbridge  and a number of good contemporary examples in this medium.  </P> <P> Smart picks from the past two decades include pieces by John McCracken, Ed  Ruscha, Jay Phillips, Allan McCollum and Jud Fine, but the show reflects  virtually no consciousness of the steeper slopes of conceptual or postmodern  art. Not a single recent work on view could seriously be called adventurous or  difficult -- including the latest acquisition, Roland Reiss' "Thrower" from  1987, a mockingly Brancusi-style sculpture of a beefy arm grasping a football.  </P> <P> Overall, the modern and contemporary works include some valid curiosities, like  a painting of three violinists by David Park (later to become one of the Bay  Area's foremost artists). But considering the wonderful things that were  happening in Southern California art, too much wall space has been given over  to indifferent work, mostly by artists who happen to have lived in Laguna  Beach.  </P> <P> Judged by its collection, the curse of provincialism still haunts the Laguna  Art Museum. Figuring out how to charm important works out of the hands of  private collectors is sure to be a major task in the years ahead.  </P> <P>  "The Full Spectrum" remains on view through March 5 at the Laguna Art Museum,  307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday  through Sunday. Admission is $2 general, $1 for students and seniors.  Information: (714) 494-6531.  </P> <P> </P></p>

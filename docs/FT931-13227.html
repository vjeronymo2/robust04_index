			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Issue taken with minister on meaning of judgment Sir, May I take issue with Michael Forsyth's assertion (Letters, January 22) that the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Rask v ISS Kantineservice A/S says nothing new about the potential of the EC Acquired Rights Directive to apply when a service is contracted out. Mr Forsyth is right to say that the judgment does not alter the principle that employees only have rights under the directive if the undertaking in which they work is transferred as a going concern. This is, however, an altogether too superficial analysis. The real importance of the judgment lies in the guidelines which the court laid down for determining what amounts to 'the transfer of an undertaking as a going concern'. Those guidelines will have a dual significance in the context of contracting-out. First, the court said that a service which has previously been provided in-house may amount to 'an undertaking' if it forms an identifiable part of the employer's operations. Second, the court indicated that, where a service is sufficiently self-contained, the assignment of operational control over it to an outside contractor may of itself amount to 'a transfer', even though the employer retains ultimate responsibility. The latter situation has traditionally been regarded by the UK courts as involving a mere contract for the performance of services rather than the transfer of an undertaking. Although the court left it to the Danish judge to apply these guidelines to the facts of the case, it nevertheless made clear its view that there could be a transfer of an undertaking where an employer contracts out the management of an in-house service (in the Rask case, a staff canteen). Every case will, of course, depend on its own particular facts. There can, however, be little doubt that, if the contracting-out of a staff canteen can amount to the transfer of an undertaking, the potential of the directive to apply when services in central and local government are contracted out is very great indeed. Certainly it can no longer be said, as Mr Forsyth did (Letters, November 30), that 'there is not normally a transfer of an undertaking in these circumstances'.

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> LELAND PLANE STILL MISSING  </P> <P> Ethiopian police and farmers with flashlights searched a remote mountain area  overnight for the missing plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 13  other people. A daylong aerial search was suspended at dusk and will be resumed  today. The Twin Otter aircraft disappeared Monday on its way from Addis Ababa  to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border with Sudan, about 300 miles to the  west. Leland, 44, has taken a keen interest in Africa's refugee problem.  President Bush, saying Leland was on his sixth humanitarian mission in that  part of the world, promised that his Administration will do all it can to help  find the missing plane with Leland, eight other Americans and five Ethiopians.  </P></p>

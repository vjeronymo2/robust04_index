			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 28 May (EFE) -- Drug trafficking has  permeated all Mexican political structures and has corrupted  federal, state, and municipal officials who commercialize the  application of justice, Eduardo Valle, who resigned from the  post of adviser to the attorney general for this reason, has  told EFE.    When asked by EFE if he is afraid that drug traffickers  might  make an attempt on his life for making these accusations, he  answered: "If they want to kill you, they will. I walk around  without protection, without bullet-proof vests or bodyguards."    The Attorney General's Office (PGR) was able to obtain the  most complete information on drug trafficking in Mexico, but it  was unable to eradicate drug trafficking because government  structures at all levels are corrupted by drug money, the former  adviser said.    "Narcopower" has deformed the economy; it is a cancer that  has generated economic, financial, and political dependence,  which instead of producing goods has created serious problems  and distortions ultimately affecting honest businessmen, Valle  said.    "The struggle against drug trafficking is a problem like  physics; there is no absolute vacuum, when one group is  eliminated another immediately takes its place," he affirmed.    "Narcopower" has permeated the political structure; the  three  most important drug trafficking groups -- the groups of Amado  Carrillo, Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego -- which are  accused of approximately 35 killings and about 200 murders, have  a bearing on the main decisions of the country, the former  adviser revealed.    Eduardo Valle, who was a leader in the 1968 student movement  and in the Mexican Workers Party, said no one can knowingly  sponsor an initiative against drug trafficking because if he  does, he will die.    Valle, known in political circles by his student nickname,  "El Buho," explained he will leave the PGR without any  protection. He has been a federal deputy and president of the  Union of Democratic Journalists.    "Neither bullet-proof vests nor several bodyguards; my only  protection is my fellow journalists," Valle remarked. "I came  to the PGR committed to fighting against drug trafficking.  Regrettably, I was criticized for that decision, but they must  know the problem is not where you are, but what do you do, how  committed you are," Valle added.    "I came to fight without hesitation against drug trafficking  networks, and I am leaving because it is impossible to eradicate  these groups, since they have infiltrated all sectors," Valle  asserted. He added it would be suicidal and a massacre would  occur if there were an attempt to try and enter the domains of  the mafia without the support of all police forces.    Valle said at least 10 drug cartels are operating in Mexico,  although the most important ones are three that maintain ties  with the Cali Cartel (Colombia) and the incipient Peru Cartel.  These organizations handle thousands of millions of dollars.    The Arellano Felix organization has links to the most  important drug trafficking mafias in the world, with Europe, and  with the group of Asian nations called the "golden triangle of  drug trafficking" (Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma), Valle noted.    Drug trafficking organizations have employed government  officials at all levels, representatives of the legislative and  judiciary branches, and representatives of Mexican security  forces, Valle expressed.    During the "golden period," between 1988 and 1989, the  Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego introduced six tons  of cocaine weekly into the United States. It is estimated over  100 tons were introduced annually.    The Matamoros Cartel security chief is former Navy officer  Rafael Olvera, "El Rafles," who heads a small army of 70  well-equipped and well-armed men.    Pedro Aspe Armella, Mexico's secretary of finance and public  credit, has admitted while in the United States that the  influence of drug trafficking is in all structures of political  and social life in Mexico. "And the secretary came up short  because drug trafficking not only infiltrates the federal  government, but also state and municipal governments as well as  national legislative, executive, and judicial branches," the  former adviser remarked.    Drug trafficking groups in Mexico have grown and handle not  only tons of cocaine, but also hundreds of tons of marijuana  that are planted throughout the country.    Valle regretted that the presidential candidates have not  properly addressed this cancer and have not presented a  political project proposing an all-out war against drug  trafficking. So far only church representatives have demanded  an all-out struggle against drug trafficking.</p>

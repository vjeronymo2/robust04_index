			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on the barbaric  massacre perpetrated by Zionist settlers against our kinsfolk at  the holy Ibrahimi Mosuqe of Hebron.    Under the headline "The Fingerprints of Crime and Blood,"  the  newspaper AL-BA'TH says: In mid-Ramadan and while worshipers  were prostrating during the dawn prayers at the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque, the Israelis' treacherous bullets killed and wounded  hundreds of worshipers in a grisly massacre that has dumbfounded  people everywhere.    AL-BA'TH adds: The massacre is a new chapter in the  Zionists' terrorist record, which is replete with all kinds of  killings, slayings, and crimes perpetrated over the past 50  years.    The paper holds Israeli rulers responsible for the massacre,  because it is they who recruited and armed the settlers.  Moreover, it is they who disarmed the Palestinian Arabs and  prevented them from carrying even kitchen knives so they can be  easy prey for these hateful vagabonds.    The paper goes on to say: Israeli hands were stained with  the blood of victims in the massacres committed in Qibyah, Dayr  Yasin, Bahr al-Baqar, the al-Aqsa Mosque, Sabra, and Shatila,  and many other places. Now, these criminal hands have been  stained with worshipers' blood at the Ibrahimi Mosque.    The paper wonders: Can there be more heinous and dastardly  criminal murders than those being supported by Israeli rulers,  who profess to be advocates of peace and civilized conduct,  while attacking Arabs with weapons and instigating strangers  whom they brought from the farthest points in the globe?  Israeli rulers have turned the settlements into safe havens for  murderers and criminals, who are killing defenseless and  innocent people in cold blood.    AL-BA'TH says: Since the convening of the Madrid conference,  and throughout all phases of the peace talks, Israeli rulers,  and the Rabin government in particular, have been adamant in  their refusal to discuss the issue of settlements, arguing that  this issue must be discussed only during the final status  negotiations.    The paper wonders: Does this not provide glaring evidence  that the Israeli rulers are harboring criminal intentions to  evict the residents of the territories through massacres,  displacement, eviction, and killings, so there will be nothing  to negotiate on during the later stage of the negotiations?    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH wonders: What kind of  peace can be achieved when criminal slayings continue to be  carried out? What kind of coexistence can there be with these  killers? For the fingerprints of crime, blood, and shame are  engraved on their foreheads. Besides, the world community is  convinced, now more than ever before, that there can be no  stability, security, or peace in the region unless the Israeli  occupation is dismantled, and unless the Palestinian Arab people  regain their right to self- determination.    For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The heinous  massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers inside the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque confirms for the one thousandth time that Israel  is a racist hostile entity that flouts all humanitarian and  ethical values. The reality is that this massacre is the  epitome of the law of the jungle upheld by the Tel Aviv rulers,  under the very nose of the world community. They feel immune  from any punishment.    The paper adds: The Yitzhaq Rabin government is responsible  for this massacre. Blame cannot be placed on an insane settler,  nor can it be put on an unpremeditated individual act. For had  it not encouraged and endorsed such a criminal act, the Rabin  government would not have ordered its troops to kill Arabs who  took to the streets throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip in the immediate aftermath of the massacre to express  their sadness and anger.    AL-THAWRAH notes that the entire world community has  condemned this heinous crime. Statements and communiques  condemning this heinous crime and urging measures to prevent a  recurrence of what has happened have been issued by various  world capitals.    The paper wonders: Are statements enough to deter Israel and  curb its belligerence, and to return it to its senses? Is the  use of condemnations and denunciations the proper means of  dealing with an entity that flaunts its disobedience of  international legitimacy?    AL-THAWRAH urges the world community and the UN Security  Council to go beyond the issuance of condemnatory and  denunciatory statements to institute new firm formulas and  measures to make Israel understand that it cannot remain immune  from deterrent punitive measures indefinitely.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The issue is now  to be decided by the Security Council. It is hoped that the  Security Council will pass a clear and unequivocal resolution  providing for the protection of the Palestinians and disarming  the settlers, and expressing a determination to see the relevant  previous Security Council resolutions implemented. Such a  resolution must also express strong support for the peace  process, and underscore the removal of Israeli obstacles  standing in the way of peace efforts. This is because without  the achievement of just and comprehensive peace that returns  rights to their lawful owners, the region will remain fertile  ground for violence, chaos, and terrorism.    The newspaper TISHRIN also comments on the same issue, but  from a different angle.    The paper says: It is no coincidence that the occupied  Syrian Golan settlers council has expressed full support for  Rabin's policy, which is extending support and backing to the  settlement drive in the occupied Syrian territories. This stand  by the settlers council was also prompted by Rabin's frustration  with the Washington talks, and also by the efforts he has made  to block a just and comprehensive peace in the region.    The paper adds: It is Rabin who armed the settlers, and  authorized the deployment of joint army-settler patrols. It is  Rabin who blinded himself to the launching of an army of  settlers, and to their recent continuous threats to perpetrate  massacres if the Palestinians fail to quickly vacate their lands  and abandon their property.    The paper goes on to say: Rabin has consecrated settlement  activities as a constant pillar of his government's policy. The  Washington peace talks ran into the intransigence of the Israeli  negotiating teams. Meanwhile, Rabin was expanding settlements  in the West Bank and the Golan and building new settlements.    TISHRIN maintains that peace is the antithesis of settlement  activities, and that the achievement of peace is contingent upon  the dismantlement of the settlements and the evacuation of  settlers.    TISHRIN touches on the Washington peace talks, saying that  they are moving in a vicious circle, because the Israeli  Government is opposed to withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories. Besides, the paper says, the efforts made by many  international parties have failed to persuade Israeli rulers  that peace is far more important than settlement activities and  territorial expansion. Had Rabin responded favorably to the  Arab demand for withdrawal from the occupied territories, peace  would have been close at hand, and the Washington talks would  have made great progress along the path of achieving just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    However, Rabin, the paper adds, has chosen to lend deaf ears  to the calls for true and durable peace, and dragged the  Palestinian negotiators to a flawed and lame agreement that  consecrates occupation and settlement activities. The end  result has been the horrifying Friday massacre, which killed  more than 60 innocent Palestinians, and wounded hundreds of  others.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: By its perpetration  of subsequent crimes and its rejection of the requirements of  just, durable, and permanent peace, Zionism is addressing a  message to the world community, through this massacre, telling  it that it has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its racist  and aggressive colors, and that it will proceed with its  criminal schemes, even if thousands of innocent victims are to  fall.</p>

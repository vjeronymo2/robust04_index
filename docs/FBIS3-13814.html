			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned tonight that Israel is prepared to  discuss a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the  negotiations on that issue are completed. Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres told today's cabinet meeting that 'Arafat has in  fact agreed to resume the talks even though he has not admitted  it publicly. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen gives  us the political picture:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] I was surprised, Yitzhaq Rabin  said, I did not realize how widespread the support for Barukh  Goldstein's abhorrent act is among the settlers. The government  did not make any new decisions today although such decisions are  due to be made. Yesterday, we reported on the Norwegian  compromise paper, which the foreign minister confirmed today.  Mr. Peres said Israel is ready to agree to a Palestinian police  force being deployed in Hebron. A senior political source said  that the powers of the Palestinian police force will be wider  than they had prior to the intifadah. A number of ministers,  including Tourism Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, again raised the demand  for a full or partial evacuation of Jews from Hebron. Police  Minister Moshe Shahal expressed support for such a move.    [Shahal] It is easier to defend the Jewish population if it  is concentrated together.    [Rosen] Inside the cabinet room, this demand led to a  confrontation between ministers.    [Environment Minister Yosi Sarid] The government will soon  have to make very important decisions on the settlers'  deployment inside Hebron, which is very dangerous and very  problematic.    [Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish] I fear a  situation where some of the ministers, especially the Meretz  ministers, raise new proposals which will persuade 'Arafat to  continue to delay.    [Rosen] Israel is nevertheless going to meet the PLO half  way. What is on the agenda now is speeding up the withdrawal  from the Gaza Strip. The area is already being evacuated. On  the prime minister's desk is a proposal, which Rabin has not  ruled out, that the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal take place  concurrently with the negotiations and prior to the completion  of the talks in order to meet 'Arafat's demand to show signs of  withdrawal on 13 April.    [Peres] Israel is ready to speed up the negotiations and the  implementation of the agreement.    [Rosen] The ongoing curfew and the closure disturb the  ministers. Police Minister Shahal suggested continuing the  closure until after Independence Day but urged compensating the  residents.    [Shahal] The amount must be reasonable. I suggest between  15 and 20 million shekels a month.    [Rosen] The government forecasts tough talks in Tunis.  Although the foreign minister told the cabinet today that  'Arafat has in fact already decided to return to the talks, he  just has not said so publicly. [end recording]</p>

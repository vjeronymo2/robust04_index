			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Your article on the death penalty ("Degraded by a Lust for Death," by William  J. Wood, Op-Ed Page, Feb. 7) is not only outrageous but also insulting.  </P> <P> How dare you characterize proponents of capital punishment as having a "lust  for death"? Your sanctimonious opposition doesn't give you the right to slander  those with whom you disagree!  </P> <P> Furthermore, Father Wood's hand-wringing discourse adds nothing to the debate  over capital punishment. I was astounded to read that "our democratic  experiment is such a failure that we have to resort to legalized killing in  order to protect ourselves," and that violent crimes "are symptomatic of a very  dysfunctional society." What utter garbage! We are not to blame for the  atrocious crimes of people like Robert Alton Harris -- they are responsible for  their own actions, and deserve to pay the ultimate price for their horrible  deeds.  </P> <P> GREGORY J. WAHL  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

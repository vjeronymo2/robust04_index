			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Nippon Steel in US rail venture Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, has agreed to take a 10 per cent equity stake in New CF&amp;I of the US, a subsidiary of Oregon Steel, and provide its subsidiary, CF&amp;I, with the technology and facilities to manufacture head-hardened rail. The deal will enable Nippon Steel to overcome the adverse impact of the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and to deflect US anti-dumping charges. The arrangement will enable CF&amp;I to supply its customers in the railway industry with a leading product. The venture comes two years after CF&amp;I joined Bethlehem Steel in bringing charges against Japanese steelmakers of dumping rail in the US. Those charges were dismissed in June, 1992 by the US International Trade Commission. Head-hardened rail, which is longer lasting than ordinary rail, is expected to see greater demand in the years ahead. However, most US steelmakers, including CF&amp;I, do not have the technology to manufacture head-hardened rail. Nippon Steel said that the agreement would allow it to sell its product in the US without having to worry about dumping charges. The yen's high appreciation has meant that Japanese steelmakers exporting product to the US will be forced to raise their prices significantly if they want to avoid anti-dumping charges.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall, environment correspondent: </F> "Government Urged To Cut Benzene Levels"]    [Text] Britons are breathing in potentially dangerous  levels of a carcinogenic chemical, the Government admitted  yesterday as it published recommendations for limits on benzene  in air.    But a limit that ensured nobody was exposed to hazardous  amounts could not be achieved overnight, scientific advisers  said.    Yesterday they called for an interim level on benzene  concentrations in the air of five parts per billion (ppb)  averaged over the year but urged the Government to plan a limit  soon of one part per billion.    At the moment, somebody breathing London's air is inhaling  amounts of benzene equivalent to smoking about 15 cigarettes a  day.    Professor Anthony Seaton, chairman of the independent panel  on air quality standards, which has recommended the limits, said  they had taken a pragmatic approach because some people might be  more at risk from benzene than others. "Because of the  uncertainties and because it is a genotoxic carcinogen, one  which hits the DNA, it was felt the less benzene in the air the  better," he said.    The decision to act over benzene follows growing public  alarm  over car-related air pollution. Studies in animals and humans  have shown that benzene, 78 percent of which comes from car  fumes in Britain, accumulates in bone marrow and brain tissue  and causes leukaemias. In very high doses it is lethal.    Robert Atkins, the environment minister, said yesterday that  daily bulletins on benzene levels would be issued from 12 new  monitoring stations.    Environment Department officials said yesterday they would  also be publishing a consultation document on how they planned  to meet the panel's targets. They said meeting the interim, 5  ppb limit should be possible but admitted that some parts of  Britain might still exceed the guidelines.    Better engine designs, tougher MoT emission tests and the  phasing in of catalytic converters should achieve reductions in  benzene levels.    However, meeting the tougher level would be harder as the  number of cars on the roads overwhelmed technological  improvements. They said a variety of measures would be necessary.    Professor Seaton, of the University of Aberdeen's medical  school, said diesel cars were not the answer. Although they  produce less benzene, they produce more of a range of pollutants  also linked with cancer including particulates and 1.3 butadiene.    The recommendations on benzene levels are the first of a  series to be produced by the panel, covering up to 100 air  pollutants, many of which are linked with car fumes.    Figures in the report show that London's air occasionally  breaks the interim limit and often breaks the stricter one of 1  ppb. During 1991 and 1992, for example, measurements in  Knightsbridge showed an average annual concentration of 6 parts  per billion; in December 1991 concentrations peaked at around 13  ppb. Rural levels at Harwell, Oxfordshire, fluctuated between  1.7 and 0.4 ppb.    Other research has indicated that benzene levels inside cars  are higher than outside. Professor Seaton said: "If you are in a  traffic jam with the heater sucking in the exhaust of the car in  front, it is quite plausible you can get higher levels of all  sorts of things."

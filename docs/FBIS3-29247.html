The SDPJ is the largest force in the seven-party coalition  and Kubo is the party's secretary general. He did not directly  refer to Takemura during an address at the Foreign  Correspondents Club of Japan but it was clear he had Takemura in  mind.    Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies but  their relationship has deteriorated to the point that they do  not speak to each other unless they have to.    Hosokawa told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that he intends to  reshuffle the cabinet that has been in place since he took power  in August. He said he would discuss the matter with other  leaders in his coalition administration.    Takemura heads Sakigake (Harbinger), one of the partners in  the coalition. Well-placed sources said it was possible that  Takemura could be offered another cabinet position.    Kubo, one of the coalition's chief policymakers, told  reporters that Takemura's removal would weaken the makeup of the  cabinet.    He urged Hosokawa to be "very persuasive" in demonstrating  the need for a reshuffle of the 21-member cabinet during the  current Diet session.    Kubo, who became SDPJ secretary general last September,  cited  deliberations for the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993  ending in March and the national budget for fiscal 1994 starting  April 1994 as examples of the busy Diet schedule.    Kubo said he could not understand why Hosokawa intends to  reshuffle the cabinet and he urged the coalition parties to  unite in tackling tricky issues facing the government.    Takemura is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the prime  minister's proposal for a new national welfare tax.    Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito  co-leader  Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito,  over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly  asked Hosokawa to dismiss Takemura.    Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice at the time, political  sources said. Ozawa and Ichikawa are the chief strategists in  the coalition.</p>

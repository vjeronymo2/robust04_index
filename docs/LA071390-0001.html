			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO REMAP PLAN DELAYED BY U.S. JUDGE;  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING: A MAGISTRATE BARS THE CITY COUNCIL FROM ACTING TO ADOPT A PLAN  THAT HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY LATINO ACTIVISTS, PRODDING THE COUNCIL TO REVERSE  ITSELF.  </P> <P> Throwing a redistricting plan into legal and political disarray, a federal  magistrate Thursday delayed San Diego City Council action on the proposal and  threatened further court intervention unless the council reverses itself.  </P> <P> In a two-page order issued late Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue barred  the council from proceeding next week, as scheduled, toward formal adoption of  a redistricting plan that has been sharply attacked by Latino activists, some  community leaders and others since the council tentatively passed it Monday.  </P> <P> Beyond prohibiting the council from acting on any redistricting plan until July  23, McCue's order also bluntly warns of further court action unless the council  approves an alternative proposal that Latino leaders argue better protects  minority voting rights.  </P> <P> McCue's ruling, which concluded a third consecutive day of frenzied maneuvering  in the case, shifts the focus in the political-legal contretemps back to City  Hall, where the council now faces a grim choice: Either approve a redistricting  plan that, as Monday's action made clear, is opposed by a majority of the  members, or return to court for a potentially lengthy, costly battle that could  end with the city's plan being declared unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Thursday's developments brought the principals in the bitter redistricting  dispute -- the outgrowth of a 1988 San Diego County Chicano Federation lawsuit  challenging the legality of the city's electoral system -- to a precipice that  all had hoped to avoid, and, in the process, raised as many questions as it  answered.  </P> <P> Some council members questioned whether McCue's order, as a practical matter,  curtails their prerogative to alter the redistricting plan proposed, in  accordance with the terms of the lawsuit's preliminary settlement, by a  citizen's advisory board. Dissatisfaction with that plan, which some argue was  tilted toward pro-growth Republicans, led to the evolution of the other  proposal that was tentatively passed, 5 to 4, by the council Monday.  </P> <P> Would even minor changes to the advisory board's map to accommodate two members  whose new or future homes are outside their districts' proposed new boundaries  subject the council to a court challenge? And, if Monday's council majority is  willing to engage in brinkmanship, what is to stop it from simply repeating its  initial decision on or after July 23?  </P> <P> "Who knows?" Chicano Federation attorney Patricia Meyer asked rhetorically.  "The only thing certain is that, if the council approves any map other than the  one from the (advisory board), then we're going to wind up back in court."  </P> <P> Rather than view McCue's order as a threat, some council members -- notably,  those on the losing side of Monday's vote -- characterized it as an opportunity  to reevaluate a critical decision made in what even some supporters conceded  was an unorthodox, clumsy fashion that embittered many.  </P> <P> "This gives a council that stepped out and did something stupid a chance to  rectify it," said Councilman Ron Roberts, who voted against the plan proposed  Monday by Councilman John Hartley. "It sounds like the judge is sending us a  signal: 'Guys, work this out and save yourselves some big problems.' "  </P> <P> Councilman Bob Filner, whom many regard as the primary behind-the-scenes  architect of the plan passed Monday, did not return telephone calls Thursday.  None of the four other council members who support that redistricting map --  Abbe Wolfsheimer, John Hartley, Wes Pratt and Linda Bernhardt -- could be  reached Thursday night.  </P> <P> Under McCue's order, the council will reconsider both the advisory board's plan  and the one tentatively approved Monday. Furthermore, if the council adopts any  plan other than that proposed by the citizens' task force, the court will  review it to determine whether it violates an earlier settlement in the case.  </P> <P> "This court is of the opinion that the issues raised by this action are of  grave importance to the city of San Diego and its citizens as a whole," McCue  wrote. "Should the council adopt a plan other than the (advisory board) plan,  this court shall review the record to determine if that plan is in conformity  with the settlement agreement."  </P> <P> In its review of both plans, McCue ordered the council to give both "de novo  consideration," a legal term meaning, as Meyer explained, "to start anew."  </P> <P> "We're starting fresh, from scratch -- or at least as much as possible," Meyer  said. "Obviously, I'm very pleased, because the court is saying, 'Let's look at  this one more time.' "  </P> <P> Kenneth So, a deputy city attorney, was less voluble upon leaving McCue's  chambers, saying simply that he had "repeated our objections" that court  intervention at this point was improper because the redistricting plan had not  yet won final council approval.  </P> <P> In its legal arguments, the Chicano Federation has raised objections of both  style and substance to Monday's redistricting plan, faulting how the council  acted on it almost as much as the plan's content -- in particular, its dilution  of the Latino population in the 8th District.  </P> <P> Under the agreement settling the first phase of the group's 1988 lawsuit, the  city guaranteed that the Chicano Federation and other minority community  representatives would have a meaningful role in the development of this year's  redistricting plan. However, by rejecting the advisory board's map, developed  over months of public hearings and substituting Hartley's proposal -- only  hours after it was publicized -- the city displayed "bad faith" and violated  the settlement, attorney Meyer argues.  </P> <P> Hartley's plan reduces the Latino composition of Filner's 8th District from the  advisory board's proposed 52.2% to at most 51% -- and perhaps, Meyer says, to  as low as 45% -- and dramatically alters the configuration of a number of other  districts. Based on the estimates of some City Hall insiders, the plan would  change council representation for up to 300,000 San Diegans.  </P> <P> Stressing legislative, if not political, technicalities, city attorneys  emphasized that Monday's vote was not definitive, noting that it was only the  first of several steps toward the redistricting plan's adoption. The Chicano  Federation and others, they argued, would have ample opportunity to comment on  the plan -- and try to alter it more to their liking -- before it was formally  approved.  </P> <P> Meyer, however, characterized the remaining legislative steps as "more a matter  of form than content," and Tuesday asked U.S. District Judge John Rhoades to  block the council from enacting Monday's plan. In response, city attorneys  argued that it would be premature for the judge to consider such a request  until the plan was formally adopted.  </P> <P> Seeking to circumvent that procedural impasse, Rhoades tried to turn back the  clock Thursday by suggesting that the San Diego City Council nullify Monday's  tentative approval and repeat its debate on the redistricting plan next week.  In essence, Rhoades' suggestion asked both the council and the Chicano  Federation to act as if Monday's vote never occurred, thereby allowing more  time for public comment.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's possible to go back and rewrite history, especially if  people's minds are already made up," Meyer responded skeptically.  </P> <P> Timing provided another knotty obstacle to Rhoades' suggestion. Assistant City  Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick, noting that 24 hours' advance notice is required for  any special council meeting, questioned whether the council could even be  assembled to consider retracting Monday's action before a planned Friday court  hearing.  </P> <P> Faced with that riddle, Rhoades sent the two sides to McCue for mediation.  After separate morning and afternoon sessions, McCue issued his order, which  also canceled several previously planned court hearings and scheduled a July 24  status conference.  </P> <P> As a result, the critical question now becomes whether any of the five council  members who supported Hartley's plan changes his vote on July 23 to avert a  showdown, or whether that majority remains intact. Though concerned about the  latter possibility, Chicano Federation executive Jess Haro said after  Thursday's court action that he believes growing public pressure may prompt a  council retreat from Monday's action.  </P> <P> "This gives them two weeks to reflect on the action they took," Haro said. "I  think that might change some minds."  </P></p>

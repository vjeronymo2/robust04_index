			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Smilowicz: "Professionals or Bunglers?; </F> Politicians and Journalists Do Not Think Highly of Each Other"]    [Text]Television journalists agree that a majority of  politicians do not know how to present their views in front of  the camera. But what they do know how to do, is to pressure  television and blame it for the politicians' negative media  image.    "Politicians have major problems in communicating what they  have to say. As a general rule, it is hard to make them provide  concise statements that would be within the time limit they have  been assigned" -- says Adam Pieczynski, chief of "Wiadomosci"  [main television newscast]. He adds that because television has  to cut out some of the material (which is necessary in such  cases), it makes television information programs vulnerable to  the accusation of manipulating politicians.    Piotr Zaremba, chief of the news department of Polish  Television's Channel 1, agrees with the view: "There are very  few politicians who are able to communicate their thoughts  succinctly and appropriately" -- Zaremba notes.    According to him, there are no more than a handful of  political activists who come through well on television -- he  lists Ryszard Bugaj, Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Kazimierz  Ujazdowski.    "From among the political parties, politicians for the  Democratic Left Alliance definitely know best how to present  themselves on television. It is clear that they have worked on  their statements to ensure that they are concise, and without a  tone of aggression or holding something against somebody" --  Zaremba says. But when it comes to politicians for the Polish  Peasant Party, Zaremba says they portray themselves much worse.    "They do not know how to act in front of the camera, they  are  embarrassed and shy. Their bad image is later explained with  television's alleged dislike of them" -- Zaremba says.    "My assessment of politicians' capability to present  themselves on television is a `C minus'" -- says Wiadomosci's  Tomasz Lis. He adds that he is bothered by the fact that  politicians do not understand the rules governing television or  what the viewers expect from it. "A politician for the  coalition proposes time-slots for the government in prime time.  He does not understand the disastrous effect this may have both  for him and for television's image" -- Lis says. In his view,  the current pressures exerted on television may cause a loss of  its credibility which has been worked on so hard over the past  four years.    Piotr Zaremba also agrees with the view that politicians do  not understand the rules governing television: "Recently, the  `Convention' program was taken off the television schedule. In  it, representatives of a few political parties spoke out, and it  was broadcast on Friday evenings. The program was very poorly  made and its audience was at zero level. But its elimination  caused massive protests by various parties -- mainly from  outside parliament -- to the effect that the last place from  which they can address society, is being taken away from them.  This is proof of a complete lack of understanding the fact that  in order to address viewers, one must first get their attention"  -- Zaremba says.</p>

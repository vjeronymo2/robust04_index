			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Zinc prices moved ahead on the LME on good buying and short covering, with three-month metal ending just below Dollars 1,159.75 a tonne on the kerb. Traders said the Dollars 1,160 level marked the start of an expected band of resistance stretching up to Dollars 1,180 which could halt the uptrend unless fresh news of consumer demand emerges to support the higher prices. Nickel prices consolidated just below 4 1/2-month highs struck earlier on continued investment fund buying. Dealers said the market had absorbed Tuesday's downward reaction, as well as bouts of hedge-selling, and remained on target to test upside objectives above Dollars 8,000 a tonne for three-month metal. The market is waiting to see if German steelworkers go on strike. The results of a ballot on Sunday are expected on Friday January 31. A strike would reduce demand from nickel's key end-use sector. Gold eased on the London bullion market. Dealers said the market was looking tired after once again failing to make inroads into stiff resistance around Dollars 358 to Dollars 361.50 a troy ounce. It could drift back to test support at Dollars 355. Some concern appeared to be edging into the market that the metal might retreat to Dollars 352-Dollars 353 if a renewed rally was not forthcoming in the short term. Compiled from Reuters</p>

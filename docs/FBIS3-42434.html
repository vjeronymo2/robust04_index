			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article under the "Topic of the Week" </F> rubric: "Security Becoming a Topic of Speculation"]    [Text] It seems that international and domestic events  alike had conspired to take a back seat during the sleepy  holiday period at the beginning of the year, only to burst forth  uncontrollably last week. It was then that the new parliament  began work and the Russian Government was reorganized. There  was also the NATO Council session in Brussels whose decisions  directly affect Russia. As well, of course, as the U.S.  President's visit, which not only comprised talks with Boris  Yeltsin but also the more or less sensational tripartite meeting  involving Leonid Kravchuk.    I have no doubt that the opening of the Federal Assembly has  the greatest significance for the country. At the same time I  do not think that what is presently taking place in both  chambers really submits itself to analysis. At the moment,  whichever way you look at it, we have the same confusion and  struggle as before, but not so much between political policies  as personal ambitions.    At the same time, the week's events point to one fairly  alarming and completely developed trend in international  relations. What is more, it appeared in the midst of events  which, paradoxically, were for the most part fairly positive.  What I mean is the approval in Brussels of the U.S.  "Partnership for Peace" project; as well as the signing in  Moscow of the tripartite documents, which, in the opinion of one  high-ranking Russian diplomat, should finally draw a line under  the question of the fate of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian  territory.    NATO has indeed proposed an extremely wise solution to the  problems of the security of East European states. Of those  states which demanded their immediate admission to the North  Atlantic bloc, attributing this demand to the growing threat  from Russia which, they claim, might emerge as an imperial  force. But several statements by leaders of East European  countries give reason for caution by dint of their hysterical  fervor and the fact that they are clearly out of touch with the  situation as it is. I must remind you that the Polish President  stated that a refusal by the West to produce a clear plan and  schedule for his country's admission to the North Atlantic bloc  would be a "great tragedy" which may give rise to a "second  Yugoslavia" in Europe. All this leads to the conclusion that  there are considerations behind these attempts to force their  way into NATO which bear no direct relation to problems of  security.    In my view a strange kind of inferiority complex can be seen  here. After the Warsaw Treaty and CEMA ceased to exist, the  East European states "cast off their Soviet chains" and  discovered to their surprise that they were of no great interest  to the outside world as partners. They have ended up on the  sidelines of the main European and global processes. For  example, no room was found for them in the "single Europe" which  for the moment remains restricted to West Europe. The countries  of the European Union, in creating a single economic area, are  painstakingly surrounding it with a barrier of taxes, tariffs,  and other restrictions. They certainly do not intend to allow  any outsiders in. Other economically developed states like, for  example, the United States or Japan, are showing even less  interest in cooperation. They have their own priorities.    In this situation, speculation in the problems of security  has, not to mince words, presented a real opportunity to draw  attention to themselves and to raise their international status.  For the extremist pronouncements which can be heard in Russia  at present do not, of course, improve our image, but it is, to  say the least, silly to perceive them as a real threat to  anybody's security. But it has emerged that, by using the  bugaboo of imperial Russia and portraying themselves as  potential victims, it is nevertheless possible to alarm the  West. Consequently, it is possible under the pretext of a dire  military and political need to first of all attempt to integrate  themselves into its defense structure, and only later into its  economic structure. After all, you treat your neighbors one way  but your allies in a completely different way.    Ukraine also suffers from this very complex, but it is  aggravated still more by economic collapse. All talk of Russia  being a threat, which Kiev used as a pretext to limit its  progress toward adopting a nonnuclear status, can be explained  first and foremost by an urge to win for itself economic and  financial advantages which have nothing to do with Ukraine's  security.    Nevertheless, those who speculated in security in order to  try and enhance their status, got their share of attention from  the U.S. President. When Bill Clinton held talks in Prague, he  tried to persuade the East European leaders to adopt partnership  for peace. Stopping over in Kiev, he tried to persuade Leonid  Kravchuk to agree to give up his nuclear warheads. Is it,  however, possible to consider the matter closed?    Alas, no. The real reasons for speculation in security have  simply not been resolved. Indeed, the East European countries  now have the opportunity to integrate themselves into NATO's  structures by an evolutionary process; but by no means into  West Europe's economic structures. But the capital which  Ukraine has been promised in accordance with the agreement,  however large it might be, will not pull it back from the  economic abyss. Consequently, it is still possible that  speeches about the Russian threat will be heard again.    Maybe we will not just hear speeches. After all, it is not  out of the question that they may attempt to provoke Moscow in  order to reinforce in some way what at the moment seem like  absolutely unfounded claims of its aggressiveness. We also had  an opportunity to see how this is done this week. I refer to  the provocation involving the arrest of Russian generals in  Latvia. I am prepared to believe that this was inspired by a  local nationalist petty tyrant. However, by some strange law,  violent actions which might put Russia in a bad light occur in  the Baltic states precisely on the eve of or during the visits  of U.S. Presidents.    Nor is it out of the question that someone in the future  will  attempt to go along the well-trodden path of provocation. This  is dangerous. Because, by speculating in security and playing  games with military force, it is necessary to continually raise  the stakes. You do not know where you will stop and whether you  will indeed stop at all.    It is very likely that the attempts by individual states to  turn problems of security into a means of attaining other  economic and political goals may prove to be the same kind of  challenge to global stability as local conflicts have already  become. I think that both Russia and its Western partners  should see this threat.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge in spite of mixed economic data A firming trend in the US Treasury market accelerated yesterday despite a mixed bag of economic signals. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/8 ahead at 88 9/32 , with the yield falling to 7.21 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  3/16 better at 99 7/32 , to yield 5.536 per cent. The market continued to build on solid gains in the previous two sessions, suggesting prices may have bottomed out with the sell-off triggered by Monday's move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. Bonds improved right from the start of trading, buoyed by news of big jump in unemployment claims for the third consecutive week. The Labor Department said 14,000 more people applied for jobless benefits last week than during the previous seven days, suggesting economic activity slackened more than economists had expected. However, mid-morning brought complications. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve, which two months ago tripped up the market with its regional report on business activity, was out with its April survey. It included a sharp rise in the keenly-watched prices-paid component. As most traders had expected a modest drop, bonds immediately dipped. In a surprise, the market quickly recovered amid short-covering and retail buying. Traders drew encouragement for a concurrent decline in the prices-received index, which suggested higher prices for raw materials were not feeding through into finished goods. The overall index was softer, too. Towards midday, reports began to circulate that the Fed was furtively buying government securities, helping to prop up prices and luring more accounts off the sidelines. Technical Data, the Boston research firm, estimated that the central bank bought Dollars 300m in five-year notes and the same amount of 10-year bonds. European government bond prices bounced back yesterday, taking their cue from the stronger turn in the US Treasury bond market. Dealers pointed out that many of the European bond markets had appeared oversold this week, after Monday's rise in short-term US interest rates sparked a heavy sell-off, particularly in the futures pits. The Bank of France provided the main talking point yesterday, as it cut its intervention rate by 10 basis points - from 5.90 to 5.80 per cent - and lowered its five-to-10-day repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent. The cuts followed the Bundesbank's decision to lower its official discount and Lombard rates by 25 basis points a week ago, and its repo rate by 12 basis points on Wednesday. Market analysts had speculated on whether the Bank of France would be able to follow the Bundesbank's lead, given that the French franc had weakened against the D-Mark this week. However, the French currency strengthened yesterday and moved back inside its former ERM band of 3.4305 per D-Mark to trade at around 3.4283 to the D-Mark, despite the French interest rate cut. French government bond prices stayed firm across the yield curve, with the OAT due 2004 yielding 6.90 per cent against 6.95 per cent the previous day. The notional bond futures contract traded on the Matif exchange ended 0.02 lower on the day at 120.08, having traded to a high of 120.50 and a low of 119.66. 'Given the economic fundamentals in France, I think French government bonds offer the best value of any of the global government bond markets just now,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'Some people think there may be another 10 basis point cut in the intervention rate next week, but I think that's too optimistic,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, bond strategist at Midland Global Markets. She said it was unlikely the Bundesbank would would pave the way for France to cut again by reducing its own repo by 10 basis points next week. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor said: 'The decision to lower interest rates is within the context of internal and external currency stability, the good fundamentals of the French economy, and a desire to accompany the non-inflationary growth that is clearly visible.' German government bond futures ended higher after a relatively volatile day. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.47 and traded down in the morning, then picked up after the US opening and rose to a high of 94.74. The futures contract sold off again in the afternoon and then bounced back to settle at 94.60. Traders said the main domestic story for the bund market remained the upward revision in economic growth forecasts, and the focus on signs that the German economy was gradually pulling out of recession. UK government bonds nose-dived in the morning after the release of the UK retail sales figures for March, but then staged a strong recovery to end the day nearly a point higher. Retail sales volume rose a provisional, seasonally-adjusted 0.8 per cent in March from February, giving a rise of 3.8 per cent from a year earlier. The March rise was far greater than expected, and gilt prices tumbled as hopes of a near-term cut in the base rate evaporated. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 105.26, dropped to a low of 105.10. However, it gradually climbed back to settle at 106.16. The Italian treasury will today make the first payments under a new fast-track scheme to refund withholding tax to foreign bond-holders. The scheme came into force at the end of March, replacing the previous cumbersome refund system, which kept non-resident investors waiting for up to 12 months for repayments of the 12.5 per cent tax. JP Morgan in Milan said under the new computerised system, refunds should be available within 35 business days of the coupon payment.</p>

Golden Legacy GLRS 101 THE SECOND instalment of Sony Classical's Glenn Gould Edition is if anything even more consistently treasurable than the first, which appeared last year. True to its principle of comprehensiveness the new batch of discs includes Gould's second recording of the Goldberg Variations made in 1981, 25 years after the version that first established his reputation and which has already been included in the CD edition. The later account remains, though, the consummate achievement, one of Gould's finest performances, in which his astonishing powers of articulation and control are harnessed to a view of the variations that holds structural coherence, contrapuntal rigour and poetic expression in perfect balance. The other Bach here is the collection of Two-Part and Three-Part Inventions assembled in the mid 1960s. If alongside the Goldberg they seem plain, unadorned, much more confined in their tonal range and expressive potential, they represent nevertheless a vital aspect of Gould's creative thinking, which held that the bare essentials of Bachian counterpoint were to be just as highly regarded as the grandest organic conceptions. With Gould's pair of Brahms discs the common ground between performer and listener becomes a little less firm. He was a pianist who was congenitally incapable of being uninteresting, but sometimes his illogicality and wilfulness are hard to follow. Among poised, lucid accounts of some of the pieces here are strange, unexpected discursions  - the central section of the first of the Op. 10 Ballades (recorded a few months before his death in 1982) slowed down almost to a standstill, the the E flat Intermezzo from Op. 117 made so prosaic that all its poetry seeps away, the B minor piece from Op. 119 full of ripples and flurries, with the pianist's omnipresent crooning more intrusive than usual. The eclecticism of Gould's repertory is represented by Hindemith and by his magisterial version of Liszt's transcription of the Pastoral Symphony. This becomes Beethoven filtered through the sensibility of two keyboard giants to emerge as an exploration of modern piano texture and figuration which only Gould, among the pianists of our time, could make so fascinating and revelatory. Hindemith is the other unfashionable favourite here; the three piano sonatas receive muscular, committed performances. Winning would not be the word I would use describe this music, but Gould's accounts come as near as any interpreter could to making them seem like vitally important works in the 20th-century piano literature. Alongside such eccentric brilliance Maria Joao Pires' collection of three Mozart sonatas could seem plain fare indeed. There is nothing startling or unconventional about her playing; it is not the supremely elegant style of Mozart interpretation which makes Mitsulo Uchida's Mozart sonata cycle so enduring, but something altogether more straightforward and ultimately endearing. It is, though, skilled, highly sophisticated playing, full of careful grading and shading and with a punctilious correctness about its rhythmic shaping. Nothing is pushed too hard, there are no specious claims to profundity; the music emerges naturally and easily. In the Beaux Arts Trio's integral set of Schumann's piano trios the piano playing of Menahem Pressler takes pride of place. Indeed Pressler's propulsive, brittle approach gives the familiar Beaux Arts character to these performances, which may not be ideal (the account of the D minor Trio, for instance, cannot hold a candle to the famous version that Rubinstein recorded with Heifetz and Piatigorsky) but which in works that are too often neglected are much more than simply serviceable. The tone of violinist Isidore Cohen has got wirier and less supple over the years, that of the cellist Peter Wiley is less assertive than that of his predecessor in the group Bernard Greenhouse. But the energy of the playing is unmistakable and the surge it gives to Schumann's melodies hard to gainsay. Finally a curiosity. The irrepressible Mahler enthusiast and scholar Gilbert Kaplan has sponsored and produced a realisation of four piano rolls made by his hero for the new Welte-Mignon system in 1905: the songs 'Ging heut' morgens uber Feld' and 'Ich ging mit Lust durch einen grunen Wald', the fourth movement of the Fourth Symphony and the opening movement of the Fifth. The disc also includes alternative versions of the three vocal items with solo vocal lines added by the soprano Yvonne Kenny and mezzo Claudine Carlson. On this evidence Mahler was not a great composer-pianist; the performances are full of scumbled passage work and muddy figuration. But they do give an uncanny sense of his energy as an interpreter; his tempi are generally faster than those of conventional performances today, and he seems to have obtained emotional weighting through contrasts of mood and dynamic much more than by languorous expressivo. The realisations have been carried out immaculately; for Mahlerians this is doubtless an essential issue.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Lamont consults libel lawyers MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, has called in leading libel lawyers, Carter Ruck, over reports in six newspapers about his credit card transactions. The editors of the newspapers - The Sun, the Evening Standard, the Daily Mail, the Daily Star, the Observer, The Independent and The Independent on Sunday - have all had letters from the law firm. It is believed the letters imply that Mr Lamont has been defamed by the coverage and the lawyers are seeking an early response. Legal action has not been ruled out at this stage. Last night the Treasury was referring callers to Carter Ruck, a firm that represented Mr Lamont in an earlier controversy, the eviction last year of a tenant, Ms Sara Dale, from the basement of his Notting Hill home. Carter Ruck declined to comment. In deciding to move against the newspapers Mr Lamont has the agreement of the government law officers. One of the main issues involved is understood to be the apparent challenge made in some coverage to the chancellor's truthfulness. The decision to at least consider legal action against so many newspapers marks a rise in tension between the government and the press. In an interview in today's Times newspaper, Mr Lamont warned that the press could become an important political issue in the 1990s as the trade unions had been in the 1970s. 'They are both over-mighty subjects,' he said. 'I read that my view is that there is a conspiracy. But I emphatically do not believe in conspiracies. It seems to me that the press have a powerfully destructive herd instinct, which I believe will be their undoing.'</p>

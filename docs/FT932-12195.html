			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cowie acquires Keep Trust - Pounds 39.5m motor deal takes group to fifth position in UK league T COWIE, the motor trading, leasing and bus and coach group, yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 39.5m deal to buy Keep Trust, a motor dealer, from Fitzwilton, the Irish group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly. Fitzwilton, which last October bought a stake in Wellworth, the Northern Ireland food retail chain, said it wanted to refocus its business on to food and to raise cash to give flexibility. It yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.62m) for 1992, compared with a profit of IPounds 231,000, after exceptional costs of IPounds 1.89m (IPounds 1.54m). Below-the-line there was a IPounds 25.3m extraordinary loss on the sale of Keep. Cowie is raising the Pounds 28.6m purchase cost through a placing of shares at 212p, with a 1-for-9.0948 clawback offer for shareholders, and taking on Pounds 10.9m of Keep's debt. Cowie's shares were steady at 230p yesterday; Fitzwilton's fell 2p to 48p. The deal will give Cowie fifth position in the UK motor distribution league, with Keep's 18 dealerships taking its total to 42. However, it is unlikely to be satisfied with this number. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said 'we are still an acquisitive company', although acquisitions could come in any of its activities. Asked if Cowie might rebid for Henlys Group, after its Pounds 32m offer failed last September, he said his company would 'keep all its options open'. Cowie retains a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys, whose shares have doubled from the 60p they are valued at in Cowie's accounts. Mr Hodgson said Cowie started talking to Fitzwilton within days of the bid for Henlys failing. He said the acquisition of Keep would bring benefits from putting the networks together, such as introducing Cowie's management systems into the Keep dealerships, selling more of its ex-hire cars through them and introducing its instalment credit, service and warranty packages. 'We have the management skills to generate far better profitability out of those dealerships', he said. Also, Keep has two Nissan franchises giving Cowie access to the marque for its leasing business. Keep's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.2m in 1992, Fitzwilton said, but are expected to recover this year. Mr Hodgson said that if Keep meets Fitzwilton's internal budgets in 1993, the deal would not dilute Cowie's earnings. Cowie will have nine Ford dealerships, one more than Ford usually allows under its present agreements, which could eventually result in a disposal. Fitzwilton's results showed a decline in turnover from IPounds 453.2m to IPounds 444.2m, including Pounds 193m (Pounds 186m) from Keep, and trading profits slightly down at IPounds 7.2m (IPounds 7.4m). Interest charges rose to IPounds 7m (IPounds 5.6m). Mr Patrick Dowling, finance director, said the exceptional charges related to the loss of business and redundancy costs because of the turmoil in the currency markets last autumn, which disrupted exports from Ireland to the UK. He said the 42 per cent Wellworth stake contributed IPounds 1.2m after interest in the two months it was owned. Losses per share were 1.87p (0.63p). The final dividend is held at 2p for an unchanged total of 3.5p. Henlys annual meeting heard that profits in the first quarter were 'significantly ahead' thanks in part to itscost reduction programmes. The shares rose 2p to 125p.</p>

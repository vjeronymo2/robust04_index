			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Peruvian Police  reported that a Shining Path [SL] leader, who was arrested last  week, was trying to reactivate a logistics support organization  for SL commandos with funds derived from drug trafficking.    SL Leader Moises Simon Limaco, also known as "Ramiro," is  believed to be the right-hand man of Oscar Ramirez Durand  ("Felicano"). Durand is the new SL leader, who is also striving  to reactivate the weakened terrorist gang.    Limaco planned to reactive the People's Aid of Peru force,  an  organization headed by lawyer Martha Huatay who has been  sentenced to life imprisonment. This organization supplied  clothing, food, shelter, and medical attention for SL commandos.    The police have indicated that the reactivation of the  People's Aid of Peru was financed with funds Limaco obtained  from traffickers in the northern Peruvian jungle region where SL  offers protection to traffickers in exchange for money and guns.    Limaco was arrested on 17 June in the northern part of Lima.  The same sources added that his questioning proceedings, which  began yesterday, comprises about 100 questions drafted by the  police antiterrorist squad. [passage omitted]    It was also reported today that 18 SL members were arrested  in Ayacucho department, in the southern Andean region. The  sources added that among them is Ercilia Prado (also known as  "Maria"), who has been a SL member since 1981 and who was in  jail for seven years. She is believed to be the liaison between  "Feliciano" and the Ayacucho branch of the SL.</p>

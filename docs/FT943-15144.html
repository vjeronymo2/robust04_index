			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank completes US buy Royal Bank of Scotland has completed its six-year US acquisition spree with the finalisation over the weekend of its purchase of Old Stone Federal Savings Bank of Rhode Island. It paid a premium of Dollars 134m (Pounds 88m) for the business, which comprises Dollars 1.1bn in deposits and Dollars 450m in selected loans. The vendor was Resolution Trust Corporation, a US government agency which took control when Old Stone failed in January 1993. Royal Bank has deliberately kept the acquisition trail within 100 miles of the Providence, Rhode Island, headquarters of Citizens Financial Group, the bank it bought in 1988. Since then, it has bought eight other institutions. Mr Larry Fish, Citizens' chief executive, says there were four main criteria in considering any purchase: that the location was close enough to Providence to deepen the bank's franchise in its core areas; that the target had a clean balance sheet; that it would make money in the first year; and that it was accepted that Citizens would merge the back offices and choose the management and board. Royal Bank is not the only UK bank eyeing the US banking sector. Despite the losses UK banks endured in the late 1980s, the fragmented and regional nature of US banking franchises offers the attractions of being able to establish a significant market share concentrated in a single, wealthy, county or state. Already this year, National Westminster Bank, the UK's second largest, has spent Dollars 800m buying two retail banks in New Jersey - Citizens First and Central Jersey Bancorp to add to NatWest Bancorp. Royal Bank began adding to Citizens in December 1990. It appears to have reaped some benefit from that early start, as prices for US banks have been rising. The highest price Royal Bank paid has been 1.9 times book value, while NatWest has paid 2.4 times book for both its purchases this year. Apart from the possibility of buying a few more branches to fill in the network, which will total more than 120 in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, is clear that the time has come to consolidate the acquisitions. In terms of market share, Citizens is now among the top five banks in New England. It contributed Pounds 27m of the group's interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 201m, against a Pounds 21m contribution the previous year. To fund Citizens' growth, Royal Bank is injecting Dollars 465m in capital, of which Dollars 165m is a result of buying Old Stone. While an end to acquisitions will mean the end of capital injections, it will also mean intensified pressure for Citizens to deliver organic growth. Citizens' cross-selling in Rhode Island, where some 60 per cent of its 1m or so customers live, is an impressive average of between three and four products per customer. From now on, greater emphasis will be put on cross-selling in the other two states, where the average number of products per customer is just over one. Mr Mathewson believes that fundamental changes in US banking such as consolidation among fewer, larger players, make it important to build value in Citizens as well as build income. 'The changes will make the key banks more valuable and will make those which do not give a strategic advantage less so,' he says. 'If our market share is only 10 per cent, we could be squeezed out without anyone even needing to buy us, but as we're the dominant bank in our areas, it's a different ball game.'</p>

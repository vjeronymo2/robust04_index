			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Saleh Al-Djufri: "Golkar-NU Relations Become </F> More Distant"]    [Text] President Suharto, in his capacity as chairman of  Golkar's [Functional Groups Organization] Development Board,  recently called on the leadership of Golkar's DPP [Executive  Board] to investigate the drop in Golkar votes in the 1992  general elections.    Only a few months after being elected general chairman of  Golkar's DPP Harmoko took swift action to prepare for a Golkar  victory in future general elections. Harmoko's acts of  consolidation were only natural and due above all to the fact  that Megawati stepped into the position of general chairman of  the PDI's [Indonesian Democracy Party] DPP and to the  conjectures that elements of the NU [Islamic Scholars Party]  would step into leadership positions at the upcoming August  Party Congress of the PPP [United Development Party]. It seems  that Harmoko wants to prove that he cannot be taken lightly and  that he is showing that a civilian can also lead the party whose  symbol is the banyan tree.    The challenges faced by Harmoko in the 1997 general  elections  are certainly far more difficult than those of previous  elections. In the past, ABRI [Republic of Indonesia Armed  Forces] and the bureaucracy sided firmly with Golkar, the level  of the people's political maturity was still low and the system  for running the general elections favored Golkar. In future  elections, on the other hand, the situation will be very  different. The strong impetus towards democratization, ABRI's  neutral position, the people's increased political maturity, the  quality of the system running the general elections, and the  consolidation of two political parties are all serious  challenges which Harmoko will have to face. This list doesn't  even include the increasingly distant relations between Golkar  and the NU, the largest mass organization, which played a big  role in jacking up Golkar's votes in the 1987 general elections,  Golkar's greatest achievement and one which it would find hard  to repeat.    It is not hard to notice the increasingly distant relations  between Golkar and the NU. After the tug-of-war between Golkar  and the NU just before the 1992 general elections, which  resulted in a drop in Golkar votes, the make-up of the  leadership of Golkar's DPP for the period 1993-1998, which  emerged from the Fifth Party Congress and is often called the  work of Habibie, was seen as the low point in Golkar-NU  relations.    This time Habibie will really play an important role at the  Party Congress. Habibie's troops are now putting their stamp on  the Golkar leadership which emerged from the Fifth Party  Congress. But it is unfortunate that he is probably incapable of  understanding the political anatomy of the Islamic community and  so he is not introducing NU figures into the ranks of Golkar's  leaders. This is really a fatal decision because it is believed  that it will influence the NU's political position in future  general elections. The NU is the religious social organization  with the largest membership in Indonesia.    It seems that it will be hard to improve the increasingly  distant relations between Golkar and the NU in the future.  Besides that, both Golkar and the NU also want to become  independent organizations. The NU does not want to depend on  Golkar's political positions but wants to give its members the  freedom of political choice. At the same time, Golkar itself  also does not want to depend on the size of the NU or of any  other social organization because Golkar's political style is  clearly not to be dictated to by other organizations, especially  after learning the lessons of the 1987 and 1992 general  elections, in which Golkar's rise and fall depended on the NU's  political positions. The problem is whether Golkar is ready to  face future general elections by taking those steps. In other  words, how far down into this society has Golkar moved?    In my opinion, the steps taken by Golkar under Harmoko's  leadership to construct its own independent political base are  part of Golkar's strategy to win the general elections and to  move into this society. If we look carefully at Golkar's journey  since its inception three decades ago, it has gone through three  stages in its effort to win the general elections. At the  beginning of the New Order, Golkar, which was helped into being  by the military and by groups of social organizations whose goal  was to stem the activities of the PKI [Indonesian Communist  Party], racked up victories in the general elections through the  power of the state apparatus. The military and the bureaucracy  were very effective in spearheading their influence over the  masses who had experienced political trauma following the  G30S/PKI bloodbath [September 30th Movement].    At the same time, the government restructured politics by  narrowing the scope of political party activities and gave way  to Golkar to seize victory. The masses were made politically  sterile, which made it easier for the government apparatus, who  are also members of Golkar, to herd them into voting for Golkar  in the general elections. It makes sense to say that the Golkar  government used "bulldozer politics" when the general elections  were first organized.    Golkar, which from its inception was very closely linked to  abangan [traditional Javanese but not orthodox Muslim] culture,  did not want to see a religious group, especially one that was  Islamic in nature, rise to the national political stage. That is  why for the first 2 decades after its inception the government  always faced off against Islam. The Islamic masses refer to the  government as "them," which shows the psychological distance  between them. Golkar has always been suspicious of Islamic  political actions, which they say disturb sociopolitical  stability.    The second stage arose when Golkar became reconciled with  the  Islamic community, which was mainly signaled by the rebirth of  the NU into the '26 Line of Action at the Party Congress held in  Situbondo and the willingness of the Islamic mass organizations  to accept Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] as the  nation's sole principle. This reconciliation clearly originated  with the government (Golkar). It seems that Golkar became aware  that Islam is potentially its most important political base and  that it is not possible to win the general elections forever by  depending on a relaxation of regulations or by force. That is  why the only way for Golkar to maintain its continued existence  is a rapprochement with the Islamic masses through its mass  organizations, especially the NU, which is the biggest Islamic  mass organization.    The outcome of this second movement-into-society stage was  quite spectacular; it took the form of a conspicuous rise in  Golkar votes in the 1987 general elections. It was as if Golkar  had become part of the Islamic community. When it visited the  Islamic religious schools, the NU base that had previously been  very much against Golkar, it was greeted with enthusiasm. The  relations between Islam and the powers that be, in turn,  gradually thawed out.    But it is probably true that large organizations, such as  the  NU, which from its inception has been very close to practical  politics, also hold the key to the strategy of how to relate to  Golkar. This means that NU's willingness to be close to Golkar  must be matched by acceptable political concessions. This is  NU's hope, but Golkar is unwilling to grant those concessions.  The consequence is that relations have become distant again.    Even though Golkar and the NU are far apart again, Golkar  succeeded in getting close to NU religious circles and religious  schools with the result that they are no longer willing to  accept their political line from the NU's PB [Executive  Committee] just like that. In fact, there are many potential NU  figures who have always been ignored by the NU's PB; they then  discovered new places of operation and they moved into the MDI  [Islamic Missionizing Council], the GUPPI [Association for the  Improvement of Islamic Education], and other religious  organizations under Golkar's aegis. The process of Golkar's  movement into society within the NU, in turn, increasingly  aggravated the poor relations between NU's elite and Golkar.  NU's elite probably felt disappointed with Golkar because even  though they gave concessions for Golkar's size and for its  rapprochement with religious scholars and religious schools,  they did not receive a proper political recompense.    It is this distant relationship between Golkar and the NU  that is probably at the base of Golkar's present orientation and  political strategy, which is at the same time the third stage of  its political movement into society. Golkar would like to be an  autonomous and mature party, not dependent on the political  behavior of other organizations. Since most Indonesians are  Moslems, Harmoko's attempt to build an independent political  base is directed towards the Islamic masses. This is, of course,  a new phenomenon in Golkar's journey.    If this hypothesis is true, it means that Harmoko is taking  a  courageous step. Golkar has the strategic tricks down pat in  that it is increasingly accepted by Islamic circles and this is  very significant for the future existence of Golkar. But this  obsession with building a political base is probably aimed more  at the "Islamic middle."    Fewer than 50 million members of the Islamic community are  members of religious social organizations, such as the NU,  Muhammadiayah, Al-Irsyad or the others. The rest, about 120  million people, are members of the "Islamic middle," which is  independent, especially when it comes to its politics. This  group is more rational and pragmatic and is not so easily swayed  by political sweet talk. In general they have enjoyed the New  Order's economic development. This group is a potentially large  base for Golkar, but keeping them as loyal voters and as a  potentially large base is not easy.    Seen from this perspective, the steps that Golkar is taking  to embrace Islamic circles, especially the ICMI [Indonesian  Islamic Intellectuals Organization], is part and parcel of the  political movement-into-society stage so that it will become an  independent political party with grass roots. Now that it has  succeeded in penetrating Islamic mass organizations, it seems  that Golkar wants to strengthen and maintain its base in the  "Islamic middle," which is most of the Indonesian population,  especially since Golkar has proven itself to be the protector of  the Islamic community, including NU's masses and the religious  schools.    The acceptance of the Religious Jurisdiction Laws, the birth  of the ICMI and other phenomena are examples of how much  attention the government is paying to Islam. Before the ICMI was  formed, many of our Muslim intellectuals were compartmentalized  and there was no one association they could count on. Golkar has  also carried out Islamic missionizing in an intensive way in the  villages and in isolated areas and it tried to eliminate the  compartmentalization which played the groups off against each  other by using such terms for the Islamic community as abangan,  santri [orthodox Muslim], Islam KTP [on their ID card], and so  on. Under Golkar, Islam flourished.    But it is believed that Golkar's obsession with building a  new base with an Islamic foundation is fraught with challenges,  both internal and external. Internally, it is believed that not  all organizations affiliated with Golkar (KINO-KINO [groups  within the main organization]) agree with Golkar's policy of  basing itself on the Islamic masses because that will narrow  their political career paths and will give the Islamic group a  greater opportunity to follow its career path within Golkar. It  has often been said that since its inception Golkar has been  closest to abangan culture.    Externally, if Golkar expects the Islamic masses to form its  base, it must pay closer attention to their political  aspirations. This will require Golkar to adapt and accommodate  itself to Islamic aspirations. And I haven't yet mentioned the  challenges from other organizations, especially the NU, which is  not willing to let Golkar grab its members just like that. This,  in turn, will rouse social jealousy between the NU and Golkar,  which can be observed in Gus Dur's political behavior. In  addition, the PDI has recently also been launching some  political initiatives of rapprochement with Islamic circles.  Practically speaking, the Islamic masses will be primadonnas in  the next election.    Aside from the possibilities of pro and con, to what extent  have such ideas become Golkar's political strategies? If such  ideas have become Golkar obsessions, Harmoko will be known not  only as a successful Golkar figure, but also as an Islamic  figure. He will be a political figure who succeeds in  eliminating the partitions between religious movements and who  integrates santri and abangan cultures within Golkar. It is  certain that we will not be able to see these achievements and  ideas until the 1997 general elections.

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / S African right sees a deadlock Prospects for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa appeared grim last night after right wing leaders said, constitutional negotiations had reached a 'dead end' and they would probably boycott elections in April. Mr Rowan Cronje, chairman of the conservative Freedom Alliance, said after a meeting of alliance leaders: 'There is really no sense in carrying on with negotiations. We are faced with a serious difficulty, which is insurmountable.' Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party which has said it will boycott April's elections unless the constitution is changed, sounded an even more ominous note. Asked if Inkatha would register to take part in elections before Saturday's deadline, even if only to keep its options open, Chief Buthelezi said: 'That would be taking away our bargaining chip, so we cannot do that. Quite clearly we've reached some kind of dead end.' There remains an outside chance that talks can be revived before the deadline, and that Alliance parties can be persuaded to register, but this will depend on whether the ANC is willing to make further concessions to the right wing Freedom Alliance on regional autonomy. Talks came to a deadlock over this issue on Monday night, when the ANC and Freedom Alliance were unable to bridge the large gulf between them: the ANC wants a strong central government and the Freedom Alliance wants a federal state with strong regional powers. There was no sign yesterday that the ANC was preparing concessions on this issue. If the ANC makes no further offer to amend the constitution, Inkatha is likely to try to prevent the April 27 elections from taking place in large parts of Natal province, as well as in troubled East Rand townships near Johannesburg where Inkatha has a strong base in migrant workers' hostels. This will lead to widespread violence. It was not clear last night whether the white right wing would also boycott elections, as parallel talks between the white right and the ANC on a homeland for Afrikaners are due to continue. If the white right participates in the election, this will weaken Inkatha's efforts to resist but will still leave a serious threat of violence in many areas.</p>

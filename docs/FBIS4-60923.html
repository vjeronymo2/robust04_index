			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on statement issued by the Democratic </F> Party of Ukraine in Kiev on 21 April]    [Text] The Presidium of the National Council of the  Democratic Party of Ukraine has made public the party's appeal  to the new Ukrainian Supreme Council. At this complex moment in  history, the document states, in spite of your different  political convictions, we hope that your civic consciousness and  responsibility for the country's fate will not allow the country  to fall into the abyss of legal chaos and economic collapse.  This is exactly what foes of the independent Ukraine hope for.  Their main goal is to disturb Ukraine's political stability and  destroy its governing structures. This might result in a  complete halt to reform, rampaging separatism, and a continued  drop in production and the population's standard of living. In  addition to this kind of social backdrop, the antigovernment  forces still need the election of a new president with vague  powers and several hundred unruly regional administration heads  to aggravate legal chaos in the state and eventually, provoke  social conflict.    The Democratic Party believes that the 26 June elections, so  eagerly pressed for by enemies of our state, must not take  place, because this would put us on the brink of the abyss.  This election is irrelevant in terms of timing, the condition  of society, etc. Here are some other reasons: The new  constitution and a law on power have not yet been adopted; the  former Supreme Council limited the president's term in office to  less than three years. So, this election is unconstitutional in  nature. As was the Supreme Council, the president was elected  by a popular vote, and only the people can replace him with an  early referendum. Aware of the danger looming over Ukraine, the  Democratic Party calls for the Supreme Council and society to  put an end to political games and postpone the elections until  after necessary legal documents are adopted -- a constitution,  first of all -- so that one could in a peaceful atmosphere  resolve state problems, reforming the economy and thereby  improving the people's well-being.    As a party of moderate politicians and people with common  sense, the Democratic Party of Ukraine assumes full  responsibility for declaring the following: the 26 June  elections are a path to death, not the creation of a young state.    [Signed] On 21 April in Kiev.</p>

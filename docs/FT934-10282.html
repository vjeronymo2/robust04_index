A bill creating the National Agency for Information and State Security will go before parliament this month and is expected to be passed by the end of December, political sources said. Allegations by jailed agents that senior figures including President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro plundered funds earmarked for covert operations have revived fears of a plot to destabilise the country and delay elections.</p>

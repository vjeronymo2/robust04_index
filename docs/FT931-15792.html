			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Inevitable conclusions about bank motives Sir, A special resolution requires a 75 per cent vote of approval by shareholders. The recent demise of both Sale Tilney and Lilley, owing to a lack of unanimity among their respective bankers, could possibly have been avoided if banks had learnt, at last, that the power of a charge over assets should also be accompanied by responsibility of effective ownership of those assets. One rule for the goose, another for the gander, is not a satisfactory recipe in a recession. William Hodgson, Tumblecroft, Up Marden, Chichester, West Sussex PO18 9LA</p>

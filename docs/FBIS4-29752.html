			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives Budget Committee is scheduled to summon former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [21 June] afternoon  as a sworn witness over his alleged financial irregularities.    But leaders of the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by  Hosokawa,  said Hosokawa and coalition partners will not appear before the  committee unless it votes again on the resolution to summon the  former prime minister.    The JNP claims the committee's decision to summon Hosokawa  is  "invalid" because of improper parliamentary procedures.    Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], reiterated at a press meeting Monday that Hosokawa does  not have to testify in the Diet about his suspected financial  deals. He also said the lower house Budget Committee's decision  was invalid, violating parliamentary rules.    Secretaries general of the coalition parties will make a  final decision at a meeting slated for Tuesday morning, parties  sources said.    However Tsuruo Yamaguchi, chairman of the lower house Budget  Committee, and opposition parties have rejected another call on  the resolution to summon Hosokawa, saying that no improper  procedure occurred in the decision.    At a session of the Budget Committee last Thursday,  Yamaguchi  declared that his panel unanimously approved a proposal to  summon the former prime minister.    Observers said if Hosokawa fails to appear before the Diet  committee, the opposition camp would intensify criticism against  him for covering up suspicion over financial irregularities.    They added if Hosokawa rejects the Diet testimony, the  Liberal Democratic Party and some members of the Social  Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan] would add  pressure to submit a no-confidence vote against the cabinet of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Refusing to give Diet testimony without a legitimate reason  is punishable with a fine or imprisonment of up to one year by a  two-thirds majority of committee members, according to Diet  testimony law.    Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for  his  April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister.    Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the  budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a  loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm.    The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that  Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and  that it was received as a secret  political donation.</p>

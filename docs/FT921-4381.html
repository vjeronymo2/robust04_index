			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Appointments: Heir-apparent at AAH Do merchant bankers make good company chairman? The shareholders of AAH Holdings, the healthcare and distribution group, may not have too long to wait to find out now that John Padovan has been appointed deputy chairman. Padovan, 53, has excellent City connections; he has been chairman and chief executive of County Bank, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, and most recently deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'The City is mostly a place for people under 50,' says Padovan, who retired from BZW in August 1991 and is now embarking on a new career as a professional non-executive director. However, he stresses that he has no aspirations to have dozens of them. He is a non-executive at Tesco, Whitbread and The Hartstone Group which, together with his latest appointment, should keep him fully occupied. Bill Pybus, 68, who has headed AAH since 1968, sees Padovan as his heir-apparent. He first got to know Padovan when the latter was running County Bank, the merchant banking subsidiary of NatWest where Pybus was a regional director. Padovan handled several acquisitions for AAH and Pybus says that NatWest made a mistake in letting Padovan go. Although the record of merchant bankers making good company chairman is patchy, Pybus stresses that Padovan is 'very much the chairman type'. His appointment to the AAH board is the final piece in the jigsaw. The company appointed a finance director in November 1989, and Bill Revell was appointed group managing director last year.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS GO TO POLLS FOR 2ND TIME  </P> <P> Soviet voters turned out Sunday for the second time in two weeks to choose  candidates in 64 constituencies where no clear winners emerged for places in a  new, more powerful parliament.  </P> <P> The March 26 vote showed public opinion swinging against the Establishment  across the country, with scores of senior Communist Party and government  officials failing to win election.  </P> <P> Reformist figures were hoping to seize on the public mood to consolidate their  gains during the second round, a runoff between the two leaders in  multi-candidate contests where no one achieved the necessary 50% of the vote.  Initial results are expected today.  </P> <P> The elections are to a newly created Congress of People's Deputies, which will  in turn elect from its members a Supreme Soviet (Parliament), endowed with real  executive powers in contrast to its rubber-stamp predecessor.  </P></p>

These are questions asked by "Sub-Commander Marcos,"  spokesperson for the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN),  reacting in a public letter to the amnesty offered by President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    The letter sent to the independent newspapers LA JORNADA, EL  FINANCERO, EL TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, and the  magazine PROCESO contains 50 questions regarding the president's  amnesty offer which was approved this morning by the Chamber of  Deputies.    "Marcos," whose real identity is unknown, wore a ski cap  during the 1 January occupation of San Cristobal de las Casas  and has signed off on all the communiques issued thus far by the  EZLN directorate. "What will they pardon us for? What do we  have to ask pardon for? For not having humbly accepted the  gigantic historic charge of rejection and abandonment? For  rising up in arms when we found all other paths closed? These  are some of the questions asked by the mysterious guerrilla  leader. "For showing the rest of the country and the world that  human dignity is still alive even in its poorest inhabitants?  For being mostly Indians? For struggling for liberty,  democracy, and justice? For not following the patterns of the  previous guerrillas? For not surrendering? For not selling  ourselves?    Who must ask for pardon and who can grant it? Those who for  years and years have sat down at a full table and have sated  themselves, while we sat down with death, on a daily basis, so  near that we ceased fear it.    Those who filled our pockets and souls with statements and  promises? Those who are dead, our dead, so mortally dead of  "natural" death, that is, of measles, whooping cough, dengue,  cholera, typhoid fever, tetanus, pneumonia, malaria, and other  gastrointestinal and pulmonary ailments?    Those who tortured us, arrested us, assassinated and  despised  us for the serious "crime" of wanting a piece of land, not a  large piece, not a small piece, only a piece that could allow  one to grow something to put into one's mouth. Who has to ask  for pardon and who can grant it?."</p>

Kobets, people's deputy of the  Russian  Federation, dropped into my office during the first half of the  day on 20 September. He reported that a session of the Collegium  of the Ministry of Defense had just concluded, which was  attended by many commanders of troop arms and military  districts. K. Kobets informed me that the session had been  convened at the initiative of the Minister and at B. Yeltsin's  instructions. The Army's participation in possible armed events  in the city of Moscow was discussed. There was discussion of the  possibility of establishing direct presidential control in the  nation on 20 or 21 September, and it was proposed that the  Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the  Russian Federation be dispersed. This would be formalized in a  message from the President to the people and in a corresponding  decree. This could result in various extreme acts and armed  confrontations. Nothing was said about who was to be fought and  who was to be protected, however. Many Collegium members were  absolutely opposed to the Army's participation in the  suppression of street disturbances. This was the function of the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Troops. Obviously  anticipating the course of events, the Minister of Defense  attempted to convince the Collegium members that it might be  necessary to move troops into Moscow.    "During our discussion a phone call came in on the direct  line from the President. I could not hear what Yeltsin said. We  could only see," K. Kobets said, "that after the words `Just  what would you have me to do? Take the `White House' by storm?  The Army is outside of politics. You have repeatedly said so  yourself!' the Minister's face turned very red and he was not  feeling well. They hung up at the other end. The Minister went  into another room and took some medicine. Some time later he  returned. The Collegium members and those present unanimously  decided to observe strict neutrality and not be drawn into any  street disturbances."    After listening to General K. Kobets, I asked him to report  on the session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium to R.  Khazbulatov, and he headed for there.    I would like to deviate somewhat here from the chronology of  events. Special circumstances had brought me into contact with  General K. Kobets and certain other generals. It so happened  that from the very beginning of my chairmanship of the  Commission on the Budget, Plans, Taxes and Prices and then my  deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet, hardly not a week  went by in which the heads of the MO [Ministry of Defense], the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the MB [Ministry of  Security] did not come to me, mainly on matters pertaining to  legislative support for the functioning of those agencies, their  financing, material and technical support, decisions on the  induction of the youth into the army and so forth. Before  becoming a member of the Supreme Soviet I worked at defense  enterprises in Tataria and then in the Defense Section of the  Tatarsk Oblast party committee.    I was frequently in the forces, at various military  anniversaries, and took part in formal and family dinners with  the generals. They all spoke aloud, without inhibition, of the  absence of a precisely defined military doctrine in the nation,  talked with suffering about the army's disintegration and the  decline of its prestige in the world arena. The only thing they  discussed in a lowered voice was who had control of the nuclear  button. God forbid that someone should hear that. Nor were they  secretive about the causes of the crisis: "What kind of minister  do we have"? He was referred to with the same extremely  diminutive name used for him throughout the army. This was not  familiarity; it was a reflection of the pinnacle of competence.  No one referred to Generals Kolesnikov, Mironov or Deynikin in a  familiar, simplified manner. They were personalities, although  they too were caught up in the "Rodionov syndrome" at a crucial  time for Russia. There was nothing surprising about that; the  army was torn down, persecuted, degraded and insulted on all  sides.    I would point out that this syndrome came into being in the  army following the Tbilisi tragedy, in which neo-democrat  Sobchak left a black mark. What rage and what thunderbolts he  leveled against the command element of the Transcaucasus  Military District and the Ministry of Defense as a People's  Deputy of the USSR! And it was, after all, thanks to the army  that a terrible bloodbath was avoided in Georgia back then, on 9  April 1989. A large disaster was prevented then. Later, this was  no longer possible; the army was forced to take a "neutral  position." Let the result be judged by those who at this  difficult time either remained silent or capitulated to  "democrat" Sobchak or took up his position without realizing it,  "falling in love with" the sparkling eyes of this destroyer of  the nation.    Ultimately, what began with Sobchak's offering led to the  Army's direct breakdown. The U.S. has long exercised control  over Russia's key areas, of course: politics and the economy. It  has now reached even the Army. Many people are probably aware  that during Minister of Defense P. Grachev's visit to the U.S.  agreement was reached on the establishment of a joint  American-Russian "peacekeeping" force out of the U.S. 3rd  Infantry Division and Russia's 27th Motorized-Rifle Division.  The most amazing thing is that the Russian Minister agreed to  the possibility of their use in the CIS countries during a  "special period." If, during the recent fall, victory had gone  to the Constitution and the Congress of People's Deputies, the  possibility cannot be ruled out that Russians would have "gotten  to known" firsthand American rapid-reaction forces at strategic  CIS facilities: atomic power plants, nuclear installations and  so forth.    ...The phone on the direct line to R. Khazbulatov rang. He  asked us to come to his office immediately. Present there were  Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff,  People's Deputy of Russia V. Achadov, advisor on Military  Affairs to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation, Vice President A. Rutskoy and A. Korovnikov,  chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee. M. Kolesnikov had  already reported to them on the session of the Collegium of the  Ministry of Defense.    "Mikhail Petrovich has just told us about the session of the  Ministry of Defense Collegium. Everything K. Kobets said is  confirmed. The Army will adhere to the concept that it is  'outside of politics,'" R. Khazbulatov said. "What are we going  to do"?    "We need officially to summon the Minister of Defense to the  Supreme Soviet and clarify the situation," someone said. Grachev  was not to be found an hour after that or later, however. Nor  did he respond to attempts to contact him. We asked M.  Kolesnikov jointly with K. Kobets to write a report to the  Supreme Soviet. The Chief of the General Staff promised to write  the report and bring it to us in an hour. R. Khazbulatov later  told me that M. Kolesnikov came to see him an hour later and  confirmed everything orally but refused to prepare a written  document. From that moment the Army began slowly but certainly  to enter into the scenario of a coup d'etat, first demonstrating  neutrality toward B. Yeltsin's unconstitutional actions (and  this actually played into his hand) and then taking action in  support of the putsch.    Throughout all those days, right up until I left the House  of  Soviets, I spoke with K. Kobets by phone three or four times a  day. Like us, he was upset by the fact that the lights had been  turned off, there was no hot water and it was not permitted to  bring in fuel, food or medicine. He believed that this was being  done by brainless blockheads to get the people to rise up and  come to the House of Soviets.    For my part, I too complained that power and telephone lines  had been disconnected in the Ministry of Defense on 23  September, organic weapons had been taken from ministry workers  and generals, and two guards from other departments had been  posted at each door. And the generals tolerated this, quietly  and timidly discussing the issues raised by the political  crisis. The situation surrounding the Ministry of Defense was  heating up, and it was impossible not to see this. The degree of  secrecy in the Army increased by the day. M.P. Kolesnikov, chief  of the General Staff, issued a special document altering the  procedure for telephone communication between the central  agencies of military command and control and the troops. This  was unprecedented in peacetime. It essentially meant that  Ministry of Defense staff could not independently contact a  single military subunit (division, regiment) even on a secure  line. Only the chief of the corresponding staff of the troop arm  could issue the order, after learning the content of the  forthcoming discussion.    All of this shows that neither B. Yeltsin nor P. Grachev was  certain how the Army, including the top generals, would conduct  themselves in that non-authorized situation which developed  after 21 September. They were attempting not only to prevent the  "leakage of information" but also to make it difficult for the  opponents of Yeltsin and Grachev in the Ministry itself to join  forces.    Was General K. Kobets aware of this? I believe he was. At  least one fact led me to doubt it.    Some Secretariat staff members came to the office and told  me:    "Look, Yuriy Mikhaylovich, General K. Kobets is allegedly in  touch with events on Leningradskiy Prospekt and is giving an  interview at the Headquarters of the CIS Joint Armed Forces,  stating that the Army is being ordered to shoot at people.    "That cannot be," I replied, although I was beginning to  have  doubts. People could not make up such things.    I phoned K. Kobets and was told by his orderly:    "He is at the General Staff and will not be back soon. As  soon as he arrives, I shall put him through to you."    I phoned Kobets' dacha. His wife answered. Since we are on  friendly terms, we chatted for a awhile, and I asked her whether  she had heard Konstantin Ivanovich's TV presentation.    "No," she answered, "I did not. He is in some kind of mess  again."    Much to my surprise, some time later I was told that  Minister  Grachev had personally played back a recording of our  conversation for General K. Kobets as proof of his wife's  "underground" activities and apparently hinted that his phone  was also being tapped.    Even in that situation we still considered it more  acceptable  to use the Army in the capacity of "blue helmets" for separating  the "White House" and the police. Up to the tragic events of 3-4  October Russia's people's deputies, the heads of Federation  subjects and the leaders of trade unions and parties did not  believe that the government could make a decision to storm the  House of Soviets.    Unfortunately, independent experts with contacts with the  President's administration and with the power structures  maintained the opposite. The scenario had been worked out long  before. According to Yeltsin, the "artillery preparation" was  over. Only the actual storming remained. The date for it was  postponed from one day to the next. The breakthrough of the  blockade and the storming of important facilities (which ones  was another question) had been set forth in the scenario and  repeatedly approved. A game of nerves began.    Beginning on 22 September telegrams began coming in to the  Supreme Soviet and to R. Khazbulatov personally from the  military district commanders, in which they proposed a "zero  option" and simultaneous, early elections for the President and  the Supreme Soviet. This concept later became the basis of the  negotiating process at the Saint Daniel Monastery. I also  informed K. Kobets of this. The "zero option" demanded great  courage of the authors of Decree No. 1400, however. After all,  it actually involved rescinding it or suspending it if worse  came to worst. We understood all of the political complexity  involved in such a decision, particularly for B. Yeltsin and  those around him, but we were hoping they would be sensible for  the sake of Russia. Unfortunately, our hopes were not justified.    Representatives of the General Staff and of the military  districts made their way to the Supreme Soviet, particularly in  the first stage, who, like P. Deynikin, M. Kolesnikov and V.  Mironov, declared that they understood the political situation,  understood that an unconstitutional coup d'etat had been carried  out but that they would not intervene yet but wait to see how  events developed. Too many times the politicians had coerced the  Army in the past and then abandoned and made scapegoats of the  generals.    On Sunday night a group of officers from one of the units in  the Moscow PVO [Air Defense] District led by a colonel went over  to the side of the parliament. In an interview with an Interfax  correspondent inside the House of Soviets, the servicemen, who  requested that they not be named, gave as the motive for their  decision their absolute disagreement with B. Yeltsin's position.  According to them, many other servicemen in their unit had also  expressed a desire to go to the "White House", but the officers  had not wanted to draw first-term servicemen into the conflict.  The officers confirmed the fact that the Army was split but that  it must defend the Constitution.    It was apparent that following promulgation of the 21  September decree and the execution of the coup d'etat, Yeltsin's  team had seen that it did not have the necessary support either  in Moscow or regionally. The Muscovites, who staged numerous  demonstrations and rallies, were on the side of the House of  Soviets. Consequently, the Army and its leadership would still  have to be "broken." Only the excuse was needed, an act of great  provocation. And this soon occurred: the "breakthrough" by  Muscovites of the ring blockading the House of Soviets, the  "storming" of the mayor's office, "Ostankino." I underscore the  fact: Those were acts of provocation.    "Everyone," A. Rutskoy said, "is drawing the Army to the  `White House.'"    "But then General K. Kobets promised to use it only in the  capacity of `blue helmets.'"    "I do not believe your Kobets or Grachev! They betrayed us  once, and they will do it again. I was told," A. Rutskoy said,  "that there is a split in the Ministry of Defense leadership  over the use of the Army and its introduction into Moscow.  Pashka is calling the divisions and regiments himself, over the  heads of the commanders. And your beloved People's Deputy K.  Kobets agreed to head an operational group to stabilize the  situation in the city, which actually means firing upon the  peaceful population. It is at his orders that aimed fire is  being leveled against the House of Soviets."    Indeed, at a session of the Collegium of the Ministry of  Defense held on the night of 3 October, a number of district  commanders expressed their disagreement with the President's  orders pertaining to supporting the status of the extraordinary  situation in Moscow. All evening and all night from Sunday to  Monday the President attempted to convince the generals of the  need for a final assault on the House of Soviets. P. Grachev and  K. Kobets did not need to be convinced; they agreed with it all.    What was A. Rutskoy to reply? We heard over a special radio  unit that armored personnel carriers and personnel of the  Kremlin and Tula airborne divisions had begun moving toward  Moscow. Subunits of the Ryazan Airborne Division were being  moved up.    We saw all of this at 07:00 on the morning of 4 October.  Breaking through the barricades near the parliament building,  five BMP penetrated to Free Russia Square and moved to the  opposite side of the square. The armored personnel carriers and  infantry combat vehicles began shelling the barricades and tents  and opened fire at windows in the House of Soviets. The first  round razed a tent on the square with sleeping Muscovites  inside. Three bodies were left lying on the street.    Subunits of the Tula Airborne Division, which had taken the  place of the police and soldiers in the internal troops, closed  the ring around the House of Soviets. At 08:30 the soldiers  began approaching the building in bounds, while the armored  personnel carriers and infantry combat vehicles opened fire on  the parliament building. Ten tanks from the Kantemir Division  were moved onto the bridge and the opposite side of the Moscow  River to provide fire support. After several volleys fire broke  out on the 12th and 13th floor of the House of Soviets.    Over police radio R. Khazbulatov, Father Nikon and I  constantly called upon the troops to cease fire and begin  negotiations. The response was nothing but verbal abuse and a  disinclination to engage in any sort of dialog. The artillery  fire intensified. The movement of troops, equipment and police  forces in the direction of the House of Soviets increased by the  hour. Reinforcements were constantly joining them. Most of the  fire on the "White House" came from the direction of the  American embassy, from the Hotel Mir and the quay near the Hotel  Ukraina. Snipers plastered anything moving inside the "White  House" from all sides.    A transition from a democratic regime to authoritarian rule  had actually occurred in Russia. Tanks fired on the Supreme  Soviet to the applause of world "civilization" and the approving  yells of neo-democrats.    I phoned K. Kobets' headquarters once more. Colonel-General  D. Volkogonov, people's deputy of the Russian Federation, picked  up the phone. In a cold and steel-edged voice he told me:    "The situation has changed. The President has signed an  order  as Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the Minister of Defense on the  storming of the House of Soviets and has assumed full  responsibility. We shall quell the putsch at any cost. Army  forces will establish order in Moscow.    When the people's deputies of Russia were led out of the  House of Soviets and were standing on the central, marble  staircase, many of them asked one another: "Why did they shell  the 'White House' in such a ruthless, demonstrative and  ostentatious manner"? So much has been written in the mass media  on the possibility of taking such buildings with special-purpose  forces and Alfa and Vympel subunits, without artillery or  outside fire. All the more since Alfa leaders and Deputy  Minister of Security V. Stepashin gave assurances that 30-40  minutes would be enough to take the building. We had experience:  the capture of the royal palace in Kabul and the operations in  Ossetia and Ingushetia. There were therefore other objectives. A  scenario worked out long before was being played out.    All of us clearly understood that the shelling and the fire  in the "White House" was an expensive show, a drama, staged on a  grand scale for the West. "See, respected colleagues, how much  work and bloodshed we have endured to achieve democracy and the  opportunity to continue the political and economic reforms,  while you keep waving promises in front of our faces but do not  provide financial assistance. This is not gentlemanly"!    The writers of the scenario forgot, however, that the House  of Soviets would remain in the mind of the population not just  in Russia but in the entire former USSR as the champion of their  interests, the interests of Russian-language citizens. The  Russians remember well who has betrayed them and how many times.    Why are those who came to defend the Constitution and the  law  during those terrible days from the Dniester Region, the Baltic  area and Central Asia regarded as butchers? By issuing the  unconstitutional Decree No. 1400 on the coup d'etat and  announcing that force would be used to break up the Supreme  Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies, B. Yeltsin himself  created all of the circumstances necessary for the arrival at  the House of Soviets not just of the supporting mass of  peaceable people with a certain political orientation but also  people prepared to defend the Constitution and the parliament  being dispersed, bearing weapons.    In the minds of the Russians the House of Soviets continues  to represent the citadel of the Congress of PEOPLE'S (I  particularly underscore that) Deputies. And the neo-democrats  wanted very much to erase the memory of the Supreme Soviet from  the minds of the people. In the minds of the Russians they were  firing on their memories. It is not surprising that the  government made haste in this matter as well. It adopted a  decision to perform restoration work in the "White House" by  November 1994 and to use the building as the center of  government. History will hardly forget that no matter who is  housed in that building, it is still the House of Soviets, that  it was there that an act of vandalism was perpetrated in the  public view, the shelling of Russia.    And now... the awarding of the order For Personal Valor to  Army Gen Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev, minister of defense of the  Russian Federation, and Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets, deputy  minister of defense of the Russian Federation, for valor and  heroism exhibited in the suppression of armed attempts at a coup  d'etat in Moscow on 3-4 October 1993. I am pained by the cynical  use of the lofty words "valor" and "heroism" in this Decree.  There is no such thing as heroes who fire upon the people.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Private View: Fairytales that frightened Tinseltown - Armistead Maupin's novels about life in San Francisco were a huge success, but no US producer dared film them. He explains why THERE WAS a young mother in the bookshop, pushing a baby-buggy. 'I've read all six of them,' she said. 'Twice.' She wiped the baby's nose. 'And I'm going to start them again.' She is one of the million readers of Armistead Maupin, the genial chronicler of bohemian San Francisco whose first volume, Tales of the City, will be serialised on British television from next week. And here is the paradox: no American media mogul dared to make or even co-finance a TV adaptation of the stories, even though they were written in the mid-1970s for a family newspaper. What viewers will see, therefore, is a British production, with American actors, of Maupin's gentle perversion of the American Dream. Why? Because, says the author, Hollywood is incapable of portraying sex or drugs or homosexuals except in the most lurid way. 'The studios tried to cannibalise my exotic storylines but not remain faithful to the spirit of the books.' One executive wanted the homosexual characters 'reduced to campy walk-ons'. Another suggested that the gay gynaecologist should be translated into a serial killer. Hollywood, Maupin said, lives in fear of 'narrow-minded fundamentalists who don't want to see homosexuals depicted as average human beings', yet his own postbag showed that the housewives of Iowa - or indeed suburban London - are a lot more sophisticated. He is probably right. But as a spokesman for gay rights, he is being perhaps a little disingenuous. The culture of American television - unlike that of Britain - has always been primarily commercial. A sympathetic screen treatment of Maupin's fairytale, precisely because it is oh-so-innocent, easily invites the commercially damaging charge of condoning vice. Maupin's message is 'Be Yourself' and his methods are observation, wit and the sparest, neatest prose. What Damon Runyon did for the New York underworld he has done for the West Coast sub-culture. You accuse Hollywood of distorting real life, I said, but the same could be said of Tales of the City - that it is a sterilised account. 'I don't think I have sanitised any aspect of gay life to the degree that it's unrecognisable,' he replied. 'I think the real threat of the book is that it's an affectionate look at all sorts of sexualities.' What about the bath houses, the sado-masochism, the gross promiscuity behind your cheerful picture? 'I have characters who go to the bath houses, yes, and I myself went to the bath houses. I did not see them as a dark and frightening. It's very hard to say that today and have anyone understand it. But I saw them as places of great joy and camaraderie. I wasn't into any kind of heavy S and M scene. I was able to be matter of fact because I knew that a lot of very average and nice people went there. They were like men's clubs, with sex.' He agreed that Tales of the City, written before the Aids earthquake, might look quaint today. (Later books in the sequence confront the epidemic). I asked: aren't you concerned that it is so out-of-date? 'No, I'm very happy that I recorded a moment in history that was a very true and pure time, and I'm happy to go on record as saying that I'm ashamed of nothing that I did at that time and very grateful that I landed in San Francisco when I did. Because it turned my life around.' I said I was hoping to interview Maupin the writer, not just Maupin the homosexual. He said he was grateful. 'I'm bored of discussing it as if I'm some sort of ape in a zoo. Sometimes I just want to say: 'Get over it. There are homosexuals in the world. It's not that sensational a subject after all, is it?'.' But it proved difficult to get over it. In a sense the subject made the writer; it is the refrain that sustains his big theme, that Being Different Is Normal. Even the midget actress who is the heroine of his latest novel, Maybe the Moon, can be construed allegorically as a proxy victim of 'homophobia'. Being homosexual was, Maupin said, 'the luckiest thing that happened to me. It gave me material that had not been tapped and it forced me to re-examine the rules of my life. In doing so I liberated myself, not only sexually, but in terms of taking control of my own destiny.' The eldest of three children, he had been taught from the age of eight to aspire to his father's law practice in Raleigh, North Carolina. The family was descended from Huguenots, belonged to the white aristocracy and boasted a Confederate general among its forebears. His English grandmother seems to have understood him: she told him the best figure he could cut in the world was as himself. He commemorates her tolerance in the character of Anna Madrigal, the landlady of Barbary Lane around whom his plot is spun. Armistead Jones Maupin Jnr. went to the naval officers candidate school in Charleston, South Carolina, after leaving university. To fill in time, he worked for the local TV station, then managed by the arch-conservative Senator Jesse Helms. In Charleston, aged 25, he first went to bed with a man. After a Mediterranean posting he volunteered for Vietnam. 'In some twisted way I was trying to prove my manhood and the quickest way I could think of was to go to war.' Proving it to whom? 'My father. His attitude was that the world thoughtfully provides a war for every generation, and Vietnam was my war.' He was appointed naval liaison officer at an army base. 'I didn't kill anyone. I wasn't in direct combat but there was fighting all around. It wasn't a gruelling, traumatic experience. It was mostly living in a small village and being the communications officer.' Did it make a man of you? The irony was only half intended. He laughed. 'No, I'm glad to say. It made a more interesting man of me. I enjoyed the experience of seeing that part of the world and other Americans not of my class. I was a good officer. I was decorated: the Navy Commendation Medal. Nothing heroic, just a pat on the back for a job well done.' Afterwards he returned to Vietnam as a volunteer to build houses for war veterans in the village of Cat Lai. Back in Charleston, Maupin felt stifled. He headed to San Francisco as a reporter for the Associated Press. He was, he said, 'a lousy reporter. I was always tinkering with the facts in an effort to make the story better.' He lost the job, worked as a letter-writer for an Episcopal minister, sold silk in a shop on Union Street, and freelanced. Then he persuaded the San Francisco Chronicle to employ him to write fiction. 'I trimmed the fat off my prose very fast, and learned the techniques of suspense. I was forced to write 800 words a day; I told myself, it's going to be on the bottom of someone's birdcage tomorrow so this doesn't have to be Balzac.' A life of gay abandon ended when Aids struck San Francisco. In any case, Maupin was settling down. 'My grandmother said don't you dare get married until you are 30.' What age did you get married? 'Far too late. Forty'. That was nine years ago. The man he settled down with, Terry Anderson, was HIV-positive and last year suffered his first opportunistic infection, the sign of full-blown Aids. I asked if life was black. 'No. Even knowing that Terry has Aids we still agree that it's the happiest time of our lives because we're very much in love with each other, and we feel more that way every day.' He will die, I said. What will that do to you? 'It'll be hard. As much as I empathise and feel for his situation I sometimes remind myself he'll have me but I won't always have him.' Partly in anticipation of this impending personal calamity Maupin's next novel will be much more autobiographical. I asked if his purpose was to 'normalise' homosexuality 'No, it's broader than that. My work is about finding the core of common humanity in all of us. And I love to push to the limits. I love to take the most extreme examples of humankind and show them to be every bit as real as the reader.' But is normalisation at the bottom of it? 'I suppose, yes. Call it 'humanisation'. I feel perfectly normal. It's all about self realisation. It has to do with finding out exactly who you are and presenting that person to the world as honestly and joyfully as you can. And I think I am a marvellous example of how well that can pay off for you.' So the message is 'Come out in Charleston', is it? 'Coming out in Charleston is the message. I didn't do it in Charleston. I had to move to San Francisco to do it. 'But you can't just stay in San Francisco. Terry and I have to walk down the street in every city in the world and then we have to be certain about who we are. No matter where you go, there's always going to be someone asking about your wife and kiddies, and you're going to have to decide whether or not to lie about yourself. 'I don't think this just applies to gay people. A lot of straight people make themselves miserable by keeping secrets that eventually poison them. Secrets invariably imply a kind of shame about oneself, and that shame can destroy you. 'You really are only as sick as you are secret - and that applies to everyone.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 31 March the Central Election Commission  reported that 801 candidates got through to the runoffs. Of  these, 371 persons were nominated by the electorate, 254 by  working collectives and 176 by parties.    Among the latter the Communist Party is the leader -- 108  candidates (27 candidates in Donetsk oblast, 14 in Lugansk  oblast and eight in Kharkov oblast).    Other parties are significantly lagging behind the leader:  Rukh -- 26 persons; the Ukrainian Republican Party and the  Socialist Party of Ukraine -- 17 representatives from each; the  Party of Labor -- three persons; the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists -- two persons; the Democratic Party of Ukraine,  the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party and the Christian  Democratic Party of Ukraine -- one representative from each.    However, the Central Electoral Commission pointed out that  these figures did not reflect the absolute representation of the  parties because many political party members were nominated  either by the electorate or by working collectives.</p>

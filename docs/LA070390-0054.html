			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> The Saddest Muppet Show: Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Oscar the Grouch went to St.  Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday for a memorial service for Muppet creator  Jim Henson, who died in May in New York. But Kermit the Frog, whose voice was  that of the puppet master, was not there.  </P> <P> Instead, Big Bird, Henson's 7-foot-tall creation from "Sesame Street," walked  past the choir in the 17th-Century cathedral and sang Kermit's theme song,  "Bein' Green." He was followed by a recording of Henson singing Kermit's  "Rainbow Connection."  </P> <P> Well-wishers were asked not to wear black to the service. Henson's family said  the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for the puppeteer's  life as a traditional memorial service. A death-bed message from Henson, read  by his son Brian, urged people to be good to each other and enjoy life: "It  feels strange writing this while I am alive, but it sure would be hard after I  go."

I. </F> Yakovenko]    [Text]As a result of a number of natural  disasters and technogenic accidents, global changes are  presently occurring in man's environment, and this makes it  necessary to develop a new scientific discipline, ecological  psychology. Formation of radioecological psychology is taking  place within its limits. The subject of radioecological  psychology consists of objective facts, patterns and mechanisms  of development of the human personality, his mental activity in  the presence of complex interweaving of radioecological and  sociopsychological factor related to the major nuclear accident  at the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power plant]. Under such  conditions, there is dramatic and prolonged mandatory change the  lifestyle of millions of people, which leads to often  misunderstood and largely dangerous changes in the mental aspect  of their life.    Radioecological psychology is called upon to demonstrate the  patterns and mechanisms of occurring changes, assess possible  consequences and propose adequate ways and means of rendering  psychological aid to people with consideration of their age-,  sex-related, individual psychological and sociopsychological  distinctions. Thus, radioecological psychology is an applied  scientific discipline.    The distinctions of the subject and actual execution of  deployed research determine the complex nature of formation of  radio-ecological psychology, which is closely linked with  psychophysiology, general, medical, age-related, pedagogic, and  social psychology, as well as sociology, pedagogics, law and  other disciplines. It utilizes the techniques of experimental  psychology, psychohygiene, psychotherapy, etc. At the same time,  within the mainstream of this scientific direction, it is  developing its own theory, methodology, specific methods of  investigation and correction of impaired mental development and  behavior of people who have suffered from the sequelae of the  radio-ecological disaster.    The social relevance and humanitarian orientation of this  discipline are instrumental in close interaction between  scientists and practitioners in different specialties residing  not only in affected country but also in distant foreign lands.  Beneficial scientific ties are being established between  psychologists of Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine. Psychologists  of England, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, the United States,  France, Japan and other countries are displaying interest in  these problems and expressing the desire to give scientific and  practical aid [8]. The ``Children of Chernobyl'' project is  being implemented under the aegis of UNESCO; it involves  construction of a number of community centers for  sociopsychological rehabilitation of children up to the age of 7  years (in the Ukraine, in Vishnevyy, Kiev Oblast), and  preparations are under way for opening a UNESCO international  laboratory in Kiev to work on overcoming the socio-psychological  and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster.    There is a history to the formation of radioecological  psychology in the Ukraine. In the early days and months after  the accident, it was impossible to determine the nature and  extent of impact of the radioecological disaster on social and  psychological phenomena, or to predict their dynamics without  appropriate studies.    The earliest observations in 1986 (for example, those of A.  U. Kharash from Moscow State University), and subsequent  purposeful studies (in particular, of the staff of the Ukrainian  Psychological Research Institute in 1987) were carried out by  scientists at their own initiative [9]. The findings gave cause  for serious concern about the social and psychological  consequences of the accident. The results of observations,  interrogations and special studies were reported in the form of  papers and accounts relayed to superior agencies; however, the  reaction to them was quite restrained, since the findings  contradicted the official assessment of the sequelae of the  Chernobyl accident.    A comparative study of more than 1300 3d, 5th, 7th and 9th  grades students -- namely of: a) children evacuated from the  30-km zone, b) those who remained in the zone of radioactive  contamination in Zhitomir, Kiev and Chernigov oblasts, c) those  residing in Kiev, d) a control group from Poltava Oblast --  carried out by 16 staff members of the Ukrainian Psychological  Research Institute in 1987 revealed a number of statistically  significant differences between them. Thus, the exposed  students revealed decline in indicators of attention, memory,  work capacity, impairment in volitional-emotional and emotional  areas [1]. All this was indicative of sustained stress. Children  and adolescents evacuated from the 30-km zone were in a  particularly difficult situation: about 50 percent of them  experienced serious difficulties in socio-psychological  adjustment to their new place of residence [2, 3].    A small research team was formed in 1988, which became the  Children of Chernobyl scientific and practical center in 1990  (headed by S. I. Yakovenko), to carry out further investigations  at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute. Several  articles and methodological recommendations were prepared on the  basis of their studies [4, 5, 6].    The next step toward deeper investigation of the  socio-psychological consequences of the accident at the  Chernobyl AES was the Union-Republic Children of Chernobyl  program approved in 1991. In spite of organizational and  financial difficulties, it was possible to recruit the nation's  leading scientific institutions to implement it. In the Ukraine,  the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute was appointed as  the head organization (director: A. V. Kirichuk), and 18 of the  42 topical problems of this program were worked on there. The  results of its research and clinical work carried out in 1991  were summarized at the interregional scientific conference on  ``Socio-psychological Rehabilitation of Children and Adolescents  Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster,'' which convened in February  1992 in Kiev [8].    The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows:  The accident at the Chernobyl AES caused catastrophic changes in  the ecological situation, radical breakdown of the age-old  lifestyle, system of relations, and made substantial adjustments  in people's value orientations (first of all, those dealing with  attitude toward the environment, society, health and rearing  children).    The psycho-traumatic situation that developed after the  Chernobyl disaster enhanced "centrifugal tendencies" in  personality development of children and adolescents, which was  manifested by a tendency toward accentuation of temperament,  diminished resistance to stress, increased aggressiveness and  conflict in some, passivity, asthenization, formation of  consummatory and pension-neurosis mindsets in others.    On the whole, the following developmental disturbances were  typical in children and adolescents who suffered the  consequences of the Chernobyl accident: --physical:  asthenization, deterioration of indicators of physical  readiness, early development of chronic diseases; --mental:  stress, deadaptation, diminished attention, memory, work  capacity (including mental work), volitional and emotional  disturbances, nostalgia for the past and uncertainty about the  future, diminished motivation, distorted self-appraisal, and  others; --spiritual: existential crisis, difficulties in  personal and professional self-assertion, formation and  persistence of the helpless victim complex doomed to a short and  difficult life; --social: increased aggressiveness, conflict;  social apathy, difficulties in communicating (particularly in  children evacuated from the 30-km condemned zone).    In other words, there was a large number of "children who  had  gone through a lot," which is not normal in peacetime.    At the same time, what had been experienced was, in a number  of instances, instrumental in intensive formation of the  personality of affected children and adolescents, appreciable  improvement in family relations, and others. However, the  existing positive facts have not yet been reliably aired in  psychological publications.    The following tasks moved to the fore in solving problems of  sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents in  the zone of the Chernobyl catastrophe: --determination of  factors and conditions that arose because of the Chernobyl  disaster and prevent proper development of children and  adolescents in the accident zone, and their relationship to  other concurrently existing factors; --establishment of patterns  of impact of the aggregate of all existing factors on mental  development of different territorial and age groups of victims;  --elaboration of an integral concept of providing for proper  development of children and adolescents in the zone of the  Chernobyl disaster; determination of scientific ally validated  ways and means of rendering the necessary psychological aid to  victims.    The most important factors that hinder proper development of  children and adolescents in the accident zone are: --external  and internal radioactive irradiation that is deleterious to  health and particularly dangerous for children born in 1986;  --unsatisfactory level of medical care of affected children,  only 15 percent of whom are under clinical observation;  --inadequate information given to the public about the  radioecological situation, safety measures, health status, and  results of scientists' studies; --distorted image of the  Chernobyl disaster in the mass media, which are transformed into  "mass mental traumatization" media, continued circulation of  various rumors and conjectures that initiate social stress and  personal anxiety, also affecting children; --deterioration of  sociodemographic population indicators in the accident zone,  which is being abandoned by the best educated people who are  replaced by those who expect only benefits, housing and high  wages; --erosion of family-relative relations, prolonged  separation of parents and children during vacations,  impossibility of restoring previous forms of organization of  everyday work and leisure; --material and technical difficulties  in organizing the educational-rearing process in public  education institutions situated in the zone of rigid radiation  monitoring (crowded cafeterias, no gyms, ancillary facilities,  technical educational equipment, etc.), shortage of qualified  personnel, overfatigue of pedagogues; --inadequate efficacy of  sociopsychological rehabilitation of children and adolescents  during vacations, its virtual absence at their place of  residence; --shortage of funds and resources to implement laws  and enforceable enactments called upon to provide social  protection of victims, diminished attention given to the latter  on the part of local authorities and the world community.    In assessing the prospects for overcoming the  sociopsychological sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl  AES, we must state that: 1) the sources of radiation hazard have  not disappeared and their impact will probably last for tens of  years; new victims of the disaster have also been found who were  previously convinced that they were not involved in its  consequences; 2) it is impossible to provide all victims with  normal living conditions, good medical care, work in their  special field, to compensate them for the material damage; 3)  social tension persists in society due to the ``unfair''  distribution of benefits, humanitarian aid, etc.; 4) victims do  not trust the authorities, mass media, scientists and  specialists; 5) it was found that the victims have extremely  limited opportunities to solve their problems; nor is there any  effective State sociopsychological and legal aid for these  people.    The reason for the existing situation is not only that the  necessary funds and resources are wanting, but also there is a  shortage of constructive ideas to be systematically implement,  or a scientifically validated conception for eradication of the  sociopsychological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl  AES.    In this respect, the only exception is the concept of  providing for proper mental development of children and  adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster, which was  developed at the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute and  approved by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. However, it  requires further definition, since there are still not enough  scientific data for accurate assessment of the  sociopsychological and psychological-pedagogic sequelae of the  Chernobyl disaster and prediction of further development of the  situation.    The information we have to date is fragmentary, and for this  reason it is dangerous to draw far-reaching conclusions on its  basis. Only one thing is apparent: we can make a distinction of  at least nine subgroups among affected children, which differ in  number, relocation, proportion of radioecological and  psychotraumatic factors, and how the stress situation is  experienced. They are: --1) those evacuated from the 30-km  accident zone in 1986; --2) those living or who have lived in  the zone of mandatory relocation; --3) those referred to the  guaranteed relocation zone; --4) those living in regions of  continuous radiometric monitoring; --5) those living on "safety  islands," situated in the accident zone (Kiev, Slavugich and  others), who do not, however, agree with this assessment of the  situation, as well as: --6) children of "eradicators," who were  born after their parents had fulfilled their civic duty; --7)  "grandchildren of Chernobyl," i.e., children of the grown  representatives of the above subgroups; --8) children and  adolescents in "clean" territories, who were exposed to the risk  of internal irradiation due to consumption of contaminated food;  --9) children born in 1986 who were the most affected by the  radiation factor.    A considerable number of children and adolescents of the  Chernobyl zone were given the status of victims and have the  right to expect the State's aid; the rest who have, so to speak,  fallen through the cracks, have not undergone humanitarian  socio-psychological expert evaluation. The reason is clear: not  a single decision or enforceable enactment underwent expert  humanitarian sociopsychological evaluation.    The program of further scientific and clinical work in  1992-1995 aimed at eradicating the socio-psychological  consequences of the Chernobyl disaster covers the following:  --organization of monitoring of the sociopsychological  situation, mental development of a representative sample of  children and adolescents in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster,  starting a distributed data bank in order to assess the  situation and predict its future dynamics; --expert humanitarian  evaluation of decisions pertaining to provision of appropriate  living conditions for children and adolescents affected by the  consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES, organization  of the educational-rearing process in and beyond the area where  they reside; --development, experimental trial and adoption of  psychological-pedagogic recommendations to workers in public  education and health care institutions, and parents of affected  children; --establishment of an infrastructure of specialized  institutions for socio-psychological rehabilitation of affected  children and adolescents, provision of psychological  consultations for them; --training and advanced training of  personnel (clinical psychologists, pedagogues and social  workers), providing them with scientific-methodological and  psychological aid.    These tasks have been fulfilled to varying extents. In 1992,  Kiev State University handed out diplomas of clinical  psychologists to 140 people who were referred there from the 5  most affected oblasts of the Ukraine. They returned to their  homes to work with children in public education institutions and  specialized psychorehabilitation offices, the network of which  is already beginning to proliferate. In the future, it is  planned to graduate 60 clinical psychologists annually from the  specialized department of Kiev State University, who will be  involved in implementation of the Children of Chernobyl program.    An agreement has been reached to organize training of  psychologists from affected regions of the Ukraine at Fordham  University in New York and the New Hope Guild Center also  located there, which specializes in sociopsychological  adaptation of migrants.    A program for organizing a network of regional  psychorehabilitation centers in the Ukraine, a decree on  regional centers and prototype plan to outfit them have been  developed.    Methodological recommendations have been elaborated for:  parents of affected children (M. I. Alekseyeva), preschool  institutions for children from the zone of radioactive  contamination (S. Ye. Kulachkovskaya), different types of  schools situated in different zones of the Chernobyl disaster  (I. L. Fedorishina, Yu. M. Shvalb and others), non-educational  institutions called upon to provide conditions for creative  development of children and adolescents living in radiation  zones and unable to spend their free time in the usual way (V.  V. Rybalka), as well as workers in health camps and rest homes  where children of the Chernobyl zone spend long periods of time  (M. I. Borishevskiy, I. M. Turchaninova).    Much work has been done in the field of methodological and  software-hardware support of monitoring the sociopsychological  situation, mental development of children affected by the  sequelae of the Chernobyl disaster, and managing a distributed  data bank (A. M. Karpukhina, V. G. Panok).    In 1993, the Ukrainian Psychological Research Institute is  joining in a comprehensive investigation of the adult population  affected by the sequelae of the accident at the Chernobyl  Nuclear Power Plant.

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (23): Geared for change - Lorries THE LORRY industry is going through a radical change, due in part to the impact of the recession, but also as a result of a new, strategic offensive by truck manufacturers. They aim to broaden substantially their involvement in the market, so that they play a dominant role in the way in which fleets finance, and, subsequently, maintain their vehicles. The truck companies are setting up their own finance companies to provide operators with everything from basic hire purchase to full contract hire packages. On much of the Continent, the move will allow them to take the lead in the development of contract hire services; in the UK, where contract hire is more developed, it means they will challenge the established giants, such as BRS and Ryder, head-on. In the UK, the move is also a short-term necessity, to plug the gap left by traditional lenders - the high street banks and finance houses  - which have fled the market. Barrie Cload of Volvo Truck Finance (VTF) says these lenders have 'lost their shirts' in trucks over the past 18 months. Volvo was first to develop its own contract-hire and finance arm. In 1988, just 5 per cent of Volvo trucks went on the road with a guaranteed buy-back from VTF; in 1991 the figure was one in four. VTF's receivables total around Pounds 70m, and the company says it has not yet reached top gear. Companies such as ERF, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland, and Scania have followed Volvo's lead. Mercedes-Benz is thought to be planning the most ambitious attack on the contract hire market yet with the formal launch expected in May this year. Underlying this strategic shift is the desire of manufacturers and their dealers - in many cases wholly-owned - to retain control of the profit opportunities available in selling and servicing lorries throughout the life of the vehicle. The truck industry is following the example of General Motors in the US car market during the mid to late 1980s. The company was making minimal profits from US car manufacturing, but the financing of those vehicles proved highly profitable. Truck manufacturers will tailor contracts to the realities of transport much more closely than traditional lenders, according to Mr Cload. For example, a haulier may wish to finance a vehicle over five years, with the possibility of getting out after one year, if he loses the transport contract, and reducing the cost of a repair and maintenance agreement using the part exchange value of traded-in trucks. 'These deals are a million light years away from what finance companies were offering. We are to a finance house what a merchant bank is to the bank in the high street.' While only a proportion of operators will favour full contract hire, manufacturers will be attacking in-house workshops more strongly than they ever have in the past. Pence per mile repair and maintenance contracts have become cheaper, partly as a result of commercial pressure to cut rates but also due to increased reliability of the trucks and a long-term drive to bring business back into dealers' workshops. Contract charges will continue to fall, in cash terms, over the next two years, Mr Cload predicts. They are also available over much longer periods, giving operators fixed maintenance costs for five or more years. In the past three months, Renault has broadened the concept by actively marketing repair and maintenance contracts on used lorries. Several factors will favour the case for using dealers. Skilled fitters will become increasingly scarce, and therefore hard to attract. Electronics on vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and there will be pressure to invest in expensive diagnostic equipment. Some tasks, for example setting up the air suspension on some Leyland DAF lorries, can be done only by using specialist equipment. As vehicles become more reliable, the convenience benefits of in-house workshops are reduced. However, British hauliers are proving much more reluctant to part with their workshops than their continental counterparts. UK operations are renowned as the most demanding in Europe, and the rigorous legal requirements for mechanical inspections, typically every six weeks, are unmatched in Europe. As a result, trucks have to be in the workshop more often. Taylors of Martley, a haulier running 100 trucks based near Worcester, is committed to having a workshop at its main depot, but recognises the increasing pressures to stay ahead of dealerships. Unusually, the family-owned firm has persisted with a three-year apprentice scheme throughout the 1980s to ensure it has skilled fitters. 'The trend in truck electronics will encourage us to specialise on one make, though,' director Stephen Martley says. 'Having your own workshops usually only starts to pay dividends in the second half of a vehicle's life, when maintenance costs start rising and niggling faults start to appear. I doubt if firms with 10-15 trucks will have their own workshops, in future.' Old lorries, unlike, old soldiers, rarely fade away gracefully - either they die suddenly or they cost a fortune in workshop charges. The arrival of manufacturers alongside contract hire specialist companies coincides with a classic credit squeeze on many operators, and intense scrutiny of costs at all companies. There has been such a jolt to business confidence and profits, that many firms will feel reluctant, or unable to buy vehicles and suppliers predict a new surge in demand for contract hire. Many operators will insist that in-house operations are still the cheapest, and the safest in the long term. However, guaranteed fixed-costs for truck fleets has rarely been as attractive an option or as widely available.</p>

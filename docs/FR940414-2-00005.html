			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, if the placement of bait should become a land or resource management issue and if it is determined that the State regulations governing baiting would not protect resources in an area adequately or would otherwise be inconsistent with the applicable forest plan or conflict with federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act, then, under the proposed policy, the authorized officer would issue an order to close the area to baiting. The authorized officer also could close an area to baiting after considering the likely impact on a site-specific basis on water quality, public health and sanitation, or the potential threat to the viability of wildlife. Finally, the proposed policy would explicitly prohibit the practice of issuing a special use authorization to individuals for the specific act of placing bait on National Forest system lands for hunting purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The approach contemplated in the proposed policy maintains protection of national forest resources. First, under the terms of the Memorandums of Understanding with the State fish and wildlife or game agencies, the Forest Service continuously participates in the review and adoption of State game regulations as they affect National Forest System land or resources. Second, the proposed policy would provide the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor with the flexibility and discretion to determine if baiting should be prohibited in a specific location. Finally, if a hunter, in placing bait to attract resident game creates litter through improper placement or untimely removal of bait in violation of State regulations or Forest Service closure orders, the agency has the authority under its regulations at 36 CFR 261.11 to cite the hunter for violating the prohibition on litter. If such bait results in violation of State regulations, the agency also has authority to cite the hunter for violation of 36 CFR 261.8, and agency employees routinely do so where such violations occur. In short, the agency's proposed approach (1) relies on existing relationships with each State, (2) prevents duplicative regulation by Federal and State agencies, and (3) provide site-specific environmental safeguards to address those situations where baiting would have an adverse site-specific effect on National Forest System land or resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed baiting policy would be an amendment to the Forest Service Manual. Accordingly, pursuant to 36 CFR part 216, the text of the proposed policy is set out at the end of this notice. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption of a final policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Publication of this proposed policy is an integral part of the agency's scoping process by which it determines the scope and level of any environmental effects of proposed actions. According to the agency NEPA procedures, scoping is required for all proposed actions, including those that might be categorically excluded. Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Service-wide administrative procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This proposed policy would provide administrative instructions to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of placing bait for resident game. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this policy falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. The agency particularly invites comment on this preliminary finding. Following consideration of public comments, the Forest Service will make a final determination regarding the level of environmental analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This policy will not result in addition paperwork.

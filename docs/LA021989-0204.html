			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SAYS IT TAPPED CALLS OF PALESTINIAN DEFENDANTS, LAWYERS  </P> <P> A clandestine arm of the federal judiciary eavesdropped on telephone  conversations between Los Angeles-area Palestinians charged with subversion and  visa violations and their attorneys who are fighting to keep them from being  deported, the government has disclosed.  </P> <P> In revealing the surveillance, the Justice Department said, in effect, that no  constitutional rights were violated because "none of those conversations  involve privileged attorney-client communications."  </P> <P> The lead attorney for the Palestinians, Dan Stormer of Los Angeles, branded the  surveillance "unlawful." He said defense lawyers will make an effort in federal  court to force the government to produce information that laid the foundation  for the wire taps.  </P> <P> But the government said such exhibits must remain sealed because they "contain  extremely significant documents concerning sensitive intelligence sources and  methods used by U.S. intelligence agencies (and) would damage the national  security of this nation."  </P> <P> Stormer charged that the government misused its eavesdropping powers,  authorized under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, when it tapped  the Palestinians' phones and picked up conversations with their lawyers.  </P> <P> "Under common law, the Constitution's Sixth Amendment (which spells out the  rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions) and state and federal evidence  codes, the conversations between an attorney and a client are protected,"  Stormer said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, he said, the Surveillance Act is aimed at individuals involved in  criminal activity and "acting on behalf of a foreign power. Our clients have  not engaged in any unlawful acts. They've only engaged in their First Amendment  right of freedom of speech."  </P> <P> The Justice Department memorandums, which also described the use of informants  and video taping of one of the defendants, were filed last week in U.S.  Immigration Court in Los Angeles in response to requests by defense lawyers.  </P> <P> A Justice Department spokeswoman said Saturday that the department will have no  further comment on the surveillance disclosures.  </P> <P> The volatile case, which pits the Justice Department against civil rights and  Arab-American groups, involves eight aliens who were accused under the  McCarran-Walter Act of belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine  Liberation Organization with a history of terrorism.  </P> <P> All eight -- seven Palestinians and a Kenyan -- have denied membership in the  faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). None were  charged with any criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers raised the surveillance issue in June, 1987, in an Immigration  Court filing alleging that they and their clients "have experienced unusual and  inexplicable noises and clicking sounds during their telephone conversations."  </P> <P> The government filings do not say whether the aliens are still under  surveillance or how many conversations were monitored.  </P> <P> The wiretaps were authorized under the Carter Administration law designed to  allow covert gathering of information for national security purposes. Wiretap  orders were issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which  operates in a closely guarded courtroom in the main Justice Department building  in Washington, which is closed to defendants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began in 1985  </P> <P> In the government papers, a U.S. immigration attorney, Michael P. Lindemann,  said the FBI carried out the surveillance as far back as July 31, 1985, when it  began recording the telephone numbers called by one of the defendants, Julie  Mungai, 30. She is the Kenyan-born wife of Khader Hamide, 34, of Los Angeles,  one of the case's two leading defendants.  </P> <P> Additionally, Lindemann said in a declaration, government lawyers "viewed a  brief portion of one video tape, without sound, taken in the course of one  surveillance."  </P> <P> Government memorandums said that monitoring also took place by "consensual  electronic surveillance," which involves the use of informants.  </P> <P> Lindemann said "that while attorneys of record in this case have been  overheard" talking to the Palestinians, whose phones were tapped, "only a  single conversation was in connection with this case, and that single  conversation did not involve attorney-client communication and was not  otherwise privileged." In any case, he said, the material would not be used in  the deportation proceedings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deportations Delayed  </P> <P> Although the eight aliens were arrested and briefly jailed in January, 1987,  legal maneuvering has delayed their deportation proceedings, now scheduled to  resume in May.  </P> <P> Charges against six of the eight have been reduced to miscellaneous visa  violations; and proceedings against two of these six were then halted when it  appeared that they would be granted amnesty.  </P> <P> But deportation hearings are scheduled to proceed against two of the  Palestinians whom the government alleged are local PFLP leaders -- Hamide and  Michel Shehadeh, 32, of Long Beach. Both have been charged under  McCarran-Walter with "unlawful damage, injury or destruction of property."  </P> <P> Complicating the government's case, however, is a major free-speech decision  last December in Los Angeles by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who  ruled that the McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions were  unconstitutional. The government is expected to appeal.  </P></p>

The Standard Forms 1193A and 1194 will be used to establish and modify letters of credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) SBDCs shall utilize the Standard Form 5805 in order to draw down funds. It is critical that recipients ``draw down'' only those funds required to meet their estimated or actual expenses. The frequency of drawdowns and the amount of the cash-on-hand balance are monitored by examining the Standard Form 272 (Federal Cash Transactions Report), submitted quarterly by the recipient. Repeated drawdowns in excess of immediate cash needs may result in the cancellation of the LOC. In the event any interest results from the deposit of any drawdowns in an interest-bearing account, SBDCs, other than state government sponsored SBDCs, must report and return such interest annually to the SBA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;130.600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cooperative Agreement.

The Cooperative Agreement shall set forth the programmatic and fiscal responsibilities of the recipient organization and the SBA, and describe the scope of the project to be funded as well as the budget of the program year covered by the Cooperative Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Principles for determining applicable administrative requirements are contained in the following OMB Circulars and are applicable to the Cooperative Agreement: A&hyph;110 (for programs administered by educational institutions and nonprofit organizations) and A&hyph;102 (for programs administered by State and local governments). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;130.620 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Revisions and amendments to Cooperative Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requested revisions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A revision to the Cooperative Agreement may be requested in writing by the recipient organization at any time during the Agreement period. These revisions will normally relate to changes in the scope, work or funding during the specified budget year. Any request for revision must be submitted on an SF&hyph;424 ``Application for Federal Assistance,'' signed by the recipient organization's ``authorized representative,'' and include a revised budget and budget narrative, if applicable. Any revision to the Cooperative Agreement must be mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and the responsible SBA district office and be approved by the AA/SBDCs.

The Cooperative Agreement under the section entitled ``Prior Approval'' shall list the proposed actions which require Project Officer concurrence, approval of the AA/SBDCs and amendment of the Cooperative Agreement. No application for an amendment submitted after the Cooperative Agreement has been issued shall be effective until it is approved and incorporated into the Cooperative Agreement. Revisions which require amendments shall include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any change in project scope or objectives; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The addition or deletion of any subgrants or contracts; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The addition of any new budget line items; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Budget revisions and fund reallocations which exceed the limitations established by applicable administrative regulations or OMB Circulars, either individually or in the aggregate with other such revisions or allocations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Any proposed sole-source or one-bid contracts exceeding the limits established by applicable regulations or OMB Circulars; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The carryover from one Budget period to the next Budget period of unobligated, unexpended SBA funds allocable under the Cooperative Agreement to nonrecurring, nonservable bona fide needs of the SBDC network as provided in the applicable OMB Circular and the Annual Program announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Revisions which do not require amendments to Cooperative Agreement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Budget revisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Revision may be requested by the recipient organization at any time and requires approval of the SBA Project Officer in the SBA district office and the AA/SBDCs as prescribed by OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment J, or 13 CFR 143.30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reallocation of funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Reallocation of fund shall be conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment J, or 13 CFR 143.30.

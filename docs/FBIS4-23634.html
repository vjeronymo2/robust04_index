			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Head of State General Sani Abacha </F> on the anniversary of the annulled 12 June 1993 elections; place  and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow Nigerians, on Thursday, 18 November 1993, in  my maiden national broadcast, I referred to what had become  obvious to every concerned Nigerian. Our beloved country was  adrift, threatened with imminent anarchy and disintegration.  Some component parts of the nation threatened secession.  Critical elements within the society openly invited the Armed  Forces to intervene to secure the territorial integrity and  sovereignty of the Nigerian state and to stem the tide of  dangerous national descent into chaos and disorder.    As a result of this nationwide concern about the state of  our  country and following intensive consultation with a wide range  of interests, including the principal actors of the 12 June  crisis, the Armed Forces, along with other patriotic Nigerians,  took the initiative of (?devising) a way forward by forming a  government of a grand national coalition. To facilitate  reconciliation, this coalition comprised eminent political  leaders from all shades of political opinion. It is, therefore,  clear that this administration came in to perform a mission of  national salvation.    Fellow Nigerians, we have undertaken to lay a solid  foundation for the growth of genuine democracy in our country.  This is the agenda of our administration. We are determined to  accomplish this historic task firmly, objectively, decisively,  and with all sincerity of purpose. Guided by mature advice from  the best political insides available in the country, we  considered all options that could move the nation forward. Some  of the options were practical but undemocratic. Others were  emotional, among a vocal few, but not practicable.    After exhaustive appraisal of all the options, we recognized  as our best choice the convention of the constitutional  conference. The constitutional conference is an opportunity for  the duly elected of representatives of all Nigerians to come  together for unfettered national dialogue and discussions on a  wide spectrum of issues confronting us as a nation. I have  already signed into law the decree establishing the conference.  On 27 June, I shall inaugurate the constitutional conference.    The conference agenda has been derived from more than 1,000  memoranda received from individuals and groups from all strata  of our society across the length and breadth of this country.  Let me state categorically our firm determination to see to the  successful implementation of the program towards democratization.    We must warn that our pursuit of this noble objective is  unequivocal and cannot be compromised. Therefore, those  elements in our society engaged in acts of confrontation,  sabotage, rumor mongering, false alarm, and distortion of facts  must bear in mind the full consequences of their acts of  disservice to the nation. They must also be prepared to face the  full force of the law of the land.    This country is greater than any individual or group. No  individual or group will be permitted to hold this country to  ransom. We have had enough and we have seen enough. All  well-meaning Nigerians condemn the attempt of some individuals  and groups seeking to translate their personal ambition into a  national trauma. It is clear that the constitutional conference  would afford any group or individual with genuine grievances  ample opportunity to discuss them. Choosing the path of  confrontation and subversion at this time of our national  history would not be tolerated. Such acts would be sternly  punished.    We acknowledge the interest demonstrated by the  international  community concerning our great nation. We know most of you are  doing so with very good intentions. We urge you to continue to  appreciate fully the magnitude of our problems and give support  to our determination and courage to grapple with them. We,  indeed, hope that in the true spirit of our national interest  you should do nothing to encourage the idle dreams of  self-seeking individuals or the parochial interests of small  opportunistic groups within our society who are bent on acts of  destabilization under various covers.    This administration appreciates the political and economic  crises confronting us today but we are determined to contain and  control their painful effects on our people. Indeed, the  economic policy of this administration has been realistic in  appraising both the depth of the crisis as well as in offering  genuine short- and long-term solutions.    Fellow Nigerians, this administration has a solemn  responsibility to maintain the corporate existence of Nigeria.  We have a responsibility to achieve this objective through the  enthronement of the principle of justice, equity, and fair play.  Our mission is to ensure that we establish a very enduring  democratic base that will form the bedrock for a sustainable,  nationally acceptable governance for our nation. We enjoin all  patriotic Nigerians to participate in this great national  endeavor.    Government wishes to thank all our citizens for their  patience and show of understanding at this critical moment of  our history. We ask all members of our society to continue to be  peaceful and law-abiding. This administration wishes to  reassure everybody of our commitment and determination to  protect all lives and property. Long live the Federal Republic  of Nigeria! Thank you.</p>

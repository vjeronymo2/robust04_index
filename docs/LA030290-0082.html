			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: BLUE SUEDE, GRAY FLANNEL  </P> <P> Elvis impersonator Raymond Michael could teach the King a thing or two about  balancing life styles. Since 1978, the 36-year-old entertainer and his band,  The American Legends of Rock 'N' Roll, have performed all over the world in  tributes to Presley. Yet during the week, Mr. Hebel, as he is known to his  students, teaches sixth grade and chorus at Chaparral Middle School in  Moorpark.  </P> <P> Tomorrow night, Hebel will again bring his show to where it all began when he  performs a benefit concert at his alma mater, California Lutheran University in  Thousand Oaks. For this year's appearance, Hebel will add 16 musicians  including a horn section, and several backup singers.  </P> <P> "I'm doing a tribute to him. I'm not trying to be him," said Hebel, who  performed as Elvis for about five years before the King's death. He prefers the  term illusionist.  </P> <P> Hebel has performed in Canada, Guam, Japan, Australia and the South Pacific.  "It is one of the most popular shows we've had at the park," said Robert Deuel,  a publicist at Knott's Berry Farm.  </P> <P> Trained as a lyric baritone, Raymond Michael Hebel was a music student at Cal  Lutheran. In the fall of 1972, he represented the football team on a panel of  student guinea pigs for a hypnotist who was entertaining the student body.  Until then, his knowledge of Presley songs was limited to "Blue Suede Shoes,"  which his roommate sang constantly.  </P> <P> Hebel said he remembers nothing of what happened after the hypnotist suggested  he portray Elvis -- he brought the house down in a performance of "Blue Suede  Shoes."  </P> <P> At the urging of friends and professors, Hebel said he turned down offers of  singing jobs with opera companies to perfect his Elvis show.  </P> <P> People are always amazed at the difference between Hebel's alter ego and the  tall, polite, soft-spoken person they meet before a performance. He can remove  the wig and sideburns and disappear.  </P> <P> "When I fly to appearances, the people at the airport end up paging me because  I look so different from their expectations," Hebel said with a chuckle.  </P> <P> He delights in his normalcy, his 2-year-old son and his wife, Donna. After his  marriage in 1984, Hebel wanted what he calls "a respectable life." He holds a  kindergarten through 12th grade music and multi-subject teaching credential.  After substitute teaching for 11 years while doing Elvis, Hebel during the last  four years has taught full time at Chaparral, where he and "Elvis" have been  responsible for building the chorus to 250 students.  </P> <P> "Once I did a stint at the Silverbird in Las Vegas, and the next day I was  teaching a special education class. That really brings your feet to the  ground," he said.  </P> <P> Raymond Michael and his band, "The American Legends of Rock 'N' Roll," will  present "A Tribute to Elvis" at the California Lutheran University Auditorium,  Thousand Oaks, at 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $10 in advance ($15 at the  door), $5 children 16 and under. For information, call (805) 493-3170. ROBYN  LOEWENTHAL  </P></p>

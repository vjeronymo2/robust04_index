			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silvia Odoriz] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad, 13 May (EFE) -- Argentine Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella today ended a two-day visit to  Turkmenistan, where Argentina has significant investments. He  expressed full support for the political independence of this  former Soviet Republic and for its economic reforms.    Di Tella concluded his stay in Turkmenistan with a one-hour  meeting with Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, with whom he  discussed political and economic issues.    During a news conference, Di Tella said the political issues  discussed with Niyazov focused on Argentina's support for the  independence of Turkmenistan.    Di Tella noted: "We were among the first countries to  recognize the independence of Turkmenistan, because we believed  it was fair."    Niyazov, who received 99.9 percent of the votes in a  plebiscite held in January -- a plebiscite that allows him to  extend his tenure until the year 2002, and which prevented the  holding of new presidential elections that had been scheduled  for 1997 -- today presented to his country's parliament his  economic reform program for his country, including agricultural  reform that involves land privatization.    Indicating that the political and economic reform programs  announced by Niyazov "seemed good to him," Di Tella said: "Now  it is also necessary to support economic reform."    The Argentine foreign minister admitted that "every country  has to maintain its own rate of reform" and that, however  desirable it might be to institute reform immediately, "it must  be assumed that transformations need to take place at a rate  that societies can accommodate."    Di Tella noted that "reaffirmation of the economic reform"  is  a key point now, as it represents one of the pillars of the  future Turkmenistan. He added that along with this  transformation, "political reforms" will take place "slowly, but  firmly," and this is more important than any spectacular  measures.    Concerning bilateral issues, the foreign minister pointed  out  that "we talked in particular about the presence of Argentine  companies involved in giant projects" like Bridas, linked to the  oil industry field, and Lybra, linked to the production of sugar  and other industries.    Upon pointing out Bridas' goal of participating in ambitious  projects such as the construction of gas pipelines linking this  central Asian republic with Turkey, Europe, and Pakistan, and  gas prospecting in Turkmenistan, Di Tella said: "I believe that  in this case the old proverb that business creates friendship  and friendship creates business is correct."    The foreign minister also mentioned the industrial projects  of the other Argentine company operating in Turkmenistan.    Di Tella, who was feted today with a luncheon by Turkmen  Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov [title as received],  this morning visited the Kaakhka area, where Lybra is  constructing a sugar mill and an alcohol distillery that within  one year will be able to process 30,000 metric tons of sugar per  year.    Lybra executives Francisco Gradin, Pablo D'Agnillo, and  Francisco Cordella joined Di Tella and his entourage, including  high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials, Argentine businessmen,  and Juan Carlos Olima, the Argentine ambassador to Russia and to  other former Soviet republics, for the visit to the sugar mill,  whose construction in the middle of the desert requires a huge  logistical deployment.    Lybra's investments in Turkmenistan total $230 million. The  company, which specializes in the construction of industrial  "turnkey" facilities, is involved in nine projects in this  central Asian country. Lybra directly or indirectly employs  1,200 people in these nine projects.    Di Tella was feted last night by Bridas President Carlos  Bolgheroni in a building that is part of a housing project  developed in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital, for Bridas  personnel in Turkmenistan.    Thus far, the oil company has invested $168 million in  drilling two oil wells in prospecting for gas in Yashlar, about  450 km east of Ashkhabad, and is exploiting 38 oil wells in  Keimir on the Caspian Sea. These oil wells currently yield  1,400 metric tons of crude oil per day.    Bridas is employing 616 people in Turkmenistan, of whom 236  are Argentines and people from other nationalities, including  Europeans, Latin Americans, and U.S. nationals, 316 are Turkmen,  and 64 are people from other former USSR republics.</p>

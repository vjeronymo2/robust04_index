			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norilsk manager reveals nickel ouput RUSSIA'S GIANT Norilsk Nickel company produced 240,000 tonnes of nickel in 1992, according to Mr Sergei Korneyev, the sales and purchasing manager, reports Reuter from Moscow. He said the Interfax news agency's report that the company exported between 60,000 and 65,000 tonnes of nickel in 1992 was correct 'plus or minus 10 per cent'. He gave no comparisons for 1991 production or exports. It is the first time the traditionally secretive plant has outlined production figures. Officials said last year they expected 1992 output to fall by 15 per cent in line with a general decline in Russian industry, but they gave no absolute figures. Data on output of precious and strategic metals were traditionally kept secret in the former Soviet Union and Russian producers have also been reluctant to release figures. But information has been trickling out in recent months, providing important clues to Russia's role as an exporter and producer on world markets. Norilsk, with plants in Siberia and on the Kola peninsula, accounts for about 80 per cent of Russian nickel production. It is also an important copper producer, but Mr Korneyev said Interfax's figures of 1992 output of 450,000 tonnes copper were 'slightly exaggerated'. Interfax said nickel exports from the whole of the Commonwealth of Independent States probably totalled 120,000 tonnes, up from 100,000 tonnes in 1991. But Korneyev said it was impossible to determine total CIS nickel exports because the metal was being exported by other companies and from stocks as well as by Norilsk. 'The full figure for exports will come later from customs data,' he said. There have also been complaints that large amounts of nickel and other non-ferrous metals have been smuggled out of Russia, mostly via the Baltic states.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Strategy of Dual Containment"] </F>   [Text] Clinton and the Democratic Administration have  assessed and approved a policy of dual containment toward Iran  and Iraq that is based on a series of restrictions and  pressures. Even though there is no uniformity between Iran and  Iraq, it appears that the Clinton administration has been forced  to adopt such a policy to extricate itself from its  decisionmaking impasse.    Speaking in favor of this policy, Clinton's adviser for  Middle Eastern affairs, Martin Indyk, who is considered the  formulator of the policy of dual containment and restriction,  says: In the past our policy was to give one of the two  countries, that is Iran and Iraq, greater preference over the  other. We are now in a situation where we should learn a  lesson from the past and should study and adopt a suitable  strategic stance on the Persian Gulf. Reliance on the strength  and capabilities of one of the two countries to restrict the  other and to maintain a balance of power has proved to be an  erroneous policy.    Today, such an equilibrium can be satisfactory and in  conformity with U.S. national interests if it restrains both the  countries.    Martin Indyk believes that the dissolution of the Soviet  Union, the reduction of the political and military strength of  Iran in the eight-year war with Iraq, and the direct presence of  the United States in the Persian Gulf have created conditions  that allow the United States to bring about a balance without  Iran or Iraq having any direct intervention in the region.    In his criticism of the policy of dual containment, U.S.  political expert Graham Fowler has said that the aforementioned  policy will not be beneficial. The United States tends to  greatly exaggerate the dangers from Iran and the current U.S.  policy needs to be reviewed and reappraised.    Fowler says: At present we are confronted with an Islamic  Republic in the Middle East, but in the future there will be  more such republics and we cannot make any innovations in our  policy that we cannot continue in the future. Our (U.S.)  current policy is very shortsighted.    According to Fowler, the formulation of a balanced policy in  which there is a collection of friends and enemies is not a  difficult task, but the balance of power in the aftermath of the  Cold War needs assessment, study, and thought within the new  framework. The United States should formulate its strategy in a  manner in which the Persian Gulf countries can resolve their  security issues without much dependence on that country and U.S.  interests can be safeguarded.    Fowler says that Iran and Iraq have policies that are  different from those of the United States, and they are also  different from one another in relation to their respective  situations. Iraq is a country with unchanging policies, which  have not evolved completely, and is being administered by a  ruthless individual. However, Iran is a country undergoing  change and freedom and abundance is evident. Therefore, it would  be fallacious for the United States to adopt a uniform policy  for both countries.</p>

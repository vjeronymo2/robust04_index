			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: US telecoms group close to European deal AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Unisource, a consortium of European telecoms operators, are thought to be close to announcing a joint venture aimed at Europe's telecommunications market. Yesterday, neither company would comment on reports that they would announce the formation of the company next week. The telecoms industry, however, has been expecting the move since AT&amp;T and Unisource became partners in the US company's Worldsource venture earlier this year. Worldsource involves no equity exchange, but is an attempt by AT&amp;T to marshall leading operators to help provide its international business services. Worldsource is strong in the Asia Pacific region where its partners include Singapore Telecom and Telstra, the Australian operator, but weak in Europe. A joint venture between AT&amp;T and Unisource, which comprises the national carriers of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, moves a step beyond this marketing affiliation. Press reports suggest Unisource would have a 60 per cent shareholding.</p>

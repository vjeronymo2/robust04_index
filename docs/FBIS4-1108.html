			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with opposition leader Faustin Twagiramungu by </F> Christophe Boisbouvier; place and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] Our guest this morning is the Rwandan opposition  leader Faustin Twagiramungu, who is interviewed by Christophe  Boisbouvier. There has been no news of this key Rwandan figure  since 7 April. I remind you that he was designated to lead the  future transitional government in accordance with the Arusha  agreement. Faustin Twagiramungu succeeded in escaping from the  soldiers of the Presidential Guard who were looking for him in  the streets of Kigali. Today he is in a safe place and for the  first time he gives us his account of the events that followed  the assassination of President Habyarimana. Christophe  Boisbouvier spoke to him:    [Twangiramungu] The shooting started at 0505 on the morning  of 7 April. I had a conversation with the prime minister. She  told me that her house was surrounded and that she wanted to go  to speak on the radio but could not do so, because it seems that  the people were very serious and that she feared for her life.  We talked throughout that morning and we exchanged points of  view on the situation until 0830. At 0830 the gendarmes  informed me that the situation was becoming very serious; I  thank the French ambassador for having communicated with UNAMIR  [UN Mission in Rwanda]. UNAMIR then sent me an armored vehicle  which picked me up at around 1230, and at that very moment I  heard the news of the assassination of the prime minister by the  Presidential Guard. I remained cut off from the outside world  from 7 April until I was invited to escape with the UNAMIR  staff, which is what I did.    [Boisbouvier] Was the assassination of opposition leaders  ordered at the highest level, or was it decided by low-level  authority in the Presidential Guard?    [Twangiramungu] It was not a low-level authority in the  Presidential Guard which decided that a massacre of opposition  leaders should be carried out. It seems to me that it had  already been decided upon a long time before, because the  political authorities of the [word indistinct] party had decided  to distribute weapons to the militia of the MRND [National  Revolutionary Movement for Development]. I don't understand how  the Presidential Guard could have found everyone in their homes  and everyone's address. This was done and planned by extremists  within the army. They are extremists of [word indistinct] who  are now using other personalities to lead international public  opinion into thinking that the conflict is of an ethnic nature.  This is not the case. If this were an interethnic conflict why  then would all opposition leaders, Tutsi and Hutu alike, have  been assassinated?    [Boisbouvier] Who do you think is behind the attack on  President Habyarimana's plane?    [Twangiramungu] I don't personally think that the president  was assassinated by the Belgians. What for? Nor do I think  that this method was used by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front].  I think the president was assassinated by extremist soldiers  within the Presidential Guard or simply by soldiers within his  circle, soldiers forming a clan within the army. Why? Because  extremist soldiers wanted the president to resume war [with the  RPF]. The president had merely wanted to use delaying tactics  by refusing the formation of a transitional government.  Extremist soldiers did not accept these delaying tactics. They  purely and simply preferred to eliminate him in order to  continue to enjoy their privileges if, of course, they succeed  in winning such a war. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 11 (CNS)--Coal consumers in China  have run up a total debt of as much as RMB 19.1 billion, the  Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Wang Senhao, revealed. He said  that serious difficulties facing the coal industry last year lay  in the large amount of debt owed by coal consumers with the  money in arrears increasing by RMB 3.8 billion over late last  year.    Such debt, according to Mr Wang, resulted in a serious  shortage of capital required by the coal industry with the  payroll for coalminers being badly affected. Banks had to help  pay salaries by giving coal mines loans.    The shortage of capital needed by coal mines make them  unable  to afford raw and processed materials as well as equipment, all  of which are of great importance to the safety of coal mine  work. As important repairs for mine facilities cannot be  carried out because of lack of money, safety technology required  by the coal industry had been adversely affected.    Statistics show that orders accepted by coal enterprises  registered a sharp drop last year, making up a mere one-tenth of  orders received in 1992. Orders for coal mining equipment  amounted to a mere RMB 93 million for 1994, far lower than the  RMB 651 million in 1992. Facilities for safety in the coal  industry cannot be renewed because of the shortage of capital.    Should the input into mining production not be forthcoming,  according to the Vice Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Zhang  Baoming, the supply of coal will be in jeopardy.    These serious problems have been of great concern to the  State Council which decided to allocate a bank loan of RMB 1.5  billion to the coal industry to pay salaries to the miners, Mr  Wang said. The State Council was determined that the People's  Bank of China and the Economic and Trade Commission would be  responsible for the settling of the debt in the coal industry  and a national meeting of heads of branches of the People's Bank  of China would place it at the top of the agenda for an early  solution.</p>

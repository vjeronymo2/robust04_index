The government had already hurt  our farmers, and the textile, drugs and insecticides industries,  but has now definitely caused an impediment for our production  sector and thus to the nation's security itself. Not only that  but now there are big question marks on India's economic and  constitutional sovereignty. In a way, the republic has been  brought to a laughable state, where the honor of the country,  its achievements, and its very future have been laid at stake  for a very long time ahead. GATT was established right after  the second World War to establish and maintain international  trading, with limited powers to oversee specific areas such as  boundary-taxes and trade commercial agreements. Agricultural  services, intellectual property rights, and corporate mergers  were not in its purview. Thus GATT could only control matters  upto our borders, and beyond that, it had no control on what  went on inside a country especially with its economy. But, the  new treaty makes it possible for it to have a say in many of our  internal economic policy matters. It will be useful to briefly  review the old GATT and why it is being revised prior to  entering a discussion of the detrimental effects the new treaty  is going to have on the third world, especially on India.    Among the advanced and rich nations, uncontrolled rivalry,  and competition had been frequently interfering with the  functioning of GATT. The U.S. was getting very frustrated. Its  principal position in many areas in international trade had  started to be challenged. In the areas of industries,  machinization, automobiles, electronics, and agriculture, the  advanced place held for ages by the U.S. was starting to be  challenged by such countries as Japan, Korea, Germany, Taiwan,  and Singapore, whose products were of equally good quality,  enabling them to compete in international markets. This  necessitated coming up with a new market control strategy for  the U.S. It figured whatever losses it was facing in the areas  of automotives, electronics, and industrial machinery, could be  made up by introducing into the world market, services in  banking, insurance, technology, travel, and agriculture. Since  the West and Japan had monopolised technology, it became  necessary to develop safeguards of rights in agriculture,  services, and intellectual properties, and to incorporate them  into the GATT. Based on these concerns, a review of GATT was  initiated by the U.S.    It should be kept in mind that the kind of techno-economics  the West has developed necessitates a constant market and flow  of capital to feed it. It was figured that by bringing in the  issue of intellectual property rights a control could be  exercised over the market availability, but unless there is  unimpeded entry into areas of banking, insurance, and the share  market, capital flow and profits may not be available to the  desired extent, through royalties, etc. The multinational  companies were already in search of this. U.S., multinational  firms, and other affluent nations came together in setting the  ball in motion for a complete review of the GATT. They  understood that if along with general agreements, specific  requirements such as the TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of  Intellectual Property Rights] were to come under the purview of  GATT, they could gain an uncontrolled supremacy over the third  world. Rich nations would then be able to control their  capital, market, and natural resources. This was a smooth way to  obtain a certain standard of living for twenty percent of the  world's population, by bringing the other eighty percent of  humanity with all their God given resources under complete  control and to render them ineffectual for the longest period of  time. This was a modern treaty which could inconvenience the  majority for the convenience of a privileged minority. The  Third World was ensnared in this treacherous net.    The beginning of GATT talks was in Uruguay. There, the  poorer nations made their objections to including TRIPS,  agriculture, etc., in the treaty. It was the same with the  Punta-del-Vista. India and Brazil had attempted to keep these  issues out of GATT. We don't know what really happened after  the round of talks in Montreal, but India and Brazil drifted  apart, and India agreed to including TRIPS, services,  agriculture, and genetics in GATT's realm in April 1989.  Possibly the increasing pressure by the International Monetary  Fund, World Bank or maybe the need India felt for loans to keep  the budget balanced, were the factors that were ultimately  responsible for India giving it up. An indebted nation loses its  economic sovereignty. This is a burning example of that fact.  India lost a golden opportunity to lead the other poor nations  out of this quagmire. The Congress government has lost our  economic soverignty in modernizing our economy. Then matters got  fairly easy for the designers of the GATT, and under Arthur  Dunkel, some new proposals to replace the old were drafted.  This draft was referred to as the Dunkel draft or Dunkel  proposals. The most recent debate has been of the clauses of  this draft. Not all of the rich countries were in support of  these proposals either. Their respective national interests  mattered. The European interests were quite different. Two  requirements sprung up: One, to bring about a consensus amongst  the western nations, and two, to make the poor countries accept  the proposals. By the fifteenth of December, the last round of  talks were concluded, and the rich countries managed to reach an  understanding.    Following the adaptation of the basic program resulting from  the GATT talks, these affluent countries started to draft  special jargons and interpretations for a series of industries.  Simultaneously, a lot of force was applied in making the GATT  decisions internationally acceptable by offering the Dunkel  draft to be adopted as it was or with review. The GATT talking  group is going to be proclaimed an MNO [Multi National  Organization]. For conflicts within member nations, this MNO  will be the authority issuing resolutions. In the UN, the voice  of poor nations was heard vey little, and many decisions made to  protect these countries' interests, but now this MNO may  supersede the UNO. This new authority will eventually prove a  threat to our sovereignty. The Commerce Minister and his  colleagues have tried to explain to us in the Parliament that  adopting the Dunkel proposals will enable us to play a greater  part in the international market. They say that by not adopting  this we will get left out. It should be remembered that when  GATT was created in 1947, its objective was to expand world  trade. In the past forty years, how much improvement was made  by the rich participants? India's part lessened. In 1947,  India gained independence, and at that time its export was 3.5  percent [of the world market share], and it has since reduced to  .5 percent. The G-7 countries form 12.3 percent of the world's  population, with 66 percent GDP, and 54 percent exports.  India's population is 16.2 percent, GDP only 1.0 percent, and  exports only 0.5 percent. The truth is that the rich nations of  the world support an international economic policy of absorption  and take-overs. They do not want to give it up at any rate, and  do not want their comfort level to be reduced even a little bit,  even if 80 percent of the world remains hungry, destitute and  diseased. It does not matter if they are suffering from famine,  or dying like flies due to a severe shortage of medicines.  French President Mitterand condemned this attitude in 1991, in  a conference of 150 nations, and called it the rape of the poor  nations. The fact is that in none of the eight rounds of GATT  talks did advanced nation broach the subject of their  authoritative behavior, they did not want to participate in  anything that even remotely resembled such criticism. So where  has GATT membership taken us to? The bottomline is that while  our markets opened up to the world, our exports kept getting  lower and lower. Therefore, when Sutherland announced the  successful completion of the Uruguay talks, and the members  opened bottles of champagne claiming that from now on every  country's income will increase, and that everyone's trade will  improve, it was the lie of the century. Well, if everyone meant  everyone of the G-7 countries, then that of course is quite a  different thing. After signing the treaty on international  trade, there will be an increase of $213 billion in profits, and  according to the World Bank, 60 percent of it will go to the  rich nations. India's share will be $4 billion, which is 2  percent of it. The eastern European nations' share will be only  $700 million, and Africa's will be lesser. This treaty will  internationalize production and the profits will go directly to  the multinational corporations, because they will be the  directors of the production operation. Fiscal capital will  replace labor capital, which will prove unprofitable for a  fund-poor nation like India. Broadcasting industries' new  channels will propogate consumerism, and the developed nations  will secure their market in the developing nations.The direct  disdvantage of this will be to indigenous industries and its  workforce.</p>

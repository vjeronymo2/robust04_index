			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- A military source reported  today that, following the suspension in May of U.S. logistic  support to combat the transportation of cocaine by air,  trafficking in Peru has regained what it lost over the past  couple of years.    The source added that drug mafias have increased their  flights. He said they resumed operating in the Huallaga Valley  from where they were forced to withdraw in 1993 in view of  effective repressive operations by the Peruvian Air Force (FAP),  which operated with the support of U.S. radar installations.    Opposition Legislator Julio Castro Gomez has stated that if  the current level of trafficking flights is maintained, it will  reach 10,000 by the end of the year.    With each flight, the Colombian drug "cartels" transport  guns  and money to Peru in exchange for cocaine paste which is later  transformed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombian laboratories.    Castro Gomez stated that according to official sources, the  Colombian planes transport between 1,300 to 1,500 metric tons of  cocaine paste per year, and leave in Peru somewhere between $1.5  and $2 billion.    Trafficking has been back to normal since May when the U.S.  Government closed down the only fixed radar it operated in Peru.  It also decided to suspend flights of its AWACS E-3 and Orion  P-3 planes, equipped with modern flight detection equipment.    The U.S. withdrawal, which took Peruvian officials by  surprise, compelled the Peruvian Government to issue a formal  protest. They reasserted, however, their firm political  willingness to continue the antidrug struggle with their own  resources.    Achieving this goal is, however, very difficult because Peru  lacks the indispensable economic and material means to stop the  shipments.    A high-ranking FAP official has stated that the U.S.  decision  "has left us virtually blind. We are frustrated because drug  traffickers are flying right under our noses and we are unable  to do anything about it."    The same source noted that the only means available to the  FAP to combat the drug cargoes are four battered T-27 planes,  two helicopters, and eventually, two more A-37 planes.    By comparison, the traffickers are equipped with modern  planes that can easily dodge FAP planes and make night flights  with special equipment.    The military source stated: "A T-37 flies at 200 knots and  at  26,000 feet, while drug mafia planes reach 300 knots and 30,000  feet."    A U.S. technical mission arrived last week in Peru to  explain  the reasons for withdrawing its logistic air support. The result  of the negotiations have been kept strictly secret.    The Peruvian press reported, nevertheless, that U.S. support  was suspended for fear of legal complications for the United  States in the event of a downing of a civilian plane "by  mistake."    This comes following a recent experience in which a U.S.  warplane mistakenly shot down two U.S. helicopters in Iraq.    The FAP spokesperson stated that U.S. Government's concern  does not apply in Peru's case because experience has shown that  the FAP complies with international regulations for the  interception of planes.    He said: "When we intercept a plane we comply with the steps  of verification, identification, and communication. Only then,  and if it refuses to comply with orders, do we fire at nonvital  parts of the plane and, as a last resort, shoot it down."    The Peruvian press has reported that it seems the United  States wants to establish "specific legal guidelines" under  which Peru will assume full responsibility if a civilian plane  is mistakenly downed.    Some trafficking experts have stated, however, that  Washington's fears do not justify withdrawing U.S. air logistics  support from Peru. They added that the U.S. decision "causes  doubts about its political willingness to combat the issue."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Southeast Asia: An El </F> Dorado where French Businesses Must Prove Themselves"--first  paragraph is LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE introduction]    [Text] Very few PMEs [small to mid-size companies] have  durably succeeded on the Asiatic market, although that market is  booming. Criticism--failure to meet deadlines, overall lack of  professionalism--added to difficulties in obtaining help account  for their inconspicuous presence.    What is it that drives to Asia French PMEs like Ilog, an  SSII  [data-processing services and engineering company] specialized  in software engineering which just set up a subsidiary in  Singapore, or Gemplus, the smart card leader which has been  operating in Singapore for four years and is now opening an  office in China? "We are aware of the French market limitations.  International markets, especially the Asiatic market, are a  matter of survival for us," Edouard Efira, the Ilog assistant  general manager, assured. If they relocate, therefore, it is not  to benefit from lower labor costs at the expense of French  workers, but because they are determined to gain market shares  in Asia.    Actually, most countries in the region have the advantage  not  only of experiencing economic booms, but also of being perfectly  solvent. Just a few figures will illustrate the existence of a  sort of Asiatic El Dorado. Whereas, according to the OECD, the  seven major western industrialized countries are expected to  record 1993 growth rates in the +2.6 to -1.9 percent range, the  World Bank reported 12-percent growth for Communist China in  1992; according to Chinese sources, growth should reach 13.5  percent in 1993. As for the other countries in the region  (Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia,  Malaysia, and Thailand), the World Bank stressed that no group  of countries ever experienced such a high growth rate within 30  years: 5.5 percent on the average between 1960 and 1990.    Yet, less than three percent of French foreign trade is with  the "three Chinas" (Communist China, Taiwan, Hong Kong). Apart  from the French giants in the electronics sector (Alcatel,  Bull-Zenith, Thomson), French presence is limited to a few  enterprising PMEs (Ilog, Gemplus, OST [Observatory of Science  and Technology], Pact Group, Lisa Engineering, etc.), which are  usually well positioned in their subsectors and quite determined  to expand all over Asia. Thus Ilog, the leading European  supplier of object-oriented development tools, which possesses a  technological lead in constraint-oriented programming, has made  a remarkable breakthrough in Singapore, especially in government  offices. "We expect our sales in the region to increase from 4  million francs [Fr] now to Fr40 million in four to five years,"  Edouard Efira disclosed.    As for Gemplus, it achieved Fr30 million in sales with  significant projects such as the electronic wallet credit card  it implemented jointly with a Japanese partner, a Singapore  bank, Visa International, and the U.S. company Verifone. The  price of success for the French company was that South Koreans  and Taiwanese asked for licensing agreements, for which they are  prepared to pay a high price... no doubt in order to be able to  compete with Gemplus later on. The problem, therefore, consists  in knowing how to manage what is transferable and what is not.  "For the time being, we have not yet made any technology  transfers," we were told by Eric Alzai, a former manager of  Gemplus Technology Asia.    The two French PMEs have one thing in common: They have  practically no competitors on location, and their markets are  buoyant. "The more sophisticated the PME's subsector, the  greater its chances of success, because when it comes to  standard products Asiatic countries are hard to beat," according  to Eric Alzai. It is not by chance that they both chose  Singapore as an operating base: the island offers a high  technological level, international trade experience, and a very  western-like culture, especially in legal matters. Moreover, the  majority of its population is Chinese, which helps penetration  into Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Communist China. "Actually, these  markets are linked. For instance, Taiwan is the leading investor  in Communist China," people at Ilog pointed out.  <H5>  A Certain Lack of Professionalism </H5>   For all that, these successes may well be the exceptions  that  confirm the rule concerning the presence of French PMEs in Asia.  "Last September, a Philippine mission came to Paris, looking for  opportunities to work together with French companies in the  software field. Since these companies did not respond, the  Filipinos turned to the Germans and the British. It is a pity  because, with the high-speed train in Korea, Ariane and the  subway, France has a good technological image in these  countries," people at the Paris Chamber of Commerce regretted.  "Geographic and cultural distance, but also our companies' lack  of professionalism account for this lack of a French presence in  Asia," according to Elisabeth Landemaine of the Financial  Company for Asia. Actually, French businessmen are often  perceived as people who do not approach markets in a  professional manner, who do not meet deadlines. Their lack of  fluency in the English language can also prove a serious  handicap. "If the only English-speaking individual in a PME  happens to be out when the Asiatic partner faxes a letter, he  will not get an answer until that individual is back, which is  very detrimental," Nadia Gourievidis, head of the Asean  department at the Paris Chamber of Commerce, observed.    Besides, some French banks and organizations such as COFACE  [French Foreign Trade Insurance Company] (State insurance  against export-related risks) are said not to be very eager to  help PMEs. "We had a lot of trouble obtaining prospection  insurance from COFACE and discounting facilities on our invoices  from our bank," the managers of an SSII told us.    In spite of these obstacles, it is possible to succeed, like  Ilog and Gemplus who received little or no help from the French  government or from major French groups already on location. "You  must not hesitate to go on location to study the market, to  write your commercial documents in English, to project a very  professional image, to provide thorough information on your  products, and above all to find good partners because, in Asia,  the more middlemen you have, the better your image," Eric Alzai  confided. But the supreme quality to succeed is perseverance.  "You must show that you are settling down for good," Edouard  Efira concluded.</p>

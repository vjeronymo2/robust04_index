			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Former retailer to sell off BR A sizeable part of BR's turnover comes from activities such as freight, parcels and maintenance work, but it is the privatisation of British Rail's passenger services that has attracted most attention. Responsibility for engineering the sale of BR's non-passenger businesses has been entrusted to Christopher Campbell, who joined BR yesterday as vice-chairman. Campbell, 58, has spent most of his business career in retailing at Debenhams. But his particular relevance to BR lies in his experience of handling the break-up of the National Bus Company following the deregulation of the bus industry in 1985. Campbell was chief negotiator handling the sale of NBC companies to the private sector. The government will be hoping that the privatisation of BR does not lead to the chaos that followed bus deregulation in some provincial cities, where rival companies swamped popular routes and brought city centres to a stand-still. Campbell was educated at Epsom College before qualifying as a chartered accountant with Spicer &amp; Pegler. After 20 years with Debenhams and a spell with National Bus in the late 1980s he went to British Shipbuilders in 1989. He has also been a director of Harrods Bank since 1991. His spare-time positions include a governorship of the United World College of the Atlantic, a network of international schools with a strong 'outdoor' flavour. He is also a council member of the MusicSpace Trust, which has established a network of music therapy centres. Long-time students of British Rail might also identify another strand in his professional career linking him to BR. One of the jobs he held at Debenhams was that of managing director of Hardy Amies, a name once associated with the design of uniforms for BR staff.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Yeltsin criticises Ukraine over nuclear disarmament President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday condemned Ukraine's stalling on nuclear disarmament as 'evil' in remarks which could signal a tougher Russian foreign policy after ultra-nationalist gains in last weekend's election. 'Ukraine is deceiving us all. It is deceiving the US, Russia, Europe, deceiving the whole world and we are so helpless that we cannot deal with this evil,' he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as telling visiting US Vice-President Al Gore. The unexpected electoral triumph of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist who says former Soviet republics will beg to be re-absorbed by Russia, has provided Ukraine with a powerful excuse to procrastinate on commitments to give up nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. In the face of strong international condemnation over its failure to ratify the Start-1 treaty without conditions and to fulfil its May 1992 promise to go non-nuclear, Ukraine is insisting on security guarantees and financial compensation for the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads it transferred to Russia last year and for its 1,656 remaining warheads. The electoral success of Russia's far-right parties has prompted fears Mr Yeltsin will be tempted to play the nationalist card in foreign policy, while, at best, sticking to unpopular market reforms at home. As the pro-western reformist camp awaits a public signal of support from Mr Yeltsin, Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, flies to Paris today for talks with officials of the Group of Seven industrial countries to discuss continuing western support for economic reform. 'The signals I'm getting are that reform is still on track,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'The prime minister is still committed. The president looks committed but we're still waiting for him to speak up. Maybe I'll have a better picture before the meeting (with the G7).' Mr Gore, describing the views of the neo-fascists who did so well in the elections as 'reprehensible', predicted after meeting Mr Yeltsin at the Kremlin that he would form an 'effective' coalition government. While reformist parties have been consulting on a possible anti-fascist coalition, Mr Yeltsin appears to be hedging his bets until the full election results are available. An unofficial counting of results including both seats determined by party lists and by a first-past-the-post system for candidates without explicit party affiliations, showed the reformist Russia's Choice as the largest single group in the 450-seat state Duma (lower house of parliament) with 74 seats. A Kremlin official said that in the 209 out of 225 first-past-the-post constituencies so far counted, 24 per cent were Russia's Choice, while only 4 per cent went to Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party. In the other 225 seats determined by proportional representation, Mr Zhirinovsky is in the lead. Jurek Martin adds from Washington: The US believes Russian reformist parties could still form the largest single bloc in the Duma, with Mr Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalists finishing up no better than fourth. President Bill Clinton yesterday used this more optimistic reading to stress again that US policy supporting reform needed no changing. He suggested that Mr Zhirinovsky's strong showing was mostly a 'protest vote' from Russians largely unfamiliar with his extreme views. Mr Clinton wrote to Mr Yeltsin on Tuesday. The Russian response, delivered to Mr Gore in Moscow, emphasised Mr Yeltsin's strong commitment to economic reform and continued respect for the territorial integrity of Russia's neghbours, both apparently threatened by Mr Zhirinovsky.</p>

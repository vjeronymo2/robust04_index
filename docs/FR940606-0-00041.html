			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the ``make whole'' approach, the displacing agency must provide assistance sufficient to enable the displaced person to purchase or rent (for a 42-month period) a comparable replacement dwelling, irrespective of the payment limits under section 203 (raised to $22,500 from $15,000) or section 204 (raised to $5,250 from $4,000) of the URA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the open-ended ``make whole'' approach to providing replacement housing assistance under the ``common rule'' and subsequent DOT interim and final rules, the sole impact of the DOT interim rule on the provision of replacement housing assistance was the reduction of rental assistance payments by 12.5 percent (caused by reducing the period of assistance from 48 to 42 months).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 407 of the 1987 Amendments requires that URA rental assistance payments to lower income persons ``take into account such person's income.'' This change, implemented in the DOT final rule (but not in the DOT interim rule) substantially increased the amount of replacement housing assistance to very low-income persons. During the period between implementation of the DOT interim and final rule, URA replacement housing payments to tenants were higher under the now removed HUD URA rule at 24 CFR part 42 than under the DOT interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment on Proposed Section 8 Project-Based Certificate Program Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 24, 1993, HUD published proposed relocation requirements (58 FR 11319) for the Section 8 Project-Based Certificate Program (PBC). The requirements were published with a proposed rule to conform Section 8 tenant-based rental certificate and rental voucher rules. The proposed PBC relocation policies were similar to those followed in other HUD-assisted programs. Three comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first comment addressed the current PBC requirement that prohibits the displacement of any residential tenant of a unit to be assisted under the PBC Program. On February 24, 1993, HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it to the standard applicable to other HUD-assisted programs. That standard allows displacement, provided it is consistent with the other goals and objectives of the program, and property owners take all reasonable steps to minimize it. One commenter opposed this proposal, stating that the current regulation works well to prevent displacement and, in extreme cases, can be waived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD believes that the current PBC displacement prohibition eliminates many projects where the failure to carry out timely rehabilitation leads to property deterioration that ultimately increases displacement_displacement without assistance to those forced to relocate. Under the proposed rule, persons displaced by rehabilitation for an assisted project would receive relocation assistance at URA levels, obtaining standard housing at a cost that is usually lower than what they had been paying for substandard housing. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt the comment, and the final rule reflects the ``minimize displacement'' standard that is followed in other HUD programs and described in the proposed rule. Also, it is noted that a public housing agency or Indian housing authority (HA) could opt to provide a unit selection preference for units where the rehabilitation will not result in the displacement of a family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second comment addressed PBC relocation policy regarding ``partially-assisted buildings.'' The term ``partially-assisted'' is used to describe a building in which some, but not all, of the units will be ``assisted'' with a project-based subsidy upon completion of the rehabilitation. Under the current PBC policy, only the occupants of units to be assisted under the section 8 HAP contract are protected by the URA. HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it to policy in other HUD-assisted rehabilitation programs where the tenants in all rehabilitated units in the building are protected, whether or not the units they occupy will receive a PBC subsidy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

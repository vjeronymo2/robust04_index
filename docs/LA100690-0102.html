			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PHILLIPS INVESTIGATION COMPLETED  </P> <P> The district attorney's office is reviewing the investigation of the assault of  Charger nose tackle Joe Phillips and is expected to decide within two weeks  whether to file charges against three construction workers suspected in the  case.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said detectives completed their investigation  Thursday of the incident in which Phillips was severely beaten by three men  after a verbal exchange outside a Mission Beach restaurant Sept. 26.  </P> <P> Police refused to comment on the investigation's results or the strength of the  case against the three suspects.  </P> <P> Deputy District Attorney Mark Pettine said he is awaiting some final bits of  information from the police investigation before deciding whether to file  charges.  </P> <P> Pettine also said investigators are "looking at other things" besides  statements from three witnesses, Phillips and a woman friend with him during  the incident, but he declined further comment.  </P> <P> Phillips, who is expected to be sidelined for another two months, underwent  facial surgery Thursday, and Charger physician Lee Rice said the complex  procedure was successful. Phillips is expected to make a complete recovery.  </P> <P> Police plan to show Phillips photographs of the suspects early next week. He  said he blacked out after being hit from behind but probably can identify the  three men.  </P> <P> Phillips suffered a concussion, fractured nose, fractured bone around his eye,  bruised ribs, cuts and bruises.  </P> <P> Possible charges include assault with a deadly weapon and assault with intent  to commit great bodily harm on Phillips and also battery on the woman, who was  knocked down but not seriously hurt. Police have refused to identify her, but  Charger players said she was a friend of Phillips.  </P> <P> Last week, witnesses were shown photographs of the suspects in a photo lineup.  </P> <P> Police have refused to release the names of the suspects and witnesses.  </P> <P> The three suspects turned themselves in to police for questioning last week,  but police said they were not arrested because they were cooperating with  investigators. Police refused to say if they acknowledged or denied  participating in the altercation.  </P> <P> The three suspects are in their early 20s and weigh about 210, 190 and 170  pounds, police have said. Phillips, at 6-feet-5, 315 pounds, is considered the  strongest player on the Chargers.  </P></p>

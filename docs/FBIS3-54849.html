			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Rytas </F> Staselis under the "Opinions" rubric; place and date not given:  "The President Is Calm"]    [Text] [Staselis] Mr. President, leaders and  officials of many states are commenting on the results of the  Russian elections -- the success of the extremist political  forces. What is your view?    [Brazauskas] I do not see such danger as others do. There  are also many people panicking in Lithuania. I suppose this is  unnecessary. Too much talk about a person called Zhirinovskiy  would do him too much credit. Out of 443 seats in the  parliament, his party has won only 80. Certainly, there will  also be communists and their partners, the "agrarians," in the  Russian Federal Assembly. I am not sure, however, that the  party membership of most of the elected deputies fully reflects  their views, because some parties and electoral blocs emerged  right before the elections.    [Staselis] Do you intend to correct Lithuania's policy  toward Russia somehow?    [Brazauskas] I think that our policy toward Russia will not  change. At least, there is no definite reason for doing this  now.    [Staselis]In your opinion, are the current bilateral  relations optimal?    [Brazauskas] I suppose that we have accomplished  particularly  much this year in normalizing Lithuanian-Russian relations. In  this respect, we have been more successful than our neighbors  for different reasons. We will also pursue such a balanced  policy in the future.    [Staselis] Mister President, having been disappointed  with Sajudis, Lithuanian citizens voted for the Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] a year ago. In your opinion, for  whom will they vote during the next elections if they become  disillusioned with the LDDP, particularly if the economic crisis  is too protracted?    [Brazauskas] No, Lithuania will not have such extremist  activists like in Russia (if you had in mind such an  implication) who could expect a victory in the elections.    [Staselis] Why?    [Brazauskas] Because the community in Lithuania is more  stable, and the multiparty system is more distinct. Thus, there  are no conditions for extremist policies.    [Staselis] However, can you claim that there is no  political extremism in Lithuania?    [Brazauskas] Well, it is abundant. There are many  politicians who may not be like Zhirinovskiy, but who are trying  to accumulate political capital by criticizing the government's  moves concerning our relations with Russia, by saying: "There  is no political strategy," "We must apply tough policies toward  them [Russians]," "Kaliningrad Oblast belongs to Lithuania," "We  will correct the border between Lithuania and Poland," and so on.    [Staselis] Your decision to disband the state  delegation for negotiations with Russia has caused a certain  indignation. Did you dissolve this structure for the  aforementioned reasons?    [Brazauskas] Some people are making much noise about this  issue. The delegation for negotiations is a separate issue.  First of all, I have not heard of any other country possessing  such a structure approved by the law: An institution comprised  of randomly selected persons who are not responsible for  anything. This delegation claimed that it had great authority,  but with no responsibility for its actions.    [Staselis]What is your reaction to the criticism of the  former members of this institution directed against you  concerning the "policy ordered from Moscow," "jellyfish," and so  on?    [Brazauskas] My assessment of this criticism is the same as  over the past five years. I have been called different names  all that time, and I have gotten used to it. State interests  are more important to me than the opinions of some individuals  about me.    [Staselis]However, Lithuanian foreign policy has not  been ideal. Sometimes it is difficult to understand why there  is no coordination of action; why one minister does not know  what his colleague is signing in Moscow; why the foreign  minister has no documents signed by the prime minister; or why  the president's office is unaware of the moves of the  negotiating delegation, to say nothing of certain strange  situations. What do you think of this?    [Brazauskas] Life is life. We will seek strict coordination  of action among government institutions abroad in the future,  particularly among those which influence foreign policy. It is  difficult to achieve this immediately. Certainly, there are  some people who are used to squeezing their personal opinions or  principles into some official framework.    [Staselis] Can the new seven-member working group for  negotiations with the CIS, which has replaced the state  delegation for negotiations with Russia, be interpreted as your  foreign policy "team"?    [Brazauskas] Yes, this is a team that used to meet  unofficially, and now it has been legalized.    [Staselis] Are you not afraid of the accusations that  you have eliminated all sorts of the opposition from the  "formation" of foreign policy?    [Brazauskas] I have not eliminated anyone. The newly created  council consists of persons who are responsible for the  successes and failures in foreign policy. Meanwhile, the  opposition should engage in creative work in the Seimas  [parliament] and express its opinion, and we will take it into  consideration. It is we rather than the opposition who are  responsible for our state policy today. Therefore, I do not  think that the opposition should participate in outlining our  foreign policy. Finishing the issue of the opposition's right  to state policy, I would add that I also was in the opposition  once. I remember quite well how much our opinion was necessary  in drafting state policies or how much it was considered....    [Staselis] Currently, you are under active pressure  demanding your tough stand on Lithuania's faster accession to  NATO. What do you think about this?    [Brazauskas] I suppose that this issue (knowing its  difficult  resolution even in West European countries) is not a matter of  the non-ruling party alone. I believe that its position on this  problem considerably exceeds the authority of the government and  the Seimas. Therefore, a referendum on this issue is quite an  attractive idea.    [Staselis]Mister President, recently Lithuania has  learned that the world Jewish community is continuing to seek  that Lithuania be equalled to Germany concerning the Jews'  genocide during World War II. What is your attitude toward this  problem?    [Brazauskas] I suppose that there has not been such a  statement, thus, I have no definite reply. I think, however,  that each similar statement requires evidence. I have  repeatedly said that some Lithuanian citizens really  participated in the Jews' genocide -- this is a stigma of our  nation. I will never agree, however, that the entire nation or  the state be accused of this. I proposed cooperation in  definite issues involving concrete names to the Israeli  delegation during its visit here. However, we will not agree to  the transfer of all criminal cases to another state. We trust  Israeli and U.S. justice, and we expect the same from them.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / BT warned over changes in rules Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, yesterday served notice on British Telecommunications that the regulatory structure would not be altered in its favour. He warned BT that any video-on-demand service it tried to offer in competition with entertainment services provided by cable TV companies had to correspond to the 'limited nature' of existing regulatory approval. Mr Cruickshank, making his first policy speech as director-general of Oftel to the FT's international telecommunications conference, dismissed BT's claims that it was held back by unfair regulation. He said that, in spite of the 10-year ban imposed in 1991 on BT providing entertainment services over its network, it could have bid for a 'significant number' of cable franchises and 'could have integrated them with its local network'. Indicating that he would not support any review of the essentials of the current regime, Mr Cruickshank added: 'I defend the present carefully-framed regulatory structure and hope we can move the debate away from the myth.' Mr Cruickshank's remarks brought his first public clash with Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman. Mr Vallance condemned over-regulation and warned that BT faced a 'utility trap' threatening its ability to compete internationally. He stressed the case for improvements to the competitive environment in the UK, in particular the need for 'greater transparency on the relationship between costs and charges'. He said Oftel would publish plans in the new year for a phased introduction of a new interconnection structure between BT and competitors. The phasing is believed likely to take place over four years, and could involve the introduction of tariffs for specific services required by competitors.</p>

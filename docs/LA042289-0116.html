			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF AFI FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of a selection of the screenings today and Sunday  at the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the  Cineplex Odeon Cenutry Plaza Cinemas.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> 'I'm the One You're Looking For'  </P> <P> Spain, 1988, 90 minutes  </P> <P> 4:45 p.m.  </P> <P> A beautiful model falls in love with her biker rapist and pursues him  obsessively through the dangerous, lower-class dives of Barcelona, taking as  her accomplices an embittered lady taxi driver and a gentle voyeur-transvestite  artiste. That's the explosive subject of this Gabriel Garcia Marquez-scripted  fable. But it's the weakest of the "Dangerous Love" series. Director Jaime  Chavarri has a rudimentary, flat style; he can't work up the whiff of danger or  eroticism, so the script's deliberate provocations, embedded in an emotionless  drift, seem simply shocking or shallow.

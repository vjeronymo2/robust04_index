			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Derivatives unit established by Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley has set up a triple-A rated unit for trading derivative instruments, following a trend set by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, writes Tracy Corrigan. Morgan Stanley Derivative Products has initial capital of Dollars 150m in the form of common equity, but more will be added as the size of the portfolio of transactions requires. Several banks and securities firms have set up separately capitalised derivatives units to compete with top-rated banks. The over-the-counter derivatives market is extremely credit-sensitive, and many counterparties will not deal with banks rated below double-A.</p>

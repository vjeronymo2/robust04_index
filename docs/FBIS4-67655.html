			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Latest reports indicate that in the past few  years, VD and AIDS have expanded across the mainland at an  astonishing pace. By the end of 1992, 30 provinces and cities  had reported a total of over 800,000 VD patients. In 1992 alone  some 200,000 cases were notified, an increase of 13.79 percent  over the previous year. In addition, by the end of November  1993, 1,159 AIDS patients and individuals infected with the HIV  virus had been found in 22 provinces and cities. Mainlanders  made up 948 cases, with the rest being foreigners and overseas  Chinese. Out of the 19 full-blown AIDS patients, 14 have died.  The incidence of VD and AIDS patients or HIV carriers is most  serious in coastal or border provinces and regions such as  Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Hainan and Guangxi.  However, in recent years, inland provinces which are  economically advanced or experiencing tourism booms, like Hunan,  Hubei and Sichuan, have also witnessed rapid increases in these  afflictions.    The spread of VD and AIDS on the mainland has disturbed and  worried people. The media has generally attributed the rapid  spread of AIDS to the influx of foreigners into a more open  China plus the internal floating population. In reality, China's  younger generation, affected by unhealthy foreign thinking and  at variance with traditional concepts about sexual behavior,  constitutes the more dangerous internal factor.    In 1992, Shanghai held a comprehensive survey on psychology  and morals among people aged between 20 and 55. To the question  "Are you in favor of a woman developing sexual relationships  with several men?" the responses varied according to generation.  More younger people said yes.    In 1991, the China Union Medical College Hospital conducting  a survey on taxi drivers and hotel attendants in a Beijing  district. Some 13.6 percent of the drivers and 3.4 percent of  the attendants admitted to more than one sexual partner. About  16.6 percent of the former and 41.9 percent of the latter had  desires for more sexual partners.    New concepts have led to disastrous consequences. Surveys on  16 large and medium-sized cities indicate the annual increase  rate for VD in recent years reached 45.63 percent. The number of  Chinese HIV carriers infected through sexual contact rose to 20  percent.    The press, sociologists and medicos have made an appeal that  in the coming new year priority be given to extensive publicity  and education on VD and AIDS prevention, and dissemination of  scientific knowledge. Various approaches should be applied to  publicize the influence brought by VD and AIDS on individuals,  families, children and society, to foster public awareness of  protection measures and morality, so that people become neither  VD sufferers nor spreaders.

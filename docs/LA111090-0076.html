			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN EMOTIONAL FISH FLOUNDERS IN L.A. DEBUT AT CLUB LINGERIE  </P> <P> The Irish quartet An Emotional Fish begs the questions, Which emotion? What  fish? At its Los Angeles debut Thursday night at Club Lingerie, the mercurial  band showed signs of starfish lineage but proved to be mainly flounder.  </P> <P> Nurtured by U2's Mother label in Ireland, An Emotional Fish shares its mentor's  passion but little of its pizazz.  </P> <P> Gerard Whelan is an intriguing front man blessed with an elastic voice, but  ultimately his affectations smothered his appeal. At one point he ran around  the half-filled club, hiding behind speakers and poles, then leaped back onto  the stage to announce, "Darling, I'm home." Later came an impenetrable  monologue about little boys and girls that would have worked better as a Jim  Morrison parody than a serious attempt at art.  </P> <P> The pretension detracted from some moments of marvelous music. The show opened  promisingly with "Strange Things," a deliciously sultry bit of sing-speak not  found on the group's self-titled debut album. And "Celebrate," one of the few  Fish songs with lyrics that aren't self-consciously odd, sounded just as  invigoratingly joyous during the encore as it did when the band played it as  part of the regular set.  </P> <P> But the misses outnumbered the potential hits, and Whelan had to resort to  telling the crowd to shut up and listen. The members of An Emotional Fish are  probably still talking about the audience that got away. JEAN ROSENBLUTH  </P></p>

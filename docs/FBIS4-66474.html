			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. Ibaraki, Display Device Engineering </F> Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Active matrix LCD displays (AM-LCD) that utilize amorphous  silicon thin film transistors as switching elements have become  the mainstream in flat panel color displays and are now used in  a variety of products. They not only have replaced the  traditional CRT, but have also found a home in many other  products such as in portable instruments and games. The size of  the market in personal computers and other office automation  equipment is especially large, and because this equipment also  requires displays with a high level of performance, we can say  that the main technology in this field has been built around the  AM-LCD.    When we look at product trends, right now the main items are  8-10 inch diagonal VGA class displays like those in notebook  computers, but it is clear that we are headed for the XGA and  engineering workstations (EWS) in the future, and that means  large (14-20 inch), displays with greater resolution.    In making this kind of large, high-resolution display, the  key point is how much we can increase the pixel numerical  aperture. In the case of EWS, the area per pixel is small due to  the high resolution, and obtaining sufficient numerical aperture  has been an inherent problem. On the other hand, with products  oriented toward light weight and lengthy battery use such as  notebook computers, increasing the numerical aperture has the  advantage of reducing power consumption of the backlight, which  reduces the load on the battery. One of the main factors that  determines the size of the numerical aperture is TFT  performance, and improvement in TFT performance directly leads  to improved picture quality in displays.    In this article I will discuss the high mobility TFT and  self-aligned TFT as two approaches to future  technology.[.sup]1-3[/]  <H5>  Demand for High Performance with a-Si TFT </H5>   When the a-Si TFT is used in an AM-LCD, two major items are  required for TFT performance:    (1) the field effect mobility ([.sub]FE[/]) must be  sufficiently large, and    (2) the parasitic capacitance (C[.sub]gs[/]) from gate  signal overlap must be sufficiently small.    From the standpoint of physical properties, the electron  mobility a-Si is not very large, so we cannot reasonably expect  a large [.sub]FE[/] when it is used as a TFT.    Figure 1 shows the change in [.sub]FE[/] values as  reported up till now at SID-related conferences.[.sup]4[/]  During the initial period of a-Si TFT development from  1982-1985, the [.sub]FE[/] values were 0.15-0.3  cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. After 1985 silicon nitride (SiN) came into  use as the gate insulating film, and this greatly improved  [.sub]FE[/] to the point that values surpassing 1  cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs were obtained in the laboratory. At about the  same time, in 1986, the 3-inch diagonal mini-TV appeared on the  market as the first TFT-LCD commercial product. Ten-inch  displays for personal computers appeared on the market in 1991,  and on the mass production level, the actual range for  [.sub]FE[/] values is now about 0.3-0.6 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs  for VGA displays.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-19B>      Figure 1 Changes in a-Si TFT Field Effect Mobility </FIG>     However, these values are hardly sufficient for large,  high-resolution displays. As shown in Fig. 1, even better values  are required for XGA and EWS level displays.    Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a pixel pattern and  equivalent circuitry. Here, numerical aperture is defined as the  ratio of the area of light that can be transmitted to the total  area occupied by a single pixel. In actual practice, a color  filter substrate is placed opposite the pixel pattern shown in  Fig. 2, and the numerical aperture is ultimately determined by  the openings in the black matrix on the color filter substrate.  There are three ways to increase the numerical aperture, as  clearly shown in the drawing: (1) make the gate wire or data  wire thinner, (2) make the TFT smaller, or (3) make the storage  capacity (C[.sub]s[/]) smaller. Because (1) involves the  selection of low-resistance wiring material, I will discuss (2)  and (3) in this article.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-20A>      Figure 2 Pixel Pattern Block Diagram and Electrically Equivalent Circuits </FIG>    In TFT-LCD design it is desirable to make the TFT dimensions  as small as possible, but to obtain sufficient write current  with a small [.sub]FE[/] value, we must increase the TFT  channel width (W). When we increase W, the TFT area also  increases, and that increases C[.sub]gs[/] at the same time.  This has a major impact. In other words, when the gate pulse  (pulse peak V[.sub]g[/]) reaches its OFF-state potential, the  punch through voltage (_D_V) becomes very large.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-19A>      Equation </FIG>    In this formula, C[.sub]LC[/] is the liquid crystal  capacitance. _D_V is a factor in degradation of screen quality  such as burning in and flicker, and we place it below the design  value, which is compensated by C[.sub]s[/] capacitance. When  we increase W, C[.sub]gs[/] increases, so we must make  C[.sub]s[/] larger. In other words, the area of the  C[.sub]s[/] member becomes larger, and this reduces the  numerical aperture. For these reasons, a TFT with a large  [.sub]FE[/] or a sufficiently small C[.sub]gs[/], in  other words a high performance TFT, is needed.    Two approaches appear promising for resolving this problem.  One is an attempt to increase [.sub]FE[/] by improving the  film quality of the a-Si or the gate insulation, and the other  is an attempt to reduce C[.sub]gs[/] by structure with a  self-aligned TFT.  <H5>  Increasing TFT Mobility </H5>   The semiconductor active layer material a-Si and the gate  insulating material SiN are manufactured by PE-CVD using  SiH[.sub]4[/] or SiH[.sub]4[/] + NH[.sub]3[/] as raw  material gases. Attempts have been made to improve TFT  properties by increasing the quality if the a-Si and SiN layers,  and by purifying the a-Si/SiN interface that forms the channel.  Table 1 shows the main methods that have been used and the  results.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 Improvement of a-Si TFT Mobility                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Development Item  |Method            |Field Effect Mobi-|Endnote           |  |                  |                  |lity [.sub]FE |                  |  |                  |                  |[/] (cm[.sup]2  |                  |  |                  |                  |[/]/Vs)        |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Improve a-Si Qual-|Hot CVD           |1.7               |5                 |  |ity               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Improve SiN Quali-|Hybrid-excitation |5.3               |6                 |  |ty                |CVD, a-Si direct  |                  |                  |  |                  |nitrification     |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Low-Temperature P-|Plasma CVD        |10.1              |7                 |  |oly-Si (below 300&|                  |                  |                  |  |deg;C)            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Laser Annealing   |Excimer pulse met-|329               |8                 |  |                  |hod               |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Making the a-Si layer using hot CVD has been suggested as  one  way to improve the quality of a-Si. Hot CVD makes use of the  thermal decomposition reaction of the raw material gases, so  compared with PE-CVD it inherently avoids damage due to charged  particles, etc., and we can expect an increase in mobility. The  problem lies in the fact that the film-forming temperature  exceeds 600C, so this method is not suitable for the LCD  process, which uses a glass substrate. Ahn and  coworkers[.sup]5[/] attempted to reduce the film-forming  temperature by using a high order silane  (Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) as the raw material gas. They  manufactured a TFT with a substrate temperature of 500C and  obtained a [.sub]FE[/] of 1.7 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs.    Next it is necessary to look at the method for forming the  interface between the a-Si and the SiN gate insulating film. In  monocrystalline Si MOSFETs, a distinct improvement in properties  as well as stability and control were obtained by forming a  clean Si/SiO interface by the thermal oxidation of Si in bulk  silicon.    With the a-Si TFTs, however, the a-Si is formed on the SiN  gate insulating film by PE-CVD. Therefore the purity of the  interface is determined by the degree of vacuum during film  forming and the plasma conditions during a-Si growth. Following  the example of monocrystalline silicon, if an interface can also  be formed within bulk a-Si, a controlled, clean interface should  result. Yamamoto and coworkers[.sup]6[/] made an attempt by  direct nitrification of the a-Si surface with an ammonia  (NH[.sub]3[/]) plasma and subsequent deposition with SiN.  More specifically, by using both the direct photoexcitation of  NH[.sub]3[/] and plasma-excited H[.sub]2[/] radicals, they  avoided damage from charged particle collisions. In the  subsequent SiN deposition, they formed a coplanar TFT by direct  photoexcitation of Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] and  NH[.sub]3[/] plasma excitation. As a result, they obtained a  large [.sub]FE[/] value of 5.3 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs.    Recently poly-Si film-forming technology at low temperatures  of 300C or less has received particular notice. For  example, there are c-Si forming by plasma CVD and a CVD  method that uses atomic hydrogen. Mori and  coworkers[.sup]7[/] created a prototype TFT using poly-Si  manufactured by PE-CVD with a  SiF[.sub]4[/]/SiH[.sub]2[/]/H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture,  and they obtained a [.sub]FE[/] value of 10.1  cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs.    There have also been active attempts to use poly-Si. Many  manufacturing methods have been considered, but typical methods  involve heat treatment for solid phase crystallization of  reduced pressure CVD a-Si, recrystallization of a-Si by laser  and so forth. In the case of reduced pressure and solid phase  crystallization, high temperature film forming at 600C or  more or a lengthy heat treatment is required, and a high-priced  quartz substrate must be used, so it is not suitable for the  large TFT-LCD glass substrate process. On the other hand,  recrystallization by laser has a wide range of applications, and  because a huge [.sub]FE[/] value of 329 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs  has been reported[.sup]8[/], it appears to be the most  promising technique for the future.  <H5>  Self-Aligned a-Si TFT </H5>   Figure 3 compares three types of TFT structures that employ  self-alignment methods to reduce C[.sub]gs[/]. Fig. 3(a) is a  conventional TFT, with a channel length L and a gate source  overlap length _D_L. The minimum value for _D_L is  determined by  the overlap precision of the mask during the photolithography  process, and it is normally 3-4 m. In Fig. 3(b), the pattern  in the SiN protective layer on top of the a-Si is made  self-aligned at the gate electrode by exposing the resist of the  gate pattern through a mask from the underside of the glass  substrate. This enables a precision of 0.5-1.0 m for the  gate  source overlap _D_L[.sub]s[/], so C[.sub]gs[/] becomes  smaller.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-21A>      Figure 3 Cross Sections of a-Si TFT Structures </FIG>     In the structures in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) the source drain  electrode overlaps above the SiN protective film, and the  channel length L of the a-Si layer, which is the path for the  current, cannot be made any smaller when we consider the margin  in the photolithography process for this area. The value for L  must be 10-12 m.    On the other hand, in the structure shown in Fig. 3(c), the  n+ type a-Si layer, which is an ohmic contact layer, is made  self-aligned by ion implantation through a mask of the SiN  protective layer pattern instead of by PE-CVD as was done in the  past. The SiN pattern is also made self-aligned by using low  resistance metallic silicide for the source drain  electrode.[.sup]9[/] The silicide layer, for example Cr or Mo  silicide, is formed on top of the a-Si, and after a heat  treatment at about 200C, an unreacted metallic layer is  easily formed by etching removal. With this (c) structure, the  channel length (L[.sub]s[/]) can be made distinctly smaller  because it can be determined by the minimum processing  dimensions of the photolithography process. Naturally, with this  design W is reduced, C[.sub]gs[/]becomes smaller, and as a  result C[.sub]s[/] is reduced.    Figure 4 shows the results of simulations of the dependence  of field effect mobility on numerical aperture.[.sup]2[/] The  model device here is a 13.8 inch diagonal EWS (1152 x 3 x 900  mm). For TFT dimensions we used L=12 m, _D_L=4 m,  _D_L[.sub]s[/]=0.5 m, and L[.sub]s[/]=9 m. The  numerical aperture is strongly dependent on the structure of the  TFT, and the field effect mobility [.sub]FE[/] is as well.  In the case of the self-aligned TFT (c), a relatively large  numerical aperture was obtained even when the [.sub]FE[/]  was small.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-22A>      Figure 4. Simulation of Dependence of Field Effect </FIG>     If we assume a practical level of, let us say, 35%  for an  EWS numerical aperture, with the conventional TFT we need a  [.sub]FE[/] of 1.25 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. As I have already  shown in Fig. 1, this is almost impossible to realize with an  a-Si TFT. With the self-aligned TFT (b), we need a  [.sub]FE[/] of 0.8 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. On the other hand,  with self-aligned TFT (c), the [.sub]FE[/] is 0.5  cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs, which is sufficient for design, so its  effect is quite outstanding. Therefore, we can say that the  self-aligned TFT (c) makes maximum use of the qualities of the  a-Si TFT, and it is a structure that shows great promise for the  future.    In the self-aligned TFT (c), the n+ a-Si layer of the source  drain is formed by ion implantation. Normally, a mass separation  type of ion implantation device is used to dope crystal  semiconductors, but such a device is ill suited to perform  implantation in a reasonably short period of time on a substrate  as large as 360x465 mm, for example, for the TFT-LCD. Based on  the simplicity of the structure of the apparatus, implantation  will be more suitably performed by the large-caliber ion beam of  a non-mass separation type of device that uses a plasma of  dopant gas. However, when a gas source such as PH[.sub]3[/]is  used, extraneous elements in addition to the phosphorous, such  as the hydrogen, will be implanted at the same time. Research is  continuing on problems such as what kind of effect the behavior  of these extraneous elements will have on TFT properties, how to  optimize the profile of the implanted phosphorus, and what is  the best structure for the apparatus.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   One trend in a-Si TFT technology is toward larger size and  higher resolution for AM-LCDs. More specifically, from the  standpoint of device performance, improvement of TFT properties  will be the key technology.    In this article I have described (1) new techniques for  making a-Si and SiN materials and a-Si/SiN interface control  techniques, and (2) self-aligned TFT structures and ion doping  techniques as the essential techniques for improving the  performance of TFT properties. Naturally, these apply to all  TFT-LCDs and are not limited only to large, high resolution  models.    Of course, research in this area has only begun to scratch  the surface, but we hope that our efforts will have a major  impact on the field, and we have great expectations for TFT-LCDs  as next-generation technology.

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PUMPING LIMITATION GETS INITIAL OK  </P> <P> A local water agency has given its initial approval to an ordinance designed to  reduce excessive pumping of ground water and is expected to adopt it at its  next meeting Aug. 24.  </P> <P> The measure, proposed by the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency and  tentatively approved Thursday, would reduce the extraction of ground water by  5% in 1992.  </P> <P> Cutbacks would reach 75% by the year 2009 for the agency, which manages water  resources contributing to the water supply for more than 100,000 Ventura County  residents, said county hydrologist Rick Farnsworth.  </P> <P> If passed, the restrictions will affect areas from Moorpark to the coast,  including the cities of Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Ventura, Camarillo and Moorpark,  as well as small water companies, ranches and farms.  </P> <P> Adoption of the ordinance "will conserve more water and help control overdraft  and seawater intrusion," Farnsworth said. He said it appears the board will  approve the ordinance later this month.  </P> <P> Water officials have said that agricultural users would bear the brunt of the  cutbacks. Well owners would become more dependent on outside water sources or  be forced to cut their use. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Management: Ready for a crisis British management is at last taking crisis management seriously, according to a review* published by Infoplan, a public relations group whose activities include devising strategies for dealing with corporate crises. Crises that cause a lack of corporate sleep range from bombs to television sets that burst into flames, says the survey of 250 major companies, selected from the FT-A 500. Some 92 per cent of those surveyed claimed to train all of their employees, to a lesser or greater degree, in crisis systems and procedures. At the most basic this would include fire drills. Sabotage, extortion and product faults; fire; dirty tricks and fraud; and environmental disasters were among respondents' biggest fears. All respondents considered bombs to be a real threat to business. As Infoplan says: 'It is therefore interesting and concerning that 52 per cent of companies that had developed a crisis management plan with well-tested systems and procedures, always assumed, no matter what the emergency, that they would still have access to their own building.' The report includes advice from the Metropolitan Police on problems such as extortion and from the Ministry of Agriculture on food matters. (Respondents considered the food and drinks industries to have been the most at risk in 1993 with mould growth and metal, plastic and glass slivers mentioned as major concerns.) Companies that were felt to have handled their own crises well included British Midland - one of whose aeroplanes crashed in 1989 - and Perrier which withdrew 40m bottles in 1990. Crises believed to have been handled badly included the Hoover airfare promotion. *The review of crisis and risk management, from Infoplan, 38 Bedford Square, London WC1B3EG. Price Pounds 87.50</p>

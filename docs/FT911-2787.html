			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: The riddle of the turnip - This collector never lost his curiosity the rest, as they say, is history. At about the same time, an impecunious Foreign Office employee called David Scott bought Sophie Anderson's 'No Walk Today'. It shows a little girl in an ostrich-feather hat. She gazes wistfully out from the parlour window at a 'monkey's wedding' afternoon of sunshine and raindrops. Clearly, she cannot understand why in the world They have decreed it is too wet for a walk. In the 1920's, there could not have been a type of painting more unfashionable with collectors. However, David Scott (1887-1987) was, quite literally, a born Victorian. Throughout his long life, he stayed true to the kind of paintings admired in his childhood. Sunshine and Shadow, now on view at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh (until June 2), is the first chance for the public to enjoy a uniquely personal collection of mid-Victorian genre paintings. It surely cannot be our last chance. If this enthralling exhibition does not reach London - at the very least - then it will be a crying shame. Apart from landscapes by Samuel Boyce and William Dyce, most of the 30 paintings explore the quintessential aim of the mid-Victorian artist; to tell a story. Like a typical early-19th century novel, Sunshine and Shadow has a moral; narrative paintings do not yield their secrets to the casual glance. In fact, as I watched Edinburgh visitors hover and debate in front of paintings like Thomas Faed's 'The Soldier's Return' or Thomas Roberts's 'The Discovery', it was clear quite how naturally people respond to these once-derided paintings. Read through the comments book at the end of the show, and the appreciative remarks far outweigh protests about 'kitsch' and 'sentimental twaddle'. Of course, a title like 'The Discovery' is, quite frankly, a come-on. Moreover, like all the best genre painters, Roberts knew how to attract the viewer by strong contrasts of light and shadow, and accents of brilliant colour. (These paintings are fresh from restoration by the Hamilton Kerr Institute in Cambridge, so you see them at their brightest.) If, on the way to the gallery, you stop among the Dutch 17th-century paintings and look at the paintings by Jan Steen and Pieter de Hooch, the education of the 19th-century genre painter becomes abundantly clear. So what is the discovery in Roberts's painting? A flood of sunlight pours into a bedroom, lighting up the central figure of a girl in bed. She must be ill, or the light would have woken her, and her hair looks as if it might be damp from a feverish sleep. A young woman in outdoor dress is bending to look at the locket around the sleeper's neck. Whose picture does the locket contain? Her lover's, some have thought. But why, then, does the discoverer looks so composed? Furthermore, the painting has a happy feel, with the butterfly landing on the pot of rosebuds on the windowsill. Once the invalid is nursed back to health, should we not imagine the last page of the novel will see her at the altar? Scott evidently loved to puzzle over his collection. You should not miss his humorous, quizzical comments. Rather oddly, they are not included in the catalogue, but can be found on a table. (He favoured the view that the painting showed a mistress who had discovered the guilty love of her servant-girl.) Maybe there is a deliberate ambiguity in a painting like this. 'Letting the public make up its own mind' has these days become the fashionable rhetoric for exhibition organisers. Usually, this turns out to be populist pandering, and the art-historians know exactly what they are trying to prove. Sunshine and Shadow is rather different; there are genuine puzzles, and any visitor's guess may be as good as the next. We have printed here the most genuinely mysterious of Scott's pictures. He believed he had identified it as James Lobley's 'The Squire and the Gamekeeper', or 'The Demurrer'. Curator Lindsay Errington, however, writes that Lobley 'had nothing to do with it.' Is the episode one from a novel, the stage, or even a radical political comment? It certainly seems to show an effete - or is he merely bookish? - squire confronted by an angry gamekeeper who waves a turnip under his nose. Scott thought that the landlord had spent too long at his books. Maybe the painting is a warning about the evils of too much attention to the theory of land-management - one of the tomes has 'Theory' in the title. Someone, surely, will be able to decipher the meaning of the master, the man, and the turnip, even if it defeated David Scott. If so, he would love to have known. These days, there is no shortage of grand exhbitions, with catalogues which eulogise the wealthy collectors of 20th-century art. Here is a very different and moving exhibition, about a collector who never lost his curiosity, nor his desire to share, with others.</p>

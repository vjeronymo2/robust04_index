These tolerances were established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data submitted in support of the petition and other relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerances include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A 2-year feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats using dietary concentrations of 0, 125, 500, and 2,000 ppm, equivalent to 0, 6.25, 25.0, and 100 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) body weight (bwt)/day in males and females. Clinical chemistry findings suggest that the target organ for toxicity may be the liver. The levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) were consistently higher at 2,000 ppm in males and females when compared to untreated controls, and some increase in these two parameters was also observed at 500 ppm. Although there was an accompanying small increase in liver weight at 2,000 ppm in females, there were no accompanying increases in histopathologic changes of the liver in either sex. There were only marginal effects seen on other clinical chemistry parameters, and no effect of the test compound was seen on clinically observed signs of toxicity, food consumption, hematology, or urinalysis parameters. The systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) is 125 ppm (6.25 mg/kg/day for males and females) based on the increase in liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT). The systemic lowest-effect level (LEL) was 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day for males and females). The chemical was not carcinogenic to rats under the testing conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice using dietary concentrations of 0, 125, 500, and 2,000 ppm (equivalent to doses of 0, 18, 72, and 285 mg/kg/day for males and females). The results of blood chemistry, organ weights, and gross and histological examinations indicate that the liver is the target organ. There were time- and dose-related increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), SGOT, and SGPT activities in both male and female animals receiving 500 and 2,000 ppm of the test material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, increased incidence of enlarged livers, hyperplastic nodules, and increased liver weights in both male and female animals receiving 2,000 ppm of test material was detected at necropsy. Female animals receiving 2,000- ppm doses exhibited a significant increase in the incidence of liver adenomas only, a compound-related oncogenic effect which is discussed further below. In males, there were no differences in the incidence of these lesions in treated and control males, and the incidences of liver adenomas were similar to those observed in historical controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on blood chemistry findings, the systemic NOEL and the LEL are 125 and 500 ppm, respectively (equivalent to 18 and 72 mg/kg/day for males and females). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A 2-year male and female dog feeding study using doses of 0, 150, 600, and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 3.75, 15, and 60 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females). The NOEL is 150 ppm based on changes in enzyme levels (equivalent to 3.75 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females). The LEL is 600 ppm. Although there were significant decreases in mean body weights in males receiving 150 and 2,400 ppm and in females receiving 600 and 2,400 ppm, the biological significance of these changes could not be assessed. There were noted increases in alkaline phosphatase  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -demethylase and cytochrome P-450 in males receiving 2,400 ppm and significant increases in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -demethylase in females receiving 600 and 2,400 ppm and in cytochrome P-450 in females receiving 2,400 ppm when compared to controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A 6-month dog feeding study using doses of 0, 10, 30, and 100 ppm (equivalent to 0, 0.25, 0.75, and 2.5 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females). The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A 3-month rat feeding study using doses of 0, 150, and 600 and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 7.5, 30 and 120 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females) demonstrated a decrease in body weight, in hematocrit values, and in eosinophil count and medium cell hemoglobin and demonstrated an increase in the high-dose group and a dose-related increase in liver weight. The NOEL is 7.5 mg/kg and the LEL is 30 mg/kg. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A second 90-day rat feeding study using doses of 0, 120, 600, and 3,000 ppm demonstrated piloerection lasting 1 month (month 1), decreases in body weight gain and feed efficiency lasting 1 week (week 1), alterations in serum lipids, and increases in liver weight (absolute and relative) and in incidences of liver hypertrophy and fatty changes in the high-dose group and an increase in the incidence of prostrate atrophy of slight severity in high-dose males. The NOEL was 600 ppm, equivalent to 39.6 mg/kg/day for males and 46.4 mg/kg/day for females and the lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was the HDT, 3,000 ppm, equivalent to 208.5 mg/kg/day for males and 221.1 mg/kg/day for females. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A 3-month dog feeding study using doses of 0, 150, 600, and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 3.75, 15, and 60 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females). Weight gain in all male groups and in the highest dose female group was significantly less than the control. Alkaline phosphatase in males and females showed a dose-related negative trend. There were no gross pathological changes. Effects at 15 mg/kg included an increase in serum cholesterol level in males. Although the NOEL appeared to be less than 3.75 mg/kg, based on reduced body weight and decreased alkaline phosphatase in males, the Agency has concluded that effects below 15 mg/kg in the 2-year dog study were not biologically significant and the longer-term study supersedes the 90-day dog study. Therefore, the NOEL remains at 3.75 mg/kg. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. A rat developmental study using dose levels of 0, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day was determined to be core supplementary because the NOEL for developmental toxicity (supernumerary ribs) was not definitively established. The NOEL and LOEL for maternal toxicity for this study are 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on decreases in maternal body weight, body weight gain, and food consumption at 60 and 120 mg/kg/day. Increased embryolethality (embryotoxicity) was only observed at the highest dose level tested (120 mg/kg/day).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. A repeat rat developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 15 mg/kg/day due to decreased body weight gains, and with a developmental NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 60 mg/kg/day due to increased incidence of extra ribs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. A supplementary rabbit developmental study with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 8 mg/kg and a maternal LEL of 40 mg/kg based on decreased body weight gains and food consumption. The developmental NOEL and LEL were 40 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. A repeat rabbit developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 125 mg/kg/day due to decreases in body weight gains and food consumption, and with a developmental NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day (HDT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. A reverse mutation assay (Ames), a dominant lethal test in mice, DNA damage/repair, unscheduled DNA synthesis, in vitro and in vivo (rat) cytogenic assays, and a forward mutation in mice, all of which were negative for mutagenic effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. A rat multi-generation reproduction study using doses of 0, 20, 100, and 500 ppm (equivalent to 0, 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females) indicated that the NOEL and LOEL for both parental and pup toxicity are 100 and 500 ppm, respectively, based on significant body weight and organ weight changes. The NOEL for reproductive toxicity is 500 ppm, the highest dose level tested. The Agency has concluded that the available data provide limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of triadimenol in mice and has classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with Agency guidelines, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 1986 (51 FR 33992; September 24, 1986). This evaluation was confirmed by the Agency's Scientific Advisory Panel on December 15, 1987. Based on a review of the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs, the Agency has determined that a quantitative risk assessment is not appropriate for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The tumors observed were benign and observed in one sex (females) and were present only at the highest dose tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to rats at dose levels ranging from 125 to 2,000 ppm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The chemical was negative in the genotoxic assay battery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this evidence, EPA concludes that triadimenol poses at most a negligible cancer risk to humans and that for purposes of risk characterization the Reference Dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk. There are no processed commodities derived from the RACs, wheat straw, barley straw and oat straw, consequently no corresponding food or feed additive regulations are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard risk assessment approach of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to triadimenol. The provisional acceptable daily intake (PADI) based on the 2-year dog feeding studies (NOEL of 3.75 mg/kg bwt/day), and using a hundredfold uncertainty factor, is calculated to be 0.038 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances is 0.000448 mg/kg/day and utilizes 1.2 percent of the PADI for the U.S. population. For nonnursing infants and children, the TMRC represents 2.8 and 2.6 percent of the PADI, respectively. These tolerances will not change the TMRC or the dietary exposure analysis because the already established meat and milk tolerances will cover any dietary exposure from the increased tolerances in wheat straw, barley straw, and oat straw. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of the residue is adequately understood. The residues of concern consist of the parent compound,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> beta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -(4-chlorophenoxy)- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> alpha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol and its butanediol metabolite, 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2,2-dimethyl-4-(1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -1,2,4,-triazol-l-yl)-1,3-butanediol, calculated as parent. Adequate analytical methods are available for enforcement purposes. Methods are available in the ``Pesticide Analytical Manual,'' Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement of the tolerances on livestock commodities. The method for plants has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in PAM II. Because of the long lead time from establishing this tolerance to publication of the enforcement methodology in the PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 246, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-4432. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Daniel M.

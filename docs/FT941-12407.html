			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Balladur acts to lift ailing economy Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday unveiled a package of measures designed to stimulate France's struggling economy and curb the rise in unemployment. The measures are designed to encourage consumer spending and provide support to industries, including the motor industry, which have been badly hit by France's economic downturn. They reflect concerns about an unemployment rate in excess of 12 per cent and a desire to strengthen the country's weak economic recovery. The principal elements of the package, which was constrained by a budget deficit targeted at FFr300bn (Pounds 34bn) this year, include an easing of the rules relating to employees' profit-share savings schemes. Under the proposals, employees will be able to withdraw funds from these schemes ahead of the usual five-year deposit period if they are used to buy cars or for housing-related expenditure. Insee, the national statistics office, estimates some FFr80bn is held in such schemes. The motor industry will receive additional assistance through an innovative scheme to give a FFr5,000 allowance to motorists who trade in cars more than 10 years old and buy a new vehicle. This allowance appears to apply to all makes of car, irrespective of their country of origin. Last year car sales in the French market fell by 18 per cent to 1.72m, the lowest since the mid-1970s. Mr Balladur, stressing that yesterday's measures did not mark a departure from existing economic policy, outlined additional plans to stem the rise in unemployment. Implementation of the government's five-year employment plan, which was announced last year, will be accelerated. Companies and unions were urged to bring forward negotiations to discuss how to increase flexibility in working practices and to extend part-time work and training schemes. In addition, the government said it would encourage employers to increase the number of service sector jobs. Mr Balladur said the economy's performance was improving and confirmed the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year after an estimated contraction of 0.8 per cent last year. But many private sector economists are more pessimistic. The 2.1 per cent decline in consumer spending on manufactured goods in the final quarter of last year has raised fears that economic activity declined after recovery in the July-September period. The weakness in consumer spending is partly the result of increases in indirect taxes last year and higher social security payments. But Mr Balladur promised yesterday that French households would not face any extra tax increases this year, 'in order not to put the brakes on recovery'.</p>

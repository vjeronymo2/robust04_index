			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Guinea in telecoms sale Advisers to the African republic of Guinea are this week studying proposals submitted by foreign investors to privatise the national telecommunications company. Foreign companies had until last week to submit proposals for the state-run international and domestic telecommunications company (Sotelgui). The privatisation is part of the Guinean government's sell-off programme, which also involves the energy sector and hotels. Mr Arnaud Casalis, of Arthur Andersen Paris, the international accounting and consulting group brought in to advise the government, said: 'We have convinced the government that it would be better to use the funds to develop the company rather than bring in money for the government.' The deal involves the sale of a minority stake of up to 49 per cent. Mr Casalis said a later tranche of up to 51 per cent would be aimed at Guinean nationals. A decision on the foreign proposals would be made in late December. Belgium granted a BFr100m loan to Guinea in 1993 to enable the country to set up a 300-line digital telephone exchange.</p>

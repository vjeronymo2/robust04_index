			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of </F> the Kingdom of Cambodia" in Phnom Penh on 2 May]    [Text] I would like to request the beloved Royal  Government to order the responsible and competent compatriots  not to forcibly recruit our civilian compatriots who are  unwilling to serve the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF].    The method that the KRAF must follow now and in the future  in  recruiting soldiers is to accept only the voluntary combatants.    Any KRAF unit whose members are forcibly recruited will not  be able to win victory in the fight on the battlefield.    [Singed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

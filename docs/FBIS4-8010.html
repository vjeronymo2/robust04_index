			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Miro Lasic, member of the Presidency of </F> Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not given:  "`If We Do Not Want an Agreement, We Will Have War'"]    [Text] Miro Lasic never submitted his resignation as  a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and  therefore legally he can still be considered a member of that  body, although another person has been named to that position.  In addition, Lasic is one of those who revived Napredak  (Progress), the Croatian cultural society, he is president of  the Croatian Intellectual Forum, cochairman of the Croatian  Section of the International Society for Human Rights (IGFM),  and before the war he was director of the Sarajevo theater  festival MES for a number of years. So it is not difficult to  find a topic for conversation with him. Nevertheless, we  restricted ourselves to the political present and future of the  Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    [Sabic] "Well-informed sources" have been talking for a long  time now about world (U.S.) pressure on the Croatian and Muslim  side to revive the alliance between these two peoples who are  victims of the aggression of Serbian expansionism. It can now  be said that the pressure has borne fruit. Did the Muslims and  Croats have to get in a situation of being subjected to  pressure?    [Lasic] We are in a historical situation in which the  international community has an interest in a Croato-Muslim  alliance. We are well aware that the armed conflict between the  Muslims and Croats was artificially stimulated and provoked in  a dirty way. Without going into all the reasons on this  occasion, both sides were involved in bringing about the  conflict: The Muslim fault, 70 percent of the total, came from  the central government, and the Croatian fault, representing 30  percent, was manifested at the peripheral level. Almost the  same proportions, but in reverse, occurred during the lengthy  period of the peace initiative. "Offers" of peace were issued  from the Croatian Supreme Command and from the Muslim  peripheral level.    So, the sporadic and local conflicts occurred through the  Croatian fault, but the all-out war, such as was waged in the  Lasva Valley, occurred because of the strategic moves and  decisions of the Muslim leadership. It now seems that even in  the Muslim General Staff they have finally committed themselves  to accepting the Croatian peace initiative, and we should  expect the disagreements to be resolved around a green baize  table instead of on the battlefield. Now, just as in the past,  the key is in the hands of the Muslim leadership.  <H5>  The Option of Contact Did Not Die </H5>   [Sabic] Did the United States necessarily have to become  involved for the Croats and Muslims to agree?    [Lasic] U.S. policy did not need to use any pressure at all  on the Croatian side. All we needed was for our position to be  understood, and when that finally occurred, there was the first  constructive result, the preliminary agreement with the Bosnian  Muslims. What is more, the Americans did not put anything  together by force, but they precisely noted the most favorable  realistic opportunities, and they could be recognized and read  in Croatian policy.    Let us not forget, even in the worst moments of the conflict  with the Muslims there were always flickering options of  contact and possible agreement, a process was taking place in  the background with attempts to resolve the crisis and revive  the alliance, which Franjo Boras was persistently initiating in  the Presidency, but without a real response. The Americans were  certainly well aware of that, and I would not say it was a  question of their dictate, but of their understanding and  correct orientation--to which their skillful ambassador, Victor  Jackovich, I believe, also contributed. That is essential for  us, because this is the most powerful force in the world, and  it opened up for Croatian efforts and Croatian policy an  immediate occasion for application and realization.    [Sabic] Many people are inclined to say that a change of  direction occurred in Croatian policy toward Bosnia and  Herzegovina. Do you agree with that assessment, and to what  extent?    [Lasic] Croatian state policy is conducted in an unbroken  continuity, and those "many people" are just "some people,"  specifically those who talk about this and judge it either from  a lack of understanding and misconception or out of some petty  political interest of their own. The Croatian national  objective has always been peace. Aggression and war were  imposed on the Croats, both in Croatia and also in Bosnia and  Herzegovina. Defense, which was a grave necessity, implies both  counteroffensives and various tactical moves. One cannot always  go in a straight line. Even back in Lisbon in February of 1992  during Muslim, Serb, and Croat talks, I set forth views which  were verified in the center and supported by President Tudjman,  and mostly they have been taken over in the present preliminary  agreement between the Croats and Bosnian Muslims. The effective  instructions of President Tudjman were never directed at any  point toward the breakup of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I can  personally testify to that. Of course, on every occasion he  explicitly called for the protection of all the Croats and the  Croatian interest.  <H5>  The Croatian Defense Council Was a Lightning Rod </H5>   In March 1992, the Serbs established authority by hook or by  crook over a large part of the territory, and the Muslims  imposed their hegemony more and more wherever they could. Some  of our political leaders hesitated and gave in to foreign  domination out of opportunism. In April 1992, Mate Boban, with  the help of the center, organized the Croatian Defense Council  [HVO] as a defensive energy, as a lightning rod for the Croats  in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The creation of Herceg-Bosna as a  part of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred when the  HVO, in a period of grave crisis, in a balance of armament and  strength of the armed forces that can be said to have been  disastrous for the Croats, was defending undefined territory and  organizing life under wartime conditions. The Muslims, the worst  victims of aggression, were getting extensive and unselfish  humanitarian, logistical, and armed aid from the Croatian  people, which was itself threatened. Herceg-Bosna thus became a  provisional historical fact, a symbol and reality of Croatian  defense, and that is beyond dispute. There is something wrong  with the Croatism of anyone who does not see and recognize that.    What kind of policy and whose (Croatian) policy deserves the  credit for the Croats finally having become an important  principal with an internationally recognized decisive role?  Everyone knows the answer, and perhaps that is precisely what  has caused the frustration and paranoic reactions of those "many  people" who have seen the lines of the battlefields only on the  map. As the popular saying goes: Where were they during the  thunder and lightning?    [Sabic] When Bosnia and Herzegovina is discussed, people  inevitably talk about the peoples who live in it living  together. One often hears that these nationalities have been  condemned to live together, but also that life together is no  longer possible after all that has happened. Which of these  assertions is closer to the truth?    [Lasic] When you talk about life together today--that is a  great dilemma. The impression that life together could still be  revived and preserved comes from historical inertia, because  everyone is in trouble, all the nationalities want peace, the  world wants peace, and it is almost certain that the invective  of war and the fateful tensions could cease in Bosnia if they  could all finally understand one another. If we do not want an  agreement, we will have war. Regardless of the injustices during  the period of communism, when every nationality was neglected  and frustrated--but the Croats constantly and most of all --  this bloody war certainly would not have occurred had it not  been for Serbian expansionism and intervention from outside for  conquest.    The principle of living together in Bosnia has had various  manifestations and arrangements of human relations. That would  have prevented this dirty war, and that is beyond any doubt, but  war was imported into Bosnia. Indeed even the drastically  altered conditions that resulted in two nationalities being  crammed together in a tight space -- 65 percent of the  population on 30 percent of the territory of Bosnia and  Herzegovina--could not have caused major armed conflicts,  although that fact did create tensions. In other words, even  under the impossible conditions coexistence among the  nationalities, in particular between the Croats and Muslims,  victims of the same aggression, could have been maintained  through goodwill and mutual respect for each other's interests.    [Sabic] Can it be said that you are an optimist concerning  the final Croato-Muslim agreement that is to follow after the  preliminary agreement?    [Lasic] I cannot speak for the Muslim side. The Croats, one  can confidently say, accept the agreement generally as the  result of the Croatian peace initiative.  <H5>  An Open Appeal to the Third Nationality </H5>   [Sabic] If all the documents from the negotiations in  Washington and Vienna are adopted, what has to be done?    [Lasic] I think that a temporary transitional government  must  immediately be set up to conduct the affairs of state on the  basis of the agreement until the next democratic election, which  would be in a period of one or two years, i.e., until the safe  return of the displaced persons and refugees. Officials should  be appointed by the legal political parties in the proportions  in which they obtained ethnic legitimacy in the last election:  For the Croats, this is the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union],  which took 94 percent of the Croatian seats in the Assembly of  Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all 100 percent in the Presidency.    [Sabic] You mention elections, but still they are far away.  But that is a question of democratic procedure, and this must be  put on the "agenda" sooner or later.    [Lasic] Electoral procedure is one of the decisive issues.  Each nationality should elect its own representatives.  Otherwise, because the balance between the Bosnian Muslims and  Croats in the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina is 72:28, the  Croats would get "representatives" who in both practice and  theory would in every respect be determined by someone else and  not they themselves. That is the case in Sarajevo today. Which  means ethnic voter lists must be drawn up. Incidentally, that is  one of the virtues of the Vienna negotiations, which, according  to the reports, are going favorably, which means in the interest  of both nationalities.    [Sabic] Many people familiar with Bosnia and Herzegovina are  ready to say that the prospects are not good when two of the  three nationalities in it reach agreement independently of the  third. Can that rule also be applied to the Croato-Muslim  preliminary agreement? Are there prospects for the Serbs to join  the agreement as well?    [Lasic] The opportunities of joining are open to them,  because the preliminary agreement has been drafted in such a way  that an open appeal to the Serbs is implied in its context. If  we are to judge by the public signals of Serbian policy, at  least for now there are no prospects of the Serbs, as an ethnic  entity, entering the federal arrangements and confederal  relations with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Bosnia and  Herzegovina. We should not forget that the Serbs carried out  aggression and they are still behaving aggressively. But we  should be mindful that the agreement between the Croats and the  Bosnian Muslims alters the political reality of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, toward which the Serbs, like it or not, must take a  position and define their policy.    In other words, they will not be able to behave as though  nothing had happened, and things do not happen in a vacuum, but  in a world context, so that it is logical to expect the consent  of the world, of the United States and Russia first of all, to  a solution that would not be the temporary situation of a  temporary truce, but the firm foundation of a lasting peace.    [Sabic] This crucial time is being marked by meetings of the  Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There have been particularly  significant meetings in Sarajevo on 6 February and in Livno on 8  February. These and other meetings indicate that the Croatian  people in Bosnia and Herzegovina should rally around a policy  which will be viewed as their joint program. But the approaches  and points of departure differ. Who is right?    [Lasic] In the present reality in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  viewed in isolation, it is absolutely certain that all the  Croats, that is, the representatives of the Croatian people,  from all the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are right. There  are causes and reasons which brought the Croats to a historical  impasse precisely now when they are waging a decisive struggle  for the natural right of Croats in their native country of  Bosnia and Herzegovina. But we must not omit from our thinking  that a right can result in harm to the person seeking it if the  scope of that right does not offer a future. And the future of  Croats and of their right in Bosnia and Herzegovina can only be  the entire Croatian interest, and here that entirety for us  Croats is based on the outlook, security, and strength of the  state of Croatia.  <H5>  Was It a Case of "Petty Folklore"? </H5>   [Sabic] Is the expected reconciliation with the Muslims a  reflection of our inability--either because we were not strong  enough or because of the inhibiting force of the world  community--to resolve the situation "in the field"?    [Lasic] There is no real historical chance of reviving  concord between the Croats and Muslims, nor of finding a modus  vivendi with the Muslims, but also with the Serbs, and achieving  an authentic agreement, if we are disunited and weak. Every  Croat must keep that in mind. The alliance with the Bosnian  Muslims does not assume that we are weak and would therefore  enter into an alliance and back off from legitimate Croatian  policy. In that case, we would not be equal, but we would be in  a subordinate position. Our strength is great, but the more  united we are, the greater that strength.    [Sabic] If that is so, that means that the alliance with the  Bosnian Muslims is a thrust that comes from our increased  strength.    [Lasic] Right. We can enter into an alliance with the  Bosnian  Muslims, under the final agreement, in two ways: forced because  we are weak or oriented because we are strong and united. This  is one of the historical moments which every Croat must  recognize. This is, after all, everyone's personal destiny as  well. For example, if all the Croats in Sarajevo were put ad hoc  into positions of power in the government of the Bosnian  Muslims, there would be no guarantee of their fate. It would be  up to someone else, just as is the case today of the Croats who  out of the kindness of the Muslim leaders are part of the  administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo or are  organizing "rallies" there.    Without a guarantee of the Croatian entity, the Croats as  individuals, and also as groups, have no future whatsoever. This  does not mean that we should not understand the vital necessity  and human attempt to do something to make that position easier.  That is why that meeting in Sarajevo should be seen as a real  reflex on the part of those 300, or more precisely 306, people  who attended out of the 35,000 Sarajevo Croats. In principle, if  procedure is respected, and that means legitimacy, support  should be given to the effort for the Croats to meet, to become  stronger, to enter into association, to study and inquire into  their possibilities.    [Sabic] You and the writer Andjelko Vuletic were unable to  take part in the meeting in Sarajevo. Ivan Lovrenovic, one of  the organizers of the Sarajevo meeting, recently declared in an  interview that preventing your coming to Sarajevo was "petty  folklore." What actually happened?    [Lasic] That is well-known to the organizers of the Sarajevo  meeting; in the end, they stood behind that. Only one of them,  Ivan Lovrenovic, used the phrase "petty folklore over  everything" to describe the effort to keep away those political  Croats who by all parameters which they themselves have  proclaimed should have been on the list, present and active. The  only thing Lovrenovic, as is evident from his statement, was  afraid of was that no one from the Muslim government would come  to the meeting--and he knew, in "consultation" with Ivo Komsic,  back in Zagreb, not only who would come, but also where they  would sit and what they would say. The news about the  unprecedented incident, in which even the Croatian ambassador,  Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, was also held back, which Lovrenovic  refers to as a mystification, traveled around the world.    Our ignoramus does not mention that this provoked negative  comments and marked the entire Sarajevo meeting as a  totalitarian ruse of proven advocates of their own exclusive  doctrine. The people on the program for that meeting did not  include any new names, new people, those who authentically  suffered, but mainly those who in the democratic election did  not win the confidence of the people for their policy, and so  they are attempting to "fish in muddy waters," using real  troubles in their manipulation. That is nothing new. This is  familiar ground. The sad thing is that a Croatian intellectual,  a writer, should pretend not to know what the suspension of  democratic procedure means and where it leads. The real issue  was not whether particular people could take part, but the  procedure itself, and Western civilization is based on  procedure, at least that is well-known.    [Sabic] And in the end, how close are we to peace or far  from  it?    [Lasic] Peace must be closer and closer to us. If we are to  favorably regulate our relations with the other two  nationalities, the Bosnian Muslims and Serbs, in a truly  civilized way, in a possible reconciliation of interests,  because only this can be lasting, we must be strong, and that  means united. That is the sense in which one should understand  the gist of President Tudjman's policy and his vision of the  entirety of the Croatian interest. Croatian state policy, which  is legally and legitimately, by the political will of the  Croatian people, conducted by President Tudjman, must under  wartime conditions be valid for every Croatian patriot and  conducted in a unified fashion.    Our point of departure must be the historical imperative,  which is that we do everything we can so that we Croats, in  Bosnia and Herzegovina and in general, are unified so that each  individual, with his pledge to that unity, has his own prospects  for resolving his own crucial issues in the entirety of the  general interest of the Croatian people.  <H5>  The Traps in the Washington Agreement </H5>   [Sabic] What is your view of the preliminary agreement? Is  there a trap concealed in it?    [Lasic] The preliminary agreement is a superbly drafted  legal  document. From the standpoint of constitutional theory and  practice, in particular there are two critical points for me.  The legislative body with two chambers--the House of  Representatives and the Chamber of Nationalities--copies the  model of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. In  the House of Representatives, which might be superfluous in the  federal interethnic state community at the highest level, where  there are only two principals representing two nationalities,  the membership is made up on the formula "one man one vote."  The Bosnian Muslims will always have a more than two-thirds  majority--72 percent--so that by the nature of things the Croats  would always be in a minority if there should be a difference of  views. It is good that a correction has been envisaged in the  Chamber of Nationalities.    But the function of the latter chamber must be defined  precisely. If at the highest level of the state we are to  achieve ethnic reciprocity of rights in all institutions with  government prerogatives, the constituent nationalities,  regardless of numbers, must have equal rights. Unless absolute  parity is pursued in the legislative, judicial, or executive  branches, I see a danger in that one ethnic majority could be  set against the other ethnic minority. That could become a  generator of tension and conflict.    The longevity and stability of the federation are guaranteed  only by parity, consensus, and every office open to change.  Another critical point might be the provision on the central  government, where parity is also essential. This is an  institution familiar from the Belgian Constitution (the Council  of Ministers consists of an equal number of ministers  representing the French and Flemish languages). But, as Dr. Mate  Granic, who headed the Croatian delegation in Washington, has  stated, every agreement presupposes reconciliation of views,  i.e., compromises. In the interest of the federation and its  future, I believe that it would be worthwhile for our side and  the side of the Bosnian Muslims to envisage certain institutions  that would eliminate the possibility of ethnic confrontation in  both practice and theory.    [Sabic] Negotiations are being conducted in Vienna  concerning  the constitution of the federation. What might arise as a  problem in the wording of the constitution?    [Lasic] A big job was done with the signing of the  preliminary agreement in Washington. Nevertheless, the  constitution is the fundamental document of the state, and one  must show maximum caution. Dr. Ivo Sanader, who heads the  Croatian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna, said that the  territorial arrangement is perhaps the most difficult problem.  Every Croat who lives on "problematical" territory will agree  with Dr. Sanader. The duty to undo the knots which have been  tied for almost an entire century has fallen to our generation.  Let us start with the first level of government--the opstina. In  territorial terms, the opstina arrangement of Bosnia and  Herzegovina was done to suit the holders of power at the time,  in the sixties, so perfidiously as to make the Croats a minority  wherever possible. The borders of the opstinas and kotars that  came down from Austro-Hungary were altered in minute detail and  with the same objective back in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.    For instance, Mostar is frequently referred to as a  community  in which the Muslims have the majority--about 44,000 Muslims, it  is said, as against 42,500 Croats--that is a difference of 1  percent on behalf of the Muslims. That is a striking half-truth,  because those figures apply to opstina territory. In the actual  city of Mostar, according to the official 1991 Census, which is  the most unfavorable to the Croats, there are about 27,000  Muslims and 31,000 Croats. But on one side a locality inhabited  by Muslims was added to Mostar Opstina, while another with  100-percent Croatian population was taken away.    The example of Dobretici, where there are 4,500 Croats,  today  driven from their century-old homes, is also significant. By  administrative decision, Dobretici was annexed to Skender Vakuf  Opstina, with which it does not even have direct highway links.  If Dobretici had been in Travnik or Jajce Opstinas, the Croats  would have an absolute majority, as they did before. There are  several such examples: Derventa, for instance. If new/old  opstina boundaries that are fair should be established, we would  have a territorial situation much more favorable to us.</p>

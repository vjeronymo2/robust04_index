			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Andi Bejtja article: "Right-Wing Albanian Nationalists </F> Under the Royal Wing"]    [Text] The departure last October from the Democratic  Party [PD] of Deputies Baleta and Kalakula simultaneously marked  the start of efforts to start a home-grown right wing, which the  blue color adopted by the PD three years ago would suit more  than any other group. It seems that these two deputies are at  the same time working to form a typically right-wing party and a  coalition of right-wing forces, which may be the largest  coalition in the next elections. The party for which Baleta and  Kalakula are working has its natural roots in the National Front  [Balli Kombetar], in Legality, and in the Property With Justice  Association. Because the total restitution of property lies at  the foundation of its program, it would be natural for this  still unregistered party to form a coalition with the Republican  Party, whose chairman did not hestitate to take part in a  meeting in Shkoder with the "PD's right-wing outcasts," although  he has still not publicly repudiated the old distinctly fading  Republican-Social Democrat-PD coalition. An increasing  rapprochement is also noticeable with the Cameria Association  and the Association of Former Victims of Political Persecution,  with whose representatives the two deputies meet, it seems, not  merely to drink coffee. This is shown by the recent visit to  Johannesburg by the right-wing deputies and Kurt Kola, chairman  of the Association of the Former Victims of Persecution.    But what is the right launching on the Albanian political  market? Parliamentary deputy and former Agriculture Minister  Kalakula said in an interview published in ALEANCA: "We are for  the immediate and unconditional restoration of all property to  its legitimate owners.    "We are for the privatization of enterprises, especially in  agriculture, forestry, construction, the textile industry, the  food-processing industry, tourism, etc.    "We wish to establish new criteria for privatization,  substantially favoring former owners, victims of political  persecution, and employees, who will be given priority in the  granting of small and medium enterprises on delayed repayment  terms.    "It is not only the proprietors that have been left  disappointed," Kalakula continued in his interview. So have the  hundreds of thousands of former victims of persecution, who in  fact also include the proprietors, who have also received  nothing of what belonged to them. These too were promised  "vouchers." There are also hundreds and thousands of unemployed  workers and intellectuals on welfare. The people's strongest  anticommunist hopes lie here." [no opening quotation mark as  published] It is precisely among these strata that the Albanian  right hopes to gain support. "I want to stress that these  people are watching me, not as an individual, but because of the  position that I uphold, which it seems to me reflects their  aspirations."    Moreover, the right has come out clearly in favor of a  nationalist policy, which is the ideological rallying point of  the parties with whom they wish to form a coalition.  Nevertheless, it must be said that this still undeclared  right-wing front needs to create a single center that will have  the strength and credibility to attract the fringe, which is  often still within the PD's orbit. It seems that the two  deputies are not strong enough to do this, and one of them  cannot enjoy the total confidence of this home-grown right for  the simple reason that he was once Hoxha's representative in the  glass palace of the United Nations. In this resepct, the  weightiest and most suitable figure, even though he does not  speak good Albanian, remains Leka Zogu, whose political baggage  contains nothing but the successes and failures of his father  Ahmet [King Zog]. The fact that the heir to the royal throne  himself is making overtures to the right is shown by the  invitation to visit South Africa that Leka extended to its  representatives. This also explains the current Albanian  authorities' fear of allowing him to enter Albania. Thus, the  heir to the throne, if he is allowed into Albania, may also be  carrying the little banner of the Albanian right as well as the  great flag of the monarch of the ethnic territories. This may  be the aim of the home-grown Albanian right: to grow strong  under the royal wing.</p>

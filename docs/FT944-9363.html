			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / EU fraud 'will force Tory revolt' A report exposing massive waste and fraud in the European Union will prompt a substantial Conservative revolt against legislation increasing Britain's contributions to the EU, Tory Euro-sceptics said yesterday. Ministers sought to play down the report, by the EU's Court of Auditors, which said it was impossible to estimate how much money went astray from the Ecu64.2bn (Pounds 50.52bn) of EU funds paid out last year. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, praised the court for exposing the fraud. 'It is much better that it should be revealed than that it should lie hidden,' he said on BBC Radio. But Mr Bill Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic backbencher, said the report raised 'a very important question as to the extent to which the British taxpayer should continue to pour money into this bottomless, fraudulent pit'. Underlining the potential threat to the government, Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, warned Tory MPs not to underestimate the impact of a rebel victory. He said: 'It is a matter of confidence. If there is any amendment or defeat, the consequences to the government are quite obvious. We shall end up with a general election.' Rightwingers dismissed cabinet attempts to shore up support for the contributions bill, which the Treasury says will increase the UK's net payment to the EU by Pounds 75m next year, and around Pounds 250m a year by the end of the decade. Many also claimed that only a big surprise in the legislative package to be unveiled in today's Queen's Speech could save the government from a severe mauling when the bill is tabled later this year. Ministers are resigned to a battle with the Euro-sceptics, but plan to limit parliamentary manoeuvring by ensuring that the bill is sufficiently tightly drafted to head off backbench amendments. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will try to embarrass the government by calling for amendments to the Common Agricultural Policy, but will not seek to defeat the central thrust of the bill, which both parties support. Rightwingers said the timing of the EU report might help to stiffen support for a backbench challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Tory party, which constitutionally has to be mounted within the next two weeks or delayed until next winter. Few mainstream MPs believe that any candidate can defeat Mr Major, although some say that a 'stalking horse' candidate such as Mr Norman Lamont, the disaffected former chancellor, could clear the way for a further contest next year.</p>

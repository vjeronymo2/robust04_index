			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Lloyd's offer faces a fresh blow Names on two more loss-making Lloyd's syndicates look set to reject the insurance market's Pounds 900m settlement offer, designed to end litigation by some 17,000 individual members, who have traditionally supported the market's capital base, Richard Lapper writes. Both syndicates - Pulbrook 90 and 334 - face losses from so-called long-tail liability claims, many of which are emerging many years after the original inception of policies. One hundred and forty eight of the 168 Names on syndicate 334 and 161 of 201 Names on syndicate 90 who responded to surveys by Names, said they would reject the offer. Names on 334 have been offered about Pounds 2.5m to compensate for actual losses of more than Pounds 35m in 1985, while Names on 90 have been offered about Pounds 1.5m in compensation for losses sustained during the 1982 year. A legal case by syndicate 334 Names is expected to come to court next month.</p>

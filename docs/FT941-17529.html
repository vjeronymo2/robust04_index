			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Labour attacks tax rises as threat to recovery Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday that Britain's economic recovery is likely to be hampered by tax increases due to take effect later this year. Mr Smith welcomed signs of 'modest' economic growth but he said forecasts that the growth would accelerate failed to take account of the impact of tax rises. Mr Smith's comments signal the beginning of a new year opposition offensive against the government's taxation policy, which Labour claims is 'unfair' to the less well-off. Labour leaders believe that the government is vulnerable to claims that both Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, broke election promises not to increase taxes. Mr Smith said: 'The Tories told us they would not increase taxes. They have flagrantly broken this promise in the two Budgets of 1993 and the price is going to have to be paid in 1994. 'They are huge increases, the biggest increases in British peacetime history  -and this from a party that won the election in 1992 on the claims that it would be a low-tax party.' Mr Smith said that average families would face tax increases of Pounds 10 a week from April and Pounds 16 a week from next year - equivalent to 7p on income tax. Public-sector workers would also face a pay freeze, amounting to an effective cut in living standards and further draining demand from the economy. 'I doubt very much if the impact of these tax increases has fully been taken account of in some of the economic predictions which, of course, are pretty varied,' he said. Mr Smith urged the government to put the unemployed back to work by tackling 'the real problems' facing the economy - lack of investment, regional development, skills and housing. He urged the government to stimulate demand by allowing local authorities to spend accumulated capital receipts. 'That would get people back to work and would contribute to a virtuous recovery in the economy,' he said.</p>

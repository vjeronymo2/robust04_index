			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Bundesbank trumpets its approach to Emu: Self-confidence in Frankfurt BRIMMING with confidence in the rightness of its ways, Germany's Bundesbank has suggested that all other European central banks should adopt its approach to monetary policy in the interests of a smooth transition to monetary union. Unmoved by charges that Bundesbank policy has undermined partner countries' efforts to escape from recession and helped promote the crisis in the European monetary system, the bank said following its example would help keep expansion of the European Community's money supply in line with productivity growth, and reduce the impact of cyclical swings. The bank said in its annual report yesterday that despite possible risks, the lack of convincing alternatives supported the case for a pan-European strategy steered by medium-term money supply targets. Adoption of the Bundesbank model by the proposed European system of central banks (ESCB) would be an especially appropriate way of achieving the Maastricht treaties' aim of price stability, the report claimed. At the same time the adoption of the 'Bundesbank's proven concept' would help quickly to establish the credibility of the ESCB. Given the size of the monetary territory involved, the report said, such policies appeared to make even more sense for the proposed system than for a single central bank. Running through the alternatives, the bank claimed that the scale of the proposed European union meant a monetary system which tried to set exchange rate targets was out of the question. Policies based on interest rates had been proven ineffective in the past. The suggestions, under the heading 'Thoughts on a European monetary policy concept', followed persistent nagging from the bank's senior policy-makers during the past year that the planned central banking system under Emu could function effectively only if it was seen from the outset to be as trustworthy and credible as the Bundesbank itself. The report recommended its concept as a means of determining the interplay between the proposed European central bank and the 'subordinate' national institutions. It also repeated the Bundesbank's defence of its monetary policies with a claim that softening its stance could have 'raised the pace of inflation throughout Europe'. As it turned out, its policy was at last beginning to bear fruit in Germany, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, claimed in the preface. While the German measure of money supply, M3, grew wildly out of control for much of last year, it now appears to have been tamed. Latest monthly figures show expansion running below the bank's official target range. In the six months to the end of March, a period including bouts of double-digit growth in late 1992, M3 has expanded at an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent, compared with 7.5 per cent in the comparable year-earlier period, the report said. But as it made plain in a section on Germany's public finances, there is more to the management of inflation and monetary policy than steering money supply between goalposts erected by the Bundesbank's technicians. In a critique of public financing plans and the bank's first full analysis of the recent solidarity pact - representing Bonn's efforts to cut ballooning public deficits while fostering economic recovery in the east - the bank finds much to worry about. While federal spending increases this year will be kept to 3 per cent, compared with the aim of 2.5 per cent, outgoings from regional governments will rise by up to 5 per cent compared with an original target of 3 per cent, while local authority spending will go up 4.5 per cent in the west and almost 10 per cent in the east. Despite its persistent demands that spending cuts must come before tax increases, the bank calculates that Bonn's new budget consolidation plans will in the medium term increase the annual burden of taxes, duties, tolls and assorted levies by the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross national product. As yesterday's report said, future progress in budget consolidation will depend largely on overall economic developments. And as it added: 'With the proposed increases in contributions growth prospects for the German economy have certainly not been improved.'</p>

In its statement given to CTK today, the ministry reiterated  its opinion that any external military intervention alone could  not produce settlement of the situation unless all the three  feuding parties display will and ability to reach agreement.    The ministry said it believed that the warring parties would  withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo's surroundings within the  10-day deadline given them by the NATO Council, and that they  would show real political will not only to introduce an  effective cease- fire, but to find an acceptable way out of the  crisis as well.    The ministry said it believed that the previous resolutions  adopted by the UN Security Council provided a sufficient legal  basis for aerial attacks under conditions set by the United  Nations earlier.</p>

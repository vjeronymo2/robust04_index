			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Intl Paper tumbles 33% in final quarter INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday announced a 33 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, once special charges are stripped out of the figures. It blamed this mainly on the sluggishness of the US economy and said it expected difficult business conditions to continue in early 1992. Its fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share, including a Dollars 4m after-tax special charge for an accounting change and a Dollars 37m one for severance costs. In the fourth quarter of 1990 earnings totalled Dollars 23m, or 20 cents a share, after a Dollars 137m charge for a business improvement plan. Without the special charges, 1991 fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars 107m, compared with Dollars 160m the previous year. Mr John Georges, chairman, added that fourth-quarter sales and earnings 'about equalled second and third-quarter levels as the domestic economy remained stagnant'. Full-year earnings totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after Dollars 231m of special charges, compared with Dollars 569m, or Dollars 5.21 a share in 1990 after Dollars 137m of special charges. 1991 sales dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 12.7bn. Mr Georges said the company's packaging and distribution business reported stable quarter-to-quarter earnings, while the timber and wood products businesses had higher earnings. Domestic linerboard benefitted from increased demand and prices, but sales of uncoated printing and writing papers, coated papers and imaging products had stalled.</p>

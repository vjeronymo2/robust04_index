On 30 and 31 January, accompanied by Cheng Weigao, secretary  of the provincial party committee, Ye Liansong, governor of the  province, Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State  Council, and Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education  Commission, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited, in spite of the  severe cold, Shijiazhuang city, Baoding city, and Baoding  Prefecture to investigate and study the educational work in the  countryside and went deep to five primary and middle schools in  mountainous areas of Pingshan and Shunping counties to express  solicitude for teachers. Whenever he arrived in a school,  Comrade Li Lanqing conscientiously inspected schoolrooms and  teachers' dormitories, cordially inquired about teachers'  situation in work, livelihood, wage payment, and teaching, and  sent, on behalf of the State Council, cordial regards to the  vast numbers of rural teachers, teachers in mountainous areas in  particular, who have long worked silently with all their hearts  under difficult conditions.    In recent years, leaders at all levels in the province have  paid high attention to education, have energetically promoted  reform and development in education, have constantly attached  importance to rudimentary education, have adopted resolute  measures to continuously improve teachers' remunerations, have  solved in a timely manner the problem that once emerged  concerning teachers' unpaid wages and have been studying ways to  formulate a guarantee mechanism to ensure the fulfillment of the  rudimentary education target and for eliminating the deferred  wage payment to teachers.    After hearing this, Comrade Li Lanqing was very happy and  fully affirmed it. During the inspection, Comrade Li Lanqing  repeatedly stressed that rudimentary education is the foundation  of all sorts of education which concerns the quality of  education in the entire nation. Because 800 million of China's  population lives in the countryside, the difficult and focal  points of rudimentary education lie in the countryside. If  peasants have no knowledge and no agricultural skills, it is  impossible to develop the rural economy or to fulfill the  nationwide objective of having the people become relatively  well-off. Therefore, governments at all levels and all  educational and administrative departments must exert great  efforts in conscientiously developing rudimentary education in  the countryside. The education in the countryside must be  carried out in line with local conditions by giving full  consideration to the actual demands and circumstances of the  countryside. We should conscientiously study ways to reform the  school administration in the countryside. Comrade Li Lanqing  fully affirmed Shunping County's methods of adding the content  of professional education to train a large number of new  peasants, who have both knowledge and agricultural skills, at  the present stage of developing rudimentary education in the  countryside. He said: In the countryside, it is a good way to  give overall consideration to agriculture, science, and  education. It will not only be conducive to training more  useful skilled persons for the countryside and accelerating the  development of rural economy but will also effectively make the  nine-year compulsory education universal in the countryside.    On the morning of 31 January, Comrade Li Lanqing also talked  with leaders of the province, responsible persons of pertinent  departments, and teacher representatives on the reform and  development of higher education, vocational education, and adult  education and listened to their opinions and suggestions.</p>

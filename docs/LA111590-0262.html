			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PETROVIC THREATENS TO QUIT IF BLAZERS DON'T TRADE HIM  </P> <P> Yugoslav Drazen Petrovic says he's tired of his reserve guard role with the  Trail Blazers and wants to be traded.  </P> <P> "I'm the 12th man on the roster and I don't deserve that," Petrovic said.  </P> <P> "I'm not being treated fairly."  </P> <P> Petrovic, 26, a sports hero in his native Yugoslavia, said he would give the  Blazers until Nov. 30 to work some kind of trade.  </P> <P> "If nothing is done, I'm going back to Yugoslavia," he said.  </P> <P> If Petrovic leaves the Trail Blazers and returns to Yugoslavia, he would be  ineligible to play professionally in Spain or Italy because all NBA contracts  are recognized by FIBA, the sport's international governing body.  </P> <P> He could play for the Yugoslavian national team.  </P> <P> Petrovic is in the second year of a three-year contract that calls for the  Trail Blazers to pay him $1.3 million for the 1990-91 season.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Visa Imposes Membership Moratorium: Visa U.S.A. said the six-month moratorium  on allowing new applicants from non-banking companies to issue its credit cards  was a "prudent measure" while it reviews Visa membership eligibility in  general. Institutions not eligible to join Visa directly would not be allowed  to join indirectly by merging or acquiring a member company without the  approval of Visa's board, the company said.  </P></p>

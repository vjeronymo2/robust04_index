			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Markets: Wages, skills and inequality in a modern economy - Economic Eye The Institute for Fiscal Studies is justly proud of its dual reputation for providing sound economic analysis without even a hint of political bias. It is much harder for the government to evade the charge that recent and proposed tax changes are taking money from people with below-average incomes and transferring it to above-average income households when it is the IFS which makes the claim, as it did last week. By choosing to look at the period 1985-95, the authors of the IFS report, Christopher Giles and Paul Johnson, ensured their numbers could not be used to make headline-grabbing claims about overall tax changes since the last Labour government. The results were striking, nonetheless. The combination of tax cuts in the late 1980s and the current package of tax increases mean the poorest 10 per cent of households end up Pounds 156 a year worse off. The top 10 per cent are Pounds 1627.60 a year better off. Yet analysing the effects of tax changes on the distribution of income tells only part, and a part which is reducing in significance, of the story of the rapid growth in inequality over the past decade. For, as the left-hand chart shows, changes in taxes and benefits have compounded a massive rise in gross income inequality since the late 1970s. Inequality is measured here by an index called the Gini coefficient. The higher the figure, the more the distribution of income is skewed to a smaller number of high income earners. Zero indicates a completely equal distribution, one means that one person has the lot. The main causes of this rise in pre-tax inequality are two-fold: long-term unemployment and the growing dispersion in wages between high and low income earners. Unemployment was much higher and more persistent in the 1980s than in any previous decade since the 1930s, while the large majority of women who entered employment did so from households with at least one other income earner. Meanwhile wage inequality has risen sharply, particularly for men. The wages of the top 10 per cent of male earners have risen from 1.67 times the median wage in 1979 to twice the median in 1993. Over the same period the wages of the poorest paid 10 per cent have fallen from 68.5 per cent to 58.2 per cent of the median. UK wages are now more unequal than at any time since the 1880s when comparable records began. Wage inequality has grown in almost every developed country over the last twenty years. But wage inequality has grown faster in Britain than in almost any other developed country, catching up with France and overtaking Japan, as the chart confirms. Allocating the growth in overall household income inequality among unemployment, earnings and taxes and benefits is a tricky business. One analysis conducted by Paul Johnson and Steven Webb of the IFS found that, over the period 1979 to 1988, changes in taxes explained half the rise in inequality. However another study by Stephen Jenkins of University College, Swansea found a much greater role for wages and employment and a consequently smaller role for tax changes. However in whatever way the causes are allocated, the evidence suggests that inequality among wage-earners is increasingly becoming the most important cause of income inequality and poverty. This is certainly the case in the US, where much of the best research on wage inequality has been performed. And it is confirmed for the UK in an important paper by Paul Gregg and Steve Machin, to be published next month by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in a new book on the UK labour market. They find that the conventional link between poverty and its standard causes  -average real wage growth, unemployment and inflation - broke down in the 1980s, as it also did in the US. The combination of low inflation, falling unemployment and rising real wages would normally have delivered a substantial fall in the percentage of the population in poverty, defined as being below half the median of the 1979 level of real expenditure. However the rapid growth of wage inequality which occurred throughout this period has delivered the opposite result. The percentage of the population with poverty-level expenditure continued to grow to more than a fifth of the population by the end of the decade. The causes of this persistent unemployment and rising wage inequality have the same root cause, both in the UK and in the US, the rise in the economic return to skilled labour and the declining demand for the capabilities of unskilled workers. The wages which skilled workers can demand has risen over the past fifteen years, despite an increase in the supply of highly educated workers. The proportion of workers with degrees rose from 8 per cent to 11 per cent across the 1980s. However, while the percentage of workers with no qualifications fell from 46 per cent to 32 per cent, the male unemployment rate among this group rose from 6.5 per cent in the 1970s to 16.4 per cent by the end of the 1980s. Moreover, Gregg and Machin confirm that the same technological changes which have produced this shift in demand from unskilled to skilled workers in the US have also been at work in the UK. While lower-paid service sector jobs have been replacing manufacturing jobs, both wage differentials and employment shares within manufacturing and within particular industries have shifted in favour of non-manual, better educated workers. In short, the growing gap in incomes and job-chances between people with the skills demanded by today's employers and workers with no qualifications is the main cause of poverty and inequality in Britain and across the developed, world. Addressing this reality is the political challenge if the 1990s. Fiddling with the tax system cannot, alone, do the trick.</p>

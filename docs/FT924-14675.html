			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (7): Enormously successful mixture - Profile of Legoland WE decided to obtain some proper consumer response before writing about the Legoland family park, the miniature township built from millions of Lego toy building bricks. So we took along Michela, aged 5 1/2 , from France. It was a magical experience for her. She was intrigued and delighted by the model villages, with ferries and cars plying a busy trade, and so convinced by the life-size models in Pirateland (everywhere else the models are in a scale of 1:20) that she was more than half-convinced that they were real pirates, waving encouragingly to the automated marooned pirate who calls for help from passing visitors in a doleful electronic voice. Michela loved every minute of the four-hour visit and even that was not long enough to sample all that Legoland has to offer. But by that time the adults were happy with the day's success, if ready to drop. We had to give the museum of dolls and dolls' houses and old mechanical toys a miss. There was obvious satisfaction among the many other children in the park, which delights children up to the age of about 13 - and also a lot of parents. There is something very Danish about Legoland, an enormously successful mixture of amusement park - not at all brassy and not too large (the site is about 10 hectares) - and town-in-miniature, as neat and as bright as Denmark's well-kept farms and immaculate fields. In fact, it is not just one township: the park is dotted with models of many towns and villages, including Dutch, Danish and Norwegian, as well as models of famous buildings, such as Brussels' ornate 15th century Town Hall, correct in every detail and all in Lego bricks. The word Lego comes from two Danish words 'lej godt', meaning 'play well'; and in the Legoland park there are plenty of opportunities to play, both with the Lego bricks and construction kits and on the fair-ground amusements. It is a most unlikely place for a leading tourist attraction - in the middle of the Jutland heathland, at Billund, far from any large population centres. This, however, is where the Lego Group has the headquarters of what has become one of the world's biggest and most successful ventures in the manufacture of toys. The group, a private company controlled by the Kirk Christiansen family, which founded the company in the 1930s, has about 7,500 employees, of which 4,100 are in Denmark. Published turnover in 1991 was DKr4.47bn, on which was made a net profit of DKr341m. However, the published turnover applies only to companies employing 5,000 people, so total turnover is significantly larger. Its manufacturing base is in Billund, but it also has manufacturing operations in Connecticut (US), Switzerland, Germany, Brazil and South Korea. Altogether the group has 36 companies in 21 countries. It outgrew Denmark long ago. Ninety-eight per cent of its sales are outside Denmark and its biggest markets now are Germany, the US, Britain, France and Italy. Lego has a lot of imitators and devotes considerable resources to trying to prevent them from infringing Lego patents. But the Lego product has got what it takes: the group noted in its 1991 annual report that, although there have never been more imitators, their share of the market had fallen for the fourth successive year. In spite of its remote location, Legoland attracts about 1.1m visitors during a season, which lasts for five months from May 1 to the third Sunday in September. It is Denmark's biggest tourist attraction outside Copenhagen. In 1991, 467,000 visitors came from Denmark, equivalent to one in 11 of the population. From elsewhere in Europe, the number of visitors was: from Germany (300,000), Sweden (140,000), Norway (66,000), the Netherlands (51,000) and Britain (45,000). Legoland has been a success in Denmark ever since it opened in 1968, but can it be repeated elsewhere? Lego hopes so, and it has many enthusiastic acolytes abroad. When the company announced in 1991 that it was planning to set up Legoland family parks in other countries, it received almost 1,000 inquiries, many from mayors and governors anxious to acquire an important tourist attraction for their own town. It has now chosen six geographical locations for closer consideration, three in the US and three in Europe. The European locations are in the densely-populated border area between Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and in the London area. In the US, California, the area around Washington DC and New England have been singled out. Each park will require an investment of about Dollars 100m, and aims to attract about 1.4m visitors a year initially. Lego hopes to decide where the first will be later this year or in 1993.</p>

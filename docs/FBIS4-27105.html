			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unpardonable Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- It is a most heinous  crime which can never be justified that the South Korean puppets  scrapped the joint declaration on denuclearisation, hurling  groundless slanders at the North, declares NODONG SINMUN today.    The analyst says:    The South Korean puppet unification minister, Yi Hong-ku, at  the "National Assembly Committee of Foreign Affairs and  Unification" recently, heaped abuses on the North and said "the  North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has already  been nullified in actuality," stating that the South "will  discuss it from a new angle."    This meant that they unilaterally scrapped the "joint  declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"  adopted by the North and the South and declared its abrogation.  This is a treacherous crime never to be condoned and an open  perfidy and malicious challenge to the North which has made all  sincere efforts for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.    The Kim Yong-sam group, after grabbing power, has hastened  the development of nuclear weapons and engaged themselves in  well- planned maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration on  denuclearisation, a hurdle in its way. Practically, the Kim  Yong- sam traitor group is making haste with the development of  nuclear weapons in full scale under the "nuclear umbrella" of  outside forces, trampling upon the joint declaration.    Not much penetration is needed to see why they openly  declared the nullification and renunciation of the joint  declaration on denuclearisation at a time when the uprightness  of the North's nuclear policy is being proved more clearly.  They seek to accelerate the development of nuclear weapons,  unhindered, by destroying the joint declaration which stands in  the way of their introduction of nuclear weapons and development  of their own nuclear arms.    The Kim Yong-sam group will have to bear full responsibility  for all the consequences arising from its perfidy in reducing  "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula" to a dead letter.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lower Saxony Minister-President Gerhard </F> Schroeder: "To Use Right-Wingers' Methods Against the  Right-Wingers?"]    [Text] Now what should never again have happened has  finally happened: A synagogue in Germany has been torched. The  politicians are reacting with shock and alarm, and are  demonstrating determination -- but they actually bypass the  problem. They are competing for the most radical proposals on  bans, tougher laws, and harsher penalties. And, in every other  regard, they continue as in the past, until next time.    This next time will come, no matter how intensively we try  to  prevent it. Admitting this has nothing to do with resignation  or cynicism. It is virtually a precondition for any rational  and successful action against right-wing extremism.    Luebeck was already "the next time." That right-wing terror  would be turned against the Jews at some stage could be  predicted, at the latest since the wave of xenophobia in 1992.    Now toughness is supposed to help against the so-called  Republikaner: banning the party of the Republikaner, depriving  Schoenhuber of his basic rights, banning Republikaner from  exercising their profession -- the inventiveness is unlimited  when the presentation of alleged panaceas is involved. And  Schoenhuber is on the front pages of the newspapers day after  day. What else could he wish for?    However, this is not the only thing that must arouse  skepticism. Even in the Social Democratic Party of Germany it is  exclusively repressive measures against right-wing extremism  that are currently being discussed. Using the methods of the  right against the right -- can it work?    In fact, all these proposals aim only at the symptoms. They  divert attention from the reasons for the right-wing violence  and for the election successes of the Republikaner, even though  we know these reasons only too well. It is the increasing social  injustice; it is prospects for life that have been destroyed by  unemployment; it is the experience of helplessness toward a  policy in which "solidarity" has become a foreign word.    None of that can be found in the debate in Bonn. Certainly,  it is not easy to admit that the failure of one's own policy has  also contributed to providing fertile soil for Schoenhuber and  others. However, we cannot avoid that. Above all, we cannot  avoid a revision of this policy.    Because as long as work, income, and housing in Germany are  not distributed justly, there will be people who turn their  frustration into hatred against all those who are different or  who think differently -- no matter whether or not the  Republikaner are banned.    It is this not-wanting-to-realize, this  always-being-surprised-again, which prevents rational dealing  with right-wing extremists (and gives them ever new publicity).  They is no "right-wing specter" that comes and goes when it  feels like it. We will have to deal with them for a long time.    Repressive means are suitable only when violence and  instigation are involved. Of course, we have to prosecute  violence relentlessly -- but still, in particular where young  people are involved, we must not forget that harsh punishment  causes rigid attitudes: In this field, too, the renunciation of  prison reduces the quota of recidivists.    Of course, we must consistently punish instigating people. A  draft law in Lower Saxony to make the penal code more precise in  this respect has been in the Bundesrat for a year now. It may  be that we will have to add a supplement because of the terrible  decision on the holocaust by the Federal Constitutional Court  [which ruled that denying the holocaust occurred is not a  punishable offense]. We do not need any new laws that go beyond  that. They just make the Republikaner important.    Of course, the constitutional protection service must watch  the Republikaner, without any restrictions. And if the courts  in Lower Saxony continue to prohibit us from watching them, we  will have to amend our constitutional protection law.    Of course, we will dismiss any teacher who causes right-wing  agitation in our schools. But for that the disciplinary law is  sufficient. The arguments with which we abolished the decree on  radicals four years ago are today as correct as they were at  that time.    What is wrong with us that we want to give -- without any  need to do so -- the Republikaner the publicity of protracted  procedures for banning someone from his profession? What else  would be the result of an application to ban the Republikaner  other than providing them with a wonderful forum to spread their  cynical way of thinking via all the media?    I do not even want to speak of the practical difficulties  and  risks of such measures. However, even if we assume that an  application to ban the party were to be granted by the Federal  Constitutional Court, How are we supposed to explain to  potential voters of the Republikaner that it is democratic to  eliminate their party juridically since we cannot cope with it  politically -- just in time for the biggest election marathon in  German history?    No. Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Central Council of Jews in  Germany] is quite right when he does not file a complaint  against Schoenhuber. It is bad enough that Schoenhuber's  well-calculated infamy has been spread by the media all over the  place. He is just waiting for an opportunity in court to spread  his anti-Semitic trash and "prove" it in front of benches  crammed full of journalists.    The right-wing agitators deserve a different way of being  dealt with -- namely not dealing with them at all. I am not  willing to engage in discussions on television with  representatives of the Republikaner, because, no matter how such  an event ends, it makes the Republikaner important. There they  can present themselves in bourgeois decency, with equal rights  and with an equal time to speak, and if I really want to deal  with their ideology, then they are the ones that dictate the  subject of discussion.    I really do not know what is worse: The sympathy that a  Republikaner functionary who is driven into a corner might  arouse or Schoenhuber's comradely assurance that "we agree on  all the important issues." The Republikaner know very well why  they are trying to force participation in election debates on  television by going to court. Certainly not because they fear  any loss of popularity there.    In my view, this too is part of the social ostracism of  right-wing extremism. Not only Max Streibl's "private" meeting  with Schoenhuber makes the Republikaner socially acceptable.  The ARD [First German Television Channel] and ZDF [Second  German Television Channel] are also contributing to this with  their unfortunate decision about future invitations to election  broadcasts. Anyone who brings the Republikaner into his program  because he is also speculating on an increase in entertaining  suspense is on the way to wishing for a situation like Weimar,  just because it might be the background for exciting television  entertainment.    We have to deal with right-wing extremist thinking in a  completely different place and in a completely different way.  If it is correct that the majority of those who vote for the  Republikaner just want to express a protest and do not really  want the Republikaner to participate in government, then it  hardly helps to take Schoenhuber's party apart with arguments.  And it is equally unhelpful if we try to "catch" these people  by increasingly adjusting our policy to the topics and contents  of the Republikaner.    It may be that such a swing to the right is rather to the  liking of some conservatives -- I think Wolfgang Schaeuble knows  very well where he is marching with his "new nationalism."    What a difference from the end of the 1960's! At that time,  when the NPD [National Democratic Party of Germany] was in the  laender parliaments all over the country, Willi Brandt issued  the slogan "Daring More Democracy" -- and put an end to the  parliamentary existence of the NPD.    And today? When was the last time that the Bundestag adopted  a law that granted more rights, more freedom, and more democracy  to the people? We had to amend the asylum law -- but no one is  talking about a new citizenship law anymore.    If it is true that the majority of those who vote for the  Republikaner vote for Schoenhuber because they have lost trust  in the functioning of our party system, our rule-of-law state,  and our social market economy, then there is only one way: We  must reestablish this functioning -- and not hurrying behind  right-wing slogans until there is really nothing left of this  democracy.</p>

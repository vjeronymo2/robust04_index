			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 22, IRNA -- Thousands of Tehranis  marched to the United Nations office here today after the Friday  prayer to protest against the world body's inaction to end the  worsening plight of besieged Bosnian Muslims in Gorazde.    At the end of the rally the marchers released a resolution  condemning the silence of the West and international forums, the  U.N. in particular.    They announced support for the defenceless Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and said they would use all possible means to  end the Serbian crimes against humanity.    The resolution called on Islamic states to close ranks  against the genocide of Europe's native Muslim population.    It lauded Iran's logical stance on the B-H issue and urged  the Foreign Ministry to provide necessary grounds for sending of  Iranian forces to Bosnia.    Placards carried by the demonstrators read: "Genocide in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, U.S. Gift to the New Generations".    A large group of women were also seen in the rally.    Earlier on Thursday, university students had demonstrated in  front of the U.N. mission to protest the indifference to the  massacre of Bosnian Muslims.</p>

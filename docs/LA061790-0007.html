			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> **** BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON "THE INVENTOR" BLUE NOTE: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM  FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).  </P> <P> A veteran of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and the respected 29th St. Saxophone  Quartet, alto saxophonist Bobby Watson shows all the right influences -- Johnny  Hodges, Sonny Stitt and, of course, Charlie Parker -- but doesn't rely on  imitation to get his point across. Tunes such as his sophisticated ballad  "Dreams So Real," the smoothly-paced "Homemade Blues" and "Heckle and Jeckle,"  on which Watson trades bird calls with trumpeter Melton Mustafa, put a  contemporary shine on the hard bop tradition and provide a framework for some  strong emotional expression. Drummer Victor Lewis also contributes two numbers,  including "The Shaw of Newark," a spirited tribute to the late trumpeter Woody  Shaw. BILL KOHLHAASE  </P></p>

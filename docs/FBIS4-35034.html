			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Mario Jose Errazuriz] </F>   [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- President  Eduardo Frei urged the meeting here of Ibero-American leaders to  make urgent efforts to train and enhance human resources in  their respective countries. Frei said it is important to  implement educational systems that meet the needs of democracy.    He said Chile is promoting an educational reform program and  urged Ibero-American countries to jointly progress in this area.    He urged them to make a serious and collective effort to  promote scientific and technological development through the  establishment of a scientific and technological development fund.    The Chilean president also proposed the promotion and  advancement of free trade without restrictive mechanisms.    Frei told the 22 chiefs of state attending the meeting that  within the framework of international trade and the opening of  world markets, extra effort must be made to avoid protectionist  measures or those that undermine competition among countries.    Frei formally invited those present to the Sixth  Ibero-American Summit, scheduled for 1996, in Chile.    The Cartagena summit studied regional policies on trade,  social development and integration.    Colombian President Cesar Gaviria officially opened the  meeting yesterday. He said the Americas are creating a new  international order based on interdependence.    The participants expressed support for the Chilean doctrine  of "open regionalism," as reasserted by President Frei in his  speech. After discussing it, the participants included this  doctrine in the final document of the summit which ends today.    The opening ceremony was marked by the Colombian tragedy one  week ago when an earthquake and a landslide killed, according to  official figures, over 1,000 people; and Fidel Castro's  aggressive speech against the United States. President Frei  addressed the summit at 1810 Chilean time. He was the 15th chief  of state to address the summit and he did so several hours  behind schedule.    At about 0800 (0900 Chilean time), President Frei and his  wife, Marta Larraechia, entered the Convention Center hall of  flags, where the summit was held. He was greeted by President  Gaviria.    After the opening ceremony, in which the Brazilian and  Colombian presidents delivered speeches, the first session got  under way. Frei was seated next to Fidel Castro.    Eduardo Frei said that although Chile has many options of  joining integration organizations at the international level, it  clearly upholds a Latin American integrationist tradition.    He said that in the next few years, Chile will implement a  regional policy of economic and physical integration and  cooperation at the educational, cultural, scientific, and  technological levels.    He reasserted the criteria of adopting "open regionalism" on  the basis of realistic, specific trade without exclusions."    He said: "In the economy, as in politics, exclusions are  both  unfair and dangerous."    Frei urged the Americas to improve their competitive level  in  the international market as a means to achieve an open economy.    Regarding competitiveness at the international level and its  improvement, Frei said governments should "abstain from using  mechanisms--be they financial, tax, economic, or of any other  nature--to undermine competitiveness."    He said such measures distort comparative advantages and  undermine the sale of more competitive Ibero-American products.    Frei criticized the use of policy mechanisms, like health,  fiscal or environmental measures, to implement protectionist  measures.    The Chilean president stressed the need to achieve national  economic development on the basis of equity. He said: "The  social dimension of development cannot and should not be  overlooked."    He said political and economic achievements only make sense  if they are accompanied by a substantial improvement of the  standard of living for their people.    Frei stated: "Social development is the basis for  democracy."    He said the main objective of his administration is to  eradicate extreme poverty, adding that a culture of solidarity  is being promoted to this effect.    He said this issue will be discussed at the Social  Development Summit to be held next year in Copenhagen. He urged  the chiefs of state to redouble their efforts so that Latin  America may be duly represented at this meeting.    Eduardo Frei included in the summit's agenda a previously  unmentioned issue: It involves giving women a bigger role, not  just because they represent more than half the population in the  region but because they are most affected by economic conditions.    Frei proposed institutionalizing a meeting of the ministers  of women's affairs, or of those responsible for women's  policies, to be held prior to the UN Conference on Women in  Beijing in 1995.    He proposed Chile as the site of this first meeting. He also  officially proposed that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit be  held in Chile, as the foreign ministers approved on 13 June.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  is likely to hold his first summit meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton on July 8, or just before the start of the Group of  Seven (G-7) summit of major industrialized nations in Naples,  Italy, government sources said Wednesday [1 June].    The sources said the two leaders' talks in Naples will focus  on the status of progress in the recently resumed bilateral  trade "framework" negotiations, as well as the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Hata is scheduled to leave Japan on July 7, arriving in Rome  later on the same day and then proceeding overland to Naples,  the sources said.    After Hata and Clinton meet July 8, the two leaders will  participate in a G-7 dinner meeting on the same day, they said.    The sources said the idea of holding the bilateral summit in  Naples was proposed by Washington, but the Japanese side would  prefer to have the talks held in another European capital such  as London.</p>

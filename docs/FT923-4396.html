			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Survey of Reinsurance (2): Flexibility attracts doubters - The growing popularity of financial reinsurance AS RECENTLY as two years ago, 'financial reinsurance' was viewed askance by many in the reinsurance industry, but the collapse of the secondary reinsurance market in the wake of the LMX spiral has created a change of mind. At last year's Monte Carlo rendezvous, 'Have you considered financial reinsurance?' had become a routine part of some participants' coffee-table discussions. Further evidence that financial reinsurance is a concept with which time has caught up was provided this summer by the UK Department of Trade and Industry. Guidelines on the recognition by insurers in their statutory returns of liabilities to financial reinsurers under spread loss and prospective aggregate covers demonstrated their use has become more widespread. Regulators have had other reasons for looking closely at financial reinsurance. An attraction for the buyer is flexibility enabling the shape of either the balance sheet or the profit and loss account to be altered if not at will, certainly at a price. One early use of financial reinsurance contracts was for so-called 'surplus relief', effectively an exercise by which primarily US insurers unable to meet statutory solvency requirements could do so, or do so by a greater margin. Such transactions did not contribute positively to the image of the new products, and led to court actions by some liquidators alleging that financial reinsurers had conspired to conceal insolvency or delay its discovery. Bermuda was home to most of the leading innovators in the business, such as Belvedere, Centre Re, Forum Re, Pinnacle Re and Scandinavian Re, because a tax-free domicile is essential for maximising return on capital employed. In this small and specialised world, a momentous event was the insolvency last year of Bermuda-based Forum Re, illustrating that although all reinsurance policies are only as good as the security behind them, particular care is required by buyers of new products where the line between profitability and bankruptcy may depend on very fine financial calculations. The market leader is Centre Re, majority-owned by the AAA-rated Zurich Insurance Group, which last year bought Pinnacle Re from its original owners, London broker CE Heath. Pinnacle specialised in providing 'Time &amp; Distance' policies or T Ds to Lloyd's syndicates. T &amp; Ds are not reinsurance policies, since they merely provide a flow of income on a predetermined basis in return for an initial payment. Buyers take a current credit equal to the full indemnity value of the contract, but since the premium is discounted, an accounting profit is created. Financial reinsurance contracts develop this basic idea, which relies for its operation on the time value of money, and therefore requires a long-tailed account. The reinsurer guarantees a payment to an agreed limit - hence Centre Re's preferred term for its operations as 'finite risk reinsurance' - but also accepts the timing risk involved that claims may crystallise faster than anticipated. Such contracts may be used to cover a book of current business (prospective aggregate covers, PACs, or spread loss covers) and portfolios on which claims are already developing (loss portfolio transfers or LPTs). In either case, the buyer is seeking to reduce the impact of the volatility of the risks insured on its balance sheet. Traditional reinsurance plays a similar role, but financial reinsurance focuses more directly on the financial rather than on the risk variables. The traditional judgment of the underwriter in assessing a risk is replaced by the joint efforts of a team of non-life actuaries who analyse likely claims development and investment managers with international banking or similar experience whose task is to ensure the income flow. As a result, new entrants to the financial reinsurance market reflect the insurance and banking sectors. Two of the most important also reflect increasing European interest. The French reinsurer SCOR now has a dedicated financial reinsurer in Bermuda, while Bankers Trust has one in Jersey, a much more convenient location for European customers. Centre Re's response will be to establish in Dublin's new International Finance Centre. The involvement of banks reflects the fact that they are one of the broader range of channels through which business finds its way to financial reinsurers in addition to the traditional broker. The latter are still important - Bankers Trust partners London broker Sedgwick's energy division in a programme for leading petrochemical companies, and financial reinsurance was specifically mentioned as a source of business growth when the broker announced its interims last month - but clients may also be introduced by lawyers, accountants or management consultants. One advantage is that since it is by definition long-term, multi-year coverage reduces distribution cost over time. In difficult market conditions, another frequent use for such products is for the proceeds of commutations from the increasing number of insolvent traditional insurers. For the strong professional reinsurer which also provides traditional risk-transfer cover, there is a different advantage. Where the cedant's underwriting performance is such that reinsurance will not be offered on terms which it can accept, financial reinsurance in effect allows the reinsurer to take control of part of its investment portfolio. Part of the price paid by the financial reinsurance buyer is the loss of the investment income it would itself have made with the premium. This issue is of particular sensitivity for Lloyd's syndicates, which must ensure equity between past, present and future names. T &amp; Ds distort the traditional relationship between current and future names in reinsurance to close (ROTC). Some syndicates are also taking out more sophisticated covers. Most notable was the purchase of an aggregate excess of loss policy from Centre Re by three syndicates managed by the Merrett agency which have substantial exposure to old US liability business, with the aim of managing the certain tail on its ROTC. There are doubts in the market, however, whether all financial reinsurance products may be properly bought at Lloyd's. Multi-year covers, for example, may suffer restrictions because of the legal one-year life span of syndicates. This can create other difficulties. A feature of all financial reinsurance contracts is a mechanism for sharing any profits should predicted losses not reach the expected level. This may be by profit commission, or extension of cover. Lloyd's syndicates which buy a financial reinsurance will not legally exist to share the benefit, however. Captive insurers owned by industrial and other concerns were among the first to appreciate the benefits of the new products. Traditional and financial reinsurance will provide a stabilisation of results, but a financial cover such as a multi-year stop loss policy will establish a band of protection which may be drawn on as required, with a loss ratio which can be fixed each year, and also to build up a fund. While traditional cover may not be available in any year, or available at a volatile price, financial reinsurance will enable smooth, if not absolutely predictable, income performance. This is likely to benefit the buyer in the equity market and facilitate the raising of capital. These advantages are equally attractive to the parent of a captive, and as a result the line between financial reinsurance and financial insurance - the tailoring of individual funding programmes for corporate entities - is increasingly becoming blurred. Centre Re, for example, may provide one level of protection while the special risks department of Zurich provides another. ACE Ltd, the Bermuda private insurer established by leading chemical companies to cover liability risks, recently took a stake in Centre Re , and there is potential for further such synergies.

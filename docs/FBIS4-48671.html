			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Statement on behalf of the Cabinet" issued by Deputy </F> Presidents T. M. Mbeki and F.W. de Klerk 23 May on the SAPA PR  Wire Service]    [Text] The KwaZulu Ingonvama [King's] Trust Act was  discussed by Cabinet at its meeting today, and a Cabinet  committee comprising Ministers Derek Hanekom, Mr Ngubane, Kader  Asmal and Roelf Meyer was appointed.    The task of the committee will be to:    1. Report on the background and reasons for the  establishment of the trust through legislation;    2. Examine and report on the implications of the act,  inter alia including the security of tenure of the residents in  the prescribed area, the functioning of the Land Claims Court in  the area should any historical land disputes arise and its  possible impact on a future land reform programme; and    3. Make recommendations to Cabinet after such investigation  on the position of the trust, with primary consideration of the  interests of dispossessed African people, and the security of  tenure of rural communities.    Cabinet approached the discussion with a view to reaching a  consensus that will contribute to the process of nation-building  and reconciliation. All parties represented in Cabinet  reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach.    The committee has been charged to prepare a report for the  Cabinet as soon as possible.</p>

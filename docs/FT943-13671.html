			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Europe's Changing Cities: Odessa flexes its old mercantile muscles - The city can do again what it always did best Even 70 years of communism failed to tame Odessa, established by Catherine the Great in the 18th century as the Russian Empire's most bustling warm water port. Soviet rule pushed some of Odessa's sharp traders into the black market and others, from the Jewish community which accounted for a third of the population before the revolution, into emigration. But, with the collapse of communism Odessa, part of independent Ukraine, is again flexing its never entirely atrophied mercantile muscle. Well appointed, if somewhat flamboyant, Greek, Jewish and Italian restaurants and boutiques are beginning to bring back some sparkle to the dilapidated tsarist mansions that line Odessa's main boulevards. The men in shiny suits who dine there while their bodyguards and BMWs wait outside, are engaged in the business which has always been Odessa's natural mainstay - trade. The flagship of Odessa's traders is Blasco, the Black Sea Shipping Company which is the largest merchant fleet in the former Soviet Union. In moving to the market, Blasco enjoys an advantage shared to a lesser degree by Odessa as a whole and by other former Soviet port cities, such as Vladivostok and St Petersburg. 'Regardless of whether we were part of the Soviet Union or in independent Ukraine, we've always been a marine company which has worked 100 per cent on the world market,' says Mr Pavlo Kudiukin, president of Blasco, whose office is decorated with antique furniture and shiny western gadgetry. 'Every single one of our sailors has worked in a market economy every day of his life.' This early exposure to the market means that Blasco is responding to the new realities of economic life in Ukraine with a nimbleness unusual in a massive state-owned company. It is ordering new vessels from shipyards in Ukraine, Slovakia and Germany to revive its rusty fleet, has set up a company in Cyprus to help attract foreign business and, within the next few months, is to be privatised with the help of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm. Mr Kudiukin is reluctant to disclose exact financial figures, but says Blasco's profits over the past five months were in the tens of millions of dollars. However, for Blasco, as for the other large Ukrainian companies, the transition from the centralised Soviet economy has not been entirely smooth. To start with, they were cast financially adrift with the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time Blasco had Dollars 100m on deposit in Vnesheconombank, the USSR's foreign trade bank. 'Now that the bank is outside the borders of Ukraine it is unlikely we will get our money back,' says Mr Kudiukin. Under the old regime, 70 per cent of Blasco's business came from central planners in Moscow. Now a third comes from Ukraine and the rest from Germany, China and Russia in that order. Blasco ships the metals, sugar and grain that are Ukraine's traditional exports. An emerging new breed of Odessa merchants, such as Mr Mikhail Chertkov, head of Karolina-Nord, a private financial company, deal in more liquid assets. Mr Chertkov, whose spartan office is decorated with lists of countries in which it is easy to set up off-shore accounts, caters to those Odessa businessmen who need help negotiating the financial labyrinth of the former Soviet Union with its various, non-convertible currencies and who wish to keep their hard currency earnings safely abroad. 'Given our anarchic banking system, our clients find it convenient to use our company to make swift hard currency payments for them within the former Soviet Union,' Mr Chertkov explains. 'The old command economic structures are gone, but no effective new mechanism exists.' One result of Ukraine's financial chaos, according to Mr Chertkov, is capital flight which he estimates at Dollars 15bn, between Dollars 6bn and 7Dollars bn of which he believes has left Ukraine over the past two years. 'This is all because of the idiotic tax policies of the government,' Mr Chertkov says. 'If the investor climate changes all that capital will flow back and the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and the IMF (International Monetary Fund) will be superfluous.' However, Mr Chertkov says his clients are prospering and re-directing their businesses. Russia, once the dominant economic player, now ranks behind the Baltics, Israel, Greece, Germany and the US in his clients' trade. 'Spiritually, we are very close to Russia, but in business we've very quickly re-oriented ourselves,' Mr Chertkov says. 'We've found better partners in the world market.' Mr Chertkov hopes that Odessa can become 'the great wholesale bazaar for the entire former Soviet Union'. It is a dream shared by Mr Edvard Gurvitz, who survived an often implicitly anti-semitic campaign to be elected Odessa's mayor in elections on July 10. A free-wheeling businessman who is credited with sprucing up Odessa's centre when he was a city councillor, Mr Gurvitz hopes to establish a free-economic zone in the city. Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new president and one of Mr Gurvitz's political allies, supports the idea and consultants, funded by the EBRD, are already in Odessa to help work out the details of the plan, which, barring administrative obstacles, could come into force late next year. Mr Gurvitz is hopeful that, with the added fillip of a free economic zone, Odessa's traders will be able to help pull the rest of the nation out of its economic doldrums. 'It's like what the Americans say about General Motors,' Mr Gurvitz says. 'What's good for Odessa is good for Ukraine.'</p>

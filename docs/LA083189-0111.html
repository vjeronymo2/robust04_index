			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKING PERMIT PROS AND CONS  </P> <P> The heavy hand of City Hall once again proposes to harass the citizens of the  city. The citizens don't desire or need to be chased from their street parking  spaces at night. But City Hall, in its infinite wisdom, wants to inflict this  dastardly harassment and to collect a fee so as to increase the city  employment.  </P> <P> If there were an off-street space available, a resident would gladly use it to  get away from the graffiti, vandalism and risk of a stolen auto, a problem  brought on by the City Council with its loose commercial and multifamily  building policy over the past 10 or more years. Has any graffiti painter been  arrested?  </P> <P> Not for street sweeping at midnight! Who wants to be awakened at 3 a.m. by a  roaring sweeping machine? Most cars are off the street in the daytime when  sweeping is done every two weeks or less often. People do go to work elsewhere.  Even for this, the citizens are harassed by being required to vacate a street  once a week.  </P> <P> Residents keep the peace by parking their cars on the street and thus not  making them available for nighttime revelers to use them while they occupy  bars, restaurants, et al., until 2 a.m., then litter and wake up the  neighborhood as they depart. Is this parking policy aimed at supporting the  bars?  </P> <P> Divide and conquer! Pick on one small area first, then another, then another --  each so the rage of citizens will not be too loud and can thus be ignored.  </P> <P> Nothing positive is attained. The citizen is harassed, the car owner is  harassed and assessed, the city squeezes more money out of the citizen, the  city establishment grows unnecessarily, another attack is made on the citizens'  freedom.  </P> <P> WAYNE S.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three comments questioned whether the rule applies to nonfederal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands within the boundaries of National Park System units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule, as does the proposed, applies to all nonfederal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands within such boundaries, without regard to title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress explicitly directed that the law apply ``*&blank;*&blank;* within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' It is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the authority of the National Park Service to rewrite an act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Congress and limit the rule's applicability to only ``Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands within the boundary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are many statutes establishing National Park System units. A brief survey of these statutes disclosed that the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``within the boundaries'' is commonly employed to refer to both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal land and nonfederally owned land or interests in land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the outer boundaries a unit. The statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that mandates this final rule specifically uses the term `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the boundary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of any unit of the National Park System.'' (Emphasis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment from Alaska noted that 36 CFR 1.2 applies only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain regulations to nonfederal lands, and then, only in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those units under the concurrent or exclusive legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction of the United States. However, the self-imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation of 36 CFR 1.2(b) applies only to regulations at 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR parts 1 through 5 and 7. Because Congress specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted a statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, that applies to all lands within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the boundaries of a unit, the regulations derived from that statute are not limited by 36 CFR 1.2(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The situation most analogous to 36 CFR part 6 is 36 CFR part 9,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A, Mining and Mining Claims. The regulations at 36 CFR part 9A apply to all mining claims within a unit, both patented and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpatented, and in all parks, even in those where the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States exercises neither concurrent nor exclusive legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction. Thus, for example, patented claims, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private property in every sense of the word, in Death Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Monument, or the Kantishna area of Denali National Park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Preserve (areas of proprietary jurisdiction only) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governed by 36 CFR part 9 subpart A, notwithstanding 36 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2(b). The same principle applies to 36 CFR part 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments questioned whether the regulations apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfederal lands within unit boundaries in units of the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park System specifically in Alaska. (Alaska units of the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park System contain approximately 2.7 million nonfederal acres of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a total of over 54 million acres encompassed within their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries, or approximately 5% of the total acreage.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basis for the comments from Alaska lies in section 103(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16 U.S.C. 3103(c)). That language states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such unit. No lands which, before, on, or after the date of enactment of this act, are conveyed to the State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any Native Corporation, or any private party shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the regulations applicable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> solely <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  to public lands within such units. If the State, a Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> become part of the unit, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and be administered accordingly. (Emphasis added) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The comments from Alaska cite this language to raise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant issue of whether nonfederal lands within National Park System units in Alaska are part of the units at all, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus subject to any NPS regulations, including the final rule at 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 103(c) language creates a question of statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation. Namely, does this section effectively render the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste site law (Pub. L. 98&hyph;506), and its implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, inapplicable to all nonfederal lands in National Park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System units in Alaska? Or does it simply mean that the non-federal lands are not be to be administered as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation unit in the same manner as the Federal lands?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the Service's opinion that the language of section 103(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not render the final rule at 36 CFR part 6 inapplicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfederal lands in units of the National Park System in Alaska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the presence of the word ``solely.'' Since Pub. L. 98&hyph;506  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizes the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibits all but certain such sites, ``within the boundary of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit of the National Park System,'' neither the law, nor its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations apply ``solely'' to public lands within the units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other possibility is that section 103(c) renders Pub. L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 98&hyph;506 inapplicable by its own terms. Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``within the boundary of any unit of the National Park System.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first sentence of section 103(c) specifies: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Only those lands within the boundaries of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation system units which are public lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as such term is defined in this Act) shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed to be included as a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> portion of such unit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Emphasis added) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Under this argument, since nonfederal lands are not ``a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of'' a unit, they are not ``within the boundary of a National Park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System unit'' and thus not subject to this regulation. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the better view of the law negates this argument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 applies ``within the boundary of any unit of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Park System.'' Words in a statute generally are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given their common meaning. The common understanding of the words  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``within the boundary'' is that something be within the outer limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It does not mean the same thing as ``a portion of.'' Perhaps the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best indication of this analysis is the use of the word ``within'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Alaska Lands Act itself. Section 1301(b)(7) (16 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3191(b)), refers to ``privately owned areas, if any, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> within such unit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' Thus, while there are no privately-owned areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are ``a portion of'' the unit, the Alaska Lands Act recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there are privately-owned areas ``within'' a unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 103(c) itself speaks of ``only those lands within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands,'' thus implying the existence of non-public lands within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those boundaries. The Service therefore concludes from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language of section 103(c) itself that nonfederal lands are ``within'' the boundaries of Alaska units of the National Park System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if they are not ``a portion of'' the unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments from Alaska offer an opportunity to further clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicability of 36 CFR part 6 and illuminate the exceptions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule that are specifically aimed at small private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential inholders. Persons who either reside or farm within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit need not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule at &sect;6.2(c)(iii) stated that such waste could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed of ``on lands or waters'' that ``he or she owns or leases''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the unit. In response to two comments, the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletes the word ``waters'' since disposing of solid waste in water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or wetlands may likely violate other laws. In the interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gender neutrality, the word ``person'' is substituted for ``he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

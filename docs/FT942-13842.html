			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Recovery boosts Amex 18% to Dollars 317m American Express's core card business continued a recovery begun last year, helping to push income from continuing operations at the financial services group up 18 per cent to Dollars 317m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 268m, or 53 cents a share, a year before. The company's travel-related services division reported after-tax profits of Dollars 234m, 12 per cent up on the year before. The amount of business billed on the company's cards during the period rose to Dollars 31.8bn, from Dollars 28.3bn, more than offsetting a decline in the average discount rate charged to merchants. This rate had fallen from 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 to 2.87 per cent in the final three months of the year, as American Express sought to extend the network of retailers who accept its cards. In the latest three months, the rate was 2.85 per cent. Though the total number of cards in force remained unchanged over the months, at 35.4m, the number of charge cards fell by 200,000 to 19.3m. The company also saw further earnings growth in its IDS financial services subsidiary, with after-tax profits climbing 22 per cent to Dollars 91m on revenues of Dollars 818m, 10 per cent higher than a year before. Lehman Brothers, the investment bank which is due to be spun off during the current quarter and which is accounted for as a discontinued operation, made net income (before accounting changes) of Dollars 55m, up from Dollars 34m. Lehman avoided the sort of trading losses seen in some other banks, maintaining its trading income at Dollars 434m for the period. With a higher cost base than many rivals, though, its return on capital during the period remained low by industry standards, at 10.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhai Peitian [5049 1014 1131]: "China </F> Successfully Develops "O"-Shaped Sealing Rings for Pressure  Vessels"]    [Text] Success has now been achieved in Sichuan in the  reactor "O"-shaped sealing rings developed by the China Nuclear  Power Academy. This is another breakthrough in research for  shifting to domestic production of nuclear power equipment that  follows China's successful development of nuclear power plant  pressure vessel steel, no-leak safety valves, dual-channel  neutron boron tables, and other achievements in our shift to  domestic production of nuclear power plant equipment and it has  major significance for China's achievement of a shift to  domestic production of nuclear power equipment.    The "O"-shaped sealing rings for reactor pressure vessels  are  one of the key components to ensure safe reactor operation. The  difficulty of their development lies in the need for the sealing  rings to ensure that no nuclear leaks occur under conditions of  high-temperature and high-pressure intense irradiation, which  places rather high requirements on their materials and  technology. The S&amp;T personnel of the China Nuclear Power  Academy  employed thick-walled tube casing and thick-walled spherical  casing theory and used non-continuous analysis methods and  iterative algorithms to successfully analyze the flange seal  performance problems of reactor pressure vessels. Because they  considered the coupling action of bolts, temperature, friction,  and other areas, they achieved innovations and developments.    The "O"-shaped sealing rings can be widely used as pressure  vessel seals in nuclear power plants, reactors, and other power  reactors such as nuclear submarine reactors, and they can be  used as high-temperature and high-pressure vessel seals in the  petrochemical and chemical industries, thermal power plants, and  so on.</p>

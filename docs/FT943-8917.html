			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Housing land prices up 35.3% The price of land for residential building in England rose 35.3 per cent in the year to June, says a survey of land values by Savills, the residential research company. Land prices have jumped 23 per cent in the first half of this year, with the biggest increases concentrated in the south-east, south-west, East Anglia and, most prominently, in the east Midlands. Since June 1992 land values in England have risen 48 per cent, exceeding the most optimistic Savills forecast. At the start of this year researchers predicted prices would rise 20 per cent during the year. This unexpected performance may be attributed to a recovery from previous price falls. Residential land has been hit much harder by a decline in property values than the housing market generally. From June 1989 to 1992 the price of edge-of-town and serviced land, as well as level sites with outline planning permission for medium-density dwellings, fell an average of 52 per cent. The Savills index of residential building land is 582.3. It is estimated that prices will have to increase by a further 40 per cent for the index to regain its 1989 peak of 817.2.</p>

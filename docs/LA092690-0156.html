			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH MAY DEAL ON CAPITAL GAINS CUTS, LAWMAKERS SAY  </P> <P> President Bush may be willing to compromise on his call for a capital gains tax  cut, the main sticking point in talks to slash the federal deficit, Republican  members of Congress who met with the President said today.  </P> <P> Instead of reducing the rate on capital gains taxes, Bush might accept other  incentives to economic growth, the lawmakers said.  </P> <P> "He might be willing to look at alternatives in the growth area," said Senate  Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), as he and other GOP lawmakers left the White  House.  </P> <P> But Bush and GOP lawmakers warned that without Democratic concessions at  ongoing budget talks, no deal would be reached in time to avoid $85 billion in  federal spending cuts that the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will impose  Monday.  </P> <P> Bush, at a political fund-raiser today in Akron, Ohio, criticized congressional  Democrats, saying, "It's their fault for holding up getting a budget  agreement."  </P> <P> "We will continue to press hard for incentives for capital investment," Bush  said. However, he did not further discuss his longstanding insistence on a  capital gains tax reduction as part of any budget agreement.  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the No. 2 House Republican, said the incentives  Bush might be willing to accept include tax breaks for businesses to encourage  research and investment, and a proposal to establish so-called enterprise  zones. The zones would provide tax breaks for businesses in poor urban and  rural areas.  </P> <P> "While he's going to be very flexible and he's willing to look at a Democratic  offer, he wants part of this final agreement to be a growth package," Gingrich  said.  </P> <P> "He's willing to negotiate every item that's been advanced," said Sen. Thad  Cochran (R-Miss.) when asked if Bush was now ready to bargain on the question  of capital gains.  </P></p>

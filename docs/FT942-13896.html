			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Molecular for market with Pounds 29.5m tag Oxford Molecular, the first company to be spun out from Oxford University, will be valued at Pounds 29.5m when its shares start trading on the Stock Exchange next Thursday following a Pounds 10m placing. Mr Tony Marchington, co-founder and chief executive, said he was very pleased with the price, particularly in view of recent problems in the new issue market. 'In spite of the tightening in the market in the last two weeks, the price is exactly the same as we first discussed last May.' Mr Marchington's stake will be valued at about Pounds 1m, although he has agreed not to sell any shares for two years. The company, which supplies computer software for use in drug design, suffered a Pounds 1.2m loss on revenues of only Pounds 1.4m last year. Mr Marchington said that after the placing he had telephoned Professor Tony Rees, one of the company's four co-founders. 'I told him I haven't had this buzz since I was 17 and got the note offering me a place at Oxford.' The shares were placed at 80p by brokers Henry Cooke, Lumsden.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  United States resolved Wednesday nearly all of their differences  on inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities and a  third-round of high-level talks in their working-level contact  in New York, a senior South Korean Government official said  Friday. As a result, North Korea will resume its negotiations  with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  working-level contact with South Korea in January, the official  said. There is also a strong possibility that North Korea and  the United States will hold a third round of their high-level  talks soon, he said, requesting anonymity.    "The United States and North Korea could not reach a  complete  agreement as two problems arose at their contact in New York on  Tuesday," the official said. "But these problems are not crucial  and I don't believe that they will become an obstacle."    The official declined to disclose details of the  difficulties  but said the United States and South Korea have already informed  Pyongyang of their positions on the problems.    "Therefore, the statement by the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman on Thursday night could be taken as its  reply, accepting the U.S.-South Korean position," the official  said.    The statement said that there had been a breakthrough in the  latest round of talks between the United States and North Korea  in New York.    "The two sides removed a series of stumbling blocks that had  deadlocked the North Korea-U.S. talks and made a breakthrough  for progress...," the North Korean spokesman said.    The South Korean official said, "The possibility of solving  the two problems is increasing."    He indicated that North Korea is going to allow the IAEA to  inspect all seven of its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and will  accept a proposal for exchanges of special envoys with South  Korea.    The problems involve the venue for the North Korean-IAEA  talks. North Korea wants to hold them in Pyongyang whereas the  United States want them to be held in a third country and favors  Vienna, according to informed sources. Because of these  differences, the two sides could not work out a complete  agreement, they said.    The United States and North Korea are expected to hold  another working-level contact in New York early next month to  discuss the venue for the talks and other auxiliary matters.    Inter-Korean relations and the North Korean nuclear issue  will enter into a new phase if the United States and North Korea  agree to hold a third-round of high-level talks, they said.</p>

Ambassador to the  Arab Emirates, Giovanni Ferrero, stated that there is no alert,  it is merely routine. In fact, it is a maneuver to increase the  Italian presence in the region and to ensure a "redistribution  of forces."    Maurizio Vacca, military attache at the embassy, said that  the decision did not mean that Italy had decided to sign a  defense cooperation agreement with the Gulf Arab states -- as  the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Russia did at  the end of the Desert Storm campaign. The naval forces will be  used as they are required and on an individual basis.    However, the military attache assured, there will be more  frequent naval exercises in the Gulf: "We want to increase our  presence in the Gulf. We want to contribute to maintaining  stability in the region."    According to statements by Kuwaiti officials, the exercises  will also serve to demonstrate to the Emirates which types of  military equipment are most suited to the climate and waters  around Kuwait. Since the end of the Gulf war, Kuwait has already  participated in 150 naval maneuvers with various allied nations.  Two Italian naval vessels have already completed a two-week  maneuver in the Gulf with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Unlike the  other allies, however, Italy has had a rather limited naval  presence in the region to date.</p>

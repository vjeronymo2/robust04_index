			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhang Junsheng Suggests Three Ways To </F> Increase Hong Kong People's Understanding of PLA"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 1 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Zhang Junsheng,  deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said here today that  increasing mutual understanding between Hong Kong people in all  walks of life and the People's Liberation Army [PLA] will be  conducive to communication between PLA troops stationed in Hong  Kong after 1997 and local residents.    Zhang joined a number of Hong Kong deputies to the National  People's Congress [NPC] and other Hong Kong celebrities in  visiting the troops of Guangzhou Military Region. When asked by  reporters after the visit, Zhang expressed the following opinion.    Zhang Junsheng said: This visit to the Guangzhou Military  Region was an activity enabling the residents of Hong Kong to  know the PLA better. Today's military show was superb. This  time, the leaders, officers, and soldiers of the Guangzhou unit  very warmly and thoughtfully received the visiting NPC deputiess  and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference National Committee from Hong Kong, members of the  Preparatory Working Committee, and Hong Kong affairs advisers.    A reporter asked: Will the press be able to cover this type  of news in the future? Zhang Junsheng said: "We shall try by  every possible means to enable Hong Kong people from all walks  of life to come into contact with the PLA and understand the  PLA, and this will include our friends in the mass media.  However, it is not easy to arrange such visits."    Another reporter asked: Will visits to the PLA barracks help  remove Hong Kong people's misgivings about the PLA? Zhang  Junsheng said: "If Hong Kong people have misgivings, this is  just a misunderstanding. The people's Army is a strong force  for defending our country. Without the PLA, how could we be  able to conduct national reconstruction in a peaceful  environment, and how could we live peacefully?"    He stressed: If there is such a misunderstanding, then it is  necessary to remove it by increasing understanding of the PLA.  First, it is necessary to know about the fine traditions and  history of the PLA. Second, there are many news reports about  the PLA on the mainland. Third, in the future, more Hong Kong  people from various social circles, including journalists, will  be organized to come into contact with the PLA. This will all  be conducive to communication between PLA troops stationed in  Hong Kong after 1997 and local residents.</p>

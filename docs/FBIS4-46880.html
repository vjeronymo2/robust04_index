			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Kharebashvili and Irine Chomakhidze: </F> "When a City's Major Enterprises Are Idle"]    [Text] If a city's mayor tells you that all the major  enterprises there are idle, under normal circumstances it would  not occur to a normal person to ask, "Is that good or bad?"  Although given the situation we find ourselves in these past few  years, which you might call anything but normal and usual (for  example, sarcastically: "interesting," fashionably:  "paradoxical," agitatedly: "critical," realistically: "pathetic  and deplorable"), any kind of question can arise and even demand  an answer. What is left to wonder at when that most absurd of  phrases--"logical paradox" (we hold the copyright)--has a right  to exist? Nevertheless, the above question did not occur to us.  Later, as we talked about various things, Rustavi Mayor Soso  Areshidze himself posed it.    We sensed that the question was not rhetorical; he had an  answer, but not the logical "It's bad." What's good about having  enterprises stand idle when resumption of operations could  affect not only Rustavi itself but, in a few days, the whole  republic? But if that were true, the question would not have  been asked.    In such cases, the question is usually answered by the one  who asked it:    "It depends on who you ask," said the mayor. "As far as I am  concerned, it is better for an enterprise to stand idle than for  its earnings to go to the wrong place and be used for the wrong  things.    "Oh yes, I know that just about all countries have the mafia  problem, but there has to be a limit. Even the mafia has its  rules. First of all, it is not banditry, otherwise it would have  a different name. But nobody cares about anything, or respects  anything or anyone! They've got everything, now they want power.  Hey, why not?!    "They even act as if they were the people's champion! Once  they took over the bakery. Who asked them?"    It used to be that if a raykom secretary asked a friend to  come work with him, the man's joy--and then his luck--knew no  bounds. Now, if the mayor or rayon head asks you to come work  with him you have to have a lot of respect for him not to say no.    The ordinary working man does not care for politics, it  doesn't interest him. He wants a decent life, and if he doesn't  have it he sees the city's or rayon's top man as the source of  all his woes. Anonymous persons telephone regional leaders at  home with brief and specific complaints--"Do your lights work?",  "Do you have water?", "You aren't hungry or cold, are you?"  These are so much like the old days (although then the  complainers probably didn't phone), but the psychology is the  same: everyone demands that he--the top man--solve their  problems.    Regional management is one of the most important problems of  Georgia today. As in other aspects of our lives, there is  disorder and confusion here as well.    "We do have our independence," says the mayor. "No one from  above either helps us or bugs us. In short, they don't get  involved."    A question again, this time from us: "Is that good or bad?"  And again the answer: "It depends on who you ask...." A little  later, after he tells us that in the old days he couldn't have  served as raykom secretary, he wasn't good enough, we pretty  much understood the meaning of his answer, in this case "It's  not a bad thing. After all, we have to learn to stand on our own  feet." And if we recall the beginning of our talk, the  idea--containing one indispensable condition--logically  continues: "But first, law and order has to be established."    That is indisputable, but of course it does not mean that  there are not certain other, equally important conditions. We  talk about cadre policy. The mayor emphasizes the importance of  choosing personnel correctly, in particular leadership cadres.  That is as indisputable as the fact that in many spheres,  reality imposes quite different demands, and poses questions  too: "How long do we have to put up with our appointed  leadership?", "Where is the institution of proprietorship?" We  do agree, after all, that we don't want to go back. We are no  longer trying to rebuild what we destroyed--otherwise, what was  the point of destroying it?! Life changes rapidly in terms of  reality and paradigm, and every step that is delayed hits us  right in the sorest spots.    However slowly, privatization is proceeding [the mayor  continues]. Relatively small entities--retail and consumer  outlets--are winding up in the hands of private owners, but  things are more complicated in the case of major enterprises.  The process of creating joint-stock companies has been slow  getting started. At present, only six joint-stock companies have  been registered, while the documentation has been prepared for  10.    Small-scale privatization is hampered by the slow pace of  differentiating state and municipal property, owing to the  unacceptability of the law on municipal property ownership.  Practical steps are being taken to privatize retail and  transportation outfits which definitely ought to be subject to  municipal ownership.    There are also complaints about joint stock companies:  enterprise officials have a negative attitude toward amounts of  shares to be transferred to the labor collectives free of charge  or at reduced prices in accordance with the republic's  privatization program, namely 4-5 and 10 percent. At a joint  meeting of the Mayor's Office and the Collegium of the State  Property Management Ministry the opinion was expressed that not  less than 20 percent of the shares should be transferred free of  charge to the labor collective, and in cases where the state  does not keep a package of shares, the collective ought to have  the right to purchase up to 51 percent of the shares on  preferential terms, which, in our opinion, would be more fair.  The collectives are treated badly enough as it is. Here's one  example: by the government's decision, consumption quotas were  imposed on goods produced last year; according to them, a quota  of 75 percent of an enterprise's production output went to the  state, 10 percent stayed with the local administration, and only  15 percent went to the enterprise. You can imagine how well that  stimulates the plant's operations!    Another issue which I have to raise: this year's  first-quarter budget. In the case of electricity and gas alone  we have to pay a subsidy in the amount of a price differential  of 31 and 35 billion coupons. Not counting other costs, we must  add to this the funds for health, culture, education, and  municipal services, adding up to at least 20 billion coupons. In  other words, the first-quarter budget came out to more than 90  billion coupons, at a time when, based on present normatives,  revenues total about 30 billion coupons.    This absurdity is due to the fact that the republic Cabinet  of Ministers decided to reduce enterprise profit taxes, which is  a good thing in and of itself, but it shouldn't have been done  at the city's expense alone. At least some percentage ought to  be retained; the republic takes 90 percent of the value-added  tax, and only 10 percent remains here. Even if all this tax were  to be kept by the city, which is not only desirable but  essential, it wouldn't help things, because it won't pay our  costs. There is just one solution: the republic ought to take  over the subsidy, otherwise we won't have the means to pay the  price differentials.    [Question] What are the prospects for developing  entrepreneurship in the city?    [Answer] We are doing everything we can to foster small  businesses. A total of 2,176 small and one-man businesses,  additional-liability and limited-liability companies, and  cooperatives are registered in Rustavi, of which 953 are now in  operation, including 117 in industry, 101 in construction, and  735 in commerce.    In 1993, 28 billion coupons of finished goods were produced.  Profits totalled 17.2 billion coupons, and 5.7 billion coupons  went into the budget. The results would have been better if it  were not for the energy crisis, which has not only hurt small  businesses and firms but also major industrial giants, and if  they cease operations we are in trouble. After all, Rustavi is  an industrial city, we have no other reserves. Some progress has  been made; a few enterprises have resumed operations. We need  more.    [Question] Any chance of that?    [Answer] There is hope. If we can get the energy, we'll get  on our feet. The Azot Production Association needs 80 megawatts  of electricity and 50,000 cubic meters of gas per hour to  operate properly, and supplies need to be steady. Other  enterprises have similar problems. If Azot can't work, almost  all of agriculture will fail. These problems are interconnected  and condition one another.    [Question] We think of the resumption of enterprise  operations as a solution, but "who are they going to be working  for?" Isn't that problem still on the agenda?    [Answer] Things are hopeful there too. The recent  republic-wide effort--open, implacable war against the criminal  world--gives grounds for optimism.    There are many problems. Moreover, as the mayor says, "each  problem comes first." Nevertheless, two main problems stand  out--the economy, and law and order. Should they be dealt with  in parallel or in sequence? On the one hand, there is the  criminal, created by society, for whom the appropriate  environment must be created--a real chance to make a living  through honest labor--before asking him to go straight. On the  other hand, until law and order is in place any thought of  creating wealth is just an idle dream.    "Where shall we begin?", says city Police Chief Rezo  Belkania, answering our question with the same question. "From  my viewpoint it would be best to start with the economy."    [Question] The businessman would probably say that first you  need law and order.    [Answer] And both of us would be right. All kidding aside,  probably we have to act first, to create the necessary  conditions for creating wealth, and, in addition, a mechanism  for protecting it, or, to put it another way, provide a  guarantee that the wealth will go to its proper destination.    [Question] Who gives you the most trouble in your  activities?    [Answer] The armed formal units. There are virtually no  armed  informal units left in the city.    For example, let's say we catch someone in the act. We  report  them to their superiors and turn them over for appropriate  action. But only one action is forthcoming--the criminal is out  on the streets the next day. Once we arrested some military  police officers in a restaurant for hooliganism, we disarmed  them and turned them over to the Military Police authorities.  They released them in a half hour and gave their weapons back.  And then you know what they did? They went back to the  restaurant and resumed their drinking party, after which they  caught one of our officers that had taken part in the raid,  killed him and threw him into the Kura River.    Another incident: Someone stole an automatic weapon and two  submachine guns from an armed unit belonging to the Defense  Ministry. We caught the thieves, who turned out to be uniformed  personnel of the same unit. They were free in a week.    Recently, 13 men armed with automatic weapons broke into the  auxiliary farm of the Metal Components Plant and stole five  cows. The bandits were caught red-handed, and guess who they  were? Members of the Rustavi Reconnaissance and Landing  Battalion of the Defense Ministry's First Army Corps.    [Question] Wow! Almost hard to believe.... Apparently they  reconnoitered the target, then they made their assault and  carried out the operation. But it fell through.    [Answer] They were free in two days, although after the  incident that Corps was abolished.... Nevertheless, we can all  see that a fresh breeze is blowing, from the top. The process is  underway. Nothing can stop us now. The criminals' days are  numbered. But would you like to know what kind of equipment they  have? We could only dream. They are in radio contact with each  other. Weapons and gasoline are no problem to them. We, on the  other hand, when two crimes take place at once, have a hard time  deciding which one is more urgent to go to. There is no way we  can go both places. Everything is a problem for us, even  uniforms for the personnel. Still, we are accomplishing some  things. But we are still far from being satisfied. We need the  public's support, and though it is slow in coming I think we are  getting it. And so, we are not retreating. We have to establish  order. People have enough trouble without being fearful as well.  [end of Belkania quote]    The police chief's attitude is commendable.    The police are working and will probably win.    "Where shall we start?" Rustavi's First Deputy Mayor for  Economic Affairs Malkhaz Gvazava has an unequivocal answer to  that question: "Start by establishing order. Without that,  anything else is empty talk. The economy can get on its feet  only under conditions of law and order. A vigorous economy and  proper management of it--privatization, the formation of  joint-stock companies, and land distribution--these are the  things that create the conditions which foster development.  Budget-funded organizations will have to start making the  changes called for in the plan. These are the conditions that  will serve to correct the situation. Our city's great potential  gives grounds for real optimism.    "To put people to work we need the appropriate mechanism,  but  we are not giving enough thought to it. In the past few years we  have destroyed a great deal, but we have not destroyed what we  should have destroyed first--the socialist mentality and way of  thinking. We will have to totally reorder our thinking and  views, cut new patterns. Consider this simple example: How many  educators or, for example, doctors do we need? Not as many as we  have. Not everyone is going to be able to work in his specialty,  only the best ones will succeed in doing so. The selection has  to be objective and tough. I realize that this is a harsh  policy, perhaps even cruel, but it is the only way. Our thinking  has to be pragmatic. The principle of our best interests has to  be paramount. This is the only way to ensure professionalism.  There is no other way to build the future society."    When Rustavi's mayor says that almost all the city's  enterprises are idle, it can only foster a hopeless mood, but  when Rustavi's police chief says that he has real grounds for  optimism, that makes us hopeful. What we have here, undoubtedly,  is a sense of the responsibility which today's harsh realities  impose on officials who must break through the blank wall of  hopelessness.    The mayor's statement that the city is beginning to move,  that enterprises are resuming operations, are practical  confirmation of this.</p>

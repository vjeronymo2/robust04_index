			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Novell and Oracle agree computer deal NOVELL and Oracle, two leading US computer software companies, have formed an alliance to create a combined range of products for corporate computer networks. Oracle will combine its database software and messaging systems with Novell's widely-used networking software and operating systems, to provide a single package of software that addresses the needs of companies downsizing their computer systems from mainframe computers to networks of workstations and servers. The new line, called Oracle Ware, will combine Novell's Net Ware networking software or Unix operating system with Oracle's Oracle 7 database and Oracle Office messaging services software. 'A lot of customers already use Novell and Oracle products together. By tightly integrating our products we will reduce the complexity of implementing networks and cut the cost of ownership,' said Mr Jan Newman, Novell executive vice-president. 'Database services have become a very critical component of enterprise networks,' added Mr Fred Cutler, Oracle executive vice-president.</p>

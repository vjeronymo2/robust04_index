			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA FREES MANDELA  </P> <P> Although the long-overdue reforms are finally being established in South  Africa, we must not make the mistake of forgetting the role that America played  in apartheid.  </P> <P> Even when the time comes that South African blacks possess civil rights equal  to those of whites, the fact will still remain that there are American  companies who refused to acknowledge the struggle for justice in South Africa  by refusing to impose the sanctions which would undoubtedly have expedited  these reforms. In this sense, they are as guilty as those who violently denied  millions of individuals the freedom and equality that is their fundamental  right.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH ORECK  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

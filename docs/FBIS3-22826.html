Employees of British Nuclear Fuels began filling a channel  with 600,000 litres of demineralised water, linking spent fuel  storage ponds with ones that feed the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing  Plant.    The company said that the first consignment of spent fuel, a  three-tonne container from the advanced gas cooled reactors of  Heysham and Hinkley Point power stations, would be moved on a  special underwater machine at the end of the week. Reprocessing  would begin after checks on the moving equipment.    Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council last week secured  the right to a judicial review of the Government's decision to  approve Thorp's operation. It will take place early next month  -- probably before the first fuel rods are reprocessed.    John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, said  yesterday: "Today is a watershed. It means at last that Thorp is  finally opening. This is good news not only for our company and  our workforce, who have worked tirelessly for this day over the  last 16 years, but also for our customers who have supported the  plant." He said he was confident that the company would secure a  successful result in the judicial review.</p>

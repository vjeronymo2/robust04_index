			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Haulage group names chairman MR Martin Llowarch, who stepped down unexpectedly as chief executive of British Steel last May, is to become chairman of Transport Development Group, one of Britain's biggest road hauliers. Mr Llowarch, who was regarded as a possible future chairman of British Steel until he resigned, will succeed Sir James Duncan, who retires at the end of August on reaching 65. Sir James has been chairman since 1975 and has been on the board since 1960. Mr Llowarch joined the board only in February. The decision to bring in an outsider is another sign of the management shake-up at a company, where profits have marked time for several years. Mr Alan Cole, TDG's chief executive, joined in June 1990.</p>

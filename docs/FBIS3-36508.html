			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article under the "Topic of the Week" </F> rubric: "Caucasian Chalk Circle"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia and the signing of  the series of Russian-Georgian documents were undoubtedly the  most important event of the week. None of the treaties with the  former Union republics has probably elicited such conflicting  and sometimes diametrically opposed assessments inside and  outside Russia. And these contradictions are based in fact, so  to speak -- in the supremely equivocal situation in the Caucasus.    In his play "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" Brecht used an  ancient legend allegorically to demonstrate the essence of this  region's fierce disputes over power and land. A guy over whom  two women are fighting is placed in a chalk circle. Each of the  women is asked to take him by the hand and pull him to her.  Needless to say, the woman who is afraid of hurting the boy  gives in. The one who loves him more. Regrettably, this wisdom  is beyond the political forces now operating in the Caucasus.  In order to possess territory and assert their authority they  are ready to inflict suffering on thousands and thousands of  people and literally tear this truly beautiful country to bits.    What role should Russia play in the Caucasus, a zone of its  vital interests (there is no point spelling that out today)?  Moscow cannot be the judge who settles the fierce conflicts over  Abkhazia and South Ossetia in accordance with its own ideas of  justice. But nor can it simply watch the bloody fighting.  Because the Caucasian republics of Russia itself are already  directly involved in these conflicts. Because if the coals of  these conflicts are allowed to continue smoldering, the fire may  break out with renewed vigor if not today then tomorrow and  spread to southern areas of Russia.    I think that Russia's main vital interest in this region at  the moment is to ensure peace and stability in the Caucasus.  And this interest can only be realized by mediating in the  settlement process and acting as guarantor of the accords to be  secured. This is no easy matter. It is no coincidence that  most Western powers are in effect ignoring the calls from  Georgia for them to act in a similar way. The obvious failure  of Russian mediation last year ahead of the latest outbreak of  hostilities culminating in the storming of Sukhumi is convincing  evidence that this task cannot be accomplished just like that.    In my view, one of the reasons for this failure was the fact  that Moscow was unable to provide the parties to the conflict  with real incentives to find a political solution. For Georgia  its treaty with Russia might be just such an incentive. But  there must be no illusions here. This will only happen if the  present phase of our relations is cleansed of starry-eyed  idealism and sentimentality. I was so touched by one Tbilisi  leader's recent statement to the effect that after a period of  alienation the two countries have finally looked one another in  the face. No, the truth is that over the last few years Georgia  has ostentatiously turned its back on Russia. And it is only  now, bogged down by conflict, a crime wave, and total economic  collapse, that it has figuratively speaking looked in the  mirror. What it saw was so impressive that it had no other  option than to try to integrate itself within the CIS and  initiate normal dialogue with Moscow. The truth is that the  incumbent authorities in Georgia, rent by internal conflict and  clashes, were incapable of ensuring even the normal working of  the state. They now see the restoration of their ties with  Russia as their salvation. And Russia certainly needs Georgia.  In order to tackle strategic problems -- guarding the CIS  external border and safeguarding the Russian troops' secure  legal and economic status.    So, Moscow today has every chance of safeguarding its own  interests in the region. Especially since they coincide, if not  with the politicians' interests then certainly with the  interests of the normal people living there. Obviously aid in  resolving Georgia's economic and military problems should be  conditional upon Tbilisi's taking a constructive approach to the  political resolution of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia. If that is clear, the development of Russian-Georgian  relations will not give rise to suspicion and objections from  the other parties to the conflicts. In my view, the realization  that the treaty signed in Tbilisi can only be ratified once a  political settlement has been secured in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia would be a good incentive for Tbilisi to seek a  reasonable compromise.    Russia's endeavor to provide Abkhazia and South Ossetia with  the kind of status that would safeguard as far as possible the  rights and interests of the people living there should act as an  incentive for the other parties to the conflicts. And there is  a normal civilized means of attaining this objective. State  competence can be divided up when a new Georgian Constitution is  developed. And in that case representatives of Abkhazia and  South Ossetia should be enlisted to work on this constitution  unconditionally.    Finally, I cannot help but mention military issues. It is  quite natural for Russia to only provide any aid in creating a  Georgian army once a real political settlement has been secured.  This settlement will necessitate wide-ranging peacekeeping  operations. It is clear that Russia will have to bear the full  burden here. But all the sides must provide firm guarantees that  the agreements will be fulfilled. Moreover, pledges to stop the  activity of those military formations which are jeopardizing the  security of Russian troops are essential.    Today purely opportunistic talk regarding the danger of the  revival of the "Russian empire" can be heard in Georgia and the  West. I do not doubt that the rigid formulation of the question  of Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus gives them fresh  ammunition. However, I do not think that one should pay  attention to them now. If they could get by without Russia,  they would probably do so. If not, then Moscow should set the  terms.    There is obviously an internal aspect to Russia's policy in  the Caucasus today. In order for this policy to be effective a  unified concept is needed not only for government departments,  but also for the government and parliament. This policy needs  the backing of Russia's regions. Judging by the adverse  reaction to the treaty with Georgia from most State Duma  factions and, most importantly, the suspicious reaction from the  Federation Council, this has not proved possible to achieve.    So, Russia itself must decide on its Caucasian policy. There  is every indication that we have left behind the period of  theoretical disputes over whether or not the post-Soviet area is  an area of Russia's vital interests. Clearly it is. Today the  whole point is what means Russia has at its disposal to  safeguard these interests. The Caucasus will be a difficult  test of this concept. And Moscow must also find out if it is  possible to erase the chalk circle that has been the scene of  hatred and mutual suspicion.</p>

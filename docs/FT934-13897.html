			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / EC will boost aid to east Germany THE European Community is likely at least to double its aid to east Germany next year from the current annual figure of Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) to try to narrow the region's economic gap with the rest of the EC. Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, said in London yesterday that east Germany was due to receive a 'very considerable' increase in structural fund payments next year, but did not give a figure. The payments would rise as eastern Germany was brought fully into the mechanism for channelling money to regions with gross domestic product per head of less than 75 per cent of the EC average. In parts of east Germany, the figure was only 30-40 per cent, Mr Millan said. 'The scale of problems is unbelievable.' His comments reflect a desire by the Commission to show that the EC is taking east Germany's structural problems seriously. Anti-EC feeling in Germany seems partly to reflect the belief that the Community is leaving west Germany to shoulder the burden alone, a view put last month by Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of Dresdner Bank. Separately, Mr Millan held out the hope of EC cash for British local authorities seeking funds for tourism and urban regeneration projects in southern England. He said criteria on structural funding for areas in industrial decline had been widened to include those suffering from problems in non-traditional industries. In a map submitted by the UK government, London and south coast towns like Brighton are included for the first time among applicants for structural aid to Britain which could amount to Pounds 1bn a year. These southern areas often have urban problems and fading tourism industries.</p>

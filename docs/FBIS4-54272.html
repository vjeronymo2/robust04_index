			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW1805145394 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] began on 15  May to study the possibility of Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  visiting the United States during June. The ministry did that  because, in addition to the fact that the foreign minister  himself very much wants to visit the United States at an early  stage, the visit would "give the impression to the United States  that there are signs of change" in resuming the Japan-U.S. trade  framework talks, which is facing difficulties. However, it  seems that the MOFA needs some time before reaching a  conclusion, partly because the Diet schedule has to be taken  into consideration, but also because some officials of the MOFA  and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are  of the opinion that the situation is still "premature."    Ever since he was inaugurated to the ministerial post on 28  April, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, in interviews and on other  occasions, has voiced his strong desire to visit the United  States at an early stage, saying: "I need to deal not only with  the economic issues but also with North Korea's suspected  nuclear arms development. It is also important for me to meet  with senior U.S. Government officials soon to establish private  and confidence-building relations with them."    Keeping in mind the issue of resuming the economic framework  talks, an issue pending between Japan and the United States, the  MOFA's administrative authorities expressed a negative stance  regarding the foreign minister's trip to the United States at an  early stage, saying: 1) the two nations are now in a  cooling-off period following the breakdown of the framework  talks with no prospects of resuming the talks in sight; 2) a  visit by the foreign minister will encourage the United States  to harbor excessive expectations that Japan may come up with  compromises over the points at issue, including "objective  criteria"; and 3) such a visit, on the contrary, will have a  negative impact on Japan-U.S. relations if it fails to produce  results.    However, some government officials and public opinion in the  United States have begun to turn against the Clinton  administration's hard-line policy, designed to urge Japan to  compromise while hinting at the possibility of imposing  sanctions. For these and other reasons, President Clinton said  on 3 May that "the United States will not demand the acceptance  of quotas or managed trade." During his telephone conversation  with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 9 May, the president urged  mutual effort to resume the framework talks.    Moreover, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor,  who  had been leading others in criticizing Japan, on 10 May  positively assessed Japan's stance shown during negotiations in  individual areas, including the rice, construction, and cellular  phone industries. In addition, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher called Foreign Minister Kakizawa on the same day and  said that "we will welcome your trip to the United States before  the Naples summit."    Regarding such a series of movements on the part of the  United States, MOFA analyzes that "there is a sign that the  United States is softening its stance," according to a Foreign  Ministry source. The MOFA thinks that the foreign minister's  "trip to the United States before the summit will have its own  political significance," according to a senior Foreign Ministry  official.    However, it is also certain that there still exists a  deep-rooted view that "although the atmosphere in the United  States is changing, it has not changed its stance (of demanding  that Japan set objective criteria)," according to the same  senior official. It seems that the MOFA will "seek, while  carefully observing how the situation will develop, the  possibility of realizing the trip in June," according to a  Foreign Ministry source.</p>

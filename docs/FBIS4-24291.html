			<p>BFN     [Text] Zairians are still expecting Prime Minister Leon  Kengo Wa Dondo to form the ninth transitional government.  Yesterday, the prime minister called for greater responsibility  from the conclave's political forces and the Sacred Union of the  Radical Opposition and Allies. He asked them to submit to him  all their proposals for the formation of the new government by  1100 GMT today at the latest. As demanded by Article 78,  paragraph 5, of the transition constitution, the prime minister  must propose the list of the cabinet members for appointment to  the president of the Republic tomorrow. Furthermore, transfer  of authority between the outgoing and incoming ministers is  supposed to take place on 30 June. The first cabinet meeting,  which will be held on 1 July, will mainly examine the prime  minister's policy speech.</p>

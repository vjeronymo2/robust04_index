Zargana, 33, who trained as a dentist but turned to comedy,  gained prominence for his satirical jokes aimed at the former  socialist regime.    First arrested briefly as a political dissident in late  1988,  he went to jail for the second time in 1990 while helping his  mother in her campaign for the May general elections that year.    Neighbors who spoke to Zargana on Friday said he had been  delivered to his parents' home by military intelligence  personnel just before noon.    He was the latest political prisoner released by the  military  junta, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council  (SLORC), which has set free more than 2,000 dissidents in the  past two years.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Musawi mourners vow revenge: Westerners advised to leave Beirut as kidnap threat increases WESTERN embassies in Beirut yesterday advised the few hundred remaining expatriates to leave the city in case the Israeli killing of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader, prompted renewed attempts by his supporters to kidnap westerners. Lebanese police said they had tightened security at western embassies and other foreign interests in Beirut. However, Iran said it expected the kidnappers holding two German hostages to respond 'reasonably'. The security warning came as thousands of Lebanese Shia Moslems thronged the streets of south Beirut vowing revenge against Israel and the US for Sunday's attack on the motorcade of Mr Musawi in which his wife, six-year-old son and five bodyguards also died. 'Oh God, wipe Israel and America out of existence,' chanted an estimated 50,000-strong crowd which turned out, led by Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah the spiritual leader of Hizbollah, to mourn the death of Sheikh Musawi, secretary-general of the organisation. Mr Musawi's deputy, Mr Naeem Qassem, told the rally: 'Do you think, enemy of God (Israel), that you have won? No, we are waiting for you ..the earth will shake beneath your feet.' In southern Lebanon, Hizbollah gunners launched a wave of rocket and artillery attacks on the 'security zone' north of the Israeli border occupied by Israeli troops and their local militia allies. Some rockets fell harmlessly into Israel itself. Israeli forces responded with artillery barrages. Lebanese army units were also reported to have been involved in the artillery exchanges in southern Lebanon, a rare and potentially dangerous direct confrontation with Israeli forces. The Lebanese government, although at odds with Hizbollah which defies its authority, called on the United Nations Security Council to discuss the killing of Sheikh Musawi. The European Community yesterday supported the US call for all parties to show restraint, reflecting fears that the increase in violence could threaten the Middle East peace talks next week. It also called for a stronger European role in the peace process. In a statement EC foreign ministers meeting in Lisbon urged 'all parties to refrain from taking any action which could endanger the (current peace) negotiations or undermine the establishment of a climate of confidence, including the pursuit of the current settlement policy'. The Israeli government said it would go ahead with the Washington talks, a position already confirmed by Syria and Lebanon. The other parties involved, Jordan and the Palestinians, have given no indication that they will reverse earlier decisions to attend. But in a further complication Israel confirmed it had arrested two men added by the Palestinians to their delegation for the peace talks. The Musawi attack followed the killing of three soldiers in Israel by Palestinians on Friday and two retaliatory Israeli air raids on Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in which at least four people died. The attack on Mr Musawi was greeted by the Israeli government and defence establishment as a timely re-assertion of the army's effectiveness. Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Postal ballot results backfire on government Postal strike ballots, made compulsory by the government on September 1, have produced a high voting turnout among workers and have normally given the leadership of the union involved the mandates for the industrial action they have sought, according to the independent Electoral Reform Ballot Services. The findings will come as a blow to ministers who believed unions would find it hard to secure high turnouts and support for strikes with the introduction of compulsory postal ballots. ERBS said that in the first 120 ballots it held for unions after the new legal requirement came into force, an average of 73.1 per cent of union members participated. 'This is a remarkably high turnout,' said Mr Owen Thomas of ERBS yesterday. Before this year's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, unions had been required by law since 1988 to hold workplace ballots of members. In the past, only a few trade unions held postal ballots for industrial action - rather than for elections of officials - and the turnout in these ballots tended to be low - often less than 30 per cent. 'The unions are clearly using the postal ballots as a valuable negotiating technique in their bargaining with employers,' said Dr Bob Simpson, of the LSE's centre for economic performance, last night. 'The figures show that they have been surprisingly quick to accommodate the latest legal changes which many thought they would have difficulty dealing with.' In as many as 78 per cent of the postal strike ballots the majority of trade union members participating backed their union's call for action. In 62 cases (51.7 per cent) the union sought a mandate for strike action only and in only seven cases (5.8 per cent) for action short of a stoppage. Few of the ballots actually led to strikes. Unions and employers appear to be taking advantage of the new statutory seven-day period of notice between the ballot result and start of the industrial action to resolve their differ-ences. The strike ballots have been held in most of Britain's main unions, including the TGWU and GMB general unions, the AEEU engineering union, the MSF technicians union, the UCATT construction union and the RMT transport union.</p>

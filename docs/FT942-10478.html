			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (6): The conditions get tougher - Aid donors find themselves in an uncomfortable role Six months after the restoration of fast-disbursing aid, Kenya's donors face an awkward dilemma. Most are torn between the wish to continue supporting finance minister Musalia Mudavadi's economic reforms and growing alarm at Kenya's deteriorating political environment. A mid-year review of Kenya's overall progress is likely to be as difficult as a Solomonic judgment. If the assessment leans too heavily on the government's political shortcomings, anti-reformers could have fresh ammunition to undermine Mr Mudavadi and his programme. Kenya's aid partners, however, have come to believe that the harassment and incarceration of opposition politicians, ethnic cleansing in the Rift Valley, and the government's crackdown on the press are not random occurrences, but the actions of a regime which has not shed its authoritarian instincts despite the formal trappings of democracy. Since November 1991 - when donors suspended about one-quarter of Kenya's aid flows, in protest against official corruption and human rights abuses - the policy linking aid levels to good government has transformed the donor community into the final arbiters of Kenya's political and economic progress. It is an uncomfortable role. The government of Kenya clearly regards some aid conditions as an infringement of its sovereignty, while opposition parties think foreign aid can and should be used as a lever to extract more political reforms. It seemed no accident that President Daniel arap Moi legalised opposition parties only days after the suspension of balance-of-payments aid in November 1991. But having failed to dislodge President Moi from power in the 1992 elections, the opposition felt betrayed when donors restored balance-of-payments aid in November 1993. It was not, however, an unqualified victory for the Kanu government. Donors pledged Dollars 850m for 1994 - significantly below aid levels prevalent before the 1991 freeze - and the money is likely to be disbursed by drip-feed as the list of conditions gets longer. Donors expressed cautious support for Mr Mudavadi's reforms, but said they wanted to see a consistent record before considering more handouts. They also told officials the government should prosecute corruption cases. 'The government clearly expected a bigger trade-off from adopting a multi-party system and toeing the IMF and World Bank line,' says one ambassador in Nairobi. 'The restoration of aid did little to ease the confrontational mind set between Kenya and its aid partners.' Some donors feel it is time to rethink the relationship. Japan, Kenya's largest bilateral donor, is destined to play a greater role in the shaping of aid policy. Tokyo's international aid charter shares the same goals as western donors - market-based economic reforms, the respect for democracy and human rights, good government - but its approach to reform appears to be infused with the millennial patience of the east. 'We understand the process of co-ordinating political and economic reforms can be difficult and complicated,' says Masahiko Horie, first secretary at the Japanese embassy in Nairobi. 'There are no absolute yardsticks. We must look at the whole process and support positive trends.' Japan was the first country to resume fast-disbursing balance-of-payments aid to Kenya last year. It released Dollars 77m in October, on the eve of the donor consultative group meeting in Paris. The unilateral action, which melted the donors' two-year aid freeze, sent a strong signal of support to the Kenyan government and effectively set the tone for the Paris discussions. Mr Horie says Japan acted with the knowledge and approval of fellow donors. It has not, however, been plain sailing for the Kenyan government since then. In February, Britain's Overseas Development Agency cancelled a Pounds 12m grant for forestry conservation after failing to receive assurances from the Kenyan government that it would end the illegal allocation of protected forest areas to members of the ruling party and their acolytes. 'What we are looking for,' says Baroness Lynda Chalker, Britain's overseas development minister, 'is effective action to improve open and accountable government, including dealing with corruption, reducing tribal tensions, strengthening law and order . . . and enhancing press freedom. These remain the benchmarks which we shall be employing when we come to review progress.' Britain is not alone in cutting back aid. Denmark, aid partners since Kenya's independence, and the US, have curtailed projects citing increasing co-operation problems with Kenyan authorities. Even the World Bank will only present one new Dollars 22m project to its board this year. Norway, which renewed diplomatic ties in February after a three-year break, has no plans to resume financial assistance. 'We have told Kenya that when we need to speak out, we will do so forcefully,' says Arman Aardal, the Norwegian ambassador. Kenya broke off relations with Norway in 1990 over Oslo's criticism of the detention and trial of Koigi wa Wamwere, a prominent dissident. Soon after the reopening of the Norwegian embassy in Nairobi, Mr Wamwere was again being dragged before the courts. The irony has escaped few Kenyans.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Pressure mounts on Taiwan over tariffs The US last week formally asked Taiwan to lower tariffs on 2,800 products and to reduce its protection for other products, before being accepted into membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, tabled the list of US demands with Gatt a week after the Asian-Pacific summit, where the US made no visible gains with China on trade. In fact, determined wooing of Taiwan's rival by President Bill Clinton seemed to yield little in the political and military facets of the bilateral relationship. Mr Kantor asserted that the tabling 'should advance the accession process in Geneva' for Taiwan. China has made known it will not tolerate Taiwan's acceptance into Gatt before its own. The US wish-list for Taiwan was formulated after 'substantial consultation with the broad range of US private sector and Congressional interests,' who represent companies hoping to sell into the Taiwanese market. It seeks a reduction in tariff peaks, commitments to maintain current low tariff levels, and the elimination of import bans, quotas and other non-tariff restrictions - mostly on farm products - which Gatt prohibits. US exports to Taiwan are expected to reach Dollars 16.9bn by the end of this year. According to the US trade agency, fulfilment of the US request alone would slice the average tariff in Taiwan by more than half and open major new areas of the market to US goods. Other Gatt members are expected to make similar requests of Taiwan over the next several months. A Gatt working party established to move Taiwan into the global trading club has complained about restrictive market access practices and special bilateral deals with the US. It raised questions about Taiwan's allegedly discriminatory import tariff structure, burdensome import licensing requirements, intellectual property violations, discriminatory government procurement practices and investment barriers in the services sector. Taiwanese trade officials say their country has made progress in reducing protection. Its nominal industrial tariff was reduced from 24.4 per cent in 1986 to 6.5 per cent in 1992. Tariffs for farm goods were reduced from 34.8 per cent to 21.6 per cent. Mr Kantor's office said it expected negotiations with Taiwan 'on the full range of subject areas such as services and intellectual property which will be within the Gatt's purview as a result of the Uruguay Round'. After years of knocking at the door, Gatt accepted Taiwan's request for negotiations for membership in September 1992. Taiwan offered to join as a developed nation but said 'certain industries' would still require protection. In the negotiations, it is expected to reduce its tariff and other import barriers to the same level of protection maintained by other developed economies and to match concessions offered by current Gatt members in the Uruguay Round. Besides China and Taiwan, Gatt is now considering 13 such membership applications.</p>

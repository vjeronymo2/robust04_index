			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Police plead not guilty to terror charges - Criticism of the City force THE BLUE lamp above the door of Wood Street Police station lends a Dock Green atmosphere to the City police operational centre. The impression is enhanced by the friendly village-bobby approach of the desk officers inside. The desk is bereft of the toughened-glass cell-like fittings more readily associated with the offices of the Metropolitan Police. In character the two forces are chalk and cheese, and while the old parochialism of the City force is not what it once was - its last four Commissioners came from the Met - there is a scarcely veiled antipathy towards each other. Met officers will jokingly refer to their City counterparts as 'door openers' because of the number of ceremonial duties demanded in the Square Mile. The Bishopsgate bomb has made that charge of amateurism a political issue. And the City police are hard pressed to respond. Their normal defence is their ability to tackle fraud, not terrorism. The Company Fraud Department, which works closely with the Serious Fraud Office, is the force's showcase squad. In his foreword to the force's last annual report Mr Owen Kelly, the commissioner, put forward unconventional though forceful argument that its performance provided value for money. Presenting a balance sheet for the City of London force, and excluding the frauds in the Maxwell Group and at Bank of Credit and Commerce International, he said the Company Fraud Department recovered or prevented the loss of Pounds 936.1m. A further Pounds 11m 'income' could be added from other sources such as fixed penalty fines, giving a total of Pounds 947.1m. This compared with the force's estimated spend of Pounds 47.4m in the 1991-92 financial year. The report was compiled before the Baltic Exchange bomb and last weekend's Bishopsgate blast which, using the profit/loss analogy, would have wiped the smile off the balance sheet. Met officers recognise City police skills at fraud investigation but few seem willing to give any further praise. That now makes the force vulnerable. One Metropolitan fraud squad detective said that he regarded the City of London as a 'commercial police force'. He said: 'In the Met it's a seven-day police operation, but the City sometimes hasn't got cover at weekends. The City hasn't got the capacity for dealing with terrorism.' Arguments over the future of the City of London Police have led to renewed debate over whether it should be amalgamated into another force  - this is one possible area of discussion under the current Home Office review of the organisation of forces in England and Wales. At least twice in its history the City force has found itself the target of amalagamation plans with other forces. On both occasions it has been protected by its fairy godmother, the Corporation of London. The City force said: 'Ever since we first started there has been talk of amalgamation, but we are still here 150 years later.' City police believe strongly that the bomb last weekend has unfairly focused criticism on their operations, when they are in fact dependent on the intelligence and logistical back-up provided by others. 'Before you blame us, you have to ask how it was allowed to get into our area in the first place,' one City police source said. This defensive position is based on the belief that an IRA operation that was well under way when a lorry was stolen in Staffordshire on March 20 should have been detected not just by M15 but also by several other constabularies before it reach its final parking place in Bishopsgate. That argument has some force but it does not answer the charge that having one extra small force, with little anti-terrorist expertise, compounds the problems of communication of intelligence in a structure already unwieldy because of the large number of constabularies. If the Corporation of London wants to defend its police force it will need more than value-for-money arguments.</p>

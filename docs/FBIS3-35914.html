"If Armenia pledges to withdraw its forces from the  territory  of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan, in its turn, will be ready to  immediately get down to talks and sign the (ceasefire)  agreement", Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov told  reporters after meeting Russian envoy mediating the settlement  in Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov on Monday.    "It is profitable for Azerbaijan to sign the ceasefire  agreement --whether short or long-term. The republic continues  to adhere to the position of a political and peaceful settlement  of the conflict", Gasanov said, but hinted, however, that the  possibility is vague because, according to him, the Armenian  position had not changed considerably and remains tough.    "Armenia continues to try and talk to Azerbaijan from  positions of force", Gasanov stressed.    Kazimirov, who had visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh,  agreed that the positions of both sides remain tough and urged  them to be "more flexible".    "We would like to see more flexibility because the interests  of the peoples whose blood is shed in the senseless conflict  demand an early end to the bloodshed", Kazimirov said adding  that Russia is ready to render any assistance in mediating a  ceasefire.    He expressed hope that an agreement on a ceasefire beginning  from this night will be reached and will become the first step  towards a complete end to hostilities.    The complete end to combat activities should be "accompanied  by the pullout of forces from seized territories, by the  restoration of transport and energy-transmitting communications,  by a return of refugees", Kazimirov said.    He complained that the warring sides "underestimate the  necessity of an early end to hostilities" without which,  according to him, it is impossible to efficiently settle the  conflict.    Advantages in the military situation may go from one side to  another while "people are paying for the calculations of  political leaders", the Russian mediator said.    Both Gasanov and Kazimirov refused to say whether they had  achieved any concrete results.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: US goodwill write-off hits Amec INTERIM pre-tax profits at Amec, the UK construction, engineering and property company, slipped from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 9.1m despite a modest increase at the operating level. Operating profits were ahead at Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.3m) but Amec's pre-tax profits were reduced by the write-off of Pounds 2.2m of goodwill on US businesses sold and the group paid Pounds 1.9m interest against Pounds 300,000 interest received last year. The board cut the interim dividend to 1.5p (2p) to reflect more closely the group's split on earnings between interim and final results. It expects at least to maintain last year's 3p total at the year end, 'unless conditions deteriorate significantly.' Turnover rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.04bn). Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: 'Turnover was slightly higher than last year but there were very, very significant variations in the type of work carried out and its geographical location.' The company's order book was down 7 per cent overall at the half way stage. Orders had grown, however, in oil, gas and petrochemical activities, matched by progress in heavy electrical and mechanical engineering. Sir Alan added: 'Steady growth in construction in mainland Europe, particularly in Germany and in south-east Asia has partially offset significant reductions in our UK building and business services work.' Gearing at June 30 was 15 per cent (2 per cent). Contracting, 'substantially' financed by subcontractors and materials suppliers, improved turnover to Pounds 346.3m (Pounds 330.9m) giving profits virtually flat at Pounds 5.5m. Mechanical and electrical engineering, including process and engineering, showed increased activity at Pounds 741.9m (Pounds 680.4m) giving profits of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.8m) but the business has an in-built lag between labour costs and payments. The housing and property business improved sales to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 40.5m), but losses deepened to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 2.1m). COMMENT Amec has tackled the difficult business cycle in contracting by diversifying its work in terms of both types of project and geography and it believes its problems in some overseas operations are behind it. Its workload is skewed more now towards the resilient process and energy sectors and away from lacklustre contracting. The former has been a cash drain but this should turn around in the second half. Amec expects to be ungeared at the year end as payments come in. Meanwhile falling orders indicate the company's restraint in bidding for unprofitable work. Full year pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 25m giving fully diluted earnings of 7.8p and a prospective multiple of 12. This looks cheap compared with other companies in the sector but they have bigger exposure than Amec to the housing recovery.</p>

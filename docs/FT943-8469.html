			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drivers are not diverted by motorway tolls Sir, One despairs of the intelligence of members of the 'Tory-dominated' Commons transport committee ('Tories attack motorway toll plans', August 13) if they delude themselves that 20 to 30 per cent of motorists in the UK would divert from motorways if tolls were charged. Motorway charges have been in force in France, Spain, Italy and other countries since the inception. In Germany, where charges are likely to be introduced soon, the idea of motorists shunning the autobahns is held to be absurd. If this committee wants some hard evidence, let it look at Switzerland where charges were introduced in the 1980s after years of toll-free use. A simple windscreen sticker costing SFr30 (Pounds 15) annually and available at all garages and post offices does the trick, with an on-the-spot fine as deterrent if you are caught using the motorways without one. No Swiss driver in his or her right mind diverts to 'local roads', and I am sure the British motorist is equally capable of calculating cost versus convenience. Such a system in the UK would yield ample funds for whatever purpose. As for the committee's rather inane suggestion of 'increasing fuel' duties instead, the extra tax would merely disappear in the Treasury maw and add yet another turn of the screw to the government's unpopularity.

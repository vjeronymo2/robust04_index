			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Drug shares help push Dow to another record Wall Street SHARP RISES on overseas markets and heavy buying of drug shares pushed US equity markets further into record territory yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing above 3,600 for the first time, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow, which ended at an all-time high on Tuesday, was up a further 17.88 at 3,604.86, but some way below its peak for the day of 3,617.71. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 2.91 to 456.04, but it remained just shy of its record close of 456.33. The American SE composite added 3.97 at 446.63 and the Nasdaq composite was up 3.82 at 734.83, both record peaks. Trading volume on the New York SE was heavy at 312.9m shares. Stronger overseas markets set the tone for an upbeat opening to US trading. Markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris staged big rallies before New York started trading, and analysts were not surprised when US equities picked up where European stocks had left off. The US markets were also aided by further gains in Treasury prices. The benchmark 30-year government issue yesterday rose almost three-quarters of a point, lowering the yield to 6.255 per cent, the lowest it has been since the Treasury began selling 30-year bonds in 1977. Falling yields are bullish for stocks because they lower the cost of capital for US companies, and because they make equities look a more attractive alternative to investors seeking high yields. Pharmaceutical issues were in the vanguard of the markets' rise. Analysts said the sector is now looking oversold, and luring investors looking for bargain buys. Merck rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Pfizer Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 , Schering-Plough Dollars 2 to Dollars 63, Glaxo Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 and John-son &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40, all on heavy buying. Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 in volume of 3.1m shares after the company, which recently announced changes among its senior management, unveiled plans to cut 10,000 jobs and boost its cash flow to Dollars 2.8bn by the end of 1995. Consumer products shares were in demand. Procter &amp; Gamble gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 , Philip Morris Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 1/8 , RJR Nabisco Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 5 1/4 and American Brands Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 5/8 . Airline issues moved against the broader trend, weakening on concern about the earnings outlook for the sector. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 , UAL Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 144 1/2 , Delta Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 3/8 and USAir Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were mixed, with Borland International up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 3/4 and Intel Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 65 1/2 but Microsoft unchanged at Dollars 77 1/4 . Canada TORONTO stock prices closed solidly higher in heavy trading as the market shrugged off worries about a weak Canadian dollar. The TSE 300 index rose 36.8 to 4,069.3 and advancing issues outnumbered declines by 471 to 273. Volume was 74.9m shares. Some observers are concerned about the lower Canadian dollar pushing up short-term interest rates, threatening to further stifle an already weak economic recovery. However, a lower exchange rate compared with the US currency is seen as beneficial to the large number of Canadian companies with exports to the US or whose products are priced in US dollars.</p>

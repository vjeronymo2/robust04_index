			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Philip Morris extends price cut to premium cigarettes PHILIP Morris, which shocked the US tobacco industry in April by temporarily slashing the price of its Marlboro cigarettes, yesterday made the 20 per cent price cut permanent and extended it to other premium brands, including Virginia Slims and Benson &amp; Hedges. The move confirms that the price of Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette in the US, was out of line with cheap discount products before the cut on April 2, known as 'Marlboro Friday'. Philip Morris said that the price cut had reversed Marlboro's slide in market share. Its US tobacco profits have, however, been hit hard by the cuts. The company, which also makes food and drink products, yesterday announced second quarter earnings of Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m), down 22.2 per cent. The results and its price action had been expected on Wall Street and its shares closed up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 1/2 . The discount sector, which consists of cheap branded goods and unbranded generic cigarettes, has grown rapidly in recent years at the expense of premium brands and now accounts for 40 per cent of the US market. Philip Morris, one of the largest companies in the discount market, also announced pricing changes in this area. It said it would push up the price of its most heavily discounted brands and move less heavily discounted brands down to that level, creating a two-tier price structure rather than the present three tiers. None of the cuts affects markets outside the US. Other manufacturers seem bound to follow the premium price cuts but may not raise the price of deeply discounted brands. RJ Reynolds, the other leading US tobacco company, said it would match Philip Morris' action at both ends of the market. Philip Morris said Marlboro's market share, which bottomed out at less than 22 per cent in March after eight months of decline, had risen to 22.6 per cent in May, according to Nielsen, the market research company. Its own data suggested the July share might rise to 24 per cent. Growth had been coming at the expense of both premium brands and discount cigarettes. Philip Morris added that the price changes would not affect the forecast made in April of operating earnings from its US tobacco business falling by as much as 40 per cent this year.

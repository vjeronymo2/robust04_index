			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Income Distribution): Tory legacy of gains in disposable income - Tax and Benefit Changes Since 1987 Many of the most radical changes to the tax and social security system implemented by the Conservative government during its 13 years in power have occurred during the current parliament. Since 1987 the top rate of income tax has fallen from 60 per cent to 40 per cent and the basic rate from 27 per cent to 25 per cent. In 1990 the joint taxation of husband and wife was replaced by a system of independent taxation. National insurance contributions have been reformed and reduced. VAT has risen from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Domestic rates have been replaced by the community charge. On the benefit side, the social security reforms of 1988 were presented as the most far-reaching supplementary benefit, family credit replaced family income supplement, while housing benefit was reformed and its scope reduced. Given such an array of changes it is extraordinarily difficult to gain a clear idea of what their combined effect has been. Hence we use the IFS Tax and Benefit Model to assess that impact. The model is a computer program which uses a large dataset containing information on 7,000 households representative of the population as a whole. Given this information, the model allows a comparison to be made between the effects of any two tax and benefit systems on the population. Here we compare the effect of the system as it stood in April 1987 with that which followed the 1991 Budget. (We include in the latter system the child benefit increases which occurred in October of 1991). The systems are made comparable by uprating the benefit rates and allowances of the 1987 system by the RPI to 1991 prices. The two figures show the results of this comparison. Figure 3 shows the proportions of households of particular types gaining and losing, along with the average gain/loss among households of these types. Households are divided according to the age of the head, their employment status, marital status, and the number of children. Thus, we have classified all households headed by somebody over state pensionable age as pensioners, any others not in work are placed in the non-working categories, which thus include groups such as students and the disabled, not just the unemployed. The other categories are self-explanatory, except that all households containing more than one family (as defined for benefit purposes) are lumped together in multiple family household categories. Overall, 62 per cent of the population gained from the changes, 27 per cent lost, and 11 per cent were unaffected (affected by less than Pounds 1 per week either way). However, the distribution of gainers and losers by family type is uneven. Only 6 per cent of two-earner couples without children lost from the changes, with 87 per cent gaining, while 63 per cent of the single out of work lost and 31 per cent gained. More pensioners gained than lost, with married pensioners doing rather better than single pensioners. The proportion gaining and losing is reflected to some extent in the average gains/losses by household type. Remember, though, that average gains or losses can be greatly influenced by a few people gaining or losing a large amount. The average gain for the population is about Pounds 350 per year, with the biggest gains amoung two-earner couples, but small net losses among some of those not in work. Before commenting further on these figures it is useful also to look at the results by income range. The combination of information allows a better explanation of what has actually happened. Figure 4 shows the same results as before but by gross income rather than by family type. The income measure we use is total income before state benefits have been received or taxes have been paid. Hence a large proportion of our sample is in the under Pounds 500 per year category, these being people  - largely pensioners and the unemployed - whose only source of income is social security. The results are quite striking. The poorest group lost an average of Pounds 150 per year as a result of changes over the period, with about two-thirds of the group losing and only about one fifth gaining. As original income increases, both the proportion of gainers and the size of average gains increase. Indeed, only in our lowest income group are there more losers than gainers, and average gains of Pounds 50 per year start in the Pounds 2,600-Pounds 5,200 range. The population average gain is not reached until the Pounds 15,600-Pounds 20,800 per week range is reached. Of the small group with incomes of more than Pounds 50,000 a year, more than 95 per cent are gaining, with an average gain of about Pounds 7,000 a year. These results are clearly consistent with those derived by family type, where we saw the poorest groups - the unemployed and pensioners - doing badly and the richest groups, those in work, doing best. The single most important reason for the gains among the employed and the rich has been the reduction in income tax, with the biggest gains accruing to higher rate taxpayers. They enjoyed the maximum gain from the 2 per cent fall in the basic rate of tax as well as benefiting from the abolition of tax rates over 40 per cent. Most people in employment also benefited from the reforms to the National Insurance system implemented in the 1989 Budget. These had the effect that employees no longer had to pay their full rate of national insurance on earnings under the lower earnings limit, but rather a lower rate of 2 per cent. One other important reform to the income tax system - the change to independent taxation - affected relatively few people, but the impact on some of those who were affected was considerable. Among single-earner couples those where just the wife was working lost from the change as the total level of allowances for this group fell by the amount of a single personal allowance. On the other hand, where the wife had a significant amount of unearned income there were gains. Under the old system of joint taxation the investment income of a married woman was taxed as if it belonged to her husband. Under independent taxation married women can use their own personal tax allowance to set against both earned and unearned income. As the charts make clear there were some losers both among the employed and those on high incomes. These resulted largely from the increase in VAT in last year's Budget, but also reflect the restriction of mortgage interest relief to the basic rate and the continuing fall in the real value of the ceiling for mortgage interest relief, which has remained at Pounds 30,000 since 1983. Some poorer employees will also have lost out as a result of the reforms to the housing benefit system which reduced its generosity. This change was even more important to pensioners, who were the biggest losers from the reform. In particular many fell foul of the newly imposed capital limit. Housing benefit entitlement is now reduced for anybody with savings of more than Pounds 8,000 and stopped entirely for those with more than Pounds 16,000 in savings. The fact that pensioner couples did better than single pensioners is a straightforward reflection of the higher average incomes of married pensioners who were thus more likely to gain from income tax cuts and less likely to lose from housing benefit changes. Overall the groups with the largest average loss and most losers were the single without work and those with little or no non-state income generally. Among the single people not in work two groups did particularly badly from policy changes over the period. The first were single unemployed under the age of 25 living away from the parental home and dependent on supplementary benefit, now income support. The new income support benefit has a special low rate for under 25-year-olds, and so the transition from supplementary benefit to income support led to a straightforward fall in the income of this group. Second, students have suffered very large falls in their entitlements to state benefits recently. In particular most students are no longer entitled to claim income support or housing benefit at all, leading in some cases to quite substantial losses. In 1988 social security reforms were specifically intended to target more help on poor families with children both through the income support and family credit benefits. This shows up in our figures to some extent. While most non-working couples without children lost over the period, rather fewer than half of those with children lost. Among single parents there were some quite substantial gainers leading to a gain on average despite nearly half losing some income. Finally, among single earner couples those with children did rather better than those without, partly as a result of the introduction of family credit which is considerably more generous than the old family income support. Other changes brought in with the 1988 reforms which affected many on income support were the ending of 100 per cent rebates for rates payments and the ending of the automatic payment of water rates. Though the benefits were intended to be at such a level as to compensate people on average for this change many were effectively not compensated in full. This change in the benefit regime in fact, had a greater impact on those with very low incomes than did the actual change from rates to the community charge. Overall, the effect of tax and benefit changes since 1987 has been to increase the disposable income of more than 60 per cent of the population and reduce that of about a quarter of households. But the losses are concentrated in the lower reaches of the income distribution and among those not in work. The benefit reforms are largely responsible for this. On the other hand, those in work or in the middle and higher income ranges have seen gains on average. The biggest gains are concentrated among the richest. These gains are a direct effect of income tax and national insurance reductions. Articles and charts prepared for the FT by Steven Webb and Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Clinton appoints London envoy President Bill Clinton yesterday named retired Admiral William Crowe, 69, to be the next ambassador in London in succession to Mr Raymond Seitz, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The choice of Admiral Crowe - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the US military high command, from 1985-89 - has been an open secret. He earned a particular place in Mr Clinton's affection early in the 1992 presidential campaign. In the first public endorsement by a top ranking active or former officer, he said Mr Clinton's avoidance of military service at the time of the Vietnam War did not render him unfit to be president. He declined offers from President Clinton to run the Central Iintelligence Agency and be ambassador to Moscow, but has been serving as chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Admiral Crowe lived in London for six months in 1965 while researching his doctorate on the Royal Navy and was a frequent visitor from 1980 to 1983, when he was Nato commander in southern Europe.</p>

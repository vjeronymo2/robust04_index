			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] South Africa and Zimbabwe have laid the foundations  for the first major cooperation agreement between the two  countries in 14 years. The minister of justice and of defense,  Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterparts, Mr. Emmerson  Mnangagwa and Mr. Dumiso Dabengwa [name as heard], said after  talks in Harare that a working committee had been established to  oversee an exchange of information on matters such as the  administration of justice, the combating of organized crime, and  the resumption of an extradition treaty. The imprisonment in  Zimbabwe of three South Africa agents had also been discussed,  but Mr. Mnangagwa merely said that the men would be freed at an  appropriate time. The men were sentenced to life imprisonment  for bombing an ANC [African National Congress] house in 1988.</p>

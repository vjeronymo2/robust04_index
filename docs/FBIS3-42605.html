			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valter Shoniya, Russian ambassador to </F> Azerbaijan, by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA staff correspondent Elmira  Akhundova; place and date not given: "`I Did Not Receive  Instructions on Whom To Place My Bets' Says Valter Shoniya,  Russian Ambassador to Azerbaijan"]    [Text]    [Akhundova] Valter Aleksandrovich, how would you evaluate  the  current status of bilateral relations between Azerbaijan and  Russia?    [Shoniya] Recently, these relations have undergone not just  substantial, but we might say fundamental changes. Mutual  alienation, which at times prompted us to look at each other as  virtual enemies, has disappeared. As early as October 1992,  Azerbaijan and Russia signed a treaty that laid the legal  foundation for relations of friendship and cooperation between  the two sovereign states. However, it soon turned out that,  putting it bluntly, they took this step for the sake of  appearances. At present, the new Government of Azerbaijan is  having to scrupulously restore everything that was so quickly  and "expertly" destroyed at the previous stage.    [Akhundova] Do you blame only the Azeri side for severing  relations?    [Shoniya] Perhaps some of the blame also devolves on Russia.  However, there is a reason why they say: "Love cannot be  compelled." The Russian leadership heard nothing but rebukes  from the lips of the former leaders of Azerbaijan--this was  still the same Soviet empire, it wanted yet again to "swallow  up" Azerbaijan, strip it of its independence, and so on, and so  forth. As I observed how anti-Russian sentiment was fueled in  the society, I became convinced at the same time that this  sentiment did not reflect public opinion. In this regard, a trip  to Agdam shortly before its occupation became a particular  revelation for me. As I socialized with common Azeris, I  understood that these people have a very good attitude toward  Russia and Russians. At the end of 1992 and the beginning of  1993, I understood that some kind of change was coming.    [Akhundova] Leaders of the People's Front have a different  point of view on this. They believe that in June 1993, a quite  commonplace coup d'etat occurred in which the hand of Moscow  clearly shines through.    [Shoniya] This is absolutely absurd. Russia strictly adhered  to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of  Azerbaijan. I speak in all sincerity: personally, I did not  receive any instructions to support someone, to place my bets on  someone, etc.    [Akhundova] Recently, representatives of the opposition have  written that the admission of Azerbaijan to the CIS has failed  to produce the desired results. The war in Karabakh goes on and,  allegedly, will go on until Azerbaijan accepts all conditions  set by Russia, the main condition being for Russian troops to  return to the original lines in Azerbaijan.    [Shoniya] Nobody ever set such conditions for Azerbaijan  when  it joined the CIS. Besides, what kind of raising of the issue is  this: we joined the CIS, but this accomplished nothing for us.  Allow me to ask: What did the policy of the previous authorities  accomplish for Azerbaijan--a policy of alienation from Russia,  from other republics of the Commonwealth? Strained relations  developed even between Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Did this  policy accomplish anything for the people of Azerbaijan?    [Akhundova] Do you believe that the introduction of Russian  troops to the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict under the  aegis of peacekeeping forces could play a positive role?    [Shoniya] Russia will assume the burden of responsibility if  the two sides ask it to. That is, if you want assistance we will  provide it; if you do not want it, we are not going to impose  ourselves; you sort it out yourselves. At times, we hear  absolutely absurd assertions: Since the issue is not being  resolved, it means that Russia is getting in the way in order to  allegedly force Azerbaijan to make concessions. I beg your  pardon, but it was Azeri troops that were defeated in Karabakh,  and not Russia. The myth about military assistance allegedly  being provided by Russia to Armenia is by now obvious to all. As  far as the so-called "wild" assistance from mercenary  adventurers is concerned, we are aware of the facts: Russians  have also taken part in combat operations on the Azeri side.    [Akhundova] A few words about the most acute problems of the  Russian-speaking population....    [Shoniya] The seizure of apartments is one of the "painful"  problems of the Russian-speaking population of the republic on  which I indeed work thoroughly. A person leaves home for an hour  or two, but when he returns he finds his apartment taken. In all  of this, it is extremely difficult to evict those who have  seized someone else's living space. Local authorities do  nothing, make excuses, and some hide behind the refugee problem,  which is altogether not noble. Refugees are the most pressing  problem in Azerbaijan. However, it will not be solved by  replacing one set of refugees with another. Numerous apartment  seizures inflame and destabilize the situation in the republic.  I understand that the rights of not just the Russian-speaking  but also the indigenous population are being infringed upon. Can  you imagine that Azeris sometimes approach me with complaints  about the arbitrariness of the authorities? However, when  interests of the Russian-speaking population are affected this  assumes a different coloring, and a problem of daily life is  frequently elevated to the level of an interethnic problem.    [Akhundova] You maintain continuous contacts with the  Russian-speaking citizens of Azerbaijan. What is their mood at  present?    [Shoniya] At a certain point, some kind of hopelessness  appeared in the community of Russian-speaking residents, hence  the mood of having their bags packed. Many left the republic  literally with tears in their eyes. Azerbaijan is their  motherland, the motherland of their fathers and grandfathers.  The people became very hopeful following the change in the  political situation in Azerbaijan. However, I am apprehensive  about the feeling of hopelessness reemerging if the authorities  fail to make timely and specific decisions concerning specific  issues.    On occasion, the powers that be openly tell the people whose  apartments have been seized: We will help to have your living  space vacated, but for this or that amount of money. The people  throw up their hands, lose hope, and head for the embassy to  either file for citizenship or ask for assistance in leaving the  confines of the republic. Therefore, the main point at present  is to overcome the indifference and criminal negligence of local  authorities because at the level of the government we find full  support and mutual understanding.    [Akhundova] My last question: What are the prospects for  state-to-state relations between Azerbaijan and Russia in the  new year?    [Shoniya] They give us hope, but we will have to work very  much and very hard. I would not be telling the truth if I said  that I view state-to-state relations as divorced from the  Karabakh problem--this festering wound on the body of your  republic. The position of the Russian leadership is unambiguous:  it advocates most resolutely the unconditional and unqualified  return of all the seized territory. As far as Nagorno-Karabakh  is concerned, the parties should find a mutually acceptable way  to settle the conflict.</p>

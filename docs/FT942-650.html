			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity losses will not exceed Pounds 6m Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, expects to report net losses of no more than Pounds 6m, as a result of last week's appeal court judgment which ruled victims of poor financial advice were entitled to more compensation. The court ruled on Friday that the Investors Compensation Scheme was wrong in using its discretion to limit compensation to investors in home income plans. Trade Indemnity insured the scheme's liabilities in this matter on a policy underwritten in April 1990. Its 'Special Underwriting Unit', which wrote the policy, stopped writing new business in November 1991 and the policy expired at the end of March 1992. Gross losses, taking into account reinsurance recoveries, are expected to amount to Pounds 20m. An additional provision of up to Pounds 6m will be charged to the 1994 profit and loss account.</p>

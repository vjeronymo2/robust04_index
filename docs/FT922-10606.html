			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine signs oil and gas deals with Iran IN AN effort to wean itself away from dependence on Russian oil and gas newly-independent Ukraine is building on its partnership with Iran. A visit last weekend to Tehran by a high level Ukrainian delegation headed by Mr Leonid Kruvchek, the Ukrainian president, yielded two new commercial agreements that form part of a new Ukrainian orientation towards the Middle East. Mr Mykola Havrylenko, chairman of the Ukrainian state commission on geology and natural resources, signed a protocol permitting Ukrainian teams to explore for oil and natural gas in Iran and receive payment in kind. Although Ukraine has few oilfields of its own it has vast expertise in the oil industry learned on the Siberian steppes. Mr Havrylenko signed a separate agreement for the purchase of current metals from Iran. These deals are part of an agreement whereby Iran is to provide Ukraine with 4m tonnes of oil in 1992 in exchange for Ukrainian machine parts and building materials. Together with Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Iran have also previously agreed to build a pipeline from Iran to western Europe, passing through Ukraine, in which Ukrainian officials say Germany, France, and Italy have all expressed interest. The agreements are an implicit rebuke for Russia, which regularly threatens Ukraine with the prospect of paying world prices for Russian oil. Ukrainian authorities said that it was a pleasure to do business with Iran because unlike Ukraine's other partners it did not change prices every two months or alter contracts on the whim of its leaders. Mr Kravchuk shrugged off the suggestion that the West might be displeased with the developing relationship between Ukraine and Iran. 'We will no longer pursue the servile policies, instead we will pursue the policies of independence,' he said. Turkish oil officials, touring Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union with Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, said they were prepared in principle to buy crude from Uzbekistan in exchange for refined products, reports Reuter from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. 'We import Dollars 4bn to Dollars 4.5bn worth of crude a year, mostly from the Middle East,' said Mr Mustafa Aytac, general manager of the state-owned Petrol Ofisi. 'If the price is right, we will import from Uzbekistan.' But Mr Aytac said the problems of transporting the oil by rail to Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa and then by ship to the western Turkish port of Izmit might render a deal unworkable in the short term. He said he had offered to help set up a chain of petrol stations. Uzbek oil officials will visit Turkey next month to discuss the proposal in detail, he said.</p>

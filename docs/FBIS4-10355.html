			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN National Directorate Member Bayardo </F> Arce by Noel Irias; place and date not given; first four  paragraphs are BARRICADA introduction]    [Text] Bayardo Arce, a member of the National Directorate  of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], feels that  his party's priority must be to support the workers and  producers who have been hurt by the government's economic  policies.    Arce emphasized the need to support--and not for electoral  purposes--the agricultural and industrial producers "who do not  see their work yielding any profits," and who are harassed by  high bank interest rates and a fiscal policy that makes it  impossible for their products to compete in Central America.    The Sandinist leader said the FSLN should form alliances for  the 1996 elections in order to offer Nicaraguan society a  consensus political platform.    In speaking of the selection of candidates for the 1996  national elections, Arce said that "any member will have the  right to seek the nomination or to propose nonmembers of the  FSLN as candidates. No one should be disturbed by that or reject  those potential candidates or suggestions for candidates."    [Irias] What should the FSLN's priority be until 1996?    [Arce] Our top priority must be to stand at the side of  civil  society to defend its interests and solve its problems. We  cannot seek an election victory with fancy words and abstract  concepts.    Coffee growers and cattlemen now face severe credit problems  that threaten them with the loss of their properties. Business  and industry have serious problems because they can not even  compete in Central America because of the current fiscal policy;  and there is terrible and growing unemployment.    Our priority must be to stand in support with those sectors.  And in 1996 to offer alternatives so the nation can move  forward. It is a vital and strategic necessity for Sandinism to  win the 1996 elections.    Sandinism is the only political force in the history of  Nicaragua that has presented innovative alternatives. We broke  with the either/or dichotomy of liberals and conservatives and  gave Nicaraguan society a number of political and economic  options, multiple possiiblities for expressing itself.    If that program were to suffer a political setback in 1996,  it might well mean that an exclusionary and absolutist concept  from the past could be reinstated, in which only liberals and  conservatives could take part in the process.    That is the intention of liberals and conservatives when  they  say: "We have to get rid of Sandinism and other small political  groups." That would be catastrophic for the nation's future.    [Irias] Does that mean that the FSLN should stand in support  with those sectors in order to win the elections?    [Arce] Standing with sectors of society wins you the status  of a credible negotiator, but we are not doing that just to win  votes.    We defend the transformations which we brought about. When  we  support the rights of people who were helped by Agrarian Reform  or who were given urban lots, we do so for the principle of  economic democratization, although we know that many of those  people voted against the FSLN.    Because of that democratizing principle, we support the  privatization of businesses, with their workers to become the  owners of these businesses. If those workers worked to build  them and keep them going, it is just that they should have the  possibility of becoming the owners of those businesses.    In addition, we say that properties which were improperly  confiscated should be returned when that is possible, and when  it is not possible to return those properties, compensation must  be made.    [Irias] The FSLN's secretary general, Daniel Ortega, said  the  1996 election will be between Sandinism and Somozism. Do you  agree?    [Arce] When Daniel Ortegs says the 1996 election will be  between Somoza and Sandino, I think he means that the strength  shown by the PLC [expansion not given] in the Atlantic Coast  makes clear the danger of bringing back those exclusionary  concepts which were expressed in Somozism.    Arnoldo Aleman talks about getting rid of Sandinism and  calls  us SOB's, thieves, and murderers. Those are pejorative  descriptions to use in a democratic system. Still, I do not  believe that Aleman's group represents Somozism; Somozism was an  integrated economic and military force.    Accepting that idea would mean that the National Police and  the Army are acting in support of that exclusionary and  repressive philosophy. I would be very careful about saying that  the antagonism is between Sandinism and Somozism. Many of the  young people who will be voting in 1996 were not yet born when  the dictatorship was overthrown. They have no idea of what  Somozism was.    I think Daniel is warning people that the danger exists that  those elements of Somozism might be restored.    [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for the 1996  elections?    [Arce] I personally believe the FSLN should form alliances  to  run in the 1996 elections. We have to seek an alliance, and not  just in order to neutralize the danger of a restoration of  Somozism.    The polarization of the nation has reached such profound  levels--despite the attempts made to establish a philosophy of  reconcilation--that Nicaraguan society is still divided, wary,  and suspicious.    That is why it is so important to offer society a consensus  platform in which other political, economic, and social groups  will take part, no matter what their size, so that through the  alliance a truly national platform may be developed.    [Irias] What might be the mechanism for selecting  candidates?    [Arce] If you start from this idea, obviously the FSLN will  have to establish a mechanism to select suitable people and a  mechanism to round off those candidacies with candidates from  the other groups in the alliance.    We cannot go to the 1996 elections simply to win votes and  declare that we are winning. We have to do so with suitable  people who can really put this national program into practice,  candidates who are sensitive to the people.    [Irias] And how might the FSLN candidates be chosen?    [Arce] The present FSLN Statutes--and I do not think they  are  going to change--say that the Congress selects the candidates.  It has been proposed that the Extraordinary Congress in May  convene an Ordinary Congress to be held within the next two  years to select the FSLN candidates, as well as to handle other  matters.    I think that in this democratic process any member will have  the right to seek the nomination or to nominate someone else,  even someone not in the party, if that person has the right  qualities to meet the goals proposed.    No one should be disturbed by that or reject those potential  candidates or suggestions for candidates, much less sabotage the  choice, for that is unworthy of the quality we Sandinists should  have.    [Irias] What should the FSLN do to be ready for 1996?    [Arce] In 1996 we must first of all have become credible  negotiators speaking for the interests of the workers and the  poorest sectors of society, those who are now sunk in  hopelessness because of the current economic policy. We even  suggest giving priority attention to the campesinos.    In addition, we need to serve as representatives and  spokespersons for the nation's productive sectors, who see that  their hard work is not paying off.    In 1996 the FSLN needs to be positioned as the hope of  Nicaraguan society to move the nation forward in a realistic  manner.    No one in Sandinism thinks that the party can again try do  do  what we did in the government in the same way that we did it  before.    [Irias] How should the state be run?    [Arce] On government policy we state--and this is true for  the present time when we are not in the government and also for  when we are--that we are opposed to holding absolute power.    We want to promote social self-management, the role of civil  society's organizations as an active component with a role to  play in shaping the nation's destiny.    We also favor the decentralization of power through  municipal  governments. Putting the government in a balanced role as a  guide for the economy.    On relations with the United States, a decisive factor in  our  national situation, we seek a relationship of mutual respect, a  relationship that is not only a matter of words, but one in  harmony with the new international context, in which economic  rationales prevail.    [Irias] How do you conceive the new leadership body of the  FSLN?    [Arce] A new leadership organization needs to be created,  and  the National Directorate should disappear. That name creates a  distorted image in the minds of some party members, who think  about what it has meant during the past decade.    I believe a leadership organization needs to be established  with more people to bring together the experience of cadres who  have already held those responsibilities with other cadres who  have acquired both moral and political authority.    It would be wise for this leadership organization to have an  executive body with responsibility for handling different areas:  organization, training, finances, propaganda, international  relations, etc.    The Congress only elected the General Secretary and the  Treasurer. We do not have anyone who can be held accountable for  the other jobs. I think the new election should distribute  individual responsibilities so we can generate the collegial  style of operation which has been weakened during the past two  years.    I support the idea that the responsibility of the Secretary  General should be separate from the duties of the head of  government, especially as it may well be that our candidate for  president will not be from the Front.    [Irias] Do you hope to be elected a member of that executive  body?    [Arce] Of an executive body, no, I definitely have no desire  for that. I have already spent over 10 years doing that. On the  subject of the leadership organization, what I can tell you is  that I never tried to run or presented myself as a candidate for  membership of the National Directorate. I came in to fight for  "Patria Libre o Muerte" [Liberty or Death].    In 1977, after the death of Oscar Turcios and Ricardo  Morales, Pedro Arauz told me that the members of the leadership  of the GPP [Prolonged Popular War] faction to which I belonged  had chosen me as a member of the leadership of that organization.    In 1979 they informed me from abroad that I had been named a  member of the Joint National Directorate.    During the first Congress, the DN [National Directorate]  decided not to stake out personal options, but instead to go "as  a slate," to take collegial responsbility for the decisions we  had made and the pledge to promote the transition from Sandinism  toward greater democracy.    I am not going to "toss my hat in the ring" or campaign, but  if I am nominated and elected to a leadership post, I will  handle my responsibilities in the same way that I did when I was  a courier, a student leader, or an underground cadre. If not, I  will do whatever I can as a grass-roots activist.    [Irias] People say that some DN members are involved in  managing FSLN assets. How are those assets managed?    [Arce] The way in which the party's assets will be handled  is  going to be decided by the Congress. It is important to make it  clear that for some time now these assets have not been managed  by members of the National Directorate.    Moreover, this is separate from the political leadership.  That is a legal requirement, because the FSLN, as a party, is a  nonprofit organization. By law, no party as such may have any  business activities.    Only through a business organization outside the party like  any other business arrangement can we try to engage in business  ventures to benefit the organization and earn a financial return.    In the beginning, some members of the DN--Jaime Wheelock,  Sergio Ramirez and myself--were asked to set up that  organizational process that has now been completed. No specific  member of the DN administers that business plan. The party  treasurer controls these assets and it is the treasurer who will  provide the appropriate report to the Congress.    [Irias] There are complaints from FSLN members in the  Atlantic Coast area about the lack of support they have received  from the national organization. What is your opinion?    [Arce] Actually, we did neglect the Coast from the central  level, as a result of the 1990 defeat. The idea was that  everyone would "cultivate his own garden," at least until the  election campaign in the Coast.    The Front was divided about getting involved in that  campaign, because Sandinist groups formed and created  independent slates of candidates in the RAAN [Northern Atlantic  Autonomous Region]. What the PLC did was to join in alliance  with Yatama de Fagoth, for their interest was not autonomy or  the problems of the Coast, but rather to create a political  impact...and that is just what happened.</p>

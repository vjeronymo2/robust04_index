			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Government package boosts Tokyo equities - But fundamentals are weak GOVERNMENT measures to boost the Tokyo stock market have triggered a wave of criticism among the country's financial community. Heavy buying, which pushed the Nikkei index up 3.3 per cent on January 28, was part of the government's attempts to boost the ailing stock market, through the extra public pension and postal funds which were allotted for equity investment. Some investors and brokers complain that this artificial support outweighed weak earnings and economic fundamentals, but only in the short term. 'We are not trying to prop up prices, but the stock market is almost dead and we are only supplying a cure to revive its functions,' retorts an official at the Ministry of Finance. After the Nikkei fell to a new six-year low last August, the government announced support measures, which included additional public investment to be placed in the stock market. The government allocated an additional Y1,120bn (Dollars 967m) for stock investments, boosting the amount allowed to be invested in equities this fiscal year to Y2,280bn. The boost in January came amid mounting market worries of a February crash, with heavy selling expected from companies and financial institutions wanting to prop up profits ahead of the March year-end book closing, and from companies in need of funds to refinance equity-linked bonds. The ministry tried to soothe concerns by announcing that 70 per cent of the Y9,000bn in redemptions of the equity-linked bonds had been procured through bank borrowings and bond issuances. It also launched what the local media dubbed the PKO - Price Keeping Operations - by analogy with the UN's Peace Keeping Operations, through adding extra demand, and by curbing additional supply by ordering banks and life assurers not to sell shares to shore up profits. Most market participants believe that the support will be maintained until March book closing, since the 16,000 line is a critical level for banks to sustain their capital ratio requirements set by the Bank for International Settlements. The level is also crucial for many life insurers, which rely on unrealised gains on stocks to cover their heavy losses on foreign bond investments and a decline in returns on domestic investments due to the fall in interest rates. In order to stop life insurers from selling stocks to prop up financial profits, the ministry is likely to postpone booking their foreign exchange losses on Australian and Canadian bonds, while allowing them to book unrealised profits on stock holdings. Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, points out that the government is increasingly worried over the health of the smaller life insurers, whose unrealised gains on stocks have already been run down and who have no more scope to cover further losses. The government seems to have been the sole buyer of the market. Last month, banks, including trust banks which manage public funds, posted net stock purchases for the eighth consecutive month, buying a net Y366bn in equities. However, life and non-life insurers and investment trusts were net sellers for the third consecutive month, and foreigners and individuals were also net sellers. Overall activity has also failed to revive, with January trading volumes remaining around a daily average of 200m shares. Moreover, the market support operations have flushed out the growing inefficiency of share prices in reflecting fundamentals, leaving many strategists uncertain over how much of earnings and economic news is being discounted into stock prices. Although the Nikkei is currently trading at 54 times earnings, Baring Securities maintains that on realistic earnings estimates, the p/e ratio would be around 60. However, some fund managers are more positive over the ministry's efforts. 'If company profits are to recover next fiscal year, current share prices are cheap,' says Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of pension fund management at Sumitomo Life. Some economists foresee an additional supplementary budget ahead of the royal wedding and summit this summer, and leading politicians of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are calling for an income tax cut of some Y5,000bn to Y6,000bn to revive consumer spending. Salomon Brothers in Tokyo forecasts that a recovery in consumption will allow the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year and next. However, doubts over whether consumption will respond to fiscal stimulus and scepticism over structural problems in corporate and banking sectors cloud the economic outlook, and pessimists maintain that a recovery in corporate profits may not be achieved until the winter of 1994. Meanwhile, the need for financial authorities to prop up share prices will soon weaken. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, expects volatility on the stock market during April or May, since capital ratios for banks will not be an issue until September and stock valuation losses can be forgotten until March 1994.</p>

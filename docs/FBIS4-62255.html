			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- Mykhaylo  Kukushkin, chairman of the Republic of Crimea Supreme Council  Commission for Military Issues, Security, and Servicemen's  Protection and chief of a Black Sea Fleet naval directorate,  told journalists: "We do not need the units and subunits of the  National Guard of Ukraine that are deployed on our territory.  What we do need is to form the Republican Guard of Crimea only  from the peninsula's citizens. I am convinced that the deputies  will support me in this." In Mykhaylo Kukushkin's words,  military ships should only be able to sail into the ports of  Crimea on coordination with the Crimean president.    Some data suggests that a draft document on setting up the  Republican Guard of Crimea has already been prepared and will in  the very near future be submitted for consideration by the  Crimean parliamentarians.</p>

Addressing a joint news conference with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in Pretoria, he said there  were minority groups which were not only concerned about their  future and values, but which were determined to arrest all  movement to a democratic future. It was the democratic  movement's duty to address the fears of all South Africans,  including those of minorities.    Mr Mandela said an holistic strategy should be applied to  solve the violence. The plan discussed with President F W de  Klerk could be jeopardised if details were published  prematurely, because it involved a number of parties. But Mr  Mandela said measures could include a region being declared a  disaster area, that the entire community be involved in  upgrading programmes, and that hostels be turned into family  units.    Tremendous progress had been made in building a new South  Africa, and there were many people who were determined to  contribute to this process. The ANC would continue trying to  involve the Freedom Alliance and other parties in the elections,  but would proceed without them if necessary.    Polls which indicated a landslide election victory for the  ANC were encouraging, said Mr Mandela but warned against  complacency. The ANC should be on its toes, for while the  government might be tagged as illegitimate, paralyzed by  corruption, and accused of orchestrating violence, it remained  devastatingly effective in elections.    The ANC's National Executive Committee would seriously and  sympathetically consider an invitation from France for South  Africa to join the Franco-African Conference, to be held in  Paris this year.    Mr Juppe announced France was prepared to assist in training  the national peacekeeping force. He added that few countries  were interested in improving links with Africa, and were looking  instead at the Pacific Rim or Latin America, but France would  not forget Africa, and this would ensure a basis for  co-operation.</p>

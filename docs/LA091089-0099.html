			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> South Lake Tahoe Mayor Neva Roberts is proposing that all of her city's  employees be required to submit to drug testing. Roberts said "Operation Deep  Snow," a 20-month federal investigation that led to the arrests of former Mayor  Terry Trupp and 24 others on drug charges, showed the need for the action. "It  (the community) may never be 100% (drug free), but the best place to start is  by example," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs uncertain Pharmaceutical stocks came under heavy pressure in New York late yesterday after disappointing results from US group Pfizer led to profits downgrades and heavy selling of the whole sector. SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo were most seriously affected in spite of favourable fundamental news. SmithKline has benefited from enthusiastic response to its new shingles treatment Famvir and received a further push from a hefty note from NatWest Securities. NatWest said SmithKline was poised to benefit at the expense of Wellcome, whose headline product, Zovirax, is poised to come off patent soon. The note, which featured unpleasant photographs of patients disfigured by herpes, failed to impact on the Wellcome shares, which rose 21 to 683p. SmithKline 'A' put on 4 at 439p, but lost a penny to 399p in the Units, which were trading at the equivalent of 392p in New York shortly after the London market closed. Meanwhile, Glaxo announced that its Japanese subsidiary had received approval from the Ministry of Health and Welfare for both oral and injectable forms of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment for chemotherapy patients. The shares closed a penny up at 681p in London but the American Depositary Receipts were trading at the equivalent of 673p after the market shut. Pfizer shares tumbled Dollars 6 to Dollars 61 7/8 in early US trading, with PaineWebber among several houses to cut forecasts.</p>

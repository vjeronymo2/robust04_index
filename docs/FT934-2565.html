			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Fisons ousts chief and cuts dividend The board of Fisons, the troubled UK pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, has ousted its chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs. The company is now looking for its third chief executive in as many years. The group also announced its third profits warning since 1991, the resignation of its finance director and a cut in its dividend. Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said he had expected the group to make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 100m this year. But because of restructuring provisions and a change in trading policy for the drugs division, it expected only to break even. He promised results would improve from 1994, compared with what would otherwise have been achieved. The final dividend has been cut from 5.4p to 1p, making a total dividend of 4.3p (8.7p). The group said this would save Pounds 37m in cash next year. Fisons' shares closed down 24p at 113p. Mr Egan said: 'Cedric was offered the opportunity to resign, which he refused. He was, in effect, sacked.' The primary cause of Mr Scroggs' unexpected departure was the collapse in operating profits of the scientific equipment business for which he held board responsibility. The operations will report a loss this year of Pounds 16m compared with a trading profit of Pounds 12m last year. Mr Egan said the business had been hit by the recession, but a Pounds 28m turnround was unacceptable. 'There have been clear managerial weaknesses,' he said. The collapse in profits in this division exposed some accounting practices in the drugs operations which, according to Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, were unwise but not illegal. These included boosting sales and profits by offering customers discounts at the year-end. In 1991, when the practice was at its peak, it generated nearly a fifth of the division's sales. Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, scheduled to leave shortly, has resigned. Mr Redmond said his early resignation was not related to the discounting policy. The discounts have been stopped. The drugs division's trading profits would be Pounds 28m less than they would have been, said Mr Redmond. Operating profits this year would also be hit by a charge of Pounds 3m for restructuring and Pounds 5m for stocks write-offs. A further Pounds 15m would be charged over the next two years.

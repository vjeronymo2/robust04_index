			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Argentina-Chile oil pipeline construction begins Construction began this month on a 425km oil pipeline that will link oil fields in southern Argentina to Chilean refineries in the southern ports of Talcahuano and San Vicente, Leslie Crawford writes. The Dollars 300m project is being built by the two state oil companies, ENAP of Chile and YPF of Argentina, and by Banco Rio de la Plata, an Argentine bank. The pipeline through the Andean mountains is the first project of its kind between the two neighbouring countries. It is expected to reduce Chile's oil import bill by cutting transport costs - ENAP now imports oil from Africa. The pipeline will also allow Argentina to ship oil to the Far East from Chilean ports on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

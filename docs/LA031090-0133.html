			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 16 O.C. CITIES RUNNING AFOUL OF HOUSING RULES;  </P> <P> REGULATIONS: MORE THAN HALF OF THE COUNTY'S CITIES HAVE PLANS THAT FAIL TO  COMPLY WITH STATE STANDARDS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEE A POTENT TOOL TO HALT  PROJECTS.  </P> <P> More than half of Orange County's 29 cities have local housing plans that fail  to comply with state standards and could face legal problems such as those that  barred Seal Beach this week from issuing any new residential building permits,  state officials said Friday.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, opponents of a 329-unit development in northwest Seal Beach gained  a court order preventing the city from granting permits until the city updates  and adopts its state-required housing plan.  </P> <P> While the ruling applies only in Seal Beach, environmentalists said the legal  battle highlights a potent new tool to fight developments in cities whose  housing plans fail to meet state standards.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, this will set a trend," said Galen Ambrose, vice president of the  Wetlands Restoration Society, which filed the lawsuit against Seal Beach. "I  expect all the cities now will be scrambling to adopt their new plans."  </P> <P> State officials agreed that other cities could face similar challenges. "This  could certainly happen to any city that has not updated their plan," said  William Murphy, assistant chief of housing policy development for the state  Department of Housing and Community Development.  </P> <P> "Any city that ignores the regulation will be vulnerable to similar court  action and to the same kind of decision," he said.  </P> <P> State law requires cities every five years to update their local housing plan,  known technically as the "housing element" of the city's general plan for  commercial and residential construction. In the plan, cities assess current  housing and show that their officials are planning to accommodate future  growth.  </P> <P> In Orange County, 16 cities either failed to submit housing plans by last  summer's deadline or turned in plans that did not include adequate strategies  for dealing with such issues as low-income housing, said Murphy, whose  department reviews the plans.  </P> <P> The jurisdictions with approved housing plans are Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Santa  Ana, Newport Beach, Placentia, San Clemente and Tustin. Dana Point and Mission  Viejo, plus the county. Newly incorporated cities whose housing plans are not  yet due are Dana Point, Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. Under review are plans  for Orange, Huntington Beach and Irvine.  </P> <P> These plans must be submitted to the state according to a state-mandated  timetable, although no government agency has the authority to force a city to  comply with the housing requirement. Private citizens, however, can take legal  action to force compliance.  </P> <P> "We have no authority to take action against a city for not updating their  housing element," said Travis Pitts, deputy director of the state Department of  Housing and Community Development. "Private citizens can sue the city for  non-compliance. That's about the only way to enforce this law."  </P> <P> Seal Beach officials say their housing plan will not be in compliance until at  least late April, when the City Council hopes to adopt a new plan.  </P> <P> For Seal Beach resident and developer Henry A. Ericksen, 76, the ruling has hit  home.  </P> <P> "I've been working eight months getting ready to apply for this permit," said  Ericksen, who sought permission to build two homes Thursday afternoon, just  hours after the city stopped granting permits. "I've spent $30,000 so far, and  now it'll cost me $1,500 a week just to wait. I'm sitting here with bare land  and 10% interest. It's not very pleasant."  </P> <P> According to Seal Beach Planning Director Lee Whittenberg, Ericksen is the only  permit applicant the city has turned away so far. Officials stressed, however,  that the ruling came down only this week and details of enforcement are not  complete.  </P> <P> The city has temporarily suspended issuing new permits while awaiting a more  detailed ruling on whether each kind of residential building permit would be  affected.  </P> <P> City officials say keeping a housing plan up to date is difficult because the  process requires a lot of staff time. In addition, state goals, such as making  sure there is enough apartment housing for low-income residents, sometimes  conflict with the sentiments of residents who oppose high-density housing.  </P> <P> "The growth-control sentiment is part of the problem," Murphy said. "Everyone  seems to have a NIMBY attitude (about high-density housing) -- 'not in my back  yard.' "  </P> <P> In Fullerton, the City Council adopted a housing plan over the objections of  state officials who said the plan did not include a time line showing how the  city will include housing programs for low-income residents. The city decided  it would be a waste of time to submit a revised plan to the state, said Joel  Rosen, a Fullerton senior planner.  </P> <P> "We feel that we are substantively and substantially in compliance with state  law, and, if challenged, we feel we could win on this issue," Rosen said.  </P> <P> Holly Hamlin, associate planner for Cypress, said she is more concerned with  preparing a proper housing plan than with meeting the state's deadlines.  </P> <P> "The most important thing to us is we do it right, that we adopt a housing  element that satisfies state law and meets the needs of the people of Cypress,"  she said, adding that a consultant is working on the plan.  </P> <P> Officials of various county cities said they realize that operating without a  current housing plan is legally questionable, but they also said some smaller  cities cannot afford the expense of updating one.  </P> <P> "The state says, 'Gee, we're going to pass all these laws,' and then they don't  say how they expect us to comply," said Whittenberg of Seal Beach. "Small  cities like Seal Beach don't have the resources to do everything."  </P> <P> Ed Knight, director of community development for Dana Point and former planning  director in Seal Beach, said he is not surprised that Seal Beach was sued.  </P> <P> "The reason so many general plans are out of date is that it takes so much  money to keep them updated," Knight said. "There's probably no general plan in  the state of California that is adequate."  </P> <P> In Stanton, Planning Manager Mike Bouvier said his city's housing plan was  neglected "because whoever was in charge at the time didn't do it."  </P> <P> "Clearly, we recognize the legal ramifications," Bouvier said, adding that  Stanton's general plan is being rewritten. "It is just one of the risks all  cities have to take."  </P> <P> However, state officials said cities have had ample notice that housing plans  must be submitted every five years and should be able to comply. "We'd  certainly like to direct attention to this problem, because we think it's a big  one," Murphy said. "Since there's not direct enforcement, the enforcement of  the plan depends on public attention."  </P> <P> Also contributing to this story were Kathie Bozanich, Greg Hernandez, Len Hall,  Danica Kirka, Lynda Natali, Lisa Mascaro, Laura Michaelis, Danny Sullivan and  Leon Teeboom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOUSING GUIDELINES FOR O.C. CITIES  </P> <P> Besides Seal Beach, 15 other Orange County cities could face the same problem  that hit that city this week when a judge ruled that no more building permits  could be issued until the city updates its housing plan. State officials say  these cities have inadequately planned for the future housing needs of  residents.  </P> <P> Out of compliance: Housing plans inadequate or outdated:  </P> <P> Brea  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P> <P> Cypress  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P> <P> La Habra  </P> <P> La Palma  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P> <P> Stanton  </P> <P> Villa Park  </P> <P> Westminster  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P> <P> </P> <P> In compliance: Housing plans adopted or in approval process:  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P> <P> County of Orange, unincorporated territory  </P> <P> Placentia  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing plans not due (from new cities):  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing plans under review:  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Source: State Department of Housing and Community Development  </P></p>

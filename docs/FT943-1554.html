			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Marc Rich gives way to Glencore in name only: Trading group's new head talks to Kenneth Gooding The tremendous upheaval at the world's biggest diversified trading company culminates this month with a change of name - from Marc Rich &amp; Co to Glencore International. In the past three years the company has been convulsed by a succession struggle at the very top, staff defections and accusations about wrong-doing, particularly in the former Soviet Union. Mr Willy Strothotte, who emerged as chairman and chief executive, dismisses suggestions that all this weakened Glencore's position in commodity markets. These suggestions come from rivals, he says, and were sometimes taken seriously by the media because of the personal difficulties of Mr Marc Rich, the Belgian-born founder of the group. He was charged with tax evasion and other offences by the US authorities in 1984 and has refused to return to the US to answer the charges. Mr Strothotte said it would be a tragedy if Mr Rich was remembered more for being a fugitive than for building from scratch a world-class business and, in turnover terms, Switzerland's second-biggest corporation after Nestle. As a private company, Glencore does not give financial details but Mr Strothotte does not argue with analysts' estimates of an annual turnover of Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19bn) and net profits of Dollars 125m to Dollars 160m. Mr Rich recently revealed the group's capital base to be about Dollars 750m. Glencore is one of the biggest operators in global oil and oil products markets, trading about 1.5m barrels a day. It is the biggest player in the international aluminium and alumina markets, trading 2.5m tonnes of aluminium and 3m tonnes of alumina a year, and it owns a handful of industrial companies. Some of these are held by Sudelektra, once a sleepy investment fund, and now the best-performing Swiss stock. Its shares have soared from around SFr350 when Glencore took control in 1990 to SFr1,920. Mr Strothotte describes Sudelektra, in which Glencore has a 53 per cent stake, as 'our window to the capital markets'. Mr Strothotte, 50, started his trading career in 1961 as an apprentice with Frank &amp; Schulte. In 1966 he joined C. Tennant and moved to ICC Metals in 1972. He was hired to Marc Rich in 1978, four years after it was founded, by Mr Alex Hackel and groomed as his successor to head metals and minerals trading operations. The retirements in 1992 of Mr Hackel and two other senior Rich executives sparked a dispute about how quickly Mr Rich himself should follow them and sell his shares - more than 50 per cent of the capital  - to the new management team. In the event, Mr Rich stayed on but Mr Strothotte and two other senior executives resigned. By March last year, Mr Rich had decided to call back Mr Strothotte as chief executive. Mr Rich's holding has been reduced to 25 per cent and Mr Strothotte is confident that his remaining shares will be transferred to management and employees. There are now about 360 Glencore shareholders, compared with 150 when Mr Rich was chairman. The company pays no dividends and all net profit goes into retained earnings to inflate the shares' value. When shareholders leave the group they must sell their equity which is passed on to other employees at the management's discretion. Mr Strothotte says the group does not pay big bonuses as management and senior employees benefit from share ownership instead. Mr Strothotte says the change of name is simply to prevent confusion between Glencore and Mr Rich's own finance and property group, Marc Rich Holding. 'You don't change an image by changing a name. You change your image by changing your conduct - and that I don't want to change.' Neither does the change of name signal a change of direction, he insists. Glencore will continue to trade base metals, non-ferrous and ferrous metals and ores, coal and grains - it is now the biggest exporter of European Union grain to eastern Europe. 'Our business is physical. We use terminal markets as a means of protecting that business but we don't trade paper or derivatives. We have no seat on the London Metal Exchange or other markets. We are happy to use brokers rather than to act as brokers ourselves.' Before Mr Strothotte leaves Glencore he says he 'would want to see the restructuring completed and to complete a number of exciting things I know are ahead'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Glencore International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Headquarters:   Zug, Switzerland Turnover:       Dollars 25bn-Dollars 30bn Net profits:    Dollars 125m-Dollars 160m Net worth:      At least Dollars 750m Employees:      2,000 in direct trading and 3,000 in other operations Activities:     trades in crude oil and petroleum products, ferrous and                 non-ferrous metals and minerals and agricultural                 commodities (grain, rice, sugar)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial assets include: 53% of Sudelektra Ravenswood Aluminium, West Virginia: 170,000 tonnes a year aluminium  smelter, 295,000 tonnes rolling mill Alumax, South Carolina (26.7%, balance held by Alumax): 180,000 tonnes  a year aluminium smelter Vialco, US Virgin Islands: 630,000 tonnes a year alumina refinery Eurallumina, Sardinia (21%, balance owned by Alumix and Comalco):  840,000 tonnes a year alumina refinery Perubar, Peru: zinc and lead mine Tselentis Coal, Vryneid, South Africa (50%, balance held by private  investors): 1.5m tonnes a year coal mine Silicon Technology, Johannesburg, South Africa: 55,000 tonnes a year  capacity ferro silicon producer Vanadium Technology, Johannesburg: 3,600 tonnes vanadium pentoxide  benefication plants  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main trading centres: Stamford, Connecticut; Tokyo; London; Zug; Rotterdam; Moscow; Singapore  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

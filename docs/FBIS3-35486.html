It also attempts to rudely interfere in  others' internal affairs.    Today, I would like to take two examples of this disgraceful  behavior of the United States, which it is openly following in  its dealings with the world.    The first example is the request Warren Christopher made to  Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani during  their recent meeting in Washington. Christopher wanted the  sisterly Arab state to desist from strengthening its fraternal  relations with Iraq. The second example is Clinton's arrogant  request to the Japanese prime minister to impose taxes on the  Japanese industries exported to the United States and to give  special facilities to U.S. exports to Japan. He wants to tip  the trade balance between the two countries in Washington's  favor. When the Japanese rejected this request that would  damage their industries, Clinton ordered a series of trade  measures hostile to Tokyo. This was a declaration of war  against an ally, well within earshot of the entire world.    These two examples shown once again that Washington will  never be satisfied if it does not impose its will on other  countries. Qatar is not allowed to practice independent  decisionmaking with regard to its relations with its sisterly  and friendly states. And Japan, which a major economic power in  the world today, is not allowed to compete against U.S.  industries, but must be forced to direct its development in the  interest of the United States.    Both examples indicate that U.S. policy under any  administration does not really have any friends or allies in its  general dealing. How many enemies does the United States have  today, and how many more will it have in the future? This shows  the extent to which Washington controls the world. The  important thing is that the rejection of this hegemony has begun  in different forms, including the firm rejection represented by  the Iraqi stand.</p>

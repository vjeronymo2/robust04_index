			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 26 April (SNARK) -- Armenian  parliamentaries expressed today their resentment with appearance  of deputy Ashot Bleyan, who claimed that Armenia conducts  "undeclared war" and that nearly 15 thousand Armenians became  the victims of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.    As told the speaker of the Armenian parliament, Babken  Ararktsyan, immediately after Bleyan's appearance numerous calls  started to come from Karabakh and Armenian combat divisions in  which indignance was expressed with Bleyan's statements. "Such  claims affect the national interests of Armenia," observed  Ararktsyan.    A deputy from Nagorno-Karabakh, Roles Aghadzhanyan, called  Bleyan's statement provocative. He acknowledged that there are  volunteers from Armenia fighting in Karabakh. "However there are  no Armenian troops in Karabakh," said Aghadzhanyan.    At the same time, the chairman of external relations  committee David Vardanyan reminded that Bleyan is free to  express his viewpoint. "I do not share his position, however the  deputy cannot become a persecution object," he said.</p>

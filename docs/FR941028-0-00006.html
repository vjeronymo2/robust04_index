This AD requires a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by oxygen canisters failing to activate due to the installation of incorrect pin release brackets or defective oxygen canister release pins. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective December 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from PTC Aerospace, 607 Bantam Road, Litchfield, CT 06759. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Terry Fahr, Aerospace Engineer, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7155, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats found on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48486). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with PTC Service Bulletin (SB) No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision D, dated February 2, 1993, that describes procedures for a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters state that the compliance time should be reduced, one to six months after the effective date of the AD, the other to 30 days. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not concur. Neither comment offered engineering or technical data to support a reduction in the compliance interval from the 15-month compliance time contained in the proposed rule. The proposed compliance time was determined to provide an acceptable level of safety considering the maintenance schedules of the operators. Therefore, the FAA has retained the 15-month compliance time in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the lanyard length check should be deleted due to difficulty in performing that check. The FAA concurs that the check was difficult to perform but does not concur in deleting the check. The check is needed to verify the correct lanyard length. Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that the lanyard length tolerance has been increased to plus or minus .25 inch, which will allow that check to be more easily accomplished. This tolerance factor has been added to paragraph (a)(3) of this Final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the AD should require repetitive inspections. The FAA does not concur. The one-time inspection, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will obviate the need for repetitive inspections other than those performed during routine scheduled maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter further states that the AD should contain a requirement for reporting malfunctions. The FAA does not concur. The one-time inspection, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will preclude the need for reporting malfunctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter further states that the SB does not provide adequate work step instructions. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the NPRM, PTC Aerospace has issued SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, which contains clarified work step instructions. The FAA has added this new service bulletin to the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

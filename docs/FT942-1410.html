			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Director jailed for four years A finance director who stole more than Pounds 350,000 from his company, causing its collapse with the loss of 200 jobs, was jailed for four years yesterday. Mr Richard Oates, 44, took the money to finance a lavish lifestyle. As a result Bristol-based Godwin Warren Engineering folded in 1988. Bristol Crown Court heard that Mr Oates bought a Pounds 50,000 Ferrari and a Pounds 200,000 home. Mr Oates, now of Mold, north Wales, was convicted on five specimen counts of theft and one of publishing a false statement. He was acquitted on four charges of false accounting. His co-defendant Mr Jeremy Kirk, finance director of Data Group, which was owned by Godwin Warren, was convicted of four charges of false accounting. Mr Kirk, 37, of Clifton, Bristol was ordered to do 240 hours of community service.</p>

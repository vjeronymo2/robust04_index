			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing this approach in today's rule because it does not believe a separate CPA statement is needed where the CFO simply takes figures directly from an audited financial statement. This is a straight forward process. On the other hand, where the CFO ``derives'' the figures_for example, by using different accounting procedures to determine OPEB liabilities_the process may require a high level of financial expertise. In these cases, EPA believes review by an independent auditor is appropriate. The Agency solicits comment on this approach and whether this approach would be appropriate for the financial test under subtitle C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual updates and placement of financial test documentation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The financial test proposed in this action would require firms to place the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2) in the operating record and notify the State Director that these items have been placed in the facilities operating record. Because the financial condition of firms can change over time, under &sect;258.74(e)(2), firms will be required to update annually all financial test documentation, including each of the items described above, within 90 days of the close of the firm's fiscal year. Under &sect;258.74 (e)(2)(iv), the owner or operator is not required to submit the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2) when he substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with &sect;258.71(b), &sect;258.72(b), or &sect;258.73(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternate financial assurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(v), if a firm can no longer meet the terms of the financial test, the owner or operator would have to notify the State Director and obtain alternative financial assurance within 120 days of the close of the firm's fiscal year. The alternative financial assurance selected by the owner or operator would have to meet the terms of this section and the required submissions for that assurance would have to be placed in the facility's operating record. The owner or operator would have to notify the State Director that he no longer meets the criteria of the financial test and that alternate financial assurance has been obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Current financial test documentation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;258.74(e)(2)(vi), the Director of an approved State may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, require the owner or operator to provide current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Although the Agency anticipates this provision will not be used often, it can be important in situations where the financial condition of the owner or operator comes into question. The State Director should have the flexibility to require the owner or operator to provide current financial test documents if information arises that raises serious questions about the financial conditions of the owner or operator. For example, an owner or operator may be forced into bankruptcy by a large, well-publicized liability judgment. In such cases, the State Director should be able to investigate the owner's or operator's change in financial condition, and require them to demonstrate that they still meet the financial test. The Agency requests comments from the public on this proposed requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

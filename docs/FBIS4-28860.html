			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Downright Expression of </F> Anti-Republic Hostile Policy"]    [Text] The Japanese authorities' suppression of the General  Association of Korean residents in Japan [Chongnyon] is getting  all the more vicious.    As has been already reported, the Japanese authorities  recently committed an outrage by sending several hundred  policemen, raiding the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon, and searching many places including houses of  Chongnyon functionaries on the groundless pretext of a violation  of the national land utilization law. The recent raid and search  commotion, which followed its crackdown on the Osaka prefectural  organization of Chongnyon in April, is a deliberate act to  destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic  activities and is an unpardonable criminal act.    As is known, Koreans in Japan did not go to Japan on their  own initiative. They are the ones who were drafted by the  Japanese imperialists who colonialized Korea or their offspring.  The Chongnyon is a dignified organization of overseas citizens  of our Republic which launches the righteous activities of  safeguarding the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan  and promoting friendly relations with the Japanese people.  Accordingly, the Japanese authorities should protect them and  value their rights, instead of intensifying suppression of the  Chongnyon.    Nonetheless, the Japanese authorities raided Chongnyon  organizations and houses of Chongnyon functionaries, and  searched them in broad daylight by fabricating groundless  excuses. This is an extension line of the policy of  obliterating Chongnyon, an expression of their undisguised  hostile policy towards us and Chongnyon, and a grave challenge  to them.    The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the  more  malicious in their attempt to stifle us over our so-called  nuclear issue while making haste with so-called sanctions and  adopting emergency legislature. While openly babbling about the  dispatch of the Self-Defense Armed Forces to the front line of  South Korea in case of emergency, the Japanese authorities  mobilized its armed forces to a southeast area adjacent to the  Korean peninsula in accordance with a new military strategy.    Timed to coincide with this, their provocative act committed  against the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon was not  a mere mistake as they have insisted. This is part of the  anti-Republic hostile policy which has been stepped up  maliciously through collusion and collaboration with the United  States and the South Korean puppets, and a deliberate and  premeditated act designed by the Japanese authorities. The  Japanese authorities have launched into a heinous anti-Chongnyon  campaign whenever the anti-Republic moves of the United States  and the South Korean puppets got hysterical. This is a clear  proof of it.    Regarding the suppression of Chongnyon and the hostile  policy  toward our Republic, the present Japanese authorities are more  arrogant and tyrannical than their predecessors. What they  pursue is realizing the past dream of becoming a colonial  dominator by involving itself in another war of aggression on  Korea by following the United States' emergency scenario.  However, this is nothing but an anachronistic wild dream and  only reveals their unchangeable aggressive nature.    The DPRK Foreign Ministry clearly declared that if Japan  should take the lead or be inveigled or join force in any  sanctions against us, we would regard it as a declaration of  war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment  for it.    We never use empty words. Japan occupied our country for  almost half a century, committing never-to-be-condoned crimes to  our nation, and has not atoned for its past criminal acts up to  now. Japan must ponder the consequences to be entailed by its  anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and act with discretion.    The Japanese authorities should immediately stop their  hostile policy toward our Republic and their suppression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for the recent case  and sternly punish the chief culprits. If the Japanese  authorities continue to step up their suppression of Chongnyon,  joining the anti-Republic commotion of the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppets, they will have to pay a dear price for  it.</p>

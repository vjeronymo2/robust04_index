			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- There will be more  exchanges between the capital markets of China and the United  States, with the Shanghai-based Petrochemical Shareholding  Company Ltd entering the U.S. capital market in the form of  American Depositary Receipts (ADR).    U.S. investment in China will benefit both sides, J. Carter  Beese, director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,  said here yesterday at a symposium on how to enter the capital  market of the United States.    The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai  Municipal  Government and the Bank of New York.    Carter Beese said that he was happy about China's plan to  issue one billion U.S. dollars-worth of global bonds in the  United States. It will be the first time for China to enter the  capital market of the United States.    Shanghai Vice-Mayor Wu Kuangdi agreed to Carter Beese's  view.    Now three Shanghai-based companies have entered the capital  market of the United States in the ADR form. Xu thought that  they would help establish a good image for Chinese enterprises  in the United States.    Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange,  estimated that the trading volume of ADR in the United States  will grow from 20 billion U.S. dollars last year to some 25  billion U.S. dollars this year, which will probably involve new  enterprises from China.    Joseph M. Velli, vice-president of the Bank of New York,  also  lectured at the symposium, telling some 200 Chinese stock  exchange officials how to enter the capital market of the United  States in the form of ADR.</p>

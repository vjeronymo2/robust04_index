			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z. Skerlev: "Macedonia Insists on a Package </F> Solution"]    [Text] Yesterday, the special envoy of the U.S. President  and mediator in the Macedonian-Greek dispute, Mr. Matthew  Niemitz, held talks with the President of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  Kiro Gligorov after holding discussions with Foreign Minister  Stevo Crvenkovski in Ohrid.    On this occasion they exchanged opinions about the current  stage of the Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibility  of resuming the dialogue on disputed questions. This time, too,  the Republic of Macedonia's stance was reiterated on the need  for an urgent lifting of the unilateral embargo and for all the  questions to be solved as a package. President Gligorov made a  special review of the difficulties suffered by Macedonia because  of the Greek embargo and the real danger that it represents for  a greater destabilization of the republic and the whole region.  He also expressed his belief that in the next round of  negotiations with the mediators from New York there will be  greater likelihood for solving this situation, which has already  become a clear element of threat to the stability in the south.    During the discussions there was also an exchange of  opinions  about the further development of relations between the United  States and the Republic of Macedonia. On what was referred to  as "an exchange of opinions about the current views of Macedonia  and Greece in relation to the solution of mutual problems,"  Minister Crvenkovski and Mr. Niemitz made short statements to  journalists.    "Yesterday we had long and extensive discussions in smaller  delegations, and today we had discussions with the president of  the republic," Minister Crvenkovski said. "We discussed all the  aspects of the situation here and particularly the damage caused  to Macedonia by the embargo, as well as the whole situation in  the region. We discussed a number of other questions of  importance for the whole region and we hope that we shall soon  have another opportunity to meet and continue these discussions,  and that we shall also have continual meetings with Mr. Cyrus  Vance."    In his statement to the journalists, among whom, as usual,  there were a large number from the Greek media, Mr. Niemitz said  that it was his great honor to be here again and to have two  days of discussions about these issues. "As you know, we had  serious discussions in New York. Cyrus Vance and I talked with  Minister Crvenkovski there, but we thought it was a good idea to  come and hold discussions here. There is no special reason for  this, or any special message, just fruitful discussions."    After that Mr. Niemitz stated that he was ready to answer  some journalists' questions. The first was whether he had  nothing more to say after his few days of discussions in Greece  and Macedonia.    "I will just say," Niemitz said, "that we have all agreed  not  to talk or discuss the contents of the meetings. I know that  this is frustrating for you journalists, but it is a fact that  it is a far better way for comprehending some of the subjects.  There is nothing for publication, there are no breakthroughs or  changes of policy or ideas, but I think, in my personal view,  that there is a better understanding and viewing of the  situation and the position of both sides, so, from my point of  view, it was a good idea for me to come here and have this  useful series of meetings."    Asked whether there existed opportunities for a direct  dialogue between the two countries, Niemitz said that this was  something to be discussed between the two countries, but that he  had not discussed this. The task that was assigned to him by  the President of his country was to talk with both sides in  order to clarify the concepts, and thus to examine and explain  the other positions. If the two countries wanted to talk with  each another, that would be something that they would have to  agree upon.    "There are some aspects of the relations between the two  countries that were reconsidered with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus  Vance, which is a normal and acceptable method, and I would like  to say that the leaderships of the two countries are approaching  the problems with seriousness. And that is how most of the  problems can be solved."    The next question was whether there had been any progress in  the discussions. Niemitz replied that he was not going to talk  about what had been discussed and the word "progress" for this  kind of discussion was irrelevant. "I talked with both sides,"  he said, "about their positions, and that is all I can say for  now."    As we heard, Mr. Niemitz is leaving Macedonia today. Whether  intentionally or unintentionally there have not been scheduled  new consultations in Athens, so he is leaving for New York,  where, as we know, Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski  and his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias will go next week  for indirect discussions with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance,  the special envoy of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.</p>

The improvement was due largely to a reduction from 52 per cent to 29 per cent in exposure to the 'poor performing' Japanese stock market and an increase from 13 per cent to 27 per cent in the trust's weighting in Hong Kong. Earnings declined to 1.1p (1.43p) and the dividend for the year is 0.4p (0.75p).</p>

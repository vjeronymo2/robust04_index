			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's manifesto Kenneth Clarke has proved a prudent chancellor of the exchequer. It says much about the febrile state of the Tory party that his reward is to be pushed well down the list of potential candidates for the leadership. This is a pity, since the underlying philosophy he articulated in yesterday's Mais lecture on 'the changing world of work in the 1990s' accords well with what the country needs. But the lecture fails to provide adequate answers to the questions it raises. 'I intend,' said Mr Clarke yesterday, 'to extol the virtues of both a flexible labour market and a strong welfare state. I believe that both are essential for the quality of life that we aspire to in Britain. I believe that, properly directed, the two complement one another.' The essence of Mr Clarke's philosophy then is the desire to combine the 'best aspects of American enterprise and free market efficiency with the European commitment to the welfare state'. Two questions arise: first, whether a flexible labour market is as wonderful as Mr Clarke claims; and, second, whether the flexibility he extols is consistent with the welfare state he defends. Where Mr Clarke is right is in arguing that the high current level of unemployment is not caused by changes in international competition. Nor is it due to technological change, which seems to be no faster than in the 1960s. There have been inescapable structural changes, such as the decline in the number of coal miners from 750,000 after the war to today's 15,000. The economy's failure rests in the fact that it has not provided those who have lost these sorts of jobs with adequate replacements. Market forces Deregulation does have important successes to its credit: strikes have fallen to their lowest level for a century; pay is more responsive to market forces; productivity has improved, above all in manufacturing; there has also been substantial growth in self-employment, part-time employment and female employment, with women making up 46 per cent of those in work; and employment seems to be more responsive to changes in output than a decade ago. Yet all is far from rosy. The growth of part-time work is indeed desirable, but the reduction in the number of full-time jobs is not. Equally, the unemployment cost of lowering inflation remains very high, as is the level of unemployment at which inflation stabilises. If deregulation had achieved all Mr Clarke claims, wage inflation would still be falling and an expansion of the economy at greater than its long-run trend rate of growth would be greeted with equanimity. Nothing, in short, suggests that a return to what was not so long ago thought of as full employment is likely. This may be because a 'norm' for wage growth, an idea Mr Clarke condemns, is inescapable in any fully integrated labour market. If wages in successful firms rise at levels only they can afford, wage push will afflict the entire economy, with dire results. Welfare state So far, then, it is only one-and-a-half cheers for deregulation. But what of the compatibility of deregulation with the welfare state? Mr Clarke simply asserts that the social security system should complement an efficient labour market. So, of course, it should. The question is how. Questions do not arise, in this regard, about the National Health Service or state education. But they do about any form of assistance whose withdrawal is liable to create a poverty trap. The issue is whether there can be a flexible labour market, at least at the bottom of the earnings distribution, if people can obtain almost as much as they would get from working by not working, instead. Mr Clarke's response is to state that the 'government is looking at the means of ensuring that the welfare system encourages the low paid to find employment'. This is a central issue because these are precisely the people a welfare state is supposed to help. Mr Clarke fails to provide the answer, which is why his assertion that 'harnessing market forces does not mean abandoning social protection' is, for the moment, pretty empty. His job now is to fill it. The chancellor has addressed the right agenda. But he has some way to go if he is to convince the public that he has the right answers too.</p>

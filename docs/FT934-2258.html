			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Accord boosts spirits in Scotch whisky industry Scotch whisky exports from the UK, worth Pounds 2bn last year, should be boosted by the Gatt agreement. 'In the short term, implementation of the 'zero for zero' agreement, initiated in Tokyo in July, will remove import duties for Scotch in seven countries, lopping almost 50p off the price of a bottle in New Zealand, for example, and just over Pounds 1 a bottle in Japan,' said Mr Bill Bewsher, director general of the Scotch Whisky Association. 'Real strides will be made in international markets if there is swift and significant action to reduce import tariffs by 30 per cent overall,' he added. Such a move would reduce the price of a bottle by Pounds 2.50 in Egypt, Pounds 1.90 in Korea, and 60p in Venezuela and Poland. With agreement on reducing tariff barriers, Mr Bewsher said, the time was right for serious negotiations on non-tariff restrictions. Scotch whisky at present faced tariff and non-tariff barriers in about 130 markets. Excise tax discrimination was widespread. In Japan, Scotch was taxed between six and nine times the rate of shochu, the local spirit. Other non-tax barriers were equally damaging to Scotch's ability to compete in overseas markets. Korea hindered market access through a system of licensing distribution; Argentina required immediate payments of duty on imports but allowed domestic drinks 45 days and Hungary operated quotas.</p>

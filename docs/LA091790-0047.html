			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 1ST-TIME DRUG OFFENDERS RARELY GET JAIL;  </P> <P> LAW AND ORDER: OFFICIALS SAY PENALTIES SHOULD BE STIFFENED BUT THEY STOP SHORT  OF ENDORSING L.A. POLICE CHIEF DARYL GATES' STATEMENT THAT CASUAL USERS SHOULD  BE SHOT.  </P> <P> Casual drug users -- the people Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates says  should be shot -- rarely receive jail sentences on their first offense in  Ventura County despite the county's tough law and order image.  </P> <P> Possession of a gram of cocaine on first offense, a felony that carries a  possible one-year jail term, probably will land the casual drug user in the  county probation department's diversion program, prosecutors said this week.  </P> <P> The rules there: Obey all laws for two years, attend drug education classes and  pass about two urine tests during that time. If all conditions are met, the  charge is purged from the user's record.  </P> <P> According to law enforcement officials, first-time felony possession  convictions for heroin, PCP, LSD or methamphetamines also usually go to  diversion instead of jail. If the offenders behave, their slates are wiped  clean.  </P> <P> And in Ventura County, as throughout California, possession of less than an  ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor that costs little more than most speeding  tickets; it carries a $100 fine.  </P> <P> Was Gates right to suggest shooting casual drug users?  </P> <P> "It was, at first blush . . . an irresponsible statement," said Sheriff John V.  Gillespie, whose own preference is to jail them instead in a proposed "tent  city" that he would like to see built on the Seabee base at Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> But while Gillespie excused Gates as trying to shock lawmakers into focusing on  America's drug addiction, he also advocated the firing squad for smugglers,  "who bring in tons and tons of cocaine and . . . see that it gets peddled on  junior high school campuses, and the people behind the assassination of more  than 200 judges in Colombia."  </P> <P> Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas said: "Casual drug users are in large part  responsible for the predicament that this country's in with drugs today. And I  think that they ought to be dealt with as severely as we can deal with them,  but I would stop short of shooting them." The answer, Thomas said, is "severe  jail sentences."  </P> <P> And Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said, "I don't really  believe that he as an individual or as a police chief would advocate the  execution of anybody for casual drug use."  </P> <P> But the casual drug user's money is feeding the traffickers, and that must be  stopped, Miller said.  </P> <P> While Ventura County law enforcement officials drew the line this week at  endorsing Gates' firing squad solution, many said jail is more appropriate for  casual drug users than the second chance they now receive on first offenses.  </P> <P> In fact, the current diversion program has about a 45% failure rate -- measured  by dropouts and continued drug use -- and is widely referred to as a joke by  law enforcement officials.  </P> <P> Officials find the program so unsuccessful that the Municipal Court and the  offices of the public defender and district attorney are working to help the  county Corrections Services Agency, the official name of the probation  department, to revise it.  </P> <P> In a June 29 letter, Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. wrote the  department:  </P> <P> "A program that does not do anything particularly worthwhile is a waste of  money. For courts to place people into such a program is a fraud on them and  the public we serve. . . . If we do not see a substantial improvement in the  program immediately, we will seek an alternative provider for a program of  substance."  </P> <P> The problem, according to diversion program Director Calvin Remington, is that  the courts are feeding mostly hard-core cocaine addicts into a program that was  designed 15 years ago for casual users of drugs ranging from marijuana to  heroin.  </P> <P> "Sometimes they don't report in, they move, they leave the area," Remington  said Friday. "I have to assume, if they're leading a nice, productive life,  they would tend to report in and take care of business, so I think the 45% that  fail are continuing to use drugs."  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Jean L. Farley said recent budget cuts have forced the  probation department to focus its dwindling resources on hard-core addicts,  which means less attention is paid to casual drug users -- who she said fall  off diversion more frequently as a result.  </P> <P> Remington said about 70 to 75 people per month go into the diversion program.  The majority of people sent into diversion last year -- 625 or 85% -- were  arrested for drug intoxication, while the remaining 110 or 15% were arrested  for simple possession charges, he said.  </P> <P> And about 2,160 people were arraigned on possession charges alone, court  officials said.  </P> <P> Of the 900 to 1,000 drug users now in diversion, 80% were arrested for cocaine  charges, 10% for amphetamines, 5% for heroin and 5% for marijuana, Remington  said. Seventy-five percent are employed. Eighty percent are males earning an  average of $18,000 a year, while 20% are females earning an average of $9,000 a  year, he said.  </P> <P> Remington said probation officials hope to get a revised diversion program in  place within 60 days. They also hope it will reduce the number of people who  "fall off" diversion and are rearrested on drug charges, he said.  </P> <P> The new plan would have two levels: the first for casual drug users who are not  found to be addicted and the second for more hard-core addicts, Remington said.  </P> <P> The first level would replace the current minimum 5 1/2-hour drug education  program with a minimum 26 1/2 hours of counseling and education, and would  subject participants to drug tests at least once a month, he said.  </P> <P> "If the person tests dirty, they may be prosecuted, or they may get a chance  from the court to go to Level 2," Remington said. "Level 2 hasn't been designed  yet, but it's going to be a very lengthy program, somewhere between nine and 12  months" of education, counseling and treatment, plus frequent and random drug  tests.  </P> <P> The increased attention for drug users could be subsidized by fees levied  against people who opt for diversion instead of jail, he said.  </P> <P> Also, the probation department is working with the RAND Corp. of Santa Monica  to experiment with more accurate drug tests which could make it more difficult  for someone's drug use to escape detection, Remington said.  </P> <P> Cocaine shows up in tests for only seven to 10 days after it is used, and the  user often has some advance warning of when he or she will be tested, Remington  said.  </P> <P> But while Remington says the people on diversion get "a very good deal from the  system" if they follow the rules, prosecutors say casual drug users will be hit  hard if they "fall off" diversion and are rearrested.  </P> <P> Diversion participants who "fall off" are prosecuted for the original charge  and any additional charges for which they were arrested.  </P> <P> Second offenses for possessing carry a maximum penalty of up to three years in  jail, and convicts in Ventura County often serve a sentence of 60 to 120 days,  said Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward F. Brodie.  </P> <P> And reoffending on intoxication charges will land the casual user in jail for a  mandatory minimum of 90 days, he said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes said he supports diversion for first-time  offenders so they can get treatment. But he added, "The second time, we should  come down on them like a ton of bricks."  </P> <P> However, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said, "Diversion is the worst thing  that's happened to the war on drugs." Diversion "basically immunizes"  first-time offenders for whom their arrest "is clearly not the first time" they  have used drugs, Bradbury said.  </P> <P> Bradbury and Gillespie have drafted an extensive -- and expensive -- plan for  dealing with casual drug users. If the U.S. Department of Justice and federal  drug czar William Bennett approve the $7-million proposal, the county would get  federal aid to increase drug treatment and education, hire more prosecutors,  boost staff in the sheriff's crime lab to test more urine and blood samples,  and build a tent jail to house so-called "recreational users" who are  convicted.  </P> <P> But while all the police chiefs of Ventura County have signed off on the drug  plan and support jail time for second offenders, they have varied ideas on how  to treat first-time offenders.  </P> <P> Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens proposes stiff fines and formal probation for  first-time offenders.  </P> <P> Ventura's Chief Thomas advocates mandatory jail terms.  </P> <P> And Santa Paula Police Chief Robert Adair supports Bradbury's and Gillespie's  drug strategy, adding: "If I had my druthers, the programs would be adequately  funded, and there would be sufficient rehabilitation programs out there. But  unfortunately there are not."  </P> <P> But some officials have questioned the soundness of the plan provisions that  would increase prosecution and punishment for casual drug users.  </P> <P> Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman conceded that "casual cocaine use is very  serious. . . . But I do not feel that taking those casual users and pumping  them into an overcrowded court system and making criminals out of them is going  to do anything."  </P> <P> Instead, he endorses the plan to improve the diversion program and favors  putting drug users who fall off of it into the county's work-furlough program  so they could sleep in barracks at night and work at their regular jobs by day.  </P> <P> Farley said of the tent jail plan, "Studies have shown that, if you put  somebody in jail who is a first-time drug user and you sentence them to six  months in hard labor, when they come out, they're not going to have anything  different than they had when they went in. . . . They're going to be introduced  back into the same social situation they have been in before."  </P> <P> And Judge Cooper said, "I don't have a lot of problem with that tent idea, but  what they were trying to do is to get to the casual drug user. And I put to  them, 'If you're not getting to them now, how are you going to get to them with  this program in place?' "  </P></p>

Asked about the reports that correspondents may be harassed  or restricted, al-Sharif told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "There is no  control, interference, or anything that limits their freedom of  movement, or confiscation of their messages or reports...; they  are completely free." However, the Egyptian information  minister stressed that the state or any authoritative quarter is  entitled to draw it to any correspondent's attention if it  becomes clear that he insists on reporting untrue news. "A  correspondent's freedom does not mean fabricating imaginary  stories and falling into the claws of erroneous reports."    The minister warns correspondents not to fall into what he  termed the "fax trap." He said: "For two years press and news  agency bureaus have been accustomed to receiving statements from  illegal or extremist groups by fax. Some correspondents think  these statements are a scoop or a reality, but over the past two  years nothing of what they threatened to do has happened."  Al-Sharif added: "We request nothing of correspondents except  the truth, only the truth. They know better than anyone else  that they live in security and safety which may be greater than  in their own countries."    He said that sources of information are available to them.  And with regard to security issues, the Egyptian Interior  Ministry has an official spokesman and has allocated telephone  numbers for those who want to ascertain information, without any  kind of control of interference.    He pointed out that freedom of movement is available to  correspondents and that there is the permanent press center,  which operates around the clock to serve foreign correspondents  and provide them with all the statements and statistics they  request.</p>

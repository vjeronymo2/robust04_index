			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR IS UNSAFE TO PRACTICE, BOARD CHARGES  </P> <P> State medical authorities are seeking to revoke or suspend the license of a  Woodland Hills doctor they charge has a mental disorder that may render him  unable to safely practice medicine.  </P> <P> Dr. Edward V. Madey suffers from borderline personality disorder and has shown  "impaired judgment . . . that may affect his ability to practice medicine in a  way that would ensure safety to those to whom he administers as well as to  himself," the Medical Board of California said in a complaint made public  Monday.  </P> <P> Madey could not be reached for comment. Deputy Atty. Gen. Nancy Ann Stoner, who  prepared the complaint for the board, said Madey has filed a notice that he  intends to defend himself against the charges, brought in May. No hearing date  has been set.  </P> <P> Medical board executive director Kenneth Wagstaff said in the complaint that  Madey twice tried to kill himself in 1982 and was twice hospitalized for "a  major depressive syndrome."  </P> <P> Wagstaff said that in a series of letters in 1985 and 1986 to his ex-wife, her  family and attorney, Madey also threatened repeatedly to commit suicide "if his  financial demands were not met."  </P> <P> Stoner said she was not aware that any of Madey's patients had experienced  problems with him. She also said she could not elaborate on the content of his  letters.  </P> <P> Madey voluntarily underwent a psychiatric evaluation in 1988 and was determined  to be suffering from borderline personality disorder, said Stoner. She said the  American Psychiatric Assn. defines the disorder as a "pervasive pattern of  instability of self-image, interpersonal relationships and mood, beginning by  early adulthood."  </P> <P> An APA diagnostic manual said those suffering from the disorder often make  repeated suicide threats and have trouble controlling their anger.  </P> <P> Vern Leeper, the medical board's enforcement chief, said the board files  charges against doctors with psychiatric problems about once a month.  </P></p>

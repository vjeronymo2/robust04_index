			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 1, IRNA -- The Foreign Office confirmed  Wednesday [1 June] that its deputy head at its embassy in Tehran  had been expelled in retaliation for last week's expulsion of an  Iranian first secretary from London.    A spokesman claimed that the removal of Hamish Cowell was  "totally unjustified." At the same time, he tried to defend the  feeble excuse for Britain's unilateral action when ordering  Vahid Bolurchi to leave last Thursday.    The official reason for the expulsion of the Iranian first  secretary was said to be because of attempts by embassy staff to  distribute "forged documents" about the UK's anti-Muslim policy  in Bosnia, which is universally known.    The raising of such an excuse shows British sensitivity  about  its failed policy, which frequently comes under attack from the  Bosnian Government itself for the way in which London is  attempting to impose a settlement by rewarding the Serb  aggressors.    The Foreign Office spokesman maintained it wished to keep  quiet its initial provocative move against Iran in the hope of  limiting publicity, but the real motive may be more associated  with trying to hide the embarrassment of a bug being found in  the Iranian Embassy.    Britain's strained relations with Iran have been dominated  by  a history of tit-for-tat exchanges that have always proved a  fruitless ploy for the UK. At one stage prior to Tehran  severing ties in 1989, representation was reduced to only a  mission head.    The new expulsions cut the current number of diplomats to 14  and indications are in the present climate they may not end  there with a number of Iranian parliamentarians already calling  for relations with Britain to be reviewed.</p>

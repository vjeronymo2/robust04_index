			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dominican nickel production suspended until end of March FALCONBRIDGE Dominicana, the Dominican Republic's nickel producer, has suspended its operations until the end of March because of a weak international market caused by high stocks and low prices. According to Dominican government officials, the decision by the company, in which Falconbridge of Canada has a majority stake, followed a fall in nickel prices from an average of Dollars 3.10 a lb to Dollars 2.50 a lb. These prices, they said, could not provide the company with a 'beneficial profit'. World nickel stocks had risen to about 200,000 tonnes, which is about two and a half month's supply, the officials said, and the company's three month closure is expected to coincide with a draw down of these inventories and a hardening of the market with prices recovering. The Dominican Republic's nickel production between January and September of last year was 16,974 tonnes, 26.9 per cent less than production in the corresponding period of 1991. Production in 1991 was 29,000 tonnes, 1.6 per cent less than 1990. The Caribbean Republic has reserves of 38m tonnes of ore graded at 1.75 per cent nickel.</p>

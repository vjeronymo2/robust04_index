The premier  voiced this statement in the village of Tamaresheni in South  Ossetia, which he visited on January 3.    The press center of the Georgian government reported to  Interfax that the premier had a meeting with the command of the  Russian and Ossetian peacekeeping battalions on the territory of  the Russian military unit not far from Tskhinvali, an  administrative center in South Ossetia. Since July 1992, these  battalions have been overseeing the cease-fire in this region  together with Georgian servicemen.    Patsatsiya also visited several Georgian villages in South  Ossetia where he promised the local population to provide them  with food products and other necessary consumer goods.    The Georgian-Ossetian conflict began in January 1991 as a  result of Georgian forces introduced into South Ossetia after  the South Ossetian leadership declared its intention to raise  the status of South Ossetia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>   [Text] Barnaul May 11 TASS -- A three-day session of the  Scientific Council of the programme to investigate the "distant  radiation after-effects of the Semipalatinsk nuclear tests on  the population of Altay territory" began here today.    Invited to take part in it, in addition to the participants  of the "Semipalatinsk programme", were scientists from almost 60  research institutes, who have discovered hitherto unknown  documents on Soviet nuclear tests, and their opponents.    The participation of the latter, according to Valeriy  Kiselev, director of the regional Medico-Ecological Problems  Research Institute, is most important, because their views will  allow the session to see more clearly the weak points of the  programme and to further the ongoing investigations.    As distinct from previous sessions, the current one will  work  only in plenum, which will allow it to create new conditions for  the inter-disciplinary interaction of various specialists:  Physicists, chemists, biologists, physicians and social  scientists. Such complex studies are most necessary today.  After all, Altay, which was affected by more than 58 nuclear  blasts in the period from 1949 to 1990, and also by the first  explosion of a thermonuclear bomb in August 1953, was turned  into a sort of "human survival testing ground". Only the  picture of the 1949 explosion was modelled so far. Much work is  yet to be done on the other tests. But the after-effect of  Soviet nuclear tests on the Altay population is well known.  They are more terrible than those of the Chernobyl disaster,  because the local population was exposed not once, but many  times over to irradiation with radionuclides with a short period  of decay.    The session will analyse in detail the incidence of diseases  among the territory's population, which was affected by  explosions on the Semipalatinsk testing ground. According to  Kiselev, the international scientific community expects from the  parties to the programme a thorough analysis of the medical  after-effects of nuclear tests, because a massive examination of  all the people affected by radiation was carried out for the  first time in Altay, which has involuntarily become a sort of  research laboratory.    The session will discuss the results of 1993 scientific  works  and the main directions of further studies. Moreover, it will  be an important landmark in the preparations for an  international conference on the "radiation test" programme,  which will be held in Altay this September.</p>

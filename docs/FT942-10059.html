			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Direct Line surges to Pounds 40.5m Direct Line, the UK's leading motor insurer, has nearly doubled its share of the household insurance market since March last year and expanded particularly rapidly in the six months to March 31. Details emerged yesterday when the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary reported a nearly threefold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 15m). The company said it had experienced a surge in growth following the introduction of a new rating structure and a marketing campaign in September 1993, underwriting 139,000 new policies in the half year to bring its total to 381,000. Premium income from household policies increased by 92 per cent to Pounds 41.8m. Meanwhile, Direct Line is consolidating its position in the motor market, issuing 445,000 new policies in the half year and reaching 1.56m policies in force by March 31, against 903,500 a year earlier. Motor premium income rose by 66 per cent to Pounds 219.4m (Pounds 132.4m). Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that 'despite increasing competition in the motor and household insurance markets during the half year, Direct Line has achieved rapid growth in both'. Overall including income from creditor insurance, premium income rose by 67 per cent to Pounds 267.7m (Pounds 160.6m). The company's operating ratio, an efficiency indicator which measures claims and expenses as a percentage of premiums, improved by four percentage points to 84 per cent. In household business, Direct Line's loss ratio - which measures claims as a percentage of premiums - fell to 52.4 per cent in the last six months, against 71.8 per cent a year earlier. As the size of the company's portfolio expands, the expense ratio - expenses as a percentage of premiums - has dropped to 21.9 per cent (29.2 per cent). Further injections of capital of Pounds 35m were made by Royal Bank of Scotland 'to support the company's continued expansion'. As well as maintaining the pace of its advance in the household area, Direct Line aims to underwrite 2m motor policies by the end of the year. The company plans to spend Pounds 16m on marketing this year, of which Pounds 9m will be earmarked for advertising, against Pounds 9.5m last time. Mr Wood said that he was considering a range of new services and products. A new initiative to improve the management and reduce the cost of motor insurance claims is near fruition. The company is already issuing personal loans, through Direct Line Financial Services, and plans to run a pilot scheme to offer mortgages in the summer.</p>

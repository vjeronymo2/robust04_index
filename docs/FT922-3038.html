			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: Companies utter a chorus of groans - London Markets THE AIR HAS been full of the groans of companies giving up on the economic recovery. Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of the company that bears his name, announced the first dividend cut since his family sold shares to the public. It was a time for prudence, he said, because he could not see 'the mechanism to start a recovery' in either the UK or the US. 'There is unprecedented uncertainty about the timing, nature and strength of the recovery,' he went on. That news came on Thursday, as the CBI reported weak retail sales in May and the car industry reported a fall in output because of poor export sales. Pilkington's shares dropped 3p, to close the day at 129p, down from 164p just over a month ago. On Friday, the chorus of 'Recovery? what recovery?' was taken up by Taylor Woodrow at its annual general meeting. Announcing 'a considerably reduced level of dividends' for the current year, Colin Parsons, chairman, said that the economic downturn had 'devastated' the industries in which the company operated. Given this, he said, 'we must expect any recovery, when it comes, to be gradual'. Taylor Woodrow's shares fell 10p, to 94p, a drop of 9p on the week. Other construction industry shares also fell; the sector as a whole dropped 9 per cent on the week. One influence was a note from John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, who argued that 1.5m UK householders had mortgages for more than their homes were worth. Fear of falling into this debt trap was stopping first-time buyers from launching themselves on to the housing market this year, he said, even though homes were more affordable than at any time since 1984. There were two spectacular pieces of gloomy corporate news during the week. Regalian, the property developer, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 27m for the year to March, but its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, clearly felt the figure could have been worse: it qualified the figures because of the difficulty of valuing development sites. The other bad news came from Fisons, which issued a warning about poor results in the first half of the year (though it was talking about its own particular troubles with US drug regulators rather than the state of the economic cycle). Amid a chorus of complaints from analysts, Fisons' shares fell 100p in the minutes after the announcement, closing on Friday at 244 1/2 p, down 115 1/2 p on the week. Against this background, it was not surprising that on Friday the FT-SE index came within a few points of closing below 2,600, ending the day at 2,603.7. The index has fallen 134.1 since its post-election peak a month ago. If worries about the economic recovery lie behind the market's unease, next week will provide plenty of opportunity for further hand-wringinging, as a flood of UK economic statistics are published. Another reason for edginess, however, has been political uncertainty in the wake of the Danish vote on the Maastricht treaties. As it became clear that Conservative MPs were unhappy with the government's initial support for a 'business as usual' approach to Maastricht ratification, gilt yields continued to move upwards, and sterling remained weak. Thursday's referendum in Ireland will prove another crucial hurdle for the Maastricht treaties. If they fail to surmount it, more market bumpiness lies ahead. As the chart shows, the FT-SE has dropped more, since the Danes' Maastricht vote, than the German DAX index - but less than the French equivalent, the CAC-40 index. Still, the week was also notable for some good news from companies. John Ritblat, the chairman of British Land, said the worst was over in the UK property market; Amersham International, the health science group, announced a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to March; TI celebrated an overwhelming victory in its bid for Dowty; and Racal announced a swing from a loss of Pounds 22m last financial year to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 56m. The market greeted a flow of small and medium-sized rights issues with equanimity, and looked set to swallow new issues from MFI, Telegraph and GPA with similar sangfroid. News of such developments was almost elbowed into obscurity, however, by a flood of announcements from the regulators of privatised companies. The most important of these developments was a new price formula for British Telecom, announced by its regulator, Oftel. The price cap on BT's services tightens from the rise in the Retail Price Index minus 6 1/4 per cent to RPI minus 7 1/2 per cent - a rather harsher ruling than the market had expected. Together with a number of more detailed changes, this means - according to estimates from County NatWest - that there will be a 2.8 per cent drop in turnover and a Pounds 250m drop in pre-tax profits. If BT does not accept the new formula, it will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The ruling was announced on Tuesday, pushing BT's shares down 8p on the day to 354p. By Friday it had slipped further, to close at 350 1/2 p, down 13 1/2 p on the week. Since last autumn, BT has underperformed the FT-SE index, of which it is one of the largest single components, by 16 per cent. It is now yielding 5.6 per cent, towards the top end of the range - between 3 1/4 per cent and 6 1/2 per cent - in which it has moved since privatisation. On the face of it, that looks attractive. The worry, of course, is whether the regulatory climate has shifted decisively against the company. For the investor in privatised stocks, such calculations are likely to prove a permanent feature of life.</p>

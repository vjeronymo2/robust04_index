			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDS CARVE DAMAGE SWATH IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> Storms on Monday brought heavy rains and 100-m.p.h. winds to the Northwest.  Utility lines were ripped down, houses were smashed and fallen trees and  rockslides blocked highways.  </P> <P> Gusts up to 107 m.p.h. toppled nearly 100 trees and ripped off roofs on the  Washington State University campus at Pullman, near the Idaho border.  </P> <P> Joseph Spoonemore, the university's physical plant director, said the wind  broke windows in a dozen buildings and blew the roofs off several others,  including a dormitory, but most students were off campus for winter break. He  estimated the damage at $50,000.  </P> <P> Oregon coastal communities shuddered in gusts up to 76 m.p.h. early Monday and  were braced for a third windstorm.  </P> <P> Utility crews scrambled to remove tree limbs from power lines and replace  toppled poles in much of the state.  </P> <P> Winds of up to 70 m.p.h. also swooped down the Columbia Gorge, knocked out  electricity and phone service in the Tri-Cities region of southern Washington  and, farther east, in border areas from Spokane, Wash., south to Lewiston, Ida.  </P></p>

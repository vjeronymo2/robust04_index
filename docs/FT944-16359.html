			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: FSU metal use seen staying low Metals consumption in the former Soviet Union may be nearing the limit of its dramatic decline but it is not about to recovery rapidly, according to Mr David Humphreys, economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining group. Meanwhile, metals production in the region almost certainly had further to fall, 'implying that the broadest part of the export bubble is now passed.' In any case, said Mr Humphries at a conference organised by IBC Financial Focus, contrary to public perception, the reform process in the former Soviet Union had had a fairly limited impact on world markets for the major base metals in physical terms - 'although the effect on prices has admittedly been rather greater on account of the uncertainty associated with the FSU's export behaviour'. The key exception - and a big one - was aluminium. Copper, lead and zinc consumption in the FSU had fallen by half since 1990 while aluminium and nickel use was down by nearly 75 per cent. A revival of metals use was highly dependent on investment but this was not forthcoming because of the outlook for demand, high interest rates, and lack of investor security, as well as 'the immediate political requirement to protect consumers from deprivation'. But without investment if was difficult to see how metal consumption could recover. Russia's commodity exporters had been generating substantial foreign exchange earnings but this money was not being reinvested and in some cases not being returned to the economy at all. It was not a question of waiting for a cyclical swing to prompt a restart of idled industrial capacity because much of that which was idle was obsolete or, in the case of military installations, irrelevant, and would never work again. On the other hand, most of the FSU's metallurgical plant was serviceable even if it was neither efficient or environmentally friendly. But its mines were in extremely poor condition. So, 'in the absence of substantial investment in the FSU's mines and metals sector - and soon - it is by no means impossible that when the recovery does eventually begin to bite and metals consumption starts to grow again, there will be a period in which the area will become a net importer of certain major base metals'.</p>

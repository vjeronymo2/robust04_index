			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Monday Interview: The longest swansong on Wall Street / A look at what makes Felix Rohatyn probably the most renowned investment banker in America You sit in the ante-room and wonder at its drabness. The non-descript wallpaper, the table too big for the room - you have to edge around it to peer out of the window on to Manhattan's West Side. No corporate art collections on display here. Who else has been ushered into this anonymous receptacle in recent months? Martin Davis, the erstwhile boss of Paramount Communications, perhaps, or Howard Stein, who is selling his Dreyfus mutual funds group to Mellon Bank. Or maybe Stephen Wolf, head of United Airlines, which recently sold a majority stake to its unions, or Garry Wendt, whose GE Capital yesterday announced an agreed merger with the Kemper financial services group. A door to the inner office opens and Felix Rohatyn sweeps in. Or rather, he bustles. A compact, slightly rumpled man in his mid-sixties, Rohatyn moves to the far side of the vast expanse of table. With sharp eyes behind his thick-rimmed glasses, he looks like an alert elderly uncle. You have to pinch yourself to remember that this is probably the US's most renowned investment banker. Though he will hit 66 at the end of this month, Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres, is still very much in the thick of things. The takeover wave of the late 1980s had seemed likely to be his last fling. Nearly six years ago, Business Week was moved to ponder 'the post-Felix era' at Lazard: 'Rohatyn at 60 is not the ravenous gatherer of new business he once was.' But the 1990s takeover boom has projected him back into the limelight, even as many of his contemporaries are moving into retirement. 'There is a generational change,' says one (much younger) merger and acquisition head on Wall Street. 'But Felix is Felix - he gets introduced to other people by people he knows.' The business gathering has not faltered. Rohatyn's swansong can probably be attributed in equal measure to his contacts, his reputation, and his style. The contacts have been formed over many years: the relationship with Howard Stein, the 66-year-old head of Dreyfus, dates back 25 years, says Rohatyn. Martin Davis, who retained the Lazard banker to advise him on the sale of Paramount, is also a long-term friend. The election of a Democratic president has buoyed the fortunes of Rohatyn, himself a life-long Democrat and a man once talked of as a Clinton Treasury secretary. A position on the airline commission set up by the Clinton administration last year served as an introduction to Wolf of United Airlines. Wolf was having trouble persuading the airline's unions to make big concessions in return for a majority stake. 'He showed up one day in my office and said he would like to retain us - and me specifically - because he thought it would help to convince the unions that he was serious,' says Rohatyn. If Rohatyn's style suits the times, it is because he largely stood back from the 'binge of leverage' in the late 1980s, says Martin Lipton, the US's top takeover lawyer, and a contemporary and close friend. The more considered, less super-heated takeover market of the 1990s has suited him better. Rohatyn himself characterises the current wave of takeovers in the US as being 'driven by technological or regulatory or legislative changes - whether it is the regulation and technology of communications and media, the legislation and the changes coming in healthcare, or in banking, or in mutual funds'. His verdict on the resulting restructuring in some of the biggest industries in the US: 'It's real - it's reality. It's not whether you can sell a junk bond to an S&amp;L' The exception, perhaps, was Paramount. The stress of that Dollars 10bn battle is clear from Rohatyn's verdict now: 'Probably the most difficult and personally-draining experience I have ever been through.' His reputation did not emerge unscathed. Last summer, with Rohatyn advising him, Davies agreed an Dollars 8bn takeover by Viacom in a transaction designed to discourage any other bidders. The courts later ruled that cozy deal illegal, opening the way for a bidding war which eventually forced Viacom to pay some Dollars 10bn for its conquest (and left Davies without a job). Rohatyn still sticks by the original plan. Explaining why the agreed deal with Viacom had been hatched, he says that, even though the deal was widely leaked, no one else came forward to express an interest in the buying the group - and 'you don't shop a Dollars 10bn company around, you really don't  -it doesn't happen.' He adds: 'I would argue frankly that the original deal would have created a very powerful company in terms of capital structure. That, over time, would have been a much better deal than going through this whole agony and winding up with a highly-leveraged business that will require dispositions of assets.' Rivals, though, say Rohatyn should have put Paramount's shareholders first. 'He got a black eye. We will use that when talking to their clients in future,' says a senior investment banker at another Wall Street firm. Davis is leaving Paramount. Stein, at 66, is unlikely to stay long with Mellon. Wolf is planning to step down when (if) United's shareholders approve the buy-out. ('I can't take credit for that one - he had decided to leave before he even showed up in my office,' says Rohatyn.) The loss of old ties makes business-gathering harder. And Rohatyn, though active, is less intimately involved in deal-making than he was. 'Back in the 70s, we would go seven days a week, 14 or 16 hours a day,' says Lipton. Not any more. 'Felix takes more vacations than he used to, and he doesn't work as hard as he used to - none of us in our sixties (does).' For now, he does not plan to leave Lazard - though 'I certainly do have plans to spend more time on other things.' He is involved on a UN commission, acts as vice chairman of Carnegie Hall and hopes to serve on other official US commissions, for instance. If the right offer came from the Clinton administration? 'If the president asks you to do something, you do it - but it's certainly not something I expect or am seeking.'</p>

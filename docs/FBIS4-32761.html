			<p>BFN     [Text] Szczecin, June 25 -- The "Solidarity-80" trade union  split Saturday when the third national congress of the union  elected Andrzej Dolniak new chairman of "Solidarity-80" National  Commission. Before the election leader of "Solidarity-80"  Marian Jurczyk walked out of the congress along with a group of  several dozen activists connected with him to protest, as he put  it, against undemocratic solutions of problems, unjustified  attacks and demands of measures that are not consistent with the  trade union's statutes.    The delegates who did not walk out with Jurczyk resolved  that  they constitute a majority and have the right to continue the  debates. They recalled the National Commission, chaired by  Jurczyk, and elected the new one with Dolniak as chairman. They  decided also to move the seat of the "Solidarity-80" authorities  to Warsaw.    Jurczyk, not complying with these decisions, on his part  announced that the second part of the congress will be held in  Olsztyn. The congress debating in Swinoujscie, Szczecin  Province, on Friday and Saturday was to specify new goals of the  trade union and amend its statutes. From the very beginning it  was held in the atmosphere of heated disputes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) In the event that payments after June 3, 1994, and before January 1, 1999, from Aurora (and any other source related to the rehabilitation of ELIC, other than any state insurance guaranty associations) to the Master Trust for the benefit of Plaintiffs with respect to the GACs are less than $16.1 million, approximately 27 percent of the Plaintiffs' account balances in the Segregated Fund, then the Employer shall pay the difference to the Master Trust on or before January 31, 1999. This undertaking by the Employer is referred to herein as the Settlement Guarantee. The Employer requests an exemption to permit the Settlement Guarantee under the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this proposed exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Plaintiff will have a pro rata share of the amounts paid under the Agreement in proportion to the Plaintiff's account's share of the Segregated Fund. The Employer represents that when added to the amounts already received from Aurora, the Employer's payments under the Agreement are expected to ensure that Plaintiffs will recover 100 percent of their account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Agreement, after approval by the Court, will be in full satisfaction of all claims of Plaintiffs arising out of the subject matter of the 1992 Litigation, and the 1992 Litigation will be dismissed with prejudice. The Agreement will be effective only if approved by the Court and only if the Employer obtains the exemption proposed herein by the Department and a favorable ruling on the Agreement by the Service. The Employer represents that the Court entered a preliminary approval of the Agreement on July 22, 1994, and rendered its final approval of the Agreement in a hearing on September 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this proposed exemption, the Department is proposing exemptive relief solely for the Guarantees, and not for any other aspects of the GAC transactions or the Agreement. The Department notes that this exemption, if granted, will not affect the rights of any participant or beneficiary of the Plans with respect to any civil action against Plan fiduciaries for breaches of section 404 of the Act in connection with any aspect of the GAC transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Participants in the Union Plans were not parties to the 1992 Litigation. The Employer represents that since 1991, the Union has demanded that the Union Plans' participants with rights in the GACs (the Union Participants) be made whole for their losses on the GACs. On June 9, 1994, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Trustee (the 1994 Litigation) on behalf of the Plaintiffs in the 1992 Litigation and the Union Participants, alleging that the Trutees' actions in connection with the Plans' purchase of the GACs violated various provisions of the Act. Although the proposed Agreement will provide that the 1994 Litigation be dismissed with prejudice as to the 1992 Litigation Plaintiffs, it will provide that the 1994 Litigation be dismissed without prejudice as to the Union Participants. The terms of the Agreement do not require any payments by the Employer to the Segregated Fund on behalf of the Union Participants. In response to ongoing demands on behalf of the Union Participants, the Employer has agreed to make payments to the Master Trust with respect to the Union Participants in a manner similar to the Agreement's provisions for the 1992 Litigation Plaintiffs. Specifically, the Employer will make an initial cash payment to the Master Trust on behalf of the Union Participants equal to 15 percent of the Segregated Fund account balances of the Union Participants. The Employer also guarantees to make additional payments to the extent that amounts received by the Master Trust from Aurora for the benefit of Union Participants after June 3, 1994 and before January 1, 1999 are less than $1.8 million, or 27 percent of the Union Participants' account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Employer's guarantee to make such additional payments (the Union Guarantee) is included in the Guarantees for which the Employer requests an exemption, under the terms and conditions of the exemption proposed herein. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Employer represents that, when added to amounts already received from Aurora, the initial payments and contingent additional payments by the Employer pursuant to the Union Guarantee will ensure that the Union Participants recover 100 percent of their account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Employer's initial and contingent additional payments to the Union Participants are conditioned upon the grant of the exemption proposed herein and a favorable ruling by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Union Guarantee is not evidenced by a written agreement, like the Settlement Guarantee. Instead, the Employer's commitment to the Union Guarantee is evidenced in a public announcement by the Employer's chief executive officer, Paul A. Allaire, reported in the July 18, 1994 edition of a newsletter, Today at Xerox, which is published by the Employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Guarantees will protect the Plans participants and beneficiaries from losses on the GACs' value as of the commencement of the ELIC conservatorship; (b) The Guarantees will eliminate uncertainty with respect to the value of the GACs in the Segregated Fund; (c) The Settlement Guarantee will enable the settlement of Plaintiffs claims arising from the 1992 Litigation and the 1994 Litigation; and (d) the Union Guarantee will extend to the Union Participants the same protections with respect to the GACs as those extended to the Plaintiffs under the Settlement Guarantee.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ronald Willett of the Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8881.

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gas stake sale by Phillips Petroleum PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, announced yesterday it planned to sell off a 51 per cent stake in its gas gathering and processing subsidiary, writes Nikki Tait. Shares in the business, which will be known as GPM Gas Corporation and is the largest domestic producer of natural gas liquids, will be sold to investors via an initial public offering. This will probably take place in April. Phillips said yesterday the subsidiary had operating revenues of just over Dollars 1bn last year and the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce GPM's debt to Phillips. GPM will be headed by Mr Bill Thompson, vice-chairman of Phillips. The US parent company announced plans for a significant sale of assets last autumn - a move which was seen as a further response to tough times in the oil industry, prompted by weak natural gas prices and the recession. Phillips shares rose  3/8 at midday on yesterday's news, finaly closing at Dollars 23 1/2 , for a gain of  1/2 . Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, later placed Phillips' debt on credit watch, with a view to a possible upgrade. It said that operating performance for the gas gathering and processing business had been 'fairly strong over the past two years' and noted recent stock offerings in this industry segment had attracted 'attractive valuations'.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDENTS SKIP CLASS, RALLY TO BACK TEACHERS  </P> <P> About 125 San Marino High School students skipped their 1 p.m. class Wednesday  to attend a rally supporting teachers' salary demands. But the crowd broke up  peacefully 15 minutes later when the principal politely asked students to  return to class.  </P> <P> "I think we have bright kids and they understand there are two sides to  issues," said Principal Don Banderas, as he watched the last stragglers file  back into classrooms.  </P> <P> Students had unfurled banners and chanted "6%" in efforts to focus attention on  the contract demands of their teachers.  </P> <P> "I like all my teachers, they're great teachers and I think they should get  paid more," said Annie Wu, a 14-year-old freshman at San Marino, where about  1,000 students are enrolled.  </P> <P> About 140 teachers in the San Marino School District have been working without  a contract since the beginning of the 1988 school year. They are seeking a 6%  increase retroactive to Sept. 1, 1988, said Jim Korkis, vice president of the  San Marino Teachers Assn.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Basic Forecast of Prices in 1994" </F> prepared by the Price Research Institute's Situation Analysis  Group headed by Chen Dezun (7115 1795 1415) and written by Cao  Jianjun (2580 1696 6511) et al]    [Text] I. 1993's Economic Development and Price  Situation    China's economic construction achieved outstanding results  in  1993. The GNP rose 13 percent; per capital GNP increased by more  than 2,500 yuan over the previous year. It is estimated that  agricultural value has risen by 3.7 percent based on constant  prices, with grain production topping 456.4 billion kilo and oil  production topping 17.61 million tons. Industrial value  increased by 19.5 percent based on constant prices. The people's  income also increased: After taking the price factor into  consideration, it is estimated that per capital cost-of-living  income for people in cities and towns rose 10 percent last year;  the rural population's per capita net income rose around 2  percent. People's newly added savings broke through the 300  billion-yuan mark. The markets were very active. It is estimated  that after taking inflation into consideration, social retail  sales actually rose 9 percent over the previous year. 1993's  total import and export topped $190 billion, approximately a 15  percent increase compared to 1992.    Despite the above-described fine situation, China's economy  was still plagued by many problems. The pre-existing and the new  problems together caused the overall price level to rise  sharply, and this will have a significant effect on the economy  in 1994. In 1993, the nation's total retail price index rose 13  percent over the previous year's. The price increases covered a  broad spectrum of commodities; almost all major consumer  products, labor and services, and factors of production were  affected. After mid-July, the macro regulation and control  measures adopted by the central authorities began to take  effect, and overall price level and the prices of some factors  of production leveled off some. But after November, inflation  picked up momentum again. The price situation was even worse in  the fourth quarter. The consumer price indexes in the large- and  medium-sized cities soared; the low-income class and college and  high school students had strong reactions. The prices of  agricultural means of production were rising faster than  agricultural product prices, and agricultural trade conditions  were unfavorable. Despite the comprehensive price increase,  however, the prices of energy, rail transport, and a handful of  capital goods and infrastructure remained fairly low.    The main causes of the above situation are:    1. The slow-developing basic industry has not kept up  with economic development.    Development of the basic industry, energy, transportations  and communications and similar sectors has remained slow. The  situation has not changed in 1993. Year-end statistics showed  that rail transport capacity has increased only 3 percent  compared to the previous year. Basically no new trunk-line was  put into service the whole year. Last year was one of the worse  years for rail transport in recent history. The power department  has estimated that currently China has a power supply shortfall  of around 20 percent. The Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area has a 8  billion kw shortfall; the northeast region has a 3-5 billion kw  shortfall; east China has always had a power shortage problem.  Based on actual needs, our elasticity of demand for power is  greater than 1.2, but the actual average is only 0.95. Coal  supply and demand are more or less balanced, but because of  transport capacity, supply is still tight in the economically  well-developed east and south China. The supply of steel  materials barely meets demand even with enterprises working  beyond capacity and with massive imports. Rapid economic growth  has resulted in a strong demand for basic goods and  infrastructure, which directly causes prices in the basic goods  markets to soar and in turn causes the overall product price  level to rise as a result of higher production cost.    2. Imperfect market organization and clogged channels  fail to link supply to demand despite ample supply.    Due to the slow relay of information, monopoly, regional  separatism, and failure to organize supply in a timely fashion,  product circulation in China has often failed to link supply to  demand. For example, in late November 1993, soaring grain price  was first spotted in Guangdong. It then spread to Hubei, Hunan,  Anhui, Jiangxi and so on, and before long, it reached the north,  resulting in grain price fluctuations over a fairly wide area.  Actually, we did not have a grain shortage in 1993; we also had  an ample reserve, but because grain management departments were  cut in some localities, grain transfer and shipment was slow,  making it too late to remedy the shortfall in some grain markets.    3. Behind the active markets is the hidden concern for  inadequate market demand.    The economy has been growing rapidly and prices have been  soaring, which seem to indicate brisk demands and a lively  market, but market demands for some products have been flat. For  example, the market for household electrical appliances is  already saturated; textile goods have long been in a slump;  cement stockpile has grown to around 21 million tons, and  stockpiles in the large- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises have continued to grow. It is estimated that the  stockpile of finished goods at year-end may be 12 percent larger  than 1992's. In the rural markets in particular, because the  increase in the peasants' income has slowed recently, sales of  agricultural means of production has also been sluggish, and  sales of industrial goods in the rural areas has not yet  recovered, and in view of the increasing scope of industrial  production, these have become a potential concern.    4. Despite the excess currency in circulation, there  are still some settlement problems.    Since 1992 and for two years in a row, currency in  circulation has been increasing at a rate of nearly 40 percent.  During the same period, the national economy was growing at 27  percent while prices were increasing at 19 percent--the rate of  increase in currency in circulation almost doubled these rates.  Despite that, settlement remained a problem in many sectors;  enterprises' triangle of debts continued to grow. Too much  currency in circulation seriously threatens to further drive up  prices, but settlement problems continue to call for more money  input.  <H5>  II. Forecast and Analysis of Price Situation in the First </H5> Half of 1994    Judging by 1993's economic situation and 1994's plans for  economic development and reform, it is expected that we will  continue to experience a high rate of economic growth  accompanied by high rate of inflation in the first half of 1994.  The inflation rate will keep pace with the rate of economic  growth and may exceed 10 percent or even higher. The causes of  the high rate of increase in prices are:    1. The "rooster-tail" effect of higher prices in  1993:    In 1993, while the economy sustained a 13 percent growth  rate, the cost-of-living index in cities and towns was 15  percent, and in the 35 large- and medium-sized cities, it  actually exceeded 20 percent. It is expected that last year's  price increases will continue to have an effect this year,  accounting for 4-5 percentage points of this year's retail price  increase.    2. Massive currency input has generated strong  inflationary pressure.    The macro regulation and control measures taken after July  curbed the loss of control over currency input that had begun in  the first half of 1993, but there was still too much money in  circulation. There was substantial currency input in the second  half of last year, and at year-end, various specialized banks  had approximately 180 billion yuan in basic currency. Today, the  banks have twice as much reserve fund as they had last July; it  has created a huge amount of high-energy money. At year-end,  currency in circulation may nearly quadruple that at the end of  last year. The state banks' plans for new loans in 1994 are  based on a fairly high rate of economic growth of 9 percent;  total loan volume will be 470 billion yuan, a 17.8 percent  increase. Thus, the money supply which is ready to explode will  have tremendous pressure on market prices.    3. The huge investment scope and unbalanced industrial  structure will continue to be the main driving force behind the  price increases.    Although the total scope of fixed asset investment declined  after the "macro regulation and control" efforts, it continued  to increase at a rate of more than 46 percent in 1993. It is  estimated that the state-owned units will have about 1.44  trillion yuan's work carried over from last year, 40 percent  more than in the previous year. This year, in order to ease the  restriction in the "bottleneck" industries, the start-up rate of  new key projects will continue to increase substantially. Adding  the state's matching investments in foreign capital utilization,  this year's planned social fixed asset investment scope will be  1.3 trillion yuan, 13 percent more than last year's, and it is  more than likely that we will exceed that amount. Accompanying  this huge investment scope is the unbalanced industrial  structure, especially the weak basic industry, which limits the  increase in energy and raw materials supply, creating a large  supply shortfall. Thus, it can only push the price level higher  and cause a chain-reaction.    4. The potential effects of the restructuring of the  economic system and price reform.    Several economic reform measures will be introduced this  year. Those that have potential effects on the overall price  level include exchange rate reform, tax reform, and the  structural readjustment of prices. The merging of the exchange  rate tracks will make it easier for domestic enterprises to  obtain foreign exchange, and so we may find even more imports  this year, and enterprise production cost will also increase as  a result. Tax reform overall will not increase enterprises'  burden, but because of the change in the tax structure,  individual enterprise tax burden will necessarily change. The  value-added tax will increase wholesale enterprises' tax burden;  retail enterprises' taxes will go down. In addition, grain,  chemical fertilizers, pesticides, live hogs, and reprocessed  resources and other previously tax-exempt businesses will be  paying a value-added tax this year. The structural adjustment of  prices will primarily affect grain, crude oil, and rail  transport prices, but no doubt, it will directly push market  prices higher.    5. The structural change in workers' income and  people's consumption will also raise the consumer price  index.    In recent years, the income level has risen significantly.  Statistics showed that from January to November 1993, the  nation's total wage bill rose 21.8 percent compared to the same  period a year ago. Specifically, wages in the people-owned units  rose 21.9 percent; city and town collective economic units, 15.1  percent; other economic units, 73.5 percent, which set a  historical record. The workers' nonwage income has also reached  substantial amounts. The rise in labor cost has become another  important factor pushing up production cost and product prices.  Even more serious is the change in income distribution. A  typical survey showed that currently, 2 percent of the  population is accounting for 30 percent of the income.  Meanwhile, the consumer market is also becoming more  luxury-goods-oriented. A 2,000-yuan leather coat is no longer a  novelty. The demand for soap and cosmetics has shifted to more  expensive kinds that are either imported or produced by  joint-venture enterprises. Motor cycles, air conditioners, video  tapes, camcorders, computers, hi-fi, multi-function TV sets,  refrigerators, telephones, and telecommunications equipment are  already or will soon become hot-sellers. This kind of  conspicuous consumption has a strong enticing or exemplary  effect on the low-to-middle income people. Therefore, even  though total demand in the consumer goods markets will not  change dramatically, the change in income distribution and the  structure of the products market will still push the prices of  consumer goods higher.    6. The imperfect market construction and market  organization cause sudden market and price fluctuations for some  products.    China's various tangible markets are small-scaled; supply  and  demand are scattered. The supply and marketing channels are  disjointed for many important products, and regional blocks and  market monopoly are fairly serious problems. Therefore, even for  goods whose supply and demand are balanced, because of changes  in certain policies or people's expectations, there can still be  market and price fluctuations. If these fluctuations become  frequent occurrences, there will be a natural tendency for  prices to rise.  <H5>  III. An Analysis of 1994's Price Trend and Some Policy </H5> Suggestions    Looking over China's current economic situation and the  reform and development, it is inevitable that we will find price  increases of significant magnitudes in 1994. Judging by the  developmental trend, we may encounter one of the following two  situations in the second half of the year: A) Given the in-depth  restructuring of the economic system and the stepped-up macro  regulation and control, abnormal price fluctuations and price  increases are put under effective control; the rise in the  overall price level will keep pace with the fairly high rate of  economic growth. B) The economy will grow at high speed and  inflation will be in double-digits, forcing a readjustment of  the national economy. The result will be slower economic growth,  but because various factors contributing to the higher prices  are not eliminated, the price level will continue to rise,  creating a situation of slow growth accompanied by high  inflation. In the former situation, the price situation will be  grim, but under the latter situation, it will be horrible.    To avoid even worse inflation, we must include controlling  the price level in our macro policy objective. We suggest  adopting the following policies or reform measures:    1. Keep the increase in the money supply steady.    The state's monetary policy must strive to stabilize the  money supply. Considering the fact that there is already excess  supply of currency in circulation, we must control the increase  in currency issuance to within the sum total of the planned  price increase and economic growth; the maximum rate should not  exceed last year's rate of increase.    2. Keep the increase in investment demands under tight  control.    To control investment demand, ultimately we must turn to the  restructuring of the investment system and other economic  systems. Currently, while reform is not fully in place, we must  still rely on administrative regulation and control. Primarily,  we must adopt different financial and taxation policies when  dealing with investments of different types. That is, for highly  profitable and competitive investments, we should turn to  higher-interest, commercial loans and impose a higher tax rate.  For less profitable capital investments which take a longer  time to generate profit, we should adopt a low-interest policy  and commercial loans and reduce the tax burden accordingly. For  low- or even no-profit public-good-type investments, the state  not only must allocate special low-interest loans but should  formulate policies to encourage society at large to make  investments. In addition, the state should also take local  development into consideration and guide and adjust the  investment scopes in various industries in different regions.    3. Set up and perfect macro regulation and control and  indirect market regulation measures.    To prevent abnormal fluctuations of great magnitudes in the  commodities market, the state should set up some agricultural  and sideline product and industrial capital goods wholesale  markets in the goods and materials gathering and distribution  areas and the large and medium-sized cities. Thereupon, it  should target the products' different characteristics and adopt  different macro regulation and control and indirect regulation  measures. A) For low demand-elasticity products, such as grains,  cotton, sugar, salt, pesticides, and groundcove, we should adopt  a regulation and control policy whose objective is to "guarantee  supply." The state must resolutely set up a system of stockpile  of important products in various localities over a period of  time and in groups and diligently set up a special regulation  fund and link the management of those products to stable market  supply. For example, it should be stipulated that managers must  keep a standard-size stock on hand. That is, they must maintain  the government-regulated maximum or minimum stock on hand and  operate as directed by the government at times of market  fluctuations. B) For industrial consumer goods with high  elasticity of demand, we should emphasize the construction and  standardization of wholesale markets, and as much as possible,  adopt economic measures to curb price fluctuations and, if  necessary, resume the price increase application filing system.  C) For industrial capital goods market which governs the trend  of market demand, while we keep up the necessary macro planning  and regulation, we should regularly make small adjustment  through monetary, financial, taxation, and other macroeconomic  policies.    4. Vigorously open up the rural markets.    To open up rural markets, besides guiding enterprises to  produce goods that sell well in the rural areas, the most  important thing is to increase the peasants' income. On the one  hand, we must set protective, supportive prices for agricultural  products; and on the other hand, we must continue to encourage  and support the development of township enterprises, and  accelerate the shift of the surplus rural labor force. At the  same time, agricultural investments must be given comprehensive  preferential treatment through government policies.    5. Open up a variety of investment channels, guide the  people in increasing savings and diversifying their investments,  and dissipate the market pressure on hot-selling consumer  goods.    The most important thing today is to create conditions to  facilitate the people's financial and real estate investments.  The financial investment sector should be opened up more to the  public to turn consumption funds into production funds. Reform  of the real estate system should aim to help the people achieve  the goal of owning their own homes.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WATER USE DECLINES 22% ON 'CONSERVATION DAY';  </P> <P> DROUGHT: L.A. COUNCIL MEMBER SAYS FIGURE SHOWS THAT CITY DOESN'T NEED MANDATORY  CUTS. BUT MAYOR COUNTERS THAT A ONE-DAY EFFORT AFTER A STORM ISN'T ENOUGH.  </P> <P> Water consumption in Los Angeles dropped by 22% compared to last year during  this week's "Water Conservation Day," demonstrating what one council member  characterized Friday as a willingness by residents to save water without  mandatory rationing.  </P> <P> Kicking off the daylong conservation effort Thursday, Councilwoman Joan Milke  Flores suggested that the city's water users "send a message" to the City  Council by saving water and thereby bolster her efforts to keep conservation  efforts voluntary.  </P> <P> "Based on (the) results, I believe that Los Angeles residents have demonstrated  their willingness to conserve," Flores said.  </P> <P> According to the Department of Water and Power, overall water consumption  dropped by 153 million gallons -- or 22% -- Thursday, compared to the last  Thursday of May, 1989.  </P> <P> But water use climbed by 24 million gallons, or 4%, from this Wednesday to  Thursday, something that Flores' spokeswoman Karen Constine attributed to  "average daily fluctuations."  </P> <P> In any case, Flores conceded that a storm earlier in the week helped cut water  consumption by reducing the need for outdoor watering. Also, records show  temperatures were an average six degrees lower Thursday than a year earlier.  </P> <P> If the mandatory rationing program proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley is approved, a  10% reduction will be required from 1986 levels.  </P> <P> Bradley said that despite the drop in water use Thursday, a mandatory program  is needed because consumers would "revert to old habits" without daily media  attention surrounding events such as "Water Conservation Day."  </P> <P> "It's ludicrous to make a decision about the future of the city and the supply  of our water based on statistics from one day -- particularly when that day was  unseasonably cool, and front lawns throughout Los Angeles were still damp from  an unusual late-May rainstorm," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  which Flores chairs, gave conditional approval to the mayor's plan and sent it  to the full council for a hearing June 15.  </P> <P> Flores said she would ask the council to hold off imposing the mandatory  program if forthcoming statistics from the DWP show water users have cut  consumption by 7% or more during the current 2-year-old voluntary program.  </P> <P> Flores, meanwhile, has asked the city administrative office to conduct a study  to determine if the 9% rate hike that is set to take effect if the rationing  program were approved is needed to offset increased costs.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Upjohn Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Upjohn Company (Upjohn) submitted a petition to exempt six of its pharmaceutical products that are currently sterilized using CFC&hyph;12 from the labeling requirements. The products are Hydrocortisone, Isoflupredone Acetate, Methylprednisolone acetate, Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Neomycin Sulfate and Prednisolone Hydrous USP. The company has submitted a request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept Spectinomycin Hydrochloride, a non-ozone-depleting substance, as a replacement for CFC&hyph;12. The alternative is currently used by Upjohn to sterilize some of its other products; however, FDA review and evaluation is required before it can make a change. Therefore, Upjohn is submitting this petition based on the premise that the above mentioned products are not currently or potentially available until FDA approval is obtained. There are no environmental concerns identified with this substitution; the company clearly has an alternative which it has instituted in other applications and requires additional time before it can use the substitute in the above applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without an exemption, the company asserts that it would be required to label the five products until FDA concludes its review, which would result in a substantial financial loss with little if any environmental benefit. The company also maintains that by labeling its five products while FDA reviews their submission, users could become confused by the warning statement and could decide to discontinue use of the products against the advice of their physicians. Upjohn indicates that such an outcome could result in increased absenteeism from work and potentially severe negative health effects and expenses incurred by society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. DuPont  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DuPont currently manufactures a fine synthetic fiber using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC&hyph;11). DuPont began searching for an alternative in 1987 and initiated a research and development (R&amp;D) program to find an alternative substance for the CFC&hyph;11. The R&amp;D program was comprised of the following activities: identifying all non-CFC candidates for replacements; acquiring or fabricating (where none were commercially available) all potential candidates for testing; conducting tests to ascertain that each candidate possessed the desired properties; further evaluating those which passed the initial tests in laboratory reviews; performing additional examinations once the candidates passed the laboratory tests; then performing testing to determine the acceptability of the test product. For six years, DuPont has researched over 100 potential candidates which hold specific properties required for production of the fiber. This search has included all reasonable chemical classes including (but not limited to): HCFCs, HFCs, perfluorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and amines. After consideration of these and other potential alternatives, Dupont determined that no drop-in or replacement compound (i.e. a substitute that does not require retrofitting of equipment) for the current manufacturing process was possible. Dupont identified only one or two possible replacement candidates, which will require complete testing and development and which, even if successful, will require specially designed and engineered new production facilities. All of the unsuccessful replacement candidates failed to possess at least one of the physical and chemical properties needed in the manufacturing process. The critical properties include corrosion characteristics, critical temperature, toxicity, boiling point and ozone depletion potential. Moreover, use of the possible non-CFC replacement at the current manufacturing facilities is not compatible with the existing plant process and permits, as well as OSHA and other safety code restrictions. Thus, testing of any non-CFC replacement must occur at new specially designed and engineered facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although a candidate substance has been identified as a possible substitute, Dupont continues to face various technical difficulties in implementing a new process change. Once a substitute is identified as a possible replacement, pilot testing of the candidate in a smaller version of a large-scale production facility, the preparation of the design of the larger facilities, and construction of the plants must ensue in order for the alternative to be tested for large scale production. DuPont has obtained the necessary local, state and Federal operating permits and general approval from the appropriate environmental authorities to design, construct and test the pilot plant which will further verify the production technology and equipment, the new process, and establish new procedures and practices for the facility operators. In May 1993, this specially engineered and constructed pilot plant was constructed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DuPont indicates that it will spend millions of dollars over the next several years for implementation and production trials in the new facilities. Two years of development activities are planned for the pilot facility in order to test and refine the manufacturing process. The plant continues to be modified as the need for technical adjustments arise from the trial runs. This occurs simultaneously with the design of the first facility, selection of a contractor and construction of the facility. There will be additional actions required to prepare for the first round of commercial production trials once the facility is built. DuPont will need to certify that each end use for the new fiber product meets the standards of each customer base, including industry, local, state, and Federal standards. The standards vary, requiring distinct examinations in order to determine whether for each end use, the product is capable of the same performance standards as the product made with a CFC. In addition, personnel require retraining, a new workforce is necessary to carry out the tests for product standards and certifications, and process control systems need monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DuPont contends that until all of the plants have been constructed, fully evaluated for their productability, and full-scale production of the saleable fiber product has been initiated following completion of the standards testing, no substitute is potentially available. Because of these various technical difficulties in design, and process changes to accommodate further investigation of the potential alternative, the Agency concurs that Dupont has subsequently shown that an alternative is neither potentially nor currently available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although DuPont estimates it will be unable to meet the global demand for its product by the end of 1996, the substitute would then be considered to be potentially available, as some of the plants will have undergone equipment quality checks and production tests and begun producing the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Commissioner tests water for young jobless scheme A EUROPE-WIDE scheme to guarantee the young unemployed skills and work experience will be put forward today by Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner. In a speech in Barcelona to European employment agency advisers, Mr Flynn will call for 'mainstream Community funding' to complement national schemes for unemployed school-leavers, which he refers to as a new 'lost generation'. 'We must stop this rot. If we do not, Europe's future into the 21st century is one of irreversible decline and social disintegration, Mr Flynn says. The scheme would be targeted on the 5m youngsters in the EC with no secondary school or vocational qualification, whose chances of getting a job are four times worse than that of their peers. Mr Flynn wants Community backing 'to reinvent the notion of apprenticeship Europe-wide.' His Youth Start scheme, if it won support from the Commission and member states, would be introduced at national level but co-ordinated at European level, in co-operation with governments, companies, unions, education and training organisations. It would also be cross-border, with participants taking part in work and training projects, including learning languages, for six to nine months in other EC countries. Mr Flynn singles out environmental protection, urban regeneration and cultural projects as particular areas where it could be focused. The commissioner's advisers acknowledge this is 'by no means a fully-fledged policy proposal,' but that 'we want to see what sort of reaction we get'. 'All this would cost money,' Mr Flynn acknowledges, but 'there is also a huge cost attached to doing nothing. More than anything at this stage, I am looking for political commitment to do better by our youth.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, March 11 (TANJUG)--The U.N. Security  Council on Thursday called on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  to return to Bulgaria the convoy of barges, crew, and cargo  (6,000 tonnes of oil are claimed to be in question) which  arrived in the Serbian port of Prahovo on the Danube last  weekend.    News agencies have reported that the Bulgarian barges were  hijacked by armed men and forced to go to Prahovo.    The Security Council has prepared a statement in which it  condemns what it calls an extremely dangerous act, but says that  it is yet to be determined who was responsible for it. The  council has, however, decided not to adopt the statement but  instead to call on Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew and  cargo.    In a letter to the Security Council and later in a meeting  with council president Jean-Bernard Merimee, Yugoslav Ambassador  to the U.N. Dragomir Djokic stressed that Yugoslavia did not  know of any hijacking and that the convoy of barges had normally  arrived in Prahovo and undergone a routine check there.    Djokic said that Bulgaria had informed Yugoslavia only after  over 24 hours that the Han Kubrat tugboat had been hijacked and  that Yugoslavia immediately took the necessary steps and opened  an investigation.    Djokic said that there were not only 21 crew members on  board  the tugboat, but also seven passengers, of whom five with  Bulgarian passports which were in order, while two passengers  had to be detained because their papers were not in order.    Djokic has said that Merimee thanked the Yugoslav Government  for the information it had provided so far and the assistance it  had offered in the clearing up of the case, but set out that the  Security Council expected Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew  and cargo to Bulgaria by the beginning of next week.</p>

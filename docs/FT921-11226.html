			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: Egypt in the raw DOWN TO THE SEA by Gamil Atia Ibrahim Quartet Books Pounds 14.95, 220 pages NEAR THE limestone Muqattam hills in the south east of Cairo lies the City of the Dead. This complex of mausolea, small houses and tombs now houses a million inhabitants. They first started coming to Cairo from the countryside in the 1960s lured by the hopes of work generated by Nasser's socialist policies. But they found no housing and turned this area into a city of the living which has been as good as legalised by the state. These inhabitants - the 'sea' - are the main players. Dr Sabir, one of the main characters, describes where they live: 'The sea of Cairo. The sea of the cemetery. This is the real sea. Hell. The poor. The hungry. Thieves. Rich men. Traders. Prostitutes. Perverts. Drugs. A strange, mad world, full of good people.' They are the raw material of the Egyptian nation and strive through education and hard work to break free of this 'sea' and cross to the better life they believe can be had on the west bank of the Nile. There is no one hero to this book but several, whose lives and aspirations move in circles which from time to time touch each other. This is described in the style of the realist school of the Egyptian novel, of which Neguib Mahfouz, the Nobel prize winner, was the pioneer. Ibrahim resembles Mahfouz in that his focus is on the struggles of the poorer classes, but his style is more abrupt and elliptical. One central character is Sayyid, a son of the cemetery, who lies in a hospital, itself a metaphor for Egypt's decay, after losing a foot in a train accident. He has experienced most of the events of Egypt's modern history, from Nasser's revolution in 1952 to Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977. He has time, sometimes in a half-drugged state, to review his life and disillusionment with politics. He flirts sensuously with Lawahiz, an upper class woman, a former love, and Zaynab, a laboratory technician. For Girgis the Copt, who looks after the hospital archives, her face becomes that of the Virgin Mary. The narratives are deliberately complex. Some of the characters, such as Lawahiz, have never been down to the sea, but recognise that they should go there. Not all escape the sea. Shatara, a wily, illiterate odd-job man, inspired by hashish only manages to dream of making his fortune from selling the hospital's archives. Umm Ismail, a professional wailing woman, briefly glimpses another life through a bit part trilling at a TV wedding. Throughout their varied experiences, there run humour and scenes of sexuality which ring true but would be rejected by Moslem puritans. Dr Sabir, from a cemetery family, is deliberately presented as a Nasser-like figure. He left the 'sea' to become a doctor and make money , but he returned to set up a clinic for its inmates. Like Nasser, he dies in his fifties from overwork and his funeral is similar in the depth of his mourners' grief. Ibrahim has contrived tales of frustration and of resources either untapped or exhausted. He has portrayed deftly the manners and customs of this special class of Egyptians and the translator, Frances Liardet, has succeeded in making it an English book without sacrificing its Arabness.</p>

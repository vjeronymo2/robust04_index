			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Indocement in diversification move INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's largest quoted company, has announced conditional acquisitions totalling Rp720bn (Dollars 848m). The purchases, which are in food and property, will diversify Indocement away from the cement sector in which it accounts for 52 per cent of national capacity. The principal acquisition is PT Bogasari Flour Mills, an integrated flour milling company with an estimated 85 per cent market share in wheat flour and cash-flow of about Rp160bn a year. The purchase cost of Rp1,179bn includes the assumption of about Rp350bn of debt, a cash payment of Rp220bn and the issuance of long-term promissory notes totalling Dollars 300m. Indocement will also acquire a 51 per cent stake in the Indofood Group for Rp777bn; the group of nine principal companies and 20 subsidiaries produces more than 140 products and is a leading producer of instant noodles. The final acquisition is Wisma Indocement, an 23-storey office building in central Jakarta for which the company is paying Dollars 56m. Analysts expressed surprise that there had been no mention of likely purchases at the annual general meeting held earlier this month. Indocement said the purchases would be paid out of cash resources of Rp400bn and long-term borrowing of Rp1,320bn, giving it a debt-to-equity ratio of 132 per cent. Brokers said a new share issue was likely within a year.</p>

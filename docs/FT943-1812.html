			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: India's economic progress merits support and praise Sir, Your article 'Not nearly radical enough' (September 19) misses the point by a mile. Stefan Wagstyl's conclusion that prime minister Narasimha Rao 'seems to have lost his sense of urgency' is unfair and unhelpful: unfair because Mr Rao of all people has been responsible for positive and dramatic changes in the Indian economy; unhelpful because the changes that are being effected need understanding and support, not sly criticism. One of the main problems that 'Commerce India' faces is a dearth of a constant power supply. For example, five years ago in West Bengal it was impossible to count on more than two consecutive hours of electricity, so poor was the system. Now, in Calcutta, if there is a power cut it is met with genuine annoyance rather than simple resignation. This improvement is due to the deregulation that has allowed the privately controlled R P Goenka company to run the utility properly - a deregulation promulgated by Mr Rao. Earlier this month we, through our Ashok Leyland subsidiary, together with National Power of the UK, started laying the foundations of a Pounds 1.2bn, 1,000 megawatt coal-fired power station in Andhra Pradesh. Again, the support of the prime minister for this - and six other large power plant developments throughout India - is crucial in the country's progress towards a consistent and reliable supply of energy to run the shipyards, steel mills, refineries and fertiliser plants of the present and the future on an economic basis. And it is the country's response to a recent World Bank report that saw Indian industry working at only 50 per cent capacity because of ludicrously poor energy creation and supply. The political and economic movement away from crushing and overweening state involvement based heavily on the 'licence-raj' will take time. I believe that Mr Rao and the people of India should be applauded and encouraged for their progress and not, dare I say, damned with faint praise.

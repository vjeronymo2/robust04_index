			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zdenko Vranjes] </F>   [Text] The joint declaration on launching the process of  normalizing relations between the Republic of Croatia and  Serbia, i.e., Yugoslavia, is a peaceful and diplomatic step of  exceptional importance, whose global positive effects will form  the framework for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina war.  This is said in a letter which the prime minister of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna, Jadranko Prlic, today sent to Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic. The government of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna also supports the agreement on lasting  peace between Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  confirms its readiness to work on the consistent implementation  of that agreement, the letter says. We would like the Muslim  side to sign a similar bilateral or tripartite agreement on  ending fighting and on peaceful negotiations in all future  relations. [passage omitted]</p>

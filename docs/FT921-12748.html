			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Budget boost is urged to avert car factory closures MOTOR TRADERS were warned yesterday that 'there are now real concerns' over possible car plant closures this year, with the possibility of new Japanese-owned factories leading to overcapacity and threatening the existence of UK manufacturers. Sir Hal Miller, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' chief executive and outgoing Tory MP for Bromsgrove, said that cuts in the tax burden on the industry were essential if it was to recover from its present decline. He was speaking as the society launched a campaign to raise awareness of the motor industry among MPs and election candidates. Measures it is suggesting in a pre-Budget submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, include abolition of the 10 per cent special car tax, higher price thresholds for the taxation of company cars and concessions on value added tax and national insurance contributions on the private use of company cars. Car and commercial vehicles sales have fallen by 30 per cent and 50 per cent respectively in the past two years. Sir Hal warned that, without a Budget stimulus, there was a risk of 'merely moving jobs from Dagenham to Derby'. Car production at Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby is due to start late this year, as is production at Honda's plant near Swindon, Wiltshire. In the past few days Nissan has announced plans to increase production from its Sunderland plant by 50,000 to 270,000 cars next year. The society is concerned about the severely depressed state of the UK market, and about weakening demand in main European export markets that have hitherto helped to keep UK car production relatively buoyant. That may lead to an overcapacity crisis later this year and put established plants such as Ford's Fiesta facility at Dagenham under pressure. Unofficial calculations by the society suggest that the abolition of special car tax might increase sales in a full year by 10 per cent. Since the the organisation has already forecast a 10 per cent rise in sales this year, to 1.75m units from 1.59m, abolition might therefore further increase the size of the market to about 1.88m units. However, the society is reviewing its forecast and may reduce it. Nevertheless, Sir Hal struck a note of optimism when he claimed he had 'very good reasons' for believing that Mr Lamont this year would act on at least some of the industry's submissions. At its meeting with the chancellor immediately after last year's Budget, the society had warned that higher VAT, company car taxation and retention of special car tax would significantly worsen the recession for the industry, with 70,000 jobs likely to be lost in the two-year period up to the middle of this year. Sir Hal said: 'It's turned out exactly the way we said it would.'</p>

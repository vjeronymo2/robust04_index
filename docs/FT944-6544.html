			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Eurotunnel attacks report by Klesch A row has erupted between Eurotunnel and Klesch &amp; Company, the London-based bank debt trader, over a report issued by Klesch called 'Eurotunnel Interim Results - Disaster Ahead'. The channel tunnel operator has written to Fimbra, the financial regulator, saying the report is 'seriously misleading and is plainly the product of serious negligence'. The letter by Mr Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, says 'there appear to me to be the plainest indications of a breach of your rule requiring reports of this sort to be fair and not misleading and consequently clear grounds for an investigation'. Mr Gary Klesch, founder of the debt-trading firm, said there was 'nothing wrong with the report . . . We stand by it.' He complained that Eurotunnel had consistently refused to co-operate with his firm's analysts when they were preparing reports and that there was 'no hint that Fimbra is taking the complaint seriously'. Mr Klesch urged the company 'to use the courts' if it believed the report was seriously in error. Mr Corbett believes that the report is in part responsible for Eurotunnel's bank debt being quoted in the secondary market at 60p in the pound. A number of Eurotunnel's 200 bank creditors have become concerned about the low market price for these loans. As a result, Mr Corbett has also written to Mr Anthony Jarrett, who co-ordinates Eurotunnel's relationship with its banks, asking him to inform them it has 'filed a formal complaint' against Klesch &amp; Company. The Klesch report, written last month, forecasts that the group runs out of cash next year and has a Pounds 423m deficiency at the end of 1998. Mr Corbett says this is 'fundamentally wrong' because Klesch omits from its calculation 'any utilisation of the Pounds 647m of new senior debt (raised this summer)' and also takes no account of a further Pounds 49m guaranteed from the exercise of warrants by Transmanche Link, the contracting consortium, and its adviser, Swiss Banking Corporation. Mr Corbett says that, even on pessimistic assumptions, the group would have 'Pounds 273m of unused facilities' at the end of 1998. Heron vote, Page 24</p>

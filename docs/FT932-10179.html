			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / EBRD directors demand spending inquiry THE COMMITTEE looking into allegations of overspending at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has proposed a sweeping inquiry which will look at most aspects of the bank's spending policies, including 'special flight arrangements'. The committee has recommended that four international firms of auditors be asked to tender for the role of adviser. The bank's own external auditors, Deloitte Touche and Tohmatsu will not be among them. The terms of reference drawn up at a meeting of the EBRD's board of directors yesterday are rigorous and include what the document describes as an 'arms length' relationship with the bank's management during the inquiry given the sensitivity of its work. This, says the document, requires ' strict adherence to confidentiality and independence.' Mr Claes de Neergaard, Chairman of the Audit Committee, which includes EBRD directors, has proposed that, in addition to external auditors, outside quantity surveyors and architects should be appointed 'to ensure the appearance of absolute independence and objectivity'. The committee, which will meet in closed session, has asked for between Pounds 200,000-300,000 to carry out its investigation. It plans to deliver its report by July 15 although there is scope for it to carry on longer. The bank yesterday declined to comment on the audit committee's proposals for how it wished to conduct its inquiry. Mr Attali is also believed to have accepted that the committee should look at the bank's use of private jets. The inquiry was set up after widespread calls from the bank's international shareholders following revelations in the Financial Times of expenditure of Pounds 55.5m by the bank on its London headquarters. The committee's remit on the EBRD's headquarters expenses will include, but not be limited to, a review of: The adequacy of the procedures for tendering and procurement to ensure that services and goods were processed and payments were made in a regular and proper fashion so as to obtain proper value for money *the cost effectiveness of the specification for the project as a whole *the adequacy of the arrangements for reporting progress on the project to the board of directors *the adequacy of the arrangements for managing the project, both within the bank and between the main contracting parties taking account of best practice in the European Community *looking at whether the bank's policy and procedures with respect to fitting out the temporary headquarters at Leadenhall Street were justified.</p>

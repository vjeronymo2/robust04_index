			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Beijing TV carried live Premier Li Peng's speech at a </F> get-together for Spring Festival group greetings in Beijing on  10 February 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Feb (XINHUA) Comrades, friends:    At this moment when we bid farewell to the old year and  greet  the new one and when the whole nation jointly celebrates the  spring festival, I, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council, extend New Year's greetings to everyone  present here; happy New Year to the people of all nationalities  in the country, to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and  to Overseas Chinese; and cordial greetings to international  friends who care for and support China's modernization.    The year 1993 was one in which we implemented in an  all-around way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines and  triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. We have made important achievements in  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. A new  situation has emerged in all fields of work. The national  economy has maintained its momentum of rapid growth. Positive  results have been made in macroeconomic regulation and control  measures adopted in conjunction with efforts to solve some  difficulties and contradictions in the economic development.  Our agriculture has produced good a harvest, and all aspects of  our economic work in the countryside have developed. The  industry has grown rapidly. Enterprise efficiency has risen to  some extent. The investment structure has improved. Our  transportation, electric power, telecommunications, and other  key construction sectors have scored remarkable results. The  urban and rural markets are abundant with colorful goods, and  business is brisk. The people's livelihood has continued to  improve. In line with the demands of building a socialist  market economic structure, we have continued to deepen reform.  As a result, the relationship between economic sectors has  become more rational, the pace of our opening up to the outside  world has accelerated, our import and export trade has steadily  increased, and foreign investment has risen by a big margin.  The building of socialist spiritual civilization, democracy,  and the legal system has strengthened. Science and technology  have achieved major breakthroughs. Education has steadily  developed. Culture, arts, press, publication, radio,  television, sports, public health, and other undertakings have  all expanded in the process of reform. In the turbulent,  changing international environment, our great socialist  motherland has seen economic growth, political stability,  national unity, and social progress, and is standing towering  like a giant in the East.    Comrades, friends: The year 1994 will be one in which the  national economy will maintain its momentum of sound  development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to  push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an  all-round way the guidelines of the 14th CPC National congress  and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  accelerate the building of a socialist market economic  structure, maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development  of the national economic, safeguard political stability, and  promote social progress in an all-round way.    We should unswervingly carry out economic construction as  the central task. We should seek new ways for economic  development. We should bring economic construction onto the  track of relying on scientific and technological progress and  the improved quality of workers. We should concentrate our  efforts on structural readjustment and the improvement of  efficiency. Food is the first necessity of the people. At no  time must we relax our efforts in agriculture. We must develop  the rural economy in an all-round manner and strive to do  everything possible to reap a good agricultural harvest this  year. We must ensure the steady and increased production of  grain, cotton, and oil. We should try in every possible way to  increase incomes for farmers so as to improve their living  standards.    Conscientious efforts should be made to effectively run  large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and to increase their  vitality. Enterprises should be market-oriented, and they should  readjust their product mix and produce marketable goods. They  should step up their technical transformation and strengthen  their operations and management to ensure the maintenance and  increase of the value of state-owned assets.    We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation  and  control, rationally control the scale of capital construction,  and strive to maintain a basic balance between total demand and  total supply. At the same time, we should further deepen the  structural reform in education, science and technology, and  culture so as to promote the development and thriving of other  undertakings.    The Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central  Committee made the blueprint for establishing a socialist market  economic structure, which is the program of action for us to  further deepen reform. The main tasks of reform this year are:    1. To effectively organize the implementation of major  measures for fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other  reforms and establish and improve the system of macroeconomic  regulation and control;    2. To continuously change the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises and seek effective ways for establishing  a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of the  socialist market economy; and    3. To appropriately advance price reform after giving full  consideration to the tolerance of the different sectors of  society and develop and perfect the market system.    Our reform tasks this year are arduous. But we can certainly  ensure the smooth development of various reforms provided we  work together with one heart, carefully organize our efforts,  coordinate with one another, and promptly handle contradictions  discovered on the road of advance according to the principles  and arrangements set by the party Central Committee and the  State Council.    We should continue to open wider to the outside world,  making  use of more foreign capital, technology, and managerial  expertise. We should further develop foreign trade and  exchanges and cooperation [with other countries] in science and  technology, education, culture, and other fields.    Now our country has such good conditions as opportunity, a  favorable geographical position, and the support of the people  [tian shi di li ren he]. Our national economy is growing  steadily and rapidly [chi xu kuai su zeng zhang]. It is  estimated that our market has a tremendous potential. It can be  expected that there will be very good prospects for our economic  and technological cooperation with various countries of the  world.    Comrades and friends: Seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability are the major principle for our country's work this  year [called the 20-character principle]. All fields of work  must be subordinated to and serve these interests. We should  promote reform of the economic structure during the rapid growth  of the national economy; at the same time, we should also  maintain the steady growth of the national economy during the  transformation of the economic structure. Therefore, we must  conscientiously and properly handle the relationship between  reform, development, and stability. We should uphold the  principle of grasping two links at the same time and putting  stress on both links. While concentrating our efforts on  economic reform and development, we should continue to do a good  job in strengthening the building of the CPC, and vigorously  strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We  should develop socialist democracy, strengthen the legal system,  deepen the anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve  public-order problems in a comprehensive way to create a  favorable environment for reform and development.    On festive occasions, more than ever we think of our dear  ones far away. As we celebrate the Spring Festival with  jubilation, we think more than ever of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Macao compatriots and Overseas Chinese. Promoting reunification  of the motherland in line with the concept of peaceful  reunification and one country, two systems is the common  aspiration of all Chinese people.    In the past year, there was sustained development in  economic  cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and  personnel exchanges and other kinds of exchanges increased  gradually. We reached initial understanding in our talks on  routine matters. We are happy about that and hope the Taiwan  side will put national interest above everything else and work  together with us to develope cross-strait relations and to  promote peaceful reunification of the motherland.    The dates are getting nearer for our country to resume its  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. Cooperation between China  and Portugal on the Macao issue is progressing smoothly at  present. We are satisfied with that.    The British side is responsible for the termination of talks  between the Chinese and British Governments. We hope the  British Hong Kong Authority will not sink deeper and deeper into  the wrong path. No matter what unexpected turn [bo zhe] things  take, the Chinese Government and people have the determination  and ability to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong according to  schedule, and they are also fully confident of maintaining  long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.    Comrades and friends,    In the past year, the Chinese Government has unswervingly  pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. We have made  new achievements in foreign affairs work. Our country continued  to expand friendly ties with other countries in the world, its  international standing continued to rise gradually, and it  played important roles in international affairs. We made  friends all over the world.    The Chinese Government and people, as always, will continue  to join the governments and peoples of various countries in  making unremitting efforts to strive for the establishment of a  fair and reasonable new international political and economic  order, to safeguard world peace, and to promote common  development.    Comrades and friends,    We feel tremendously proud when we look back at the past,  and  we are full of confidence when we look to the future. We are  faced with excellent opportunities for reform and opening up,  and the prospects for socialist modernization are incomparably  bright. Let us -- under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang  Zemin as the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic  line, strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the  whole country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle,  and strive for new victories in socialist modernization!</p>

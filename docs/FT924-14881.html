			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shimizu to cut its UK operations SHIMIZU, a leading Japanese building contractor, plans to sell four UK office buildings and close two UK subsidiaries as part of a restructuring of international operations that will lessen its role as a developer of new projects. The company, under pressure in markets at home and abroad, will also close two Australian subsidiaries and plans to announce extraordinary losses of Y72.9bn (Dollars 609m) for the year to the end of March. However, Shimizu still expects a pre-tax profit of Y125bn, though that may be revised. S. C. Properties (UK), S. C. Investment (UK), Shimizu Australia and S. C. Properties (Australia) are likely to be closed, though Shimizu emphasised it would still have a role as a contractor in both markets. Like most other Japanese construction companies, Shimizu will be more selective about capital participation in UK building projects. The company would not identify which buildings are to be sold, although Japanese newspapers reported that it was expecting a loss of Y27.5bn on the sales. 'We never expected that the worldwide recession would be so serious. This recession is the cause of the closures,' Shimizu said. 'In the future, we will have to be more cautious about involvement as developers. We don't want to stop being a developer, but we will be more careful.' Apart from empty buildings in foreign markets, Shimizu has been bruised by the downturn in the domestic property market. Building orders for the Japanese industry fell 15 per cent last year, and 31.5 per cent in the second quarter this year, compared with the same period last year. Japanese contractors hope the recently-announced emergency economic package will stimulate the property market, while orders for public works investment is due to increase in coming months, providing extra sales for the construction industry. Other Japanese developers, including Kumagai Gumi, Daikyo and EIE International, have scaled down their European and Australian operations and are attempting to sell buildings in these troubled markets. The companies expanded their international exposure in the mid-1980s, and their ambitions were fuelled by the ease of raising funds in an overheated domestic market in the late 1980s.</p>

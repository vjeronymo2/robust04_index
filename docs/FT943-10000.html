			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Arts: Openings PESARO The annual Rossini festival in this exquisite walled town on the Adriatic opens on Thursday with a new production of L'Italiana in Algeri. Roger Norrington makes his Pesaro debut conducting a revival of Semiramide, and Graham Vick joins forces with Carlo Rizzi for a staging of L'inganno felice, the only rarity this year. EDINBURGH After winning an international reputation overseas, the Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles returns home to open this year's festival with a performance of Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony. The Edinburgh Festival Theatre has at last become a reality and the festival is celebrating with two wildly contrasting composers of the year, Beethoven and Chabrier. SCOTALAND: NATIONAL GALLERY 'Monet to Matisse: Landscape Painting in France, 1874-1914' opens at the National Gallery of Scotland on Thursday. This is one of the most ambitious exhibitions mounted by the Gallery, ranging from the famous to lesser known artists like Devambex, who took advantage of the bi-plane to produce one of the first aerial paintings of the countryside. INNSBRUCK Best known as a ski centre, this Austrian town is developing a parallel reputation for its summer baroque and early music festival which takes place in region's historic buildings. This year's festival, opening on Sunday, celebrates the 350th anniversary of Heinrich Biber, the 17th century Bohemian composer who worked in Salzburg. LONDON THEATRE Opening at the Greenwhich Theatre on Monday is the recent New York hit The Sisters Rosenweig, by Wendy Wasserstein. This British production, directed by Michael Blakemore, stars Maureen Lipman, Janet Suzman and Lynda Bellingham. BRECON JAZZ The beard and beret set head for the hills at the weekend for Brecon Jazz, the most convivial of music festivals. Benny Carter and Slide Hampton are the main attractions, but there's plenty of atmosphere in the side streets and smaller venues of the Welsh market town</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Addressing a large and very enthusiastic  gathering this morning of the people of Kokiluyeh va Buyer,  Ahmad Province, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: [passage  omitted] God is not happy with the tribal disputes in this  province; and I, as your brother, am not happy with this  situation either. Such unacceptable customs should be abandoned.    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i criticized and rejected  tyranny against women and girls in some regions of this province  and said: Islam hates and detests any man who subjects his wife  or daughter to cruelty. The Prophet of God condemns any man who  relies on his physical ability to oppress a woman. The ugly and  un-Islamic tradition practiced in some regions of the province,  where girls are forced to marry against their will, must also  end, because God's blessings are conditional and will only come  to those who observe Islamic ethics and divine instructions.    Referring to the all-embracing propaganda and political  efforts of the enemies of Islam and the intensification of the  economic sanctions against the country, the leader of the  Islamic revolution said: The enemy is trying to make the Iranian  people despondent, to turn their backs on Islam. The enemy  intends to create division among the people and the officials  and intends to weaken the spirit of work and endeavor among the  people. Despite all the hostile efforts against Islam's  sovereignty, the spirit of faith, enthusiasm, allegiance to the  Islamic Republic, hope for the future, and determination to  continue the path of the revolution and the imam is observed in  every corner of Iran. [passage omitted].    The esteemed leader also described the claim of the United  States to be the leader of the world's nations as a futile  dream, a false hope. He said: Today it has become clear to the  Americans, to their allies, and to their rivals in Europe and  Asia -- and even to affiliated weak states -- that neither the  United States nor any other power can lead other nations,  because the nations will never again submit to oppression and  imposed puppet leaders. The events in Palestine, in Africa, and  in Europe demonstrate that Westerners -- particularly Americans  -- cannot control the world. [passage omitted]</p>

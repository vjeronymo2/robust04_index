Planned parenthood, environmental protection,  and land administration are three basic national policies of  China. It is imperative to strengthen the sense of population  and the per capita concept, to include population control in the  overall plan for economic and social development, and to adhere  to grasping two categories of production simultaneously. It is  imperative to earnestly implement the Shaanxi provincial  regulations on planned parenthood, with the focus on doing a  good job in rural birth control. It is necessary to  continuously complete and perfect the responsibility system with  population target control, which must be under the charge of the  chief responsible leading member, who will bear the chief  responsibility. The system of veto without a ballot in birth  control must be implemented resolutely so as to guarantee the  fulfillment of the province's 1994 population plan.    Environmental protection has a direct bearing on economic  and  social development, and on people's physical well-being. It is  imperative to adopt powerful measures to cure the worsening of  the ecology; to adhere to the principle of harmonious  development of environmental protection and economic  construction; and to actively promote comprehensive urban and  rural environmental improvement, with the focus on improving  environmental pollution in Xian, Tongchuan, Yanan and the  Northern Shaanxi Energy Resources Development Zone, so as to  improve the environmental quality as quickly as possible. It is  necessary to continue to augment environmental monitoring and  control in order to avoid the surfacing of new sources of  environmental pollution. It is necessary to improve the rate of  handling industrial wastes, and to do a good job in protecting  the sources of drinking water.    We should further magnify control over land resources and  property management, and promote the rational allocation of land  resources. Farmland should be protected in a down-to-earth way;  the use of land for other than agricultural purposes must be  strictly controlled. It is necessary to actively promote  institutional reform in the use of state-owned land; the state  is to monopolize the first-grade urban land market, but will  lift control over and standardize the second-grade land market.  The system of assessing and making public basic land prices is  to be established.</p>

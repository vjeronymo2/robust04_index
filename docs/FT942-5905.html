			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Sad jubilee of a white paper Although most of the junkets which economic scribes are attending this summer relate to the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions  - the IMF and World Bank - and the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England, it is arguable that another anniversary is almost as important. I refer to that, last week, of the 1944 white paper on unemployment policy by the UK's wartime coalition government. This expressed the determination of British leaders not to return to the horrors of interwar unemployment. In the UK, as elsewhere, full employment was once an uncontroversial bipartisan objective, actually achieved between the end of the war and the early 1970s. A common feature of the platform of all the candidates for the Labour leadership is their expressed determination to restore full employment. This, of course, is easier said than done, as can be seen from the example of France, which has been mostly under Socialist rule since the early 1980s, but where unemployment is 2 1/2 percentage points higher than in the UK; or Sweden, which maintained low unemployment for much longer than most countries, but where the jobless rate has now soared to 8 1/2 per cent. It is, indeed, now quite usual for historically minded economists of all schools of thought to pay justified tribute to the wisdom and prescience of the white paper, which warned - decades in advance - of the difficulties that might occur. But at the time it was a compromise document. It trod a middle way between the apostles of Keynesian demand management in the economic section of the Cabinet Office and Treasury officials concerned to balance the budget at least over a business cycle, worried that the UK was at the mercy of world economic forces and anxious that the UK should pay its way in a harshly competitive postwar world. The white paper's famous first sentence began: 'The government accepts as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war.' Keynes thought this more important than the whole of the rest of the paper. But did the government accept such a commitment? It accepted responsibility for maintaining 'total demand for goods and services at a high level'. But this was coupled with the now-famous warning that 'policies to maintain demand will not work in securing high employment unless employers and workers exercise moderation in wage matters so that increased expenditure at the onset of a depression goes to increase employment rather than pay and prices'. But the white paper had few suggestions for ensuring moderation other than exhortations of the kind resorted to by postwar governments. Even when it came to maintaining total spending, the white paper had a less than total commitment. The authors were, for instance, obsessed with the external component of demand, which was not under British control. It is also easy to read back too much into the white paper. Its authors did not discuss clearly the choice between maintaining nominal and maintaining real demand. But read in context with the warnings about pay and prices, it is natural to interpret it in terms of maintaining demand in money terms, that is nominal demand. Demand management in real terms and 'funny money' control of public expenditure intruded as the official forecasters and statisticians began to cope with creeping postwar inflation. The aim of controlling aggregate expenditure needs to be reinstated. There is nothing in this aim which a common-sense monetarist should reject. After all, why does he believe in monetary targets? It is because he asserts that there is a stable relationship between the money supply, M, and total spending measured by MV (money x velocity) - which implies that he values a stable growth in the latter. Unfortunately the recent move to define macroeconomic policy entirely in terms of an inflation target is a step backwards. This is explained well by James Meade in his new pamphlet, Full Employment without Inflation (Social Market Foundation, Pounds 6). Suppose output were to drop in one year by 10 per cent, while inflation was just over 1 per cent. There would be no breach of the government's stated objective of keeping inflation in the 1 to 4 per cent band and no obligation to take countervailing action. Such action would  -at least on present official doctrine - have to await evidence of actual deflation. An objective for total expenditure would lead to earlier offsetting action. Maintaining adequate, but not excessive, monetary demand has two main functions. One is, as the last example shows, to prevent a downward spiralling slump; the other is to prevent a serious inflationary take-off by putting a lid on growth of total spending. Thus one big switch in thinking, compared to the white paper, is that demand management is today used to contain inflation, in place of the jaw-boning or industry-union talks the 1944 document envisaged. The term 'structural' - or, better, 'hard core' - can legitimately be used for that part of unemployment which cannot be permanently reduced by maintenance of demand. It is this element which has been rising from one business cycle to the next, and which is especially bad in Europe. The proximate explanation for this hard core is that pay and related costs make workers unprofitable to employ. With the clear failure of demand deficiency to account for the bulk of the rise in European unemployment since the early 1970s, attention has naturally turned to this aspect. If the price of any particular service is raised, less will be bought - both because purchasers can afford less and because they have an incentive to substitute something else. The emphasis of economists such as Patrick Minford of Liverpool University has been, however, not on monopoly labour pricing, as such, but on the level of benefit when out of work. These economists make the benefit ratio - that is, the ratio of benefits to average pay - the fulcrum of their whole explanation. The benefit level is supposed to provide the floor or reserve wage below which it does not pay to take a registered job. The pricing-out-of-work and benefit-level explanations come together in the assertion that, without the dole, pay rates would drop, as people would have to price themselves into work to survive. I prefer the pricing-out formulation because it leaves space for institutional, psychological and even moral forces, which - quite apart from the dole  - stop pay from shifting to market clearing levels. If governments rightly hesitate to attack the benefit floor, the one weapon with which they are left is sufficient flexibility in wages and other labour costs to price people into work. This is not a policy in the direct instrumental sense; but it involves taking every opportunity to break down labour market barriers of which union pay-setting is only one example. It is more or less consistent with the British government's approach to European labour markets, as opposed to proponents of the Social Chapter. Accepting the pricing-out-of-work explanation does not entail the advocacy of starvation wages. If market clearing pay rates are regarded as intolerably low, at least three courses are open. The first - the counsel of despair - is to accept high unemployment as an alternative. The second - counsel of perfection - is to try to raise the market value of workers' services by the nostra of education and training so that customary pay rates are no longer a threat to employment. The third is supplementary payments to lowly paid families. The real weakness of the pricing-out-of-work thesis, as often expounded, is its timelessness - a weakness rarely spotted by the critics. Why should there be so much more pricing-out-of-work in some periods than in others? Or, to put it in macroeconomic terms, why should the rate of unemployment consistent with non-accelerating inflation (the 'Nairu') have apparently been so low in the 1950s and 1960s and then risen so much in the later 1970s and in the 1980s? There are at least two reasons why unemployment could have remained so low in the early post-war decades. First there was the persistence of 'money illusion' - the surviving prewar belief that a pound was a pound and a dollar a dollar. Insufficient allowance was made for inflation in pay and price behaviour; and so it was possible to run national economies with much tighter labour markets than before or afterwards without triggering accelerating inflation. The second, and perhaps more interesting, reason is that postwar growth was a fairly straightforward process involving other countries catching up with best-practice, American techniques. Modest traditional pay relativities between industries, and between skilled and unskilled workers, were sufficient to balance the labour market. The inflationary outbreak of the 1970s shattered remnants of money illusion for generations to come. A slacker labour market was now needed to prevent pay and prices chasing each other upwards. The relative demand for different types of labour was still for a time stable enough for central European and Scandinavian countries with strong traditions of social solidarity to hold real wages in check at modest levels of unemployment. Thus demand management - whatever label was attached to it - could be switched to the struggle against inflation without large job losses. As the 1980s proceeded, however, the conditions required for these centralised agreements to work began to disappear. Traditional relativities between different industries and skills, or between areas of declining old-fashioned manufacturing industry and high-technology growth areas (for example, between north and south Germany), were no longer sufficient to clear labour markets. Meanwhile the rigidities imposed to obtain union consent for national economic policies became in some Continental countries an increasing drag on performance. The pressures that have come to the surface in Europe in unemployment and non-employment have expressed themselves in the US in pay stagnation and downward absolute movements among the lowest 20 or 30 per cent of wage earners. No wonder Meade suggested that, to create 2m more jobs in Britain, average real wages would not merely have to be 'restrained' but actually to fall. How, then, can the rest of us top up the wages of the lower paid so that they can price themselves into work? The high marginal cut-off rates which create the poverty trap stem from the speed at which benefits taper off as incomes rise. If the system aims for the greatest generosity at lowest cost, the withdrawal rate is likely to be extremely high. On the other hand, if benefits are tapered off very gradually, poverty trap effects are reduced; but either the cost is prohibitively expensive or the benefits are far too low. The best chance of advance is to act where the social security system unnecessarily discourages workers from accepting low-paid jobs or employers from offering them. Any government could quite inexpensively take a first step and extend the top-up for low income earners, known as family credit, to single people and childless households. This move would cost it about Pounds 350m a year in 1994 - trivial by the standards of modern public finance. It would also help if the withdrawal rate for income support for adults of working age could be reduced below 100 per cent and brought in line with the 70 per cent taper used for other income-related benefits. Specifically, it would encourage people to take spasmodic, casual or part-time jobs that did not qualify them for family credit, and to do so on a legal basis. Changes could also be made so that assessment for income-related benefit resembled tax assessment rather than a medieval inquisition. This discussion has moved from monetary policy via labour market details to the arcane area of social security. The range indicates a little of the ground a new employment white paper would have to cover. I would feel more comfortable if we could replace all this with one big idea. But modest ideas with a chance of being right are better than big ideas which are wrong.</p>

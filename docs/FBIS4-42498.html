			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Trenin, political scientist and </F> Russian military officer, by Dieter Wulf; place and date not  given: "No Reason To Fear Russia"]    [Text] [Wulf] What form could partner-like cooperation  between Russia and NATO assume?    [Trenin] In general, the Russian Government is prepared to  sign the framework agreement on a Partnership for Peace treaty.  However, it wants an improvement in the consultation mechanisms,  especially following the experiences the Russians have had with  NATO regarding the dispute between the Serbs and Bosnians over  Gorazde. If one concludes a partnership agreement, the partners  should also consider mutual interests. If, for example, the  Russian military believed that it had to act in the Caucasus,  then they should consult NATO beforehand. Of course, things  must function the other way around as well.    [Wulf] In the Russian military doctrine that was approved a  few months ago, there is no mention at all of renouncing first  use of nuclear weapons. Does this mean that Western Europe  faces a nuclear threat once again?    [Trenin] In 1987, Gorbachev renounced first use of nuclear  weapons, but provided no guarantees. I think that the present  concepts are more realistic. Nuclear weapons solely serve a  deterrence function. In conventional terms, Russia is much  weaker today, and that causes concern among our military. We  are living in a time of great uncertainty, and if conventional  capacity is drastically reduced, that automatically enhances the  value of nuclear components.    [Wulf] Would you not agree that there are dangers, such as  the ultra right-wing politician Zhirinovskiy, that justify a  fear of Russia?    [Trenin] I personally consider Zhirinovskiy to be a  political clown. Zhirinovskiy himself is less of a danger than  some of his supporters in parliament who are considered  respectable now. We should not do these people a favor by  reviving the old myths about Russian imperialism. At the  moment, I see no reason why Russia should be considered a threat  to Europe.    [Wulf] The farewell ceremony to mark the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Germany is a sensitive issue at the present  time. What do the Russians think about that.    [Trenin] To the regular soldiers, it does not matter at all  whether the farewell ceremony takes place in Weimar or in  Berlin. What is of greater concern to them is that the military  leadership is finding it increasingly difficult to find  accommodation for the troops returning to Russia. However, the  farewell question is, of course, a very important political  symbol for the military and political leadership. If the  feeling is created that Russia has no friends in the West, that  will certainly not be in Germany's interest.    [Wulf] Does that mean that the new option that has been  agreed with Yeltsin will send the right signals?    [Trenin] The current option is very positive, but it is  still very far removed from the Russians' original expectations.  I can fully understand why the Russian troops should not take  part in joint ceremony with the Western allies. Nevertheless,  the Germans should consider the political consequences of that.</p>

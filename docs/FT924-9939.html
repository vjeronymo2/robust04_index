			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / People: Bond to run HSBC from London HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong Bank and Midland, yesterday announced the appointment of John Bond, the bank's head of operations in the US, as group chief executive officer, as from January 1. Bond, who is 51, will take over the reins from William Purves, 60, who will stay on as chairman of the group. Bond will be the first chief executive to run the bank from London, rather than Hong Kong where it was founded in the 1840s. Purves is expected to move to London next autumn. Bond joined Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in 1961. He has had a copybook career, serving extensively throughout south east Asia and Hong Kong, but his career as a senior executive of the bank has been one of troubleshooter. In 1983 he was brought in to head Wardley, the bank's merchant banking arm, which was recovering from scandal surrounding the collapse of the Carrian property group in the early 1980s. When Purves was deputy chairman of the bank, he had been responsible for a review of management and standards and is thought to have recommended Bond for the job. In June 1991, he was appointed president and chief executive officer of Marine Midland Banks, based in Buffalo, New York state. Until his arrival, Marine suffered chronic losses and required frequent capital injections from its Hong Kong parent. It had been hit particularly hard by the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s and the collapse in the US property market in the late 1980s. Bond conducted a review of the bank's operations which led to deep staff cuts, and the quitting of unprofitable lines of business. The result is that Marine - once a leading money centre bank - has been redefined as an up-state New York lender to small and medium-sized business; it made a Dollars 73.5m profit in the first nine months of this year compared with a Dollars 166.2m loss in the same period of 1991. HSBC also announced that John Gray, who was appointed chief executive of Hongkong Bank at the beginning of this year, will become chairman and chief executive of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation at the beginning of next year. James Cleave is to become president and chief executive officer of Marine Midland. ***** Hawtal Whiting, the Essex-headquartered vehicle design and engineering consultancy which now derives more than half its turnover from outside the UK, has achieved a minor coup. Coming on board as a non-executive director is Bill Hayden, the crusty former Ford of Europe manufacturing director whose final task, for the two years before retiring in April, was starting to sort out the manufacturing problems it had acquired when it bought Jaguar, as its chairman and chief executive. It was Hayden who on his arrival described manufacturing conditions at Jaguar as worse than in any plant he had seen outside a few Russian factories in Gorky. Never the world's best pr man - the 'Gorky' remarks did not work wonders for the morale of either its workers or Jaguar's new owners - Hayden, 62, nevertheless brings to Hawtal a wealth of manufacturing/engineering experience acquired with Ford since 1960. His manufacturing knowledge is of rapidly growing importance because vehicle design is becoming much more integrated with the manufacturing process through 'simultaneous' engineering.</p>

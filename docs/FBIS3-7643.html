The paper quoted a source in Beijing as saying that China,  which had earlier invited Kim, accepted the notification as a  refusal of its invitation.    The source was quoted as saying that North Korea is worried  about giving the impression that it fell under China's sway if  the nuclear problem had been resolved after Kim's visit.    Kim is especially conscious of South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam's trip to China and might have decided not to visit  Beijing in order to show that Chinese influence on North Korea  has its limits, the source said.    China, through a Communist party delegation which visited  Pyongyang late last month, invited Kim Il-song to come for  discussions on the nuclear issue as well as reform and opening,  according to the paper.    Given the close relationship between the two countries,  China's announcement on the invitation was exceptional,  according to the source.    ASAHI said China judged that Kim Il-song had come to the  conclusion that if he visited Beijing before the nuclear problem  was resolved, other countries would have the impression that  North Korea yielded to Chinese pressure.    Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said at a  press conference that Kim Il-song does not plan to visit China  in the near future.    China opposes economic sanctions against North Korea because  if such strong action was taken, the North might attack the  South in a final bid to survive, the Chinese source explained.</p>

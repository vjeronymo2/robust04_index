			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in  Spanish at 2113 GMT on 29 May broadcasts a live relay of a  36-minute news conference by President Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro and Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen with  unidentified reporters following a working meeting at San Juan  del Sur, Nicaragua.    In her opening statement, President Chamorro discusses the  topics they addressed at the meeting: "We have spoken about many  things. Great concern was expressed over preventive health  measures. We are going to work jointly on this. We are also  going to work jointly to prevent drug trafficking and money  laundering. We are also going to take steps to prevent problems  on our oceans and lakes. Fishing boats will be identified to  avoid problems in an attempt to prevent it from ever being said  again that Nicaragua seized a small boat or that Costa Rica  seized another. We do not want these problems." She adds:  "There is no protocol here, because I do not think Nicaragua and  Costa Rica need a protocol. What we want is brotherhood."    In his opening statement, President Figueres thanks  President  Chamorro for the invitation and notes the excellent relations  between their two countries, adding: "We hope to continue to  strengthen these relations, and, as a result of these meetings,  very specific solutions will be found to eliminate within the  next months and years those very small pebbles in our shoes --  small problems we sometimes have had in our bilateral relations."    Explaining the issues they discussed, Figueres indicates  that  they dealt with social, economic, and political matters. He  notes that they discussed programs against dengue fever and the  need to strengthen housing and sports programs. In terms of  economics, he reports they discussed bilateral trade: "I would  like to mention the challenges we are facing in bilateral  relations. Of course, we talked at length about trade. The  economy and agricultural ministers have been working in order  that, within 45 days, we will have clear and definite mechanisms  to remove the obstacles that have existed in our bilateral trade  and so that we can have a more productive and simpler trade  process."    Figueres states that he and Chamorro reviewed the problem of  cross-border smuggling, especially the problem of cattle  rustling, which has increased in recent years. He goes on to  state they also discussed fishing and tourism problems, adding:  "We want our ministries to find a mechanism to warn the boats of  one country that they are sailing in territorial waters of the  other country. The truth is that the boats are not acting with  ill-intent. They are not crossing the border on purpose. We  want to establish a means by which they know when they are  nearing the limits of their territorial waters, and, in turn, we  will no longer have the problems we are experiencing today."    In outlining the political issues they discussed, Figueres  says: "We talked about border issues and the opportunities our  common border provides in strengthening the ties between our  countries. We discussed the operating hours of border  checkpoints and decided to extend them, improving the border  crossing process for Nicaraguans, Costa Ricans, and foreign  tourists."    During the question and answer segment of the news  conference, President Chamorro replies to a reporter's question  on whether or not Nicaragua will accept the entry of Haitian  refugees as the U.S. Government has requested: "As far as  Nicaragua is concerned, as well as all Central Americans are  concerned, we have been presented with a minor suggestion from  Vice President Gore. We will decide on this. We are reviewing  it in advance of our next meeting in December, and, at that  time, we will announce the results of our review."    In answering the same question, President Figueres states:  "In Costa Rica's case, it is a situation we still have to review  with Presidency Minister Elias Soley and Foreign Minister  Fernando Naranjo. I believe that Costa Rica, as a country that  is always respectful of human rights, must study this carefully,  and that the appropriate forum to discuss this topic is one in  which all of the countries of the continent are present."</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Junk Bond Index Plunges: Reflecting what appears to be the worst month ever for  the volatile junk bond market, the Salomon Bros. high-yield market index fell  3.87% in August. The index's decline, its biggest on record, came amid weakness  in the overall bond and stock markets after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  In the junk bond market, some of the hardest hit securities were those of  companies in cyclical business such as National Gypsum Co., a building  materials firm, and Burlington Holdings, a textile maker.  </P></p>

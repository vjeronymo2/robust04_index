			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dick Ljungberg report: "SSU Voted No to EU"] </F>   [Excerpt] "At present I see only European Union [EU]  membership offering the possibility of working as a democratic  socialist," chairman Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson said when the  Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) held its extraordinary  congress on the EU on Saturday [4 June]. But he did not win  over to the yes line the 250 delegates who had gathered at  Cirkus in Stockholm.    Late on Saturday night after 12 hours of debate the congress  voted, as had been tipped, by 131 votes to 117 against EU  membership. Two delegates abstained.    Social Democratic Party secretary Mona Sahlin told  TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA after the vote that she has great  respect for the decision even through she herself takes a  different view of the EU question.    The SSU adopted a strategy that was more or less the same as  that of its Social Democratic mother party. At the regular SSU  congress last year it was decided that an extraordinary congress  should be held once the negotiations with the EU were complete.    The SSU leadership, like the party's, has spoken out in  favor  of membership. The SSU board was split: 10 for and 3 against  membership.    There is one decisive difference between the party and its  youth organization. The same delegates will attend the Social  Democrats' extraordinary congress 18-19 June as attended the  regular congress last year.    The SSU delegates -- the vast majority of them born in the  seventies -- had, however, been elected at annual conferences  around the country on the basis of their attitudes to the EU.  The SSU leadership had therefore a pretty clear picture of the  situation prior to Saturday's extraordinary congress.    The heavyweight delegations from Stockholm and Goteborg had  called for a no in their motions. Remarkably enough Skane  arrived with a delegation consisting entirely of no sayers,  while Norrbotten fielded a majority from the yes side. Usually  interest in EU membership becomes cooler the farther north in  the country one travels.    For the youth organization as for the mother party the  important thing is to keep ranks united in the future despite  the split on the EU question.    "There are those who hope that we will battle to the death  here today. They want nothing more than to see the SSU and the  Social Democratic movement politically wounded in the run-up to  this fall's Riksdag elections," Thorwaldsson said when he opened  the congress. "But they have underestimated our strength in  being able to hold dangerous free debates and then reach  decisions in comradeship."    He said that the congress was about whether the EU is the  right or the wrong way to go in order to achieve the common  goal: to tame market forces and set up rules for international  capitalism.    There were delegates who said that the SSU should not reach  any decision at all on the EU. After all the decision does not  tie members' hands in the referendum.    It was decided that the SSU will not be a campaigning  organization in the referendum, but members of the  organization's board will follow the organization's line when  they represent the SSU on the EU question.

He pointed out  that the government had sent a delegation to Nairobi to discuss  the organization of safe corridors with the rebel movement in  order to deliver relief to the needy in their areas. Ali Osman  Mohamed Taha said the rebel movement refused to open the roads  in the areas which it controls.    He added that in confirmation of its good intentions to stop  the war and achieve a lasting peace, the government had  responded to the request of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to  hold a meeting composed of a delegation from the government with  the rebel Garang as a preliminary step for new negotiations.  However, the rebel Garang (?reneged on his promise) [words  indistinct] which proves his lack of seriousness in the quest  for peace.

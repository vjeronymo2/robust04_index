			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ruling in Bhopal Case Upheld: The Indian Supreme Court upheld a law that made  the government the sole claimant for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, a  ruling that confirms an out-of-court settlement between India and Union Carbide  Corp. Lawyers representing gas victims had challenged the validity of the  out-of-court settlement, saying it denied claimants their constitutional right  of suing the U.S.-based multinational for history's worst industrial disaster.  Several suits were filed after the government and Union Carbide reached the  settlement on Feb. 14. The corporation paid $470 million in exchange for an end  to all civil and criminal proceedings.  </P></p>

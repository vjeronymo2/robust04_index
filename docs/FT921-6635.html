			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (9): Columbus fever runs high - Canute James looks forward to the celebrations ON A low hill overlooking the harbour in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic, teams of workmen are scrambling over a massive concrete structure that was designed 43 years ago. The government hopes it will be completed this year. The Columbus Lighthouse, a monument whose completion is costing millions of dollars, is central to much that is happen- ing in the country this year. The lighthouse is the most ambitious part of the country's commemoration - celebration, says the official literature - of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean 500 years ago. Columbus fever is running high in the country. One weekend earlier this month, thousands of Dominicans flocked to the port in Santo Domingo to view the replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria, Columbus's famed boats, which were on a short visit. 'This will be a good year for this country,' says the head of a local business group. 'We are celebrating a milestone.' Preparations for the event are evident all over Santo Domingo. Roads and bridges are being improved, the colonial section of the city is being rebuilt and efforts are under way to improve the electricity supply. The administrators of the country's tourist industry expect an increase in the volume of visitors, drawn by the focus on Columbus. Cynics and the political cognoscenti concur that 500 years after he arrived, Columbus still has a profound effect on contemporary Dominican politics. They say Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the president, was determined to stand again for office in the 1990 elections simply to be in charge of this year's events. According to the Dominican Commission for the Celeb- ration of the Quincentenary, La Isabela, established on Hispaniola by Columbus on his second voyage, was the 'first seat of western civilisation in America,' and produced 'the miracle that today we call America.' It was the Dominican Republic, according to the commission, which was the centre of the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America'. The country, it says, was the site of the first mass celebrated in the Americas, the first munic- ipality, the first city, the first viceregal court, the first university and the first cathedral in which, incid- entally, Columbus is buried until his remains are moved to the lighthouse which is being built. Dominicans appear oblivious to the consternation which they have created in other parts of the region, not by their claim on Columbus, but because of the language which they use. There is little tolerance of suggestions that the use of the word 'discovery' is eschewed by most of their neighbours who prefer to 'commemorate' the event as an 'encounter' of Europe with the Americas. 'Of course there were people here when Columbus got here,' agrees the business leader. 'But if he did not discover them no one would have known they were here. He brought them Christianity and civilisation. I must be thankful. I would not be here if it had not been for Columbus.'</p>

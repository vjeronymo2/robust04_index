			<p>BFN     [Text] JAKARTA, April 26 (AFP) -- Hundreds of Vietnamese  in Indonesia's Galang island refugee centre have been on hunger  strike since Friday in protest against their planned  repatriation, diplomatic sources said Tuesday.    The protest coincided with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh's  arrival here Tuesday on a four-day visit.    Anh is expected to discuss the plight of the 8,000 mostly  Vietnamese refugees with President Suharto. Indonesia and  Vietnam in October signed an agreement for the refugees'  voluntary repatriation.    A diplomat here, who requested anonymity, said he believed  the protestors numbered around 1,000 but said he had no precise  figure for those on hunger strike. He said 72 people had been  treated for dehydratation by the local Red Cross.    The SUARA PEMBARUAN daily said Monday that 500 refugees were  on hunger strike and that 79 people had been hospitalized.    A spokesman for police chief Major General Kusparmono Irsan  was quoted by the paper as saying a police team from Riau  province had been sent to calm the situation on the island, just  south of Singapore.    The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  temporarily withdrew from Galang after the protest erupted. But  the diplomat said the UNHCR might send an official back there  Wednesday to help restore calm.    Military authorities with jurisdiction over the island  declined comment saying that they had not yet received full data  about the incidents.    The diplomat said the camp protest started Thursday. Only  about 800 of the 8,000 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees are due  to be resettled in third countries, namely Australia, the United  States and Canada.    About 100,000 people have been transferred to third  countries  since the camp opened in 1975.    Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Monday that Indonesia  intended to clear the island which has served as a transit  centre for boat people into an industrial zone.    The Batam Development Agency, which is responsible for the  development of the bonded zone in Batam island, also south of  Singapore, wants to expand the region's rapid economic and  industrial growth to nearby Rempang and Galang islands.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Heseltine placates industry with offer of partnership MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday held out an olive branch to UK industry by offering it a partnership with government. Addressing the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry at Harrogate, Mr Heseltine said: 'Such a partnership is essential if we are to succeed in the world marketplace.' Anything else would be 'an abdication of national self-interest'. Mr Heseltine refused to disclose details of financial assistance to industry ahead of Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement tomorrow. He hinted, however, that the chancellor would be announcing help for exporters through increased export credits. He also announced that Lord Sainsbury, retired chairman of J. Sainsbury, the supermarket group, would act as his adviser on deregulation and the fight against red tape. CBI delegates, who had been bitterly critical of the government earlier in the conference, seemed broadly satisfied with the speech. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said: 'I think the open season on government should be closed.' Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said: 'What we heard today was what we hoped to hear. He clarified what he saw as his role.' Earlier, Mr Heseltine had heard a barrage of criticism of government from conference speakers. Mr Neil Ashley of Amey Holdings, the construction group, said: 'Any government that spends Pounds 70bn a year on social and unemployment spending and only Pounds 2bn on roads is not over-endowed with vision'. Mr Norman Sussmann of the British Clothing Industry Association asked: 'Is the U-turn on the miners the first sign that the government is beginning to recognise the importance of manufacturing industry?' Mr Heseltine said: 'I have never subscribed to the view that manufacturing industry doesn't matter. We built this nation's economy on it. Our principal competitors thrive on it.' He added: 'We need to build the impact of industry across Whitehall. This is a cultural change.' Mr Heseltine also urged delegates not to grant high wages. 'Wage settlements continue at a level that cannot be afforded,' he said. 'The message that the CBI has a central role in getting a grip on wages, including in the board room, cannot be overstated.' Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, welcomed the pledge to ensure that industry's needs were appreciated in Whitehall. But the real proof of the government's new approach would come with the Autumn Statement, which had to preserve capital spending programmes and permit flexibility in public financing.

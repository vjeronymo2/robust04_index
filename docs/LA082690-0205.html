			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR MAN TO 'WALK' THE BERING STRAIT  </P> <P> Corona del Mar resident Don Hodes has always looked for new challenges. When  kayaking, swimming and marathons grew stale for the 35-year-old attorney, he  looked for something different.  </P> <P> In 1986, he started walking on water.  </P> <P> Using two pontoon-like shoes and a long, double-sided oar, Hodes skates across  the Pacific waves near his Crystal Cove condominium with balance and poise of  biblical proportions. Since he picked up the sport -- developed in Europe as an  off-season training tool for skiers -- Hodes has taken on long-distance  crossings of some of the world's major waterways, including the Strait of  Gibraltar, the Irish Sea and the English Channel.  </P> <P> So where does the next challenge lie? Perhaps in crossing diplomatic channels.  </P> <P> For his next act, Hodes is negotiating with Soviet and American officials for  passage through the Bering Strait in September. Call it glasnost on water, or  pontoon peristroika -- he's off to Alaska in less than a month, and hoping to  return with a few more water miles under his feet.  </P> <P> "The real challenge with this one has been coordinating everything  politically," Hodes said in an interview Saturday before embarking on another  weekend training jaunt. "When I first started this, I set my goal to walk  across all the major walkable bodies of water in the world. . . . I've had this  one in my mind for many years."  </P> <P> With the assistance of Lynne Cox, a Los Alamitos woman who swam across the  Bering Strait in 1987, Hodes began contacting the appropriate Soviet and  American officials about a month ago. He met with Alexander Kozlovsky, the  Soviet deputy director for physical culture and sport during the summer's  Goodwill Games in Seattle.  </P> <P> Since then, also with Cox's help, he has reached everybody he needs, from the  two Alaskan senators to a helicopter mail service. And things are rolling.  </P> <P> The plan, he said, is to fly from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska, and then take a  small bush plane over to Whales, a tiny Eskimo village at the tip of the Bering  peninsula. With luck, he will catch a helicopter shuttle to the American island  of Little Diomede and set off the next day to walk to Uelen.  </P> <P> With water and air temperatures expected to hover between 30 and 40 degrees,  this walk will be, by far, the coldest one that Hodes has undertaken. The  22-mile journey, roughly the same length as the English Channel, should take  him about seven hours, depending on the waves and winds.  </P> <P> For the journey, Hodes hopes to be accompanied by both Soviet and American  ships. The idea is to demonstrate mutual cooperation, he said, and to show that  the diplomatic channels closed years ago are now open.  </P> <P> Once he arrives, there will be a ceremonial gift exchange with some of the  people who have helped him on his journey. Then it's back home again by Oct. 1.  </P> <P> So, with a month before he heads out, Hodes is pushing his workouts. Each  weekend, he spends one day on the water, walking from his home near Crystal  Cove to Laguna Beach and back. He also tries to get out on the ocean at least  once during the week.  </P> <P> All told, Hodes' trip will cost him roughly $15,000. He is hoping to get  corporate sponsorship, but so far has not heard from the companies that he has  contacted. But, as he says, the cost of the trip should not be an obstacle.  </P> <P> "I do it for the athletic challenge, but more than anything, I do it because  your time on this world is limited," he said.  </P></p>

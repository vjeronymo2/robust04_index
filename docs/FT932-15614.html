			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: My home from home in old Prague - Practical Traveller STANDING in the dark, deserted stairwell at 11 Bilkova Street I felt more like a spy than the post-communism tourist I was, waiting for my Czech hostess to arrive to make the pre-arranged hand-over: the keys of her Prague apartment in exchange for a modest sum of foreign currency. In planning my visit to Prague I capitalised on one of the fruits of the Czech Republic's new found democracy, the right of Czech citizens to rent their apartments to foreigners. Tourists now have an alternative to Prague's high-priced, often over-booked hotels, and Czechs can earn extra income, sometimes making half a month's salary in just a few days. Prague straddles the Vltava River and is divided into 10 boroughs. Praha l, with Prague Castle, Old Town (Stare Mesto) and Wenceslas Square, is where most museums and historical sites are found, and was where I wanted to stay. Consulting a map, I narrowed my choice to the charming streets of the Old Town. After talking to apartment rental agencies in France and Prague I booked a residence in the ancient Jewish quarter, close to the historic Old Town Square. I paid the France-based agent Pounds 20 and was told that all I had to do was show up at the Prague address, pay the Pounds 55 balance to my hostess, and the apartment was mine for four days. I had followed instructions and found myself waiting nervously in the darkening corridor. I started to worry. Had I made a mistake? What if no one came? I stared out at the Baroque facades of neighbouring buildings and heard the bells of St Vitus ringing from Castle Hill. It was 5pm. My Czech hostess was late. I thought of the Hotel Intercontinental down the street, and its Pounds 135-a-night price tag. Happily, Madame Koudelkova appeared, apologizing for her 15-minute delay as she welcomed me into her home. Using smiles and gestures to overcome our lack of a common language, she gave me a tour of my new lodgings. I was pleasantly surprised. The three-room apartment was spacious and clean, and as I imagined: walls were covered with enviable artwork sketched no doubt by friends, while a carved statue of a saint stood in one corner, facing a shrine of even bigger dimension: the bookcase, where Dostoevsky shared space with Goethe and Gogol. Madame proudly pointed out both a shower and tub, with 24-hour hot water. I noticed sound-proof windows in the sleeping area, where two twin beds were fitted with fluffy cotton comforters. The large kitchen was decorated with shiny red shelving stacked with international teas, evidence of guests before me. It is important to note that kitchens in Prague may prove perplexing to the unaccustomed visitor. Ovens are small, refrigerators are frequently half-size and amenities sparse: microwaves and toasters are practically non-existent. None of this proves a problem, unless, of course, it comes as a surprise. If planning to cook in your rented apartment, or if traveling with children, request an inventory of appliances beforehand. Some agencies, like Prague Suites, can provide coffee-makers and televisons. They will also stock groceries. It is a good idea to have at least water, bread and milk on hand upon arrival. Telephones are rare, but this is not a big problem as calls are made easily from hotels and post offices 24 hours a day. However, rental agencies should provide useful addresses including local hotels, taxi stands and medical clinics which admit foreigners (such as Polyclinique, 32 Karlova namesti; tel: 299-381). Madame Koudelkova handed me her keys and we pantomimed our goodbyes before she disappeared down the stairwell. I turned then to important matters. Where exactly was I? My map showed Parizska Avenue nearby and, one street down, the former home of Franz Kafka. Three blocks away was the 13th-century Gothic Old-New Jewish Synagogue and, beyond, streets lined with antique and crystal shops that led to the open-air market on the cobbled square. I had an agenda and it began with dinner. A year ago I would have arrived in Prague laden with survival food, but times have changed. Restaurants have opened all over the city. I found delicious Czech-style trout and a good Moravian wine at the charming U Zlate Hrusky (3 Novy Svet on Castle Hill). Dinner for under Pounds 3 can still be had at vinarna (wine bars) as well as pivnice (ale houses), where ham and garlic sausages go well with the famous Czech beer. U Supa (Celetna Street) has Purkmistr on tap, while U Fleku (9 Kremencova), a German-style taverna, has been serving 13` Lezak since 1499. Pilsner Urquell is the beer of choice at U Zlateho Tygra (17 Husova), a tavern packed with goateed locals (good luck getting a seat). Czech coffee is excellent, the sweet flaky pastries divine, and my neighbourhood cafe lured me away from making my own breakfast each morning. Afternoon tea at the old-world Hotel Europa was serenaded by waltzing violins and the nights were filled with Baroque concerts or jazz at Club Reduta. I felt rather guilty not spending more time at my home-away-from-home on Bilkova Street, but as I assured Madame Koudelkova in my parting thankyou note, I would surely return. Finding chez vous in Prague is made easy by asking the right questions. Decide to stay in either a private apartment or bed-and-breakfast. Request a map showing your rental's location. Inquire about noise, elevators, sleeping arrangements, facilities and proximity to metros and trams. Some of the agencies offering the largest selection of Prague rentals: Top Tour (9 Rybna, Prague 1; tel: 42-2-232-1077; fax: 42-2-232-6126) offers one-bedroom (two people) apartments at Pounds 46 nightly. No credit cards; payment in local or hard currency upon arrival. Prague Suites (8 Melantrichova, Prague 1; tel: 42-2-269-384; fax: 42-2-266-179) one-bedroom apartments start at Pounds 92 (includes transportation to and from the airport and 24-hour concierge and maintenance services). In the UK, Mary and Francis Villas, a division of Time Off (Chester Close, Belgravia, London SWlX 7BQ; tel: 071-235-8825; fax: 071-259-6093) offers one-bedroom rentals for Pounds 48. The France-based Chez Vous (47150, Lacapelle Biron, tel: 33-53-40-85-54; fax: 33-53-40-86-30) takes requests (English, French) within Europe for Prague-based agencies (including Top Tour). One-bedroom apartments: Pounds 45.</p>

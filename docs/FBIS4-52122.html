			<p>BFN     [Text] The New York Federal Bank has decided to buy  greenbacks and sell yen. In response, the Bundesbank in Germany  and central banks in European nations have made clear their  postures to keep the dollar from further falling in its value by  launching their coordinated intervention in foreign exchange  markets to buy dollars. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen has  issued an emergency statement asserting that a further slide in  the dollar's value would serve no purpose. In reaction, the Bank  of Japan [BOJ] has assigned the London Bank to intervene in  currency markets. In the wake of the most massive coordinated  intervention by the currency authorities of Japan, the United  States, and European nations in the currency markets to buy  dollars, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar, which had  been approaching a historic high, has plummeted to 102 yen per  $1.    Commenting on the coordinated intervention by major  industrialized nations in currency markets to buy dollars, a BOJ  source made it clear on 4 May that Japan will aggressively  intervene in currency markets to keep the yen from rising  steeply in its value against the dollar, saying, "We will do  everything we can to keep the yen's exchange against the dollar  stable in the future." The BOJ source welcomed the coordinated  effort by the United States and European nations to buy  greenbacks and said, "The BOJ strongly supports a statement  issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen." The the Ministry of  Finance [MOF] has said: "It cannot be said that recent  fluctuation on foreign exchange markets reflects economic  fundamentals. Japan, too, is concerned about that fluctuation"  (according to the International Finance Bureau of the MOF). The  MOF also has made it clear that Japan will make the coordinated  intervention in the currency markets in concert with the  currency authorities of other major industrialized nations.    A source well versed in the currency markets has said, "With  the coordinated intervention in currency markets to buy dollars,  it has become difficult for Japan to continue selling dollars."  There is a view that despite the massive coordinated  intervention, the dollar's rise in its value has been relatively  minor. The same source also has said that Japan will watch  whether the currency authorities of other industrialized nations  will continue their intervention in the foreign exchange markets  to buy greenbacks.    In response to the coordinated intervention by the United  States and major European nations in currency markets to buy  dollars and the statement issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Bentsen, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on the evening of 4 May  issued an statement saying, "Japan shares the common perception  that recent drastic fluctuation in the currency markets cannot  be justified from the standpoint of economic fundamentals." In  the statement, the finance minister pointed out the U.S.  intervention in the currency markets as an "evidence of  cooperative relations between Japan and the United States" and  expressed the hope that the speculative selling of the dollar  and purchase of the yen will be stopped. He also indicted that  the Japanese Government intends to aggressively intervened in  foreign exchange markets in the future.</p>

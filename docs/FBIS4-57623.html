			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena S.] </F>   [Text] The "Helms-Gonzalez" Amendment, drafted to pressure  world governments to return or indemnify the confiscated  properties of U.S. citizens, has already cleared all legislative  hurdles in the United States, but President Bill Clinton has yet  to sign or veto it.    This was said by National Assembly President Luis Humberto  Guzman, who is just back from Washington, D.C., where he met  with congressmen, as well as with high-ranking officials in the  Agency for International Development and other international  financial organizations for discussions of Nicaragua's foreign  debt.    When asked about statements by the Violeta Chamorro  administration's "strong man," Antonio Lacayo, on the amendment  that the president's son-in-law believes concerns only the  "big-footed American caitudos [pejorative term for some  Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. citizens]" but that will  not affect Nicaraguan programs, the National Assembly leader  said the U.S. legislature is studying the possibility that the  U.S. President might deem the law unenforceable due to a  conflict of interests in that nation." [no opening quotation  mark as published]    Guzman said that several of the people he met in Washington,  D.C. "told me they lack the authority to prevent enforcement of  the law."    Although the government has tried to minimize the effects  that the "Helms-Gonzalez" Amendment may have on the country,  Guzman stressed the difficulties that enforcement of this U.S.  law may create with regard to foreign aid.    The parliament leader pointed out: "Regardless of the U.S.  congressmen's and Government's positions, the property issue is  a very delicate and important issue for all Nicaraguans, who  must resolve it on our own."    Expanding on the case of the "American caitudos," Guzman  recalled the existence of several guidelines of international  law which stipulate that the owners' nationality at the time of  confiscation should be the benchmark.    "Therefore, the number of U.S. citizens claiming property  will be reduced to only those who were U.S. citizens in 1979,  not after that. Otherwise, we would never resolve this issue  because every day there are more Nicaraguans who acquire U.S.  citizenship."</p>

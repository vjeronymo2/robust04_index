			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (21): Noteworthy decision - Why De La Rue located in Africa The decision by Thomas De La Rue, the security printing company, to open a significant operation in Kenya was the culmination of a liaison with Africa dating back more than 130 years. The British-based company's first bank-note printing order was in 1860, from Mauritius. In 1988, it finally resolved to shift production into a continent that has long provided it with substantial business. Six years later, the first batch of 10m bank notes has just been despatched to the Central Bank of Kenya from the gleaming new marble-and-steel building on the outskirts of Nairobi. A second batch is under way, and notes for another East African country are also being printed. But why did the company decide to locate in Africa, and in Kenya, with a site on which it has spent Pounds 10m - an investment it expects to recover within the next four years? David Chapplow, general manager, says that growing world demand for the company's note-printing abilities from its factory in Gateshead, in the north-east of England, forced it to open a second plant in Malta in 1974. It gradually moved towards decentralised printing, opening other sites in Singapore, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. 'We realised in the mid-1980s that our printing seemed to moving to the Far East, but we had a major customer base in up to 40 African countries,' he says. 'We wanted to make a significant investment to strengthen our commitment to our African customers.' Political stability, economic growth, geographical location and an educated English-speaking working force were among the temptations that drew the company to Kenya. 'It had been quite a success story since independence,' Mr Chapplow says. In addition, the company then heard that Kenya was planning to develop export-processing zones, and applied for permission to obtain one, granting it access to a deferral on taxes and a series of other benefits. Mr Chapplow has no qualms about the results. 'I've got to say that the nature of our product is recognised as of sufficient importance that the government recognises we require some special attention,' he says. 'Delays have been kept to a minimum, and we've been very impressed by the co-operation we've received.' He is sensitive to concerns that other African countries may be reluctant to buy from a company based in Kenya. 'Once people know we're here to stay, we hope there would be an African continent pride in having a De La Rue factory here. We hope to use it as a showplace for Africa.' The company's building has been designed to expand easily by 30 per cent, and to have room in the existing space to house a second set of printing machinery. It already has the capacity to print 1m illion bank notes a day, and employs about 100 Kenyan staff.</p>

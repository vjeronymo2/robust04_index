			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker IN HIS two late ballet scores, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, Tchaikovsky's art can be seen at its greatest. Beauty needs no further bouquets here; Nutcracker is rather more problematic, since creative genius was expended upon a flimsy tale - 'a ballet unworthy of our stage' was a comment on the first performance. But the chief numbers of the score - the marvellously vivid mouse-battle; the snowflakes waltz; the grand pas de deux - are of such sublimity, and the charm of the entire composition so irresistible, that the ballet has spread into every corner of our dance world. Fatuous productions - and we have had more than our fair share in this country - have brought Nutcracker into some disrepute in the theatre, but the current Covent Garden staging has helped rehabilitate the piece by restoring much of the original Ivanov choreography, so that Nutcracker's subtle view of a childhood world is realised. Yet we have not known the resonances, intended by Tchaikovsky, that come with the juxtaposition of the ballet with its operatic partner in performance, and thus the importance of the Edinburgh Festival's decision to recreate the original St Petersburg programming. The choice of the post-modern troupe Adventures in Motion Pictures to produce the ballet was a brave one. Matthew Bourne's small company (here augmented to 17 dancers) has made a niche for itself with dance-theatre pieces (more theatre than dance, too) which have commented upon ideas of 'Englishness' in Town and Country, upon Hitchcock's films in Deadly Serious, and on social and sexual attitudes in various other shorter pieces. With Nutcracker, Mr Bourne has been faced with the double problem of a musical masterpiece which marvellously explores a very specific narrative. He has, with some wit, triumphed over the matter of making a new story to fit the score - or rather, of cunningly twisting the old tale to give it a contemporary shape. In rising to the choreographic challenges of music whose every bar speaks of dancing, he has been at moments less felicitous, since the long spans of movement implicit in the snowflakes ballabile and the grand pas de deux lie outside the experience and potential of his brand of post-modernism. The staging is, though, refreshing, good-humoured, well designed by Anthony Ward. With a sly humour, the Biedermeier charms of the original are now transformed into a dire Christmas in a Victorian orphanage presided over by the grim Dr Dross. His companion in menace is the Matron; his children, Fritz and Sugar, are the Squeers progeny, while the boy orphans have a distinctly Smike-ish air. Clara is the leader of the orphan girls. Their Christmas is of the most depressing, but toys are provided, and Clara acquires a sailor-nutcracker, on whom she lavishes her love. The mouse-battle is a dream in which the orphans rebel against Dr Dross and his family, with the aid of the Nutcracker, who becomes a handsome young man, leading hostilities that are a pillow-fight worthy of Zero de conduite. Clara is then led to a kingdom of snow, which is a skating rink owing something to Ashton's Les Patineurs, where the very sugary Sugar turns into a Sonja Henie and wins the Nutcracker as her beau. The disconsolate Clara must watch their betrothal in the Kingdom of Sweets - Mr Bourne is very amusing in devising sticky identities for his characters. Her love for the Nutcracker is unrequited, it seems, but the choreographer has a heart (and a dramatic sense that one might call Mills and Bourne) and as Clara awakens in the orphanage again, she finds the Nutcracker in her bed. They escape down a ladder of sheets to a happier, and plainly sexier, future. This action is well founded - it has more dramatic force than the original - and it sits without any awkwardness upon the score. The performances from the Adventures in Motion Pictures cast are very jolly, bright-edged with feeling. I thought Etta Murfitt touching and true as Clara, and Andrew George suitably heroic as her beloved. (There is a nice joke in partnering when, instead of the conventional premier danseur elegancies, this Nutcracker strikes some beef-cake poses). I salute Scott Ambler as a frightful Fritz, and Anton Skzypiciel in the sweetmeats divertissement as a Dago-ish ice-cream who might have strayed from Ashton's Facade. The score is, in the main, cleverly handled by Mr Bourne: it is, as I have noted, the grand and elegiac span of the second act adagio and the snowflake ballabile that look minimised. The production is otherwise an amusing gloss upon one of ballet's best - and least understood - texts. But as a companion to Yolanta - and balance to the opera's lyric effusions - its interest is far outweighed by the length of any evening which features the works in tandem.

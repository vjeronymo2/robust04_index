			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Restructuring of French property group agreed The French government yesterday agreed to a restructuring of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the heavily loss-making property company, in a deal that clears a large hurdle for the privatisation of Assurance Generale de France, the insurance group. CdE is to be permitted to remove FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in property provisions from its balance sheet, which will be guaranteed by a com-bination of the state and its larger creditors and shareholders. The restructuring is the second in two years for CdE, and follows a FFr5.5bn guarantee provided by the French state in 1993, when the group published losses of FFr823m. Similar losses are expected in the current year. The government will now underwrite up to FFr4.5bn of the provisions, and can cancel a FFr2.5bn bond issue it promised for the start of next year as part of the previous restructuring plan. AGF, which currently holds a 29.74 per cent stake in the group, will become the majority shareholder by injecting finance of a further FFr400m. Further financial guarantees will come from other creditors to CdE, which will have their loans converted into senior debt. The deal removes an uncertainty in the exposure to losses of the group by AGF, which contributed to the delays in its privatisation. Last year it took a FFr225m charge as a result of the losses at CdE. The chairman of AGF said in October that the group was planning for its privatisation by the end of January or the start of February. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the minister of economics, has said that he wanted to proceed with the privatisation 'as soon as possible', although this will depend on 'market conditions', including the position of the bond markets. Another outstanding issue is the sale of AGF's life assurance products through an effective monopoly thanks to a contract it has with the French post office. This is currently up for renegotiation and is being contested by other private insurance companies.</p>

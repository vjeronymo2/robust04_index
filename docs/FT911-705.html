			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: State blocks Californian electricity merger plan STATE regulators have blocked the proposed merger of two Californian electricity companies. The deal would have created the largest investor-owned power utility in the US. SCEcorp, the parent of Southern California Edison, which provides power in the Los Angeles area, has been trying since 1988 to take over San Diego Gas and Electric, in a deal valued at more than Dollars 2.8bn. It is unclear whether or not SCEcorp will appeal against the regulators' veto. The unanimous ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) follows its consideration of a 1,300-page report, published last February, which said the benefits of the merger would be outweighed by its negative impact on competition. The decision comes in the wake of several recent mergers in the widely fragmented power generation sector. Analysts have suggested this could be the start of a wave of takeover bids which would allow utilities to reap economies through pooling. The Californian PUC said it had ruled against the merger because the utilities had not proven that the deal would provide long-term net benefits for customers. It also feared the deal would have adverse effects on competition among utilities which transmit power or which sell in the open market the excess electricity they have generated.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS FULFILL A 'COVENANT' WITH GOD;  </P> <P> JEWISH TRADITION: A LOCAL RABBI HAS UNDERTAKEN AN EFFORT TO GET SOVIET  NEWCOMERS CIRCUMCISED. A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IS HELPING OUT.  </P> <P> The boys were frightened.  </P> <P> Arriving at the hospital in a van about 7 a.m., they fidgeted in various  examining rooms with their parents while the medical staff and rabbis prepared  a nearby operating room for the morning's circumcisions.  </P> <P> Finally a nurse summoned the first patient, a sturdy lad of 2 1/2 named Simon  Elbaum. "This is what it means to be a Jew," explained his father, Boris. "It  will be physical proof that he is Jewish."  </P> <P> Thus Simon completed a religious obligation. A recent immigrant with his family  from the Soviet Union, the youngster had never had the foreskin of his penis  removed -- a procedure customarily performed on all Jewish boys eight days  after birth as a mark of the Jewish people's special "covenant" with their God.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Union, such rituals were until very recently against the law. As  a result, tens of thousands of Soviet Jews remain uncircumcised and, in the  eyes of their religion, unfulfilled. "If you are not circumcised there is  constant conflict between your body and your soul," said Rabbi Naftoli Estulin,  director of the Los Angeles-based Chabad Russian Immigrant Program and a Soviet  immigrant himself. "The soul is Jewish, but the body is not."  </P> <P> As part of his ongoing effort to change all that, Estulin on Tuesday brought  five Soviet Jewish children, ages 2 to 12, to St. Mary Medical Center in Long  Beach. By next Wednesday he hopes that 23 children will have submitted to the  knife wielded by a specially trained rabbi -- called a mohel -- followed by  blessings over wine in the presence of family and friends.  </P> <P> "There was a religious and social need in the community," said Dr. David  Tillman, associate administrator of the hospital, which has donated the use of  its operating room as well as the services of a staff urologist to act as an  observer and an anesthesiologist to put the children to sleep. "As a Catholic  hospital, we understand the importance of sacred ceremonies."  </P> <P> Estulin, who has made it his personal mission to see to the circumcision of  every Soviet Jewish immigrant in Los Angeles who wishes to undergo the  procedure, says he has already overseen about 3,000 of the operations since  1974. But the real push, he says, started just last spring when the  liberalization of Soviet emigration policies caused a dramatic increase in the  number of Soviet Jews arriving in Southern California. Since June, Estulin  says, he has overseen about 300 circumcisions -- an average of more than 10 a  week -- on patients ranging in age from 3 to 57.  </P> <P> Most of the adults, Estulin says, undergo the procedure at regular Sunday  clinics held in a Los Angeles urologist's office, where they are given a local  anesthetic and afterward stitched up.  </P> <P> But children, unlike babies who can be easily controlled and adults who can  deal maturely with what they are experiencing, need to be given a general  anesthetic, according to the rabbis. "They get nervous," said Rabbi Gershon  Schusterman, Estulin's associate. "When they're sedated and sleeping, it  simplifies the procedure immensely."  </P> <P> So the children are taken to hospitals where the circumcision ceremony --  called a bris -- is performed in an operating room with a proper medical staff  in attendance.  </P> <P> "It is unbelievable," Estulin said. "On one side they are scared, but (the  parents) are so happy after you tell them it was done."  </P> <P> That seemed to be the mood on Tuesday as the young patients awaited their turn.  </P> <P> "We want to be real Jewish people," said Tamara Linchevsky, 31, whose  6-year-old son, Boris, was next in line for the operation. "It's a good  feeling."  </P> <P> Linchevsky's husband David, 32, said he also needs circumcising but would wait  to see how his son fared before submitting himself to the procedure.  </P> <P> And Boris Elbaum, 29, said he had been circumcised just three months before and  had now brought his son, Simon, in for the ritual. "It was a logical step in my  life," Elbaum said of his own circumcision. "This is one of the steps towards  personal harmony; I've fulfilled my obligation. It's a moving of the soul."  </P> <P> Jews believe that the first circumcision was performed about 3,800 years ago by  Abraham, who, at age 99, became his own first patient. Since then, they say,  the rite, which Jews believe was commanded by God, has survived from generation  to generation as one of the major distinguishing marks of Jewish identity.  </P> <P> Other groups practice circumcision, too. Most Muslim men are circumcised for  reasons having to do with religion and culture. And in America, doctors say,  about 85% of newborn infant boys are routinely circumcised for preventive  medical reasons.  </P> <P> While the practice came under fire in the mid-1970s by people who considered it  unnecessary, said Dr. Stuart Chalfin, the staff urologist who observed  Tuesday's procedures, recent studies showing that circumcised men are less  likely to suffer from urinary infections and penile cancer have begun to swing  the pendulum among medical practitioners back toward acceptance of the  procedure.  </P> <P> "Now most urologists and pediatricians have come around to feeling that it is  recommended," Chalfin said. "I think it's a good idea. A properly performed  circumcision is safe and seems to be beneficial."  </P> <P> Things went well on Tuesday, with the operations done by midafternoon. While  the boys may experience some discomfort for up to two days, Chalfin said, they  should have no difficulties after that and should be fully healed in about four  weeks.  </P> <P> Following each operation, the two rabbis -- Estulin and Schusterman -- along  with Rabbi Jacob Schechet, who served as the mohel, met with the patient and  his family in the hospital's recovery room. There they recited blessings over  wine, offered their congratulations and bestowed Hebrew names on the  still-groggy boys.  </P> <P> One observer added to the surreal quality of a scene featuring rabbis wearing  prayer shawls and skullcaps over green hospital-issued surgeons' gowns. She was  Sister Anne Hynes, a hospital chaplain and nun, who said she had come to her  first bris to show her support for the project.  </P> <P> "We're all together on this," Hynes said. "Reaching out to other groups is part  of the hospital's mission. These are our roots; the Jewish tradition. It gives  meaning to Bible reading and Scripture studies and helps us be more effective  in our ministries."  </P> <P> Among the adult Jews, though, the dominant mood after the circumcisions seemed  to be celebratory. "Mazel tov, mazel tov," the rabbis said to the Linchevskys,  enthusiastically intoning the traditional Jewish congratulation.  </P> <P> The parents beamed while their son bawled.  </P></p>

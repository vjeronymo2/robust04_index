			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LEAST IT'S ON SUNDAYS  </P> <P> I am furious that my favorite program, "Sunday Morning," is constantly shown at  different times. On Feb. 11, it was listed at 7:30 a.m. I got up to find it  started at 6 a.m. and ended at 7:30 a.m. I would set my VCR if CBS would be  consistent or give some notice about the scheduling.  </P> <P> Carolyn Carlsen, Seal Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roberto Petrini report: "Exports Lead Recovery"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- The first seal on the ISTAT [Central  Statistics Institute] certificate which guarantees the 1994  recovery was affixed by Confindustria [General Confederation of  Italian Industry] President Luigi Abete. "In Italy there is a  slow but constant recovery in the real economy," he announced  yesterday during a meeting at the Milan Fair. That was a  statement made under the banner of a cautious, yet decisive,  optimism on the fate of our economy, which has come out of a  disastrous 1993.    "The recovery," Abete explained, "depends on the driving  effect which the high capacity of Italian businesses to compete  on international markets is also shifting onto domestic  production." The Confindustria president added that "there is a  slight upturn in domestic consumption in Italy," following the  downturn in the entire European economy.    So there is optimism, but it is tempered by a good shot of  caution. "We must not have sudden expectations of growth,"  Abete added, "but we must be confident that this positive trend  will continue and that it should not be disturbed in its  evolution." According to Abete, the progress shown by some  economic indicators, such as industrial production, "will allow  us to have a 1994 that is certainly better than 1993, and to  consolidate the competitive ability of our economy, which could  bear considerable fruit in 1995."    So is the recovery under way? The road is certainly not a  downhill one, but a lot will depend on the economic policy  measures taken by the next government. Despite the recent  reduction in the discount rate to 7.5 percent, the knotty matter  of interest rates remains unresolved. In order to assist in the  recovery, interest rates "must drop further, not just in Italy  but in Europe too." The industrialist leader concluded by  saying that "we are waiting with confidence for this to be  verified in the coming months." However, there are still other  obstacles: such as the public-sector deficit, which this year  seems destined to exceed current estimates, and above all, the  employment crisis. The ISCO [National Institute for the Study  of the Economic Situation] report recently released highlights  the fact that the economic recovery will not be enough to  guarantee a recovery on the employment front; this year  unemployment is to rise another 1.2 percent following the 2.8  percent upsurge in 1993.    In the complex profile of Italy Inc., increasingly strong  indicators are emerging every day which indicate a revival in  the economy as well as signals that suggest caution. It is  definitely the former which have prevailed recently: Industrial  production grew in the three-month period from December to  February and the import/export figure, which in 1993 -- as the  Italian Exchange Office pointed out yesterday -- chalked up a  credit of around 11 trillion lire, compared with a deficit of  15.8 trillion in 1992. Judging by the most recent data  available, industry sales are still stagnant: The data for last  October, released yesterday by ISTAT, mention modest growth of  around 1.3 percent and only 1.6 percent in the first 10 months  of the year -- well below the rate of inflation. Reading these  data help paint a picture of the tough 1993 experienced by our  economy: Industry sales for the domestic market dropped 2.6  percent in the first 10 months of last year. It was only export  sales that rose, i.e., by 15.6 percent. The poor progress made  in regulating industry confirms last year's dreadful  performance: In the first 10 months, domestic orders dropped  10.2 percent, while foreign orders provided oxygen for demand,  chalking up growth of 16.9 percent. Strewn among the light and  shadow of 1993, other signs can also be perceived: for example,  the massive drop (down 37 percent) in gas consumption by the  chemical industry reported by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline  Company], which was nevertheless offset by the increase in  household consumption.    However, Alessandro Cocirio, president of CONFAPI [National  Confederation of Small Manufacturers], the association which  counts around 35,000 small manufacturers, is resolutely against  the optimism of recent days. "Before saying that there is a  recovery," he said yesterday, "I would think about it a bit. I  would definitely talk about a reversal of the trend. The crisis  in Italy began in 1990 and by December 1992 we were in an  extremely tough period that followed the exchange rate upheavals  and devaluation. So, comparing the data from December 1993 with  the data from back then is not a very wise thing to do."  Cocirio sees a drab picture for the future too. "The trade  balance," he explained, "is also feeling the effect of the drop  in imports as a result of the drastic drop in domestic demand.  When domestic demand starts to pick up, it will head toward  goods which come from abroad. Consequently, Italian businesses  will sell less and experience a negative effect."    Returning to the annual data on the trade balance and  exchange rates, the best results were achieved in the mechanics  sector (the credit rose by some 9 trillion), the transport  sector (which recovered almost 7 trillion over the sea of red  ink booked in 1992), and the metalworking sector. Most  prominent from the geographical point of view is the clear-cut  improvement in Italian trade with a number of key countries.  With Germany there was a spectacular turnaround in the trade  balance, which rose from a deficit of more than 3.6 trillion to  a credit of 2.4 trillion, while with the United States the  credit rose fivefold [as published], from 1.3 trillion to more  than 5.6 billion.</p>

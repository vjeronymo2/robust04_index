			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "To the Kremlin With Your </F> Desk"]    [Text] The chairman of the Coordination Council of  the Business Roundtable of Russia, Ivan Kivelidi, has written  letters to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. The letters are different. To the president:  "Participants in the Business Roundtable of Russia are convinced  that the interests of Russian property owners are alien to  you..." To the prime minister: "Participants in the Business  Roundtable of Russia note with alarm a certain distancing of the  government from the needs and concerns of the Russian  entrepreneurs...."    The letters differ but the essence is the same: The  entrepreneurs want to have their own organ for administration  and coordination at the state level. The authorities would also  like to have some organ for management of the entrepreneurs. But  the entrepreneurs, in turn, do not want what the authorities  want. Incomprehensible?    Let us begin at the beginning. One cannot say that our  domestic businessmen are functioning without state oversight  now. Russian entrepreneurs have at least seven nannies. First,  the State Committee for Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship.  Second, the department for organization of management of  property and entrepreneurship in the government apparatus.  Third, the committee for support of small enterprises and  entrepreneurship under the State Committee for Administration of  State Property. Fourth, the Federal Fund for Support of  Entrepreneurship in Antimonopoly Policy. And there are also the  corresponding departments in the Ministry of Economics, the  Ministry of Finance, the president's apparatus...    We know what happens with seven nannies. Russian  businessmen,  gathering as early as October at the constituent congress of the  Roundtable, decided that they need a single chief. Something  like a minister, or in the extreme case a state committee  chairman. So they wrote in their resolution: "An important step  toward strengthening the union of entrepreneurs and the  government would be the transformation of the currently existing  Council for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the  Government of the Russian Federation into an organ of state  administration--the State Committee for Affairs of Private  Business."    The businessmen asked and the authorities responded: There  immediately appeared a project for the creation of a kind of  Federal Center for the Development of Entrepreneurship with its  own scientific research institute and All-Russian Exhibition  Center (VDNKh) as a base. The enterprises, however, howled: We  do not want a bureaucratic "superstructure," we ourselves want...    "The terrible thing was that an organ for directive  management of entrepreneurship was created," explains the  official secretary of the Coordinating Council of the Business  Roundtable of Russia, Aleksandr Orlov. "Although one can  understand the bureaucrats: The sphere of state business is  being eaten away and the management structure is spreading. The  version of 'reorientation' toward private business seems very  tempting. It is another matter that the idea was stillborn: The  entrepreneur can only trust another entrepreneur and then not  all the time. But a bureaucrat...    In general private business "formed a solid front"--and the  idea of a federal center died a noble death. But...    "We learned recently that this plan had been exhumed," says  Aleksandr Orlov. "And now they are trying to push it through in  a new version, in the form of some kind of 'consolidation  commission.'"    In the opinion of the businessmen the motive force for the  plan came from bureaucrats in the structures of power, who  understand that sooner or later Russian entrepreneurs will  achieve the creation of the kind of coordination-consultation  organ they need. And then the "seven nannies" will have nothing  to do. And who wants that?    An unseen war is now in progress in the corridors of  power--the bureaucrats and the entrepreneurs are constantly  exchanging "responsive-warning blows," trying to work to get  ahead of the enemy. Ivan Kivelidi made his next move today by  proposing the draft of the presidential edict "On the Creation  of a Federal Public-State System for the Development of Free  Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation." The main point of  the plan, of course, is to form in the government structure a  federal administration for affairs of entrepreneurship which  would participate in the processes of development of draft laws  and normative documents, coordinate financial support for small  and medium-sized business, assist entrepreneurs in acquiring  state orders, etc. Actually, they are proposing the creation of  a legal lobbying structure which defends the interests of  private business at the government level. And not only at the  government level. The draft of the edict envisions the creation  of the position of adviser to the president of Russia on affairs  of entrepreneurship.    In general, it seems, Russian private business no longer has  much hope of a favorable disposition on the part of the  government. In previous letters from Ivan Kivelidi to Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin one can read, for example, these  lines: "No recommendation, no warning, and no information we  have presented to the Council of Ministers has ever been heeded  or accepted." Or: "Unfortunately, the Council for Development of  Entrepreneurship has received neither a reaction nor a response  from the government apparatus to the memorandum submitted to you  previously. The conviction is growing stronger that certain  forces are deliberately isolating Russian business circles from  the government...."    Consider that Kivelidi wrote these lines while holding the  position (public) of chairman of the Council for Development of  Entrepreneurship under the Government of the Russian  Federation. That is, this was not some kind of stranger.  But, as he wrote in another message to the prime minister, "the  apparatus lobby turned out to be stronger."    Now Ivan Kivelidi is the chairman of the coordination  council  of an organization which includes more than 80 movements,  unions, and large private firms and banks of Russia (for  example, the Most group, Moscow Real Estate, the Stolichnyy  Bank, the RSPP, the International Brokers Guild, the Volga Union  of Business Circles, the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Northern  Caucasus, etc.). But so far it does not seem that this "lobby"  has gained any respect in the White House. Who knows, perhaps in  the Kremlin the Business Roundtable of Russia will find more  attentive patrons.</p>

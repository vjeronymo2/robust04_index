			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Harmony's rebels confident REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Harmony Leisure predicted they would take control of the loss-making pubs and restaurants group following a heated annual meeting yesterday. The dissidents said their campaign to oust Harmony's executive directors was boosted when two companies with substantial shareholdings expressed dismay at the managing director's refusal to make a statement on the group's performance. Both Queens Moat, the hotel group which has a 14.5 per cent stake, and Southend Property Holdings which owns 4 per cent, asked Mr Stanley Lever, Harmony managing director, to make a statement on the company's prospects. He refused. The two companies urged the board to release its interim figures ahead of the November 26 extraordinary meeting requisitioned by the the rebels. Queen's Moat expressed concern that the accounts had been qualified because Barclays, Harmony's bankers, made it a condition of its facilities that Mr Lever remained on the board and that borrowings were cut.</p>

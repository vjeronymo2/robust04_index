			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  DYING CHILD'S WISH: TO MEET PRESIDENT  </P> <P> When the Make-a-Wish Foundation, an organization that grants wishes for  terminally ill children, asked cystic fibrosis sufferer Jeffrey Baird what he  wanted the most in the world, the Van Nuys boy thought it over. He decided  against trying a stint as a guest DJ or meeting his favorite rock group, Guns  'n' Roses.  </P> <P> Instead, Jeffrey, 12, will leave Saturday for Washington, where he is to meet  President George Bush on Monday.  </P> <P> "I had a few choices, and I couldn't really decide," Jeffrey said. "I said,  'Which would be harder to do? Whatever that is would be the best one.' "  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Excerpts] The defection of key members to General Constand  Viljoen's fledgling Freedom Front this week ripped the guts out  of the Conservative Party [CP] and the umbrella right-wing  Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF]. The  further defection of leading grassroots CP members such as  mayors and management committee chairmen has laid waste plans by  the CP and AVF to exploit their control over 80 rural towns to  hinder change and disrupt the elections.    The 36-member CP parliamentary caucus has been decimated by  the decision by nine of its members to fight an election under  the Freedom Front banner. Its numbers are likely to dwindle  further with the resignation from active politics after the  election of seven members who are getting old or disillusioned  with politics. [passage omitted]    Those likely to retire include frontbench finance spokesman  Cas Uys, Willie van der Merwe, Piet de la Rey and Daan Du  Plessis.    In addition to the MPs, General Viljoen also persuaded more  than 150 leading grassroots members of the CP to join him in  contesting the elections. They include mayors, councillors and  businessmen who were the backbone of the CP in terms of  orgnaisation and raising funds. [passage omitted]</p>

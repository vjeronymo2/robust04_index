			<p>CSO     [Text] Hitachi has put together a plan to boost sales of  electron beam (EB) drawing equipment, which seems to be  promising in next-generation IC [integrated circuit] manufacture  use with its high resolution, to 3 billion yen this fiscal year,  1.5 times that of the previous year. Since semiconductor  manufacturers are aggressive in new facilities investment, the  outlook is for orders to increase for manufacturing process use  to draw circuit patterns directly on wafers, in addition to use  in mask manufacturing. Other main products such as etching  equipment also seem to have surpassed the performance of the  previous fiscal year, and the outlook for sales for all  semiconductor manufacturing equipment this fiscal year is a  7.5-percent increase (43 billion yen) compared to the previous  fiscal year, an increase for the second consecutive year.    Besides EB drawing equipment and etching equipment, the  company is manufacturing and selling a kind of length measuring  SEM (scanning electron microscope) scanning devise. The external  sales ratio is over 80 percent.    The EB drawing equipment on which sales efforts have been  put  this fiscal year is a product that began full-scale external  sales last fiscal year. Generally, EB's are often used for mask  manufacturing, but the company is making its main force the use  of "direct drawing" where the pattern is drawn on the wafer  without using a mask. Processing speed is slower than a stepper  and it seems unsuitable for mass production, but production  efficiency is being raised by adopting a new transfer method of  putting together patterns in block units, and Hitachi is  beginning combined use with a stepper in ASIC  (application-specific IC) manufacture. It aims to seize this  timing to expand sales.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / It's only rock 'n roll but the advertisers like it Hot and heavy dance bands can virtually forget it. But there will definitely be a place for pop stars of a certain age - Tina Turner and Phil Collins or bands such as U2 - on VH-1, the 24-hour satellite music station that launches tonight. The channel, setting out to be a grown-up version of MTV, will be launched by the pop star Prince at a party for 2,000 at one of the UK's most nostalgic rock venues - the Roundhouse in London's Camden Town. 'Image-orientated brands' that have already signed up for the new channel - part of British Sky Broadcasting's Multi-Channels package - range from JVC and IBM to Calvin Klein and Levis. 'It's a testimony to VH-1's ability to reach a pure 25 to 49-year-old UK demographic,' Mr Frank Brown, director of advertising sales for MTV Networks Europe, said yesterday. VH-1, which stands for Video Hits One, would be 'an aspirational channel'. But it would not be 'a boys with guitars channel' according to Mr Brent Hansen, creative director to MTV Networks Europe. About 60 per cent of the output will have a current feel. There will be rock and soul and some room for nostalgia. From the vaults of BBC2, VH-1 will present the best of the seminal 1970s series The Old Grey Whistle Test. In November Eric Idle will host a vintage 1970s edition of Saturday Night Live with Kate Bush as the musical guest. The presenters have also been chosen more for their knowledge of music than for their youth. VH-1, like MTV and the children's channel Nickelodeon, is part of Viacom, the US media group that recently took over Paramount.</p>

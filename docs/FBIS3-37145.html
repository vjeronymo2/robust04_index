			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "State Duma Examines Amnesty </F> Issue"]    [Text] On Friday the State Duma completed its first month's  work. It is remarkable that during this time it has not only  failed to adopt a single draft law regarding the pressing  problems currently facing Russia, but it has also failed to  submit any for examination. It is also symbolic that the Duma  began its session Friday with the issue of providing backup  services for its work. Deputy Nikolay Travkin reproached his  colleagues with the fact that "having received 800,000 rubles  each," they have been in no hurry to get down to lawmaking work.    Another "anniversary" observation. Joint sessions begin with  "warm-up sessions" or discussions of the agenda lasting two  hours or 90 minutes. As a rule, these are a kind of "stream of  consciousness" during which it is possible to hear political  statements, outbursts directed at arch-opponents, and comments  on the business in hand. However, having worn out their nerves  and wasted time on sorting out the agenda, its subsequent  implementation is never brought to a conclusion. The same  proposals are submitted at the next session all over again to be  accompanied by the same discussion.    Basically, the Duma is being dragged into discrediting  itself. It sometimes seems that certain forces are doing this  deliberately. It is not at all hard to lead the nervous  parliamentary audience on.    Thus on Friday 90 minutes were devoted to the agenda. It was  not until midday that the deputies addressed legislative issues  directly. These included the draft decree on the amnesty in  connection with the adoption of the Russian Federation  Constitution. In accordance with a decision made by the  deputies, the issue of a general political and economic amnesty  has also been submitted for examination. The issue chiefly  involves the defendants in the State Committee for the State of  Emergency case and people who are currently being investigated  following their arrest in the events of October 1993. This is  the first category. The second includes people who have received  jail terms for economic crimes which are no longer considered  offenses.    The State Duma's draft decree "On an Amnesty in Connection  With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution"  proposes, among other things, that "defendants who have  performed military service in operational armies and combined  units and taken part in hostilities in defense of the Motherland  or while performing military duties in connection with this" are  to be let off. Moreover, a general pardon awaits men and women  above the age of 60 and first and second category invalids. The  list of names eligible for an amnesty is fairly wide. The only  people to whom the state's mercy does not extend are recidivists  and murderers.</p>

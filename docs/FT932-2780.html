			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / People: Lambeth vacuum filled ONE OF the least sought-after vacancies in local government has just been filled. Henry Gilby (above) is to take over as chief executive of Lambeth borough council in south London. The post was most recently vacated by Herman Ouseley, who left to take up the chair of the Commission for Racial Equality. His parting shot was a damning report alleging maladministration, fraud and inefficiency costing Pounds 9.5m. That was followed last month by an even more damning public interest report by the district auditor, which found that more than Pounds 20.2m had been spent illegally. One of the report's most pressing recommendations was that a new chief executive from outside the council should be appointed to serve for a long term. However, Gilby, 50, already has 16 years' experience at Lambeth, having worked his way up from senior assistant director of the amenity services department to become director of environmental services. Before that he had worked with four different borough councils and also for Essex county council. Like every other development in Lambeth's labyrinthine politics, the appointment has been hotly contested, with all non-Labour conucillors voting against it. Liberal Democrat councillors complained that the appointment was originally advertised for only six months and that many applicants were hence deterred. They also claim that the total cost of Gilbey's appointment would be more than Pounds 300,000, because of the offer of 10 years superannuation at the end of his contract. They also argue that external candidates should have been considered. But Gilby has made plain his determination to clean up Lambeth. He contributed to Ouseley's Section Five report and says: 'In my view, significant changes are required immediatiely to put this council on a sound footing.'</p>

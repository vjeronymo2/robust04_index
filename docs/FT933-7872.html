			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Norway in talks to prevent US sanctions NORWAY will be holding a series of talks with US government officials through September in an effort to avoid US trade sanctions, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, this month made an official recommendation that Norway's decision to resume hunting minke whales in defiance of the International Whaling Commission moratorium undermined the effectiveness of the IWC's conservation regime. Under a provision of US fishing law, the Pelly amendment, such a step gives President Bill Clinton the authority to impose trade sanctions against the offending country. Sanctions could be aimed at US imports of Norwegian fishery products, valued at between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.1m) a year. Norway's whalers ended their hunt last month, falling four short of a government-set quota of 160 minke whales. In autumn they will resume for scientific purposes.</p>

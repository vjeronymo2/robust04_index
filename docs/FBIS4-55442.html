			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Mitric: "They Want `Radio Station'"] </F>   [Text] Two national parties of the Hungarians and the  Croats are "spiting" the state of Serbia and "making waves" in  the domestic and international public in order to reheat the  demand for [word indistinct] autonomy of the Hungarians and the  cultural autonomy of the Croats from Tivat to Subotica. The  Serbian Constitutional Court has, so far, quashed four failed  decisions of the Subotica assembly and, some time soon, it is  supposed to discuss the statute according to which the Croatian  language is in official use in Subotica.    When this decision was being passed recently, Jelisaveta  Palfi, who was the secretary of the communal assembly then,  warned the councillors that these proposals do not adhere to the  Constitution and the law and for doing so she earned "a  dismissal" at one of the following sessions of the communal  assembly. Her fate was shared by Erika Sarvat-Barati, secretary  of the communal assembly in Senta, whom the councillors  suspended from work merely because she warned them that they  cannot annul the Serbian laws and Constitution by raising their  hands.    Milovan Salatic, president of the district court in Subotica  says that with the introduction of the Croatian language as an  official one, the FRY Constitution has been violated:    "The Constitution stipulates that the Serbian language of  the  ekavian and ijekavian diction and the Cyrillic script is  officially used in FRY. On the territories inhabited by the  ethnic minorities, their languages and scriptures are in the  official use too, in accordance with the law. However, here in  Subotica it is not the Hungarian language that is controversial,  but the Croatian. The FRY did not internationally recognize  Croatia nor has Croatia recognized Yugoslavia, and thus the  Croats in Yugoslavia do not have the status of an ethnic  minority. For the time being, they are merely citizens of  Serbia," Salatic says.    Even after the placement of the third advertisement, the  councillors Hungarians and Croats did not endorse the  appointment of the current editor, Slavica Lakicevic, to the  post of chief editor [of the radio]. As the sole "publicly  stated" reason they quoted an editor's "blunder" when Zeljko  Raznjatovic Arkan appeared as a guest on the Serbian program.    "Disregarding the national and political implications of  such  a decision and its unconstitutionality, a question emerges as to  how [words indistinct] carry out such a decision," Slavica  Lakicevic, chief editor of the Serbian program, wonders.    The employees of Radio Subotica are dissatisfied that the  founder is "disciplining" them. They have received maximum  support from their listeners, especially Bunjevci [ethnic group  of supposedly Croatian origins -- English term unknown] who,  calling into the program yesterday, claimed that they actually  did not know the Croatian language.    "Wherever the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians  has power, with the help of their sympathizers they are passing  the decision to suit their "[word indistinct]" so that when the  minorities are in question, political tensions would constantly  be present in Serbia, while there are portraying the abolition  of these unlawful decisions of theirs to the world as a threat  to their minority rights," Dragan Bozinovic, the governor of the  Sava-Backa district, says. "With such decisions, they openly  demonstrate their desire to be "a state." Bozinovic believes  that had the Serbian Constitutional Court been more expeditious  in assessing the constitutionality and legality of the Statute  of the Subotica commune, this latest "scandal" about the  Croatian language entering the program of the Radio Subotica  "through the back door" would have been avoided.    However, [words indistinct] yesterday after the creation of  "a case," president of the commune Jozef Kasa raised his voice  and stated that the Serbian program of the Radio Subotica is  interpreting the decisions of the assembly arbitrarily,  misrepresenting them deliberately.</p>

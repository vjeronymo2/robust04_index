			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Downing Street steps up campaign to kill rumours  -Sunday newspaper story dismissed / Officials stress PM's support for Lamont YESTERDAY was a day that had the government's spin doctors in a spin. Number 10 Downing Street and the Treasury were working flat out to assure the world that there were no economic policy differences between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. For the second day running government officials were denying a story in The Sunday Times that Mr Major had taken overall charge of economic policy and was aiming to cut bank base rates to 4 per cent. Instead the prime minister's office, the Treasury and Bank of England underlined that last week's surprise cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent from 7 per cent was an act of policy that had been thought through and agreed among the UK monetary authorities. And so it appears to have been. A sharp fall in sterling in Far East trading early yesterday forced the government to reiterate its unusually explicit denial of a single newspaper story. For reasons not altogether clear, reports on the UK economy in The Sunday Times tend to exert a powerful influence over foreign exchange market trading in Tokyo. But the intensity of the government's publicity offensive pointed to the bigger problem of faltering credibility that has dogged the re-balancing of UK economic policy and the person of the present chancellor since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 last year. Rumours and suggestions that UK policy is being made 'by the seat of the pants' and that the prime minister, rather than the chancellor, is in the driving seat have been around for some time. As far as any dispassionate observer can tell, they do not apply in these circumstances. But the confusion surrounding last Tuesday's cut of 1 percentage point in bank base rates to 6 per cent gave them a new lease of life. The government story, rehearsed a week ago and repeated yesterday, is that the base rate cut was agreed in principle by Mr Major and Mr Lamont in the week before the final decision on January 26. Since then, there have been numerous reports suggesting that the prime minister was the driving force behind the reduction. Downing Street yesterday denied that the cut was Mr Major's doing and said it was suggested by Mr Lamont. An official who took part in the meeting between the prime minister and the chancellor said it was a good-humoured affair in which both men agreed that the rates should be cut and that the timing should be left to Mr Lamont. It was the timing and execution of the cut that ran into difficulties, illustrating that the chancellor is, if nothing else, accident-prone. A good time to announce the cut would have been when the big increase of 60,800 in the December unemployment figures was made known on Thursday January 21. However, the authorities had other things on their minds - they were gearing up to announce the appointment of Mr Eddie George as next governor of the Bank of Eng-land. Having missed that opportunity, Monday January 25 would normally have been the occasion for the Bank of England to begin softening up financial markets to expect a cut. However, this proved impossible, because of technical difficulties on the domestic money market caused by a shortage of bills in the hands of the discount houses. Because the Bank of England was unable to push rates lower in its money market dealings, it took the unusual step of announcing a minimum lending rate of 6 per cent on January 26. There was a whiff of panic about this move for those who were unaware of the money market problems. Concern about the government's action was fuelled by anger among the marketmakers in gilt-edged stock who had been positioning themselves for a large auction of new government bonds the following day and found themselves carrying large capital losses following the Bank's move. Mr Lamont's presentation of events was not helped by the curious conventions of purdah, the period of self-imposed exile from the press and public events that Treasury ministers and officials undergo before the Budget each year. The last on-the-record interviews given by the chancellor had given the clear impression that he was reluctant to cut interest rates for fear of breaching the government's target of holding underlying inflation within the 1 per cent to 4 per cent range for the life of the present parliament. His isolation from the media, together with that of Treasury ministers such as Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, made the eventual rate cut all the more difficult to sell as a considered act of policy. There was no discussion among officials and policymakers about a more drastic lowering of borrowing costs than the 1 percentage point cut. The government was, and is, concerned not to trigger a free-fall of the pound for fear of increasing imported goods prices and putting its inflation target in jeopardy. The US approach of bringing short-term interest rates down to 3 per cent has not been considered relevant to UK conditions, in spite of the length of the recession. UK officials say the drastic cut in US interest rates was aimed largely at preventing a 'credit crunch' in the US banking system and geared to building up US bank profits. US interest rates charged to the consumer have fallen far less than those at which the banks borrow from each other. The irony of the latest rate cut is that Mr Lamont went ahead with his decision with the specific aim of boosting confidence in the economy after hearing bad news of rising unemployment, falling output and declining retail sales in the latest batch of government statistics. The controversy that has surrounded government policy over the past week will have done nothing to help his goal.</p>

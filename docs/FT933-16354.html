			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Books: A Mexican masterpiece - Fiction LIKE WATER FOR HOT CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel Doubleday Pounds 13.99, 220 pages EVASION by Francoise Sagan Severn House Pounds 13.99, 201 pages A SEASON IN PURGATORY by Dominick Dunne Bantam Press Pounds 14.99, 377 pages TO MAKE Mexican hot chocolate properly the water must be on the verge of boiling over, a state that Tita, the heroine of this extraordinary novel, all too often finds herself in. She is the youngest daughter of a prosperous ranching family on the Mexican side of the border during the Revolution. There was a popular literary tradition in 19th century Mexico summed up by one authority as 'novels of customs, crimes and horrors' which were sold in monthly instalment. Laura Esquivel has cleverly married this predominantly masculine phenomenon with its feminine counterpart, the woman's magazine, to produce in Like Water For Hot Chocolate 'a Novel in Monthly Instalments with Recipes, Romances and Home Remedies'. Where a more conventional writer would concentrate on the exploits of Pancho Villa's men, here their activities are only incidental to the dramas that take place in Tita's kitchen as she performs heroic feats of cookery with elaborate pre-Hispanic recipes. Mama Elena insists that as the youngest daughter Tita must remain unmarried in order to look after her in her old age. Pedro, the man she loves, marries her sister in order to stay near Tita, which only adds to the complications. Tita's strong passions have a way of affecting her cooking, and after a particularly aphrodisiac dish of quail in rose petal sauce, her unmarried sister Gertrudis, running naked through a field, is carried off by one of Villa's men. The recipes will delight armchair cooks with their detail and authenticity: 'The quail must be dry-plucked because putting them in boiling water affects their flavour.' The same calm friendly tone is used to describe the chaotic and often erotic events that accompany the cooking. In its modest way this is a comic masterpiece. There is good rustic cuisine of a more familiar sort in Francoise Sagan's Evasion, a spirited piece of wartime nostalgia published in France in 1991 as Les Faux-Fuyants. Four Parisian socialites are trying to reach Lisbon and thence New York in June 1940. Their Chenard-Walcker is machine gunned by Stukas and they are rescued by a 'yokel' in a cart and taken to his family's farm somewhere in the Beaune - 'Cro-magnon territory' as Diane, the older woman calls it on first sight. There is plenty of comedy in the encounter between the peasant family and their uninvited guests: a middle-aged homosexual diplomat, Loic Lhermitte, a busy society woman, Diane, 27-year-old Luce, whose husband is waiting in Lisbon, and the gigolo Bruno, but it is not entirely predictable. Because the yokel, Maurice, has been injured in their rescue Loic agrees to help his widowed mother to get the harvest in, partly because he discovers that he loves driving the combine harvester. Bruno goes off on foot in a sulk and collapses with sunstroke only to be woken by an amorous (male) half-wit. Luce and Maurice take a tumble in the hay, and Diane, who has never even seen a raw courgette, strikes up a genuine friendship with the earthy widow, Arlette. Much of the humour lies in the incongruity of it all, Luce and Diane wandering around the filthy farm in their beach pyjamas, Diane arranging the placement of the harvest lunch as Arlette kills the chickens. There is also some very funny dialogue, chiefly between Diane and Loic, who have the maturity to see that they cannot actually learn something from their hosts. There is something very different about French social comedy - the dryness of the wit, perhaps - which makes this highly enjoyable in spite of an unaccomplished translation. Dominick Dunne is presented as 'America's foremost chronicler of society life'. Like the narrator of A Season In Purgatory, Harrison Burns, he has a special interest in failures of justice. Harrison Burns was a school friend of Constant Bradley, the brightest hope of a fabulously wealthy and powerful Irish Catholic family. Constant is destined for the White House, and nothing is going to stand in his way, not even his unfortunate tendency to beat up women. Harrison has not seen Constant for nearly 20 years, since he helped to conceal Constant's responsibility for the death of a 25-year-old girl, bludgeoned by a baseball bat. A series of new encounters with the Bradleys convince him that he can no longer keep silent, and Constant is finally charged with the murder. Dunne writes intelligently, and organises his material superbly. His details of life at the top are absolutely spot on, but I was not convinced that he has really got hold of what his kind call the down-side. There is, for example, nothing in his story even half way as shocking as the real events of Chappaquiddick.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDEN PHEASANT IS LATEST TO BE FORCED FROM BREEDERS' CUP  </P> <P> A record-equaling 110 horses have been pre-entered for the Breeders' Cup, but  one of the best in the group, Golden Pheasant, will not be running because of a  training injury at Santa Anita that has probably ended his racing career.  </P> <P> Golden Pheasant, owned by King owner Bruce McNall and his star player, Wayne  Gretzky, was the early 2-1 favorite for the $2-million Turf Stakes, to be run  along with the six other Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y.,  on Oct. 27.  </P> <P> However, Golden Pheasant took a bad step during a gallop Monday and broke the  cannon bone, between the knee and the ankle, in his right foreleg. The horse,  winner of the Arlington Million in his last start, will undergo surgery today  at the Santa Anita equine hospital to have the small break fused by two or  three screws.  </P> <P> McNall was already trying to put together a breeding syndicate for Golden  Pheasant for next year. The 4-year-old Caro colt, out of Perfect Pigeon, a  Round Table mare, could probably resume training six months after the surgery,  but now it is likely he will be sent to stud in time for the breeding season  that starts in February.  </P> <P> The Breeders' Cup does have five of last year's winners -- Bayakoa, Steinlen,  Rhythm, Go for Wand and Dancing Spree -- but because of recent form, victories  by Steinlen and Dancing Spree would be considered surprises. Bayakoa and Go for  Wand will meet in the Distaff, which figures to be the highlight of the day;  Rhythm will run in the Classic; Steinlen will try to repeat in the Mile, and  Dancing Spree will seek another victory in the Sprint.  </P> <P> The pre-entry total matched the number that were made eligible for the  Breeders' Cup at Aqueduct in 1985, the last time the races were held in New  York. Owners had to pay 1% of the total purse, fees ranging from $10,000 to  $30,000, to get their horses to this stage. Another 1% is due a week from  today, to enter a horse.  </P> <P> The owners of Bayakoa and Best Pal, one of the favorites in the Juvenile, had  to supplement their horses because they weren't nominated shortly after being  foaled. It cost $200,000 for Bayakoa and $120,000 for Best Pal.  </P></p>

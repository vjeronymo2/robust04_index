The Presidential Team Is Unhappy That the  October Prisoners Were Released at the Onset of Spring"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Apparently the president, who  Monday evening was planing to speak on TV, promulgating a  certain edict, mothballed himself and some of his aides in the  October environment. According to some reports, the proposed  edict did not contain any specific tough measures, but its very  tone was fairly menacing. According to one account, it was the  unspecific and menacing verbiage of the edict that disappointed  the president and resulted in cancellation of his TV appearance.    There is also another version. Boris Yeltsin's readiness to  make a speech and the draft edict were used to bring pressure to  bear on the Duma chairman and consequently on its deputies in  the course of his evening meeting with Filatov, Satarov,  Ilyushenko, and Yakovlev. Rybkin, however, apparently managed  to propose to his guests a certain option, even if not very  radical, to defuse the situation: that all power bodies,  politicians, and political movements sign a joint memorandum on  responsibility for the breach of civic peace in the country.  Such a document was to be prepared by a working group including  representatives of the Duma, the Prosecutor's Office, and the  president. So far it is not known which credible guarantees  that the Duma will assume part of its responsibility, including  for the political conduct of the amnestied, that Ivan Rybkin  managed to provide to the president's "right- and left-hand  men." The fact that some guarantees were given, however, is  confirmed indirectly by the words by a Duma apparatus officer  who stated that the guests "came with one opinion but left with  quite another."    Yet there is no certainty whatsoever that the lower chamber  will want to vote for a memorandum on responsibility. First,  this is not so essential now that the objective -- freeing the  "Lefortovo inmates" -- has been accomplished. Second, to assume  political responsibility for the actions, say, of Aleksandr  Rutskoy is absolutely not in the interests of the communists or  their allies, who are suspicious of the former vice president.  Finally, even if the Duma does vote to assume responsibility --  within its jurisdiction of course -- for observance of civic  peace in Russia, this still leaves the president, whose  commitment to any memoranda cannot be guaranteed in any way.  The greater part of the Duma deputies understands this very  well and therefore one should expect prolonged debates on the  expediency of adopting any document imposing on it any greater  responsibility than stipulated by the constitution.

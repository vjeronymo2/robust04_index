			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: BBV declares interest in gaining control of Banesto Banco Bilbao Vizcaya has become the third big Spanish bank to publicly declare its interest in controlling Banesto, the ailing financial institution. Banesto is to be recapitalised by the domestic banking sector and then auctioned, either to a single domestic bank or a pool of banks. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, told shareholders at the weekend 'we could go (to the auction) alone, in association with one or more financial institutions or we could even not go at all if we do not believe the conditions (of the auction) to be acceptable.' Rival banks, Banco Santander and Argentaria, the partially privatised state banking corporation, have hired SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and Goldman Sachs of the US respectively, to help them prepare bids for Banesto. Mr Ybarra said Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, will advise BBV. The winner of the auction will take over a large branch network, making it the leader of the domestic banking sector and one of the major financial institutions in Europe. It will, however, be burdened by Banesto's mounting losses and by the badly damaged quality of its assets. The critical state of Banesto's balance sheet prompted the authorities to dismiss the bank's directors at the end of last year and to put a caretaker board in charge. Mr Ybarra said he believed Banesto would post a 1993 net loss of more than Pta50bn. Before the auction, the domestic institutions and the Bank of Spain will absorb bad debts valued at Pta285bn and inject Pta180bn of fresh capital in the form of a share issue. If the rescue plan is approved by Banesto shareholders at the annual meeting on March 26, the Bank of Spain will seek to have bids delivered by April 12.</p>

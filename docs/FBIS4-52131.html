			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Atsushi Kanda, director general of the </F> Defense Agency, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the  post-Cold War international situation?    [Kanda] I cannot be sure if world security improved  following the end of the Cold War. If you look at the national  conflicts in the former Soviet Union, you realize it is  difficult to simply say the end of the Cold War between the two  superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, brought  peace.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What kind of action do you think  Japan can take to deal with North Korea's suspected nuclear  weapons development if Japan, the United States, and the ROK  decide to take action without waiting for the UN Security  Council's decision to impose sanctions against North Korea?    [Kanda] One thing we must know is whether there is enough  evidence to support the view that Japan, the United States, and  the ROK will take action. We should not get carried away.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some members of the ruling coalition  parties are saying Japan should attach importance to joint  actions with the United States in dealing with the North Korean  issue.    [Kanda] Needless to say, we will adhere to UN resolutions,  otherwise we will have no grounds for taking action. I do not  know who in the ruling parties is saying this. However, I can  say that, in the spirit of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan  will fully cooperate with the United States.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you agree with the government's  current interpretation of the Constitution regarding the right  of collective self-defense?    [Kanda] Japan should act within the scope of the  Constitution.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the government may  change its interpretation of the Constitution depending on the  situation?    [Kanda] The government may talk about new ways of thinking  if the situation requires. It is possible the government may  change its way of thinking to cope with the changing situation.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this mean the government is  taking into consideration the worst possible scenario for the  Korean peninsula?    [Kanda] There are various possible scenarios. However, I do  think the worst scenario can happen.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on an ideal way for  cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations (PKO)?    [Kanda] This deals with the issue of where Japan should send  its PKO team after Mozambique. However, we would like to  actively deal with this issue.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But PKO cooperation laws impose a  freeze on joining UN peacekeeping forces (PKF).    [Kanda] Regarding the PKF, we agreed to review the relevant  laws after three years. Therefore, we will have to begin  discussions on this issue soon. We would like to carefully  study this issue because complicated problems are involved in it.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people are saying Japan should  not send its Self-Defense Forces [SDF] abroad for PKO  cooperation, but instead members of other organizations.    [Kanda] Judging from previously expressed views of the  Defense Agency [DA], it seems to me the DA is determined not to  establish another organization for PKO cooperation. An attempt  to dispatch members from non-SDF organizations for PKO  operations will deprive the SDF of its roles in terms of money  and manpower. The SDF is enough to fulfill our responsibilities  regarding PKO cooperation.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about the summit between you and  U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry?    [Kanda] I still cannot say anything about a trip to the  United States or the talks. However, I need to actively attend  various meetings if there will be change, such as new  developments in North Korea, for example.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal  with the concept of theater missile defense (TMD) which the  United States is promoting?    [Kanda] It needs to be studied quickly. While the SDF feels  uneasy about Japan's current (missile defense) system, the TMD  is a concept based on advanced science and technology. I would  like to study the TMD concept in a positive manner.    This will be useful in terms of strengthening our joint  functions [kyodo kino] in restoring our security. However, I  would like to carefully study the concept because we would need  a large amount of the budget to introduce the TMD.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The bills designed to revise the SDF  laws were carried over to the current Diet session.    [Kanda] The SDF is responsible for protecting the Japanese  people. Therefore, it is a matter of course to send SDF  aircraft to save Japanese living abroad. In this regard, the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also changing its  stance, becoming positive about the bills. However, since it  seceded from the coalition government, I suppose the SDPJ is now  assuming a prudent stand. I would like to deal with the issue  while listening to various opinions, including that of the SDPJ.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ's secession  from the ruling coalition will have an impact on defense  policies?    [Kanda] They should not say they have nothing to do with  defense policies because they are no longer a member of the  coalition. Since the SDPJ chairman signed the policy agreement,  the party must respect it. I want the SDPJ to know that it has  heavy responsibilities to fulfill.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Observer: Crystal gazing Professor Graef Crystal, the man American chief executives love to hate, is making still another comeback. His fame for publicising US corporate chieftains' bulging pay packets once led Fortune magazine to call him America's 'foremost compensation expert'. But Fortune itself had the misfortune to show, in its Crystal-compiled executive pay list for 1990, that the greediest was Steve Ross, chairman of Fortune's parent, the Time Warner group. Crystal left the magazine last summer after receiving what he termed an insulting letter from Time Warner. He then went to work at Financial World, but was dismissed, apparently having again incurred the wrath of several top CEOs. Now Crystal has signed on as a columnist for The New York Observer, an irreverent weekly newspaper whose editorial mission appears to be the debunking of myths and heroes of the the 1980s. Graydon Carter, its editor, pledges that Crystal will have 'complete freedom'; Crystal says: 'A lot of eyes need to be poked out and the Observer should allow me to do that.' From one Observer to another, good luck.</p>

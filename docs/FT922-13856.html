			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Relieved PLO celebrates Arafat's survival FOR Yassir Arafat, the great survivor of Arab politics, it was almost certainly his closest brush with death. His miraculous escape on Tuesday, when he walked away from an aircraft crash in which three crew members were reported killed, will have done nothing to diminish his Houdini-like reputation. Mr Arafat, who has somehow escaped numerous attempts by his enemies to eliminate him, including at least two attempted assassinations by the Israelis, was reported by immensely relieved Palestine Liberation Organisation officials to be in good spirits, although suffering slight bruises after his aircraft came down in the Libyan desert. The 62-year-old PLO leader, who was en route from Sudan to an air base in south-eastern Libya when his aircraft ran into a blinding sandstorm, was out of contact for 15 hours, and hopes were fading that he would be found alive. But as so often in the past, just when his personal and political obituaries were being written, Mr Arafat re-emerged, confounding the worst fears of his colleagues and supporters. He was taken first to Sarra, location of a large Palestinian guerrilla base 30 km (18 miles) from the crash site and then on to Tripoli. In the occupied territories yesterday, at least 15 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops during demonstrations celebrating the news that he had survived. Shops throughout East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were closed as Palestinians reacted with shock to initial reports that Mr Arafat was missing. But thousands took to the streets, honking car horns, chanting 'Arafat is alive' and handing out sweets when confirmation came of his survival. The demonstrations led to violent clashes in Gaza and the Israeli army clamped curfews on several West Bank communities. The long hours of Mr Arafat's disappearance also focused attention on the lack of an obvious alternative. Always extremely wary of the possible emergence of a rival, the PLO leader has not groomed a successor, and this omission was brought even more glaringly into focus in the past 24 hours. Mr Arafat seems certain to come under renewed pressures from inside the PLO to help prepare the way for an orderly succession, but he has resisted these pressures in the past. His disappearance also raised fears participation in the US-sponsored Middle East peace process. Mr Arafat's support is regarded as a key factor. While the PLO itself is excluded from the peace talks by an Israeli veto, Mr Arafat's blessing is regarded as a vital cover for Palestinian participants from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Stockholm, the chief Palestinian spokeswoman at the talks, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, said she was overjoyed that Mr Arafat had been found safe. 'He is the father of Palestinian unity. He is the symbol of national identity. He has been the driving force,' she said. 'His maturity, courage, foresight and experience show through in the sort of leadership he has.' PLO officials met in crisis session through the night in Tunis, anxiously awaiting news of Mr Arafat who became PLO chairman in 1969. When dawn broke the PLO asked regional and western governments to assist in the search for the missing aircraft. Mr Arafat's somewhat beleaguered position - he has scarcely ever been more isolated in Arab councils following his support of Iraq in the Gulf crisis - may be eased by his escape from death: his disappearance underscored his importance in maintaining a degree of stability among the fractious Palestinians. The PLO leader, who has a keen sense of the theatrical, is likely to milk his lucky escape for all its dramatic possibilities. He seems certain to chide those who have written him off in the past, and were inclined to do so again on this occasion. Apart from Israeli assassination attempts, Mr Arafat has walked away from at least one serious car accident, a Syrian-inspired bid to blow up a motorcade in which he was thought to be travelling, and attempts in 1983 by enemies in his own Fatah faction to get rid of him in a bloody siege of the Lebanese town of Tripoli.

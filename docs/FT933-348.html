			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat unveils L5,000bn cash-raising package FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday launched a large cash-raising plan combining a rights issue and the sale of its Rinascente retailing subsidiary. The complex package also contained the surprise that Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, will stay on two years longer than expected, to mid-1996. The group plunged into a L966bn (Dollars 612.6m) loss in the first half against pre-tax profit of L655bn last time, reflecting the severe downturn in the core car business and continuing difficulties at some of its other industrial activities. First-half sales fell 2.5 per cent to L29,393bn, principally due to a 11.7 per cent fall in sales of cars and a drop of almost 16 per cent in trucks. Fiat forecast that full-year earnings, before extraordinary items such as asset sales, would remain in the red because of the sharp fall in demand. Reflecting the cost of its investment programme, the group's net financial position rose to a deficit of L6,983bn from L3,849bn at the end of December. The cash-raising plans were immediately seen by analysts as a defensive move, and a step back from hopes to renew management, which has been largely discredited by Italy's political corruption scandal. Fiat will meet the heavy costs of its ambitious investment and model renewel programme with a L5,000bn cash- raising package. About L3,235bn will come through a two-for-three rights issue of new ordinary, preference and savings shares, priced at L2,000. A further L194bn will come from new savings shares for Fiat employees. Warrants, linked to the new shares and exercisable by the end of next year, will provide an additional L857bn by offering shareholders new ordinary shares at L1,000 each. Fiat will raise a further L615bn from Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group which bought its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary in 1991. Alcatel Alsthom will buy 18m Fiat shares at L7,000 each, and take up rights to new stock, raising its stake in the group to 2.2 per cent from 1. The French group will enter a 'hard core' of Fiat shareholders, which will form a shareholders' pact to control 30 per cent of the group. The pact, comprising Ifi and Ifil, two listed investment companies dominated by Fiat's controlling Agnelli family, will also have Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca among its members. Separately, Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, will buy 35m Fiat shares and take part in the rights issue, giving it a 2.4 per cent stake. In return, Fiat will spend about L160bn buying a 40 per cent stake in Generali's Paris-based Europ Assistance insurance services subsidiary. The Rinascente sale involves an offer to Fiat shareholders of the group's 58 per cent holding in the retailer's ordinary shares. Fiat share holders will be offered four Rinascente shares for every 100 of Fiat's.</p>

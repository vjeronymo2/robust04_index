The members of this committee present themselves  as independents, in relation to Haiti's political parties and  religions. The members of this committee include Carlet Auguste,  former ambassador under Duvalier; Lamartiniere Honorat,  presidential candidate in 1987; Georges A. Beaufils, former  chief of cabinet of provisional de facto President Joseph  Nerette; Daniel Supplice, former minister under Duvalier; Rosny  Desroches, former national education minister under the National  Council of Government [CNG], the first CNG having been presided  over by former Lieutenant General Henry Namphy; and Franck  Joseph, presidential candidate in 1987. Five other  personalities, members of this committee, are Mrs. Odette Roy  Fombrun, Georges Bailly, Marc Alex Guerrier, Sem Marseille, and  Dr. Georges Michel.    This committee advised that on their first workday, they  will  first focus on precise topics: that is, immediate problems, plus  management of the critical situation caused by the embargo.  Secondly, they will seek viable options for a way out of the  crisis. The debates on these topics will begin on Tuesday, 25  January, tomorrow. They will hold an important meeting at the  Villa Creole Hotel as of 0900. The points to be discussed relate  to managing the critical situation, which is a result of the  economic embargo imposed on the country. The debates will focus  on the following topics:    1. Establishment of responsibility for the consequences of  the embargo;    2. General, temporary closing of enterprises; objectives,  time limits, and incidence;    3. Partial closings, reduction and rearrangement of  political  schedules, and dismissals;    4. Formation of a private-sector crisis committee;    5. Utilization of the foreign chambers of commerce and  employers' associations as a means of pressuring the  international community.    The third major point is that resolutions will be presented  on each of these topics to facilitate a common stand within the  employers' sector. Fourth, in order to facilitate the formation  and adoption of the resolutions in debate, the president of each  employers' association will hopefully be able to consult with  his respective grassroots group in order to get a precise  advance mandate.

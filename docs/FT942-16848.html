			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / IMF raises its growth forecast for US economy The International Monetary Fund has sharply raised its growth forecast for the US economy this year amid gathering signs of US economic strength, according to international monetary sources, Reuter reports from Washington. But the Fund, in a draft version of its semi-annual World Economic Outlook, has cut its growth forecasts for most other big industrial nations, as Japanese and continental European economies have been slow to revive. The sources, who declined to be named, said the IMF now expects the US economy to show growth of some 3.8 per cent this year. That compares with the 2.6 per cent rate foreseen by the Fund just last September and well above the official Clinton administration forecast of 3 per cent. The new forecast partly reflects a surge in US growth late last year that has carried over into 1994. The US economy soared 7 per cent in the final quarter of last year, its fastest pace in nearly 10 years. However, the IMF now expects the Japanese economy to grow by a meagre 0.7 per cent this year, instead of expanding by 2 per cent, as it forecast in September. It believes that Japan may need to take further action to pump up its economy. The Fund has also reduced its growth forecasts for most European countries in the Group of Seven, adding that some may need to cut interest rates further to boost their economies. The IMF now expects Germany's economy to expand by 0.8 per cent this year, instead of by 1.2 per cent, Britain's by 2.5 per cent, rather than 2.8 per cent, and Italy's by 1.1 per cent, instead of 1.7 per cent. The growth forecast for France was left unchanged at 1.1 per cent, while that for Canada was trimmed to 3.5 per cent from 3.8 per cent. The forecasts, which are still subject to last minute revisions, are due to be made public on April 20.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Government Lost the First Round"] </F>   [Text] The 31 March special session of the National  Assembly, called to amend the Constitution, will probably go  down in the history of the Thai parliament as the first time the  government was defeated by the opposition from the very first  issue on the agenda. That is, the opposition proposed an urgent  motion to advance its draft amendments covering the entire  Constitution to the top of the National Assembly agenda. The  opposition and government had previously proposed drafts that  would amend only eight and 25 items in the Constitution.    A heated debate preceded the vote on whether the  opposition's  draft should be moved to the top of the agenda. The government  cited procedural regulations in its argument, while the  opposition cited tradition and previous decisions by the  parliament president. The reasons cited by both sides seemed  acceptable, so the parliament president called a vote, which the  opposition won overwhelmingly thanks to support from nearly the  entire Senate block. The government could only muster the votes  of the coalition parties.    Certain people believe the government's defeat in the first  round was caused by poor intelligence, a problem the prime  minister has often complained about. The government was  clueless about the opposition trick that occupied the government  with whether the draft should cover eight or 25 points. The  government decided only a couple of days before the scheduled  parliament session to agree to the 25 points proposed by the  opposition, hoping to win popularity among the people. Less  than 24 hours before the session, however, the opposition sprang  a surprise by proposing the amendment of the entire  Constitution, using the 1978 Constitution as a basis and  including some of its 25 points. The government could not  adjust in time and was defeated in the first round.    Judging from the debate, one major issue the opposition did  not touch was the status of senators. It even opened the door  to increasing the number of senators in proportion with the size  of the lower house. The Senate's power would also increase,  making it more than just a rubber stamp. This resulted in the  opposition receiving overwhelming support for its draft from the  senators. The opposition's draft also removed the ban against  politicians or bureaucrats becoming parliamentarians if they are  judged to have engaged in corruption or amassed abnormal wealth.    The point we wish to emphasize to politicians -- government  and opposition alike -- is that the amendment of the  Constitution should not be an issue they must try to win at all  costs or turn into a political game. They should consider what  people throughout the country will gain from the amended  Constitution.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL CURBS APARTMENTS ON SAN PEDRO'S PACIFIC AVE.  </P> <P> Nearly two years after San Pedro residents first expressed concern about  apartment development along Pacific Avenue, the Los Angeles City Council has  enacted an ordinance intended to curb such growth and promote commercial  revitalization along a 26-block stretch of the street.  </P> <P> The Pacific Avenue interim control ordinance, adopted Wednesday by a 12-0 vote,  is a temporary measure that will place restrictions on development for the next  year, while city planners draft permanent controls. It is retroactive to April  20, the date it was adopted by the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, developers will be permitted to build only one apartment  unit per 1,000 square feet of lot space, a much stiffer restriction than the  current rule of one unit per 400 square feet of lot space.  </P> <P> According to Mario Juravich, aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke  Flores, that provision will reduce the potential residential density of Pacific  Avenue by 60%.  </P> <P> The ordinance requires landscaping and setbacks, and it attempts to ensure  architectural diversity by mandating that the front wall of new buildings be  composed of more than one plane.  </P> <P> Said Bill Lusby, a San Pedro architect who served on a task force that helped  draft the interim controls: "I think it's going to help quite a bit. . . . If  (developers) want to go ahead with residential, at least they'll have to go and  design it rather than put up any old thing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Encouraging Mixed Uses  </P> <P> In addition, the temporary law bans residential uses on the first floor of  buildings between Oliver and 13th streets and between 21st and 23rd streets, a  provision that is intended to encourage commercial growth while permitting  residential development.  </P> <P> For years, Pacific Avenue was the main commercial thoroughfare in San Pedro.  But as many businesses moved out to Western Avenue, Pacific Avenue declined. By  1987, with the cost of land in San Pedro skyrocketing, developers discovered it  was profitable to build apartments in the area.  </P> <P> But residents, as well as Flores, were disturbed by the high density of the  developments, which were allowed under Pacific Avenue's commercial zoning. In  addition, the councilwoman did not like the building trend, with its boxy  design and lack of landscaping.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, Flores introduced a motion recommending 15-foot setbacks for  all residential developments on Pacific Avenue, from Oliver Street to Hamilton  Street.  </P> <P> That measure was never enacted, but the councilwoman did appoint a citizens  task force to study development along Pacific Avenue. The task force came up  with its recommendations in June, 1988, but it was not until April of this year  that the Planning Commission approved its proposed interim control ordinance.  </P> <P> Juravich said that, after the Planning Commission action, the measure became  tied up in the city attorney's office, as lawyers drafted the precise language  of the law.  </P></p>

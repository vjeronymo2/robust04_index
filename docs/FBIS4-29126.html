			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 June, His Excellency [H.E.] Keo Put-reaksmei  sent a brief report on the result of the 15 June roundtable to  His Majesty the King. Here is an excerpt of this report:    This morning's discussion merely turned round and round on  the first topic, that is, the cease-fire, and could not move on  to the second topic despite the efforts of the party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK].    1. The cease-fire:    The PDK announced this morning in a statement that it had  already replied to His Majesty's request for a yes or no answer,  that is, it was most delighted to have a cease-fire. After  that, this party proposed the setting up of a committee to  discuss how the cease-fire should be observed so that it would  not be just a simple cease-fire. This party stressed further  that a cease-fire date could not be specified without prior  discussion on this matter.    The Royal Government [RG]'s side, through H.E. Yu Hokkri,  proposed 30 June 1994, beginning at noon, as the start of the  cease- fire and proposed that there should be just an  inter-Cambodian committee without any foreigners to control the  cease-fire.    2. The minimal policy program:    The RG party avoided discussing this matter, claiming that  the king's 12 June message did not require the roundtable to  discuss this matter before the first topic in the agenda, that  is, the cease-fire.    On its part, the PDK proposed that this minimal policy  program be discussed as well, claiming that the two topics have  [words indistinct] value and that it had already given the  answer concerning the first topic through this morning's  statement. This party insisted that the cease-fire [words  indistinct] national reconciliation.    The two sides mutually understood the strong and weak points  of each other's strategies and hoped that the roundtable would  be able to reach a common point of view beneficial to the  Cambodian nation and people.    The meeting ended at 1200 in a good atmosphere and will  resume on the morning of 16 June.</p>

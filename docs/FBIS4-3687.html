			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun </F> (0215 1322 6511)]    [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, Premier  Li Peng held wide-ranging and in-depth talks with Kyrgyz Prime  Minister Apas Dzhumagulov on expanding bilateral economic  relations and trade. The talks proceeded in a pragmatic and  friendly [wu shi you hao 0523 1395 0645 1170] atmosphere.    Dzhumagulov said: Kyrgyzstan and China enjoy traditional  friendly relations. These relations are being increasingly  enriched and constantly developed.    He said: Kyrgyzstan, which is currently in a stage of  economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening  economic ties with China and to learning from its experiences,  including those in agricultural reform.    He said: Xinjiang and other regions in China have  established more than 70 joint ventures in Krygyzstan, including  those engaged in food processing and leather making; these joint  ventures are operating smoothly. Experts on the two sides are  considering cooperative projects in papermaking, public health,  pharmaceuticals, and other fields.    Dzhumagulov also briefed Li Peng on Krygyzstan's economic  situation.    Li Peng said: The economic difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan  during the course of reform are temporary; it is entirely  possible to overcome them through great efforts.    Li Peng said: Over the past two years or so, the two  countries have successfully initiated economic cooperation and  trade, and they have made impressive progress. Bilateral trade,  which has developed rapidly, continues to show potential. The  Chinese Government -- the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in  particular -- will strive to develop cooperation in trade,  economics, and other fields with Kyrgyzstan. In the future, the  two countries should exploit and utilize their favorable  conditions more fully, act in accordance with the law of the  economy, ensure that benefits will accrue to both sides,  constantly introduce diverse forms of cooperation, and improve  and upgrade their trade. To this end, both sides should create  better conditions, including those aimed at solving  communications and transportation problems that are hampering  the development of economic cooperation and trade.    Li Peng added: "A number of entrepreneurs are accompanying  me on my current trip, thereby enabling the two sides to  increase contacts. The Chinese Government encourages and  supports participation by Chinese entrepreneurs in Kyrgyzstan's  economic construction on the basis of equality and mutual  benefit."    Premier Li Peng invited Prime Minister Dzhumagulov to visit  China at a convenient time. Dzhumagulov expressed his thanks  and accepted the invitation with pleasure.</p>

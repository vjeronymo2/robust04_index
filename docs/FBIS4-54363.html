			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's total rice acreage  is likely to increase by about 80,000 hectares from last year to  roughly 2.20 million hectares in 1994, reflecting revived  enthusiasm among farmers to grow rice, the agriculture ministry  said Thursday [26 May].    The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said  farmers  turned enthusiastic after typhoons helped make for a poor  harvest last year, leading the government to begin emergency  rice imports.    According to a report by the Central Union of Agricultural  Cooperatives (Zenchu), about 80,000 hectares are likely to be  turned back into paddies in 1994.    Since the 1993 acreage was 2.13 million hectares, about 2.20  million hectares are likely to be cultivated for rice, ministry  officials said.    If the crop index is 100 this year as in a usual year,  approximately 11 million tons of rice harvest can be expected,  about one million tons more than the yearly domestic demand.    After last year's poor harvest which saw the crop index down  to 74, the ministry decreased the size of fields that were to be  used for other crops.    For fiscal 1994 and 1995, the ministry lowered its target  for  such fields to 600,000 hectares.</p>

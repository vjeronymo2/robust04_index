			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Get to know the Genoese - Susan Moore visits Frankfurt If only someone had had the nerve to call this show 'The Genius of Genoa'. Unsurprisingly, Art in the Republic of Genoa 1528-1815 is failing to pull crowds into Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle. No doubt few passers-by would be able to even name a Genoese artist, and the rest remain uninspired by the dreary title to find out who - or how wonderful - the republic's artists might be. What treats the incurious are missing. It is, however, an uneven show. At first glance, its exhibits are not unlike those of an Italian provincial museum, incongruously transposed into the inhospitable modernist space of the Schirn. There are the requisite unframed pictures in less than perfect condition, plus a melange of furniture, sculpture, silver, ceramics and textiles. On the other hand, most civic museums do not boast a wall of Genoese-period Van Dycks. In Van Dyck, the immensely wealthy and ostentatious ruling families of Genoa  -bankers to the world - found their perfect recording angel. These are sumptuous but sombre portraits, each nuance of gossamer lace, silk and velvet rendered with consummate skill. The young gentlewoman known as the Marchese Balbi is decked out entirely in black - but blacks encrusted with gold, trimmed with threads of silver. But this is far more than a statement of rank. Van Dyck cannot but warm to this dark, flashing-eyed beauty. Looking at her we realise how unalluring by comparison he found his puddingy English female sitters. Another other full-length, a penetrating study of an aged and wordly Genoese senator, makes for a striking contrast to the informality of the portrait of his two friends from Antwerp - the painters, engravers and dealers Lucas and Cornelis de Wael with whom Van Dyck lodged during his stay in Genoa during the 1620s. Cornelis sits with one arm casually draped over the back of the chair, the black sleeve of the other highlighting the delicious cut white silk of his brother's doublet. Sadly we are unable to compare the pupil with his master: there is not one of the great Genoese portraits that Rubens had painted some 20 years before. Rubens was to exert a profound influence on Genoese art, not least on the Capuchin friar turned painter Bernardo Strozzi. Strozzi is a painter's painter who wields a generously loaded brush with brio; nowhere is the vitality of surface more evident than in the 'Allegory of the Arts' on loan from the Hermitage, and a vast 'Rape of Europa' from Poznan. Strozzi works from a black ground and drags layer upon layer of rich tints across the canvas to lend an earthy substance to his figures. Ideal Flemish voluptuousness melds with the North Italian realist tradition. Here, too, is a marvellous lute player, a dark, swagger portrait of an unknown man, plus the only known Strozzi bozetto - or oil sketch - for a silver basin, illustrating various episodes from the life of Antony and Cleopatra. Displayed beside it is the basin which ultimately derives from Strozzi's sketch. Genoa's other great home-grown, 17th century talent is Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, best remembered as the inventor of the monotype and the perpetrator of virtuoso drawings made with the point of the brush and oil paint on paper. In one of the most complex Baroque compositions on show, Samson is attempting the destruction of the temple of the Philistines; to escape the tumbling masonry, a young boy in the foreground, boldly foreshortened, almost dives head-first out of the picture. In the art of painting, the Baroque period is indisputably Genoa's finest hour. Alongside the more or less familiar tours-de-force of acknowledged masters, we also find a wealth of major minor masterpieces, such as Giovanni Maria Bottalla's 'Deucalion and Pyrrha' brought from Rio de Janiero and an effectingly tender account of Tobias taking leave of his blind father by Bartolomeo Guidobono. It is tempting to say that an exhibition focussing on the Baroque, like that staged in Genoa earlier this year, would have been more rewarding. In an attempt to be encyclopaedic, this show has spread itself too thin. The exhibition continues until November 8.</p>

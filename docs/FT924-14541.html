			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Weak markets contribute to Perstorp's 26% decline PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, said yesterday that pre-tax profits fell 26 per cent to SKr225m (Dollars 41.3m) in its financial year to August 31 from SKr305m in the previous 12 months. Group sales rose 8 per cent to SKr7.33bn from SKr6.77bn, but this was due to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, sales fell 1 per cent. The group said weak market conditions were partly to blame for the fall in profits. But it added that increased depreciation, following an aggressive investment programme, and low profitability in some of the companies it had bought, were also significant factors. Despite the acquisitions, the group's financial position remained strong, with the year-end equity ratio amounting to 44 per cent. Rationalisation measures continued, cutting the workforce by 5 per cent over the year. Profit per share fell to SKr7.60 from SKr8.40. The dividend, after adjustment for a bonus issue, is unchanged at SKr4.55 per share The group is waiting for Italian government approval for its proposed co-operation with Italy's EniChem in the field of industrial grade laminates. The political situation in Italy has considerably delayed final approval, Perstorp stated.</p>

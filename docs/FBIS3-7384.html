			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has reacted negatively to the  Russian Government's proposal for an eight-party conference made  up of the four powers involved in the Korean peninsula issue,  North and South Korea, the UN secretary general, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency director-general in order to  smoothly resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    On 25 March, a relevant Foreign Ministry official indirectly  refused the Russian Government's proposal, saying: "We believe  we need to prudently review the proposal for the conference,  which will include relevant countries, such as the United States  and Japan, on the North Korean nuclear issue. It is more  important, however, to be patient because the UN Security  Council is now discussing the North Korean nuclear issue."    The official said that "the Russian Government had already  informed the ROK Embassy in Russia of its intention to make the  proposal before it was announced internationally." He added  that "the Russian Government's proposal was likely made to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which has been recently  deadlocked, through a multilateral approach."</p>

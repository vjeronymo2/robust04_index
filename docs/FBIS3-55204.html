A POSTFAKTUM  correspondent has learned that this evening all the editorial  offices on the territory of Russia will receive faxes containing  an appeal to strike from the two unions of journalists, of  Russia and of Moscow.    ITAR-TASS provides information about a number of demands  being submitted to the government of the Russian Federation by  journalists of the organizations, with yet another appeal to  Viktor Chernomyrdin. Journalists think it necessary to  establish purpose-orientated subsidies for all editions for the  first half of 1994 to provide for the publication of issues that  have already been paid for by subscribers.</p>

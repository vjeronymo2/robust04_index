			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich heats up on UBS speculation SPECULATION in Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, Germany gave bourses a lift, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH raised the temperature again as investors heard more details of a SFr180m rights issue from BK Vision, the investment trust which currently has total funds of more than SFr1bn, and which crossed swords recently with UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank. BK Vision, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, disclosed yesterday that 56 per cent of its holdings were in UBS. UBS led banks higher in very heavy trading, on speculation that the BK Vision rights issue would mean more big buying of UBS shares. The bearers rose SFr53, or 4.7 per cent to SFr1,187 and topped the active list. In the same sector, CS Holding firmed SFr70 to SFr2,800 and SBC SFr12 to SFr425. The SMI index hit a new all-time high of 2,390.5, up 26.5 as turnover recovered after Monday's lull. The traffic was not all one-way. Nestle came under pressure, falling SFr12 to SFr1,118 as the investment bank, Goldman Sachs, said in New York that it had removed the share from its recommended list. FRANKFURT looked for more rate cut speculation after the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, said in a speech late on Monday that western German inflation had risen at an average of 2.7 per cent over the previous three months on an annualised, and seasonally adjusted basis. However, the Bundesbank then denied a report that a majority of central bank council members had wanted a sharper cut in interest rates than was decided on last week. The DAX index rose by 8.70 to 1,700.87, nudged upward by some late buying of banks, as turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM5.2bn. Dresdner starred with a DM5.60 rise to DM388.50 at the close, and a further gain to DM390 in the London post bourse. Bayernhypo moved up DM2.50 to DM401.50 on the session, and then another DM3.50 to DM405 after hours. Chemical companies were broadly higher, benefiting from the extended strength of the dollar; constructions, similarly, moved up in echelon, recovering from recent weakness. PARIS resumed its uptrend following Monday's losses, and the CAC-40 index put on 9.68 to 1,935.12. Turnover remained weak at under FFr2bn. Total lost an early gain on news of progress in talks between the oil group and Saudi Arabia as the price of crude weakened throughout the day. The shares slipped FFr2.10 to FFr268.90, while those of Elf Aquitaine lost FFr2.30 to FFr384.50. Automotive issues were steady as James Capel reiterated its sell recommendations for Michelin, Peugeot and Valeo yesterday. The broker downgraded its 1994 profit forecasts for the three companies, although it noted that, in contrast with Michelin and Peugeot, Valeo's profits 'should hold up relatively well'. Valeo closed FFr5 higher at FFr819. AMSTERDAM also recovered Monday's falls, with a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.9 to 113.2. Ahold went against the trend, slipping Fl 2.30 to Fl 95.00 after the sale of a 6.7 per cent stake. ABN Amro improved Fl 1.80 at FL 57.70 as it announced the purchase of a US bank. MILAN failed to respond to the Bank of Italy's larger than expected cut in the discount rate, announced after Monday's close. The discount rate now stands at its lowest level for 17 years. The Comit index closed down 7.26 at 533.57. Ms Marie-Christine Keith, an Italian analyst at NatWest Securities in London, remarked that she had expected a stronger performance, given that the cut of one percentage point had exceeded expectations. She expected the market to drift over the next few weeks, ahead of a number of announcements due by the end of the month. These include publication of the draft budget for 1994 and details of progress on privatisation issues. There was some interest in Fiat, partly on rumours of a strategic link up; but the shares closed marginally lower on the kerb, down L6 at L6,225 ahead of car sales data which showed a fall of more than 28 per cent in June against the same 1992 period. HELSINKI continued to outperform many of Europe's markets on strong demand by foreign investors and positive company reports. The Hex index gained 3.12 per cent to 1,241.6, although it remained slightly below the year's high, recorded on May 21, of 1,248. Nokia advanced FM8 to FM199 after announcing the sale of its electrical wholesale operations and a broker's upgrade. ISTANBUL declined by another 3.2 per cent in reaction to the attack by Kurdish rebels on an eastern village which left 32 people dead. The composite index plunged 368.7 to 11,328.3 in turnover up to TL905bn from TL805bn. TEL AVIV dropped for the second consecutive day on weakness in the bond market, the Mishtanim blue chip index falling 2.87 to 194.30 in turnover of Shk177m. WARSAW reduced its rate of climb ahead of the release of half-year company results, but the WIG index still put on 133.7, or 3.3 per cent to 4,138.8 in active turnover of 541bn zloty (Dollars 30m).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 6                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                  Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1202.11    1201.71    1202.00    1202.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1256.55    1257.13    1258.85    1258.61  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1202.69    1202.68    1203.22    1203.04 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1259.25    1258.53    1257.84    1257.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 5     Jul 2     Jul 1    Jun 30    Jun 29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1197.01   1201.31   1213.21   1208.99   1207.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1253.51   1259.19   1270.98   1266.14   1263.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1204.36; 200 - 1259.62 Low/day: 100 - 1201.57 200 - 1256.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

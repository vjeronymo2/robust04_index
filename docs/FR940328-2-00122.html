The percentage weight of each criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the assessment is given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quality (45%). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Corporation will consider the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed activities, based on_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Scope of proposed T/TA activity relative to the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the grant requested, the number of people, programs, and/or State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commissions proposed T/TA activities are expected to reach;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Demonstration that the proposed activities meet clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling program and/or state needs related to the Corporation's mission and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals for national service;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Description of proposed T/TA techniques, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for peer exchange and peer training, experiential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> learning, and individual assistance tailored to meet specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program or state needs; also description of plans to use tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods or ways to test training activities or curricula on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small scale and refine them before offering them on a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Plan for implementing mechanisms continually to assess and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve value and impact of T/TA services.

Backgrounds of key staff, leadership, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals proposed to contribute to the proposed program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered in assessing organizational capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, the capacity to begin providing training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or technical assistance quickly will be required. In certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances, noted in the description of applicable activities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services will be needed as early as summer 1994. The applicant must demonstrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to provide high quality services in the desired time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Innovation and Replicability (10%).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Corporation will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess the extent to which the T/TA activity, or its elements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are creative or distinctive in approach or in the need that is met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation will assess the degree to which the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T/TA activity could serve as a long-term resource by identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other sources of funding and the extent to which the activity or its elements are applicable or adaptable to various program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types, locations, or approaches to service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Corporation will assess the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative technology in providing training or technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance, where appropriate. This criterion includes use of technology to increase access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and technical assistance activities and convenience for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users. For example, an information session might be conducted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> video conference, allowing users to participate from a local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and avoid travel costs. The Corporation expects that all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its program grantees will be connected through on-line networks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training and technical assistance providers will be expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be connected to electronic networks as well and should be prepared to use technology and to distribute information through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-line networks when appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are certain requirements that every recipient of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T/TA grant or cooperative agreement must fulfill. They include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following provisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) T/TA providers must work closely with Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff and other T/TA providers, especially the ``National Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resource Center'' described in the ``Concept Paper'' section below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providers must be willing to receive input from Corporation staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during development and delivery of T/TA activities; periodically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attend meetings and conferences at the Corporation's request;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform other T/TA providers of plans and progress and coordinate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts when appropriate; and work with Corporation staff to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess the direction and value of each T/TA activity every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six months and modify T/TA activity to better serve the users of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T/TA and adapt to changing needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) T/TA grantees must develop and continually apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms for assessing the value and impact of their T/TA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities and show evidence of continuous program improvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the application of such mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) While the Corporation has a vested interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promoting best practices throughout the field, to grantee and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential grantees alike, grantees will be given preference when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources are limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Databases or other on-line materials should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created in Foxpro or Oracle software. This will allow easy data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer both to the Corporation and among T/TA grantees. Assistance may be available to convert existing databases to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foxpro or Oracle if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

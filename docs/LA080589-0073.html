			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUNK ROCK HISTORY  </P> <P> I enjoyed reading "Kids of the Black Hole" (about the history of the Orange  County punk rock movement, July 23). I'm faxing copies to my L.A. and San  Francisco friends who don't believe me when I tell them that Orange County  wasn't always on the fringe of absolute cultural vacuity, in which it now seems  to be.  </P> <P> Circa 1981, we had similar Black Holes around Newport at which the Vandals, the  Crowd and others were showcased on numerous occasions.  </P> <P> Though I have some hideous specific memories collected from the wreckage, as a  whole I look back on those days very fondly. For one thing, hardly anything  compares to the fantastic exuberance of letting loose a raging libido, not to  mention the special camaraderie you get from communally hating those  optimistic, hard-working, productive types. We had more fun than the F. Scott  Fitzgeralds.  </P> <P> Of course, you can't go on so uncontrollably and still earn a living. But I'm  glad at least someone is making an effort to contribute something of value to  the O.C. scene. These bands, by way of their history and poetry, have much to  offer.  </P> <P> LORI DESMOND  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

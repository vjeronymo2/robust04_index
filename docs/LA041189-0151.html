FROM 7.2% TO 4.8%  </P> <P> The billionaire Pritzker family said today that it has cut its stake in Ramada  Inc. to 4.8% from 7.2%, indicating that the Arizona-based hotelier has won a  fight to remain independent.  </P> <P> HCC Corp., a Chicago-based company headed by Jay A. Pritzker, said in an April  5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it had sold a total of  959,100 shares of Ramada stock from March 16 through April 5 at an average  price of $11.29 a share.  </P> <P> Pritzker would not comment on the reasons for the stock sale, said his  secretary, Rhonda Scheiss.  </P> <P> Last September, Ramada rejected HCC's $10-a-share offer for all of the  company's stock and embarked on a corporate restructuring that included the  sale of its 825 hotels.  </P></p>

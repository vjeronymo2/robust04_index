			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / German Elections: Bonn government basks in the light of television coverage - On air, some are more equal than others On the night of August 17, German holidaymakers who had flocked to the Canary Islands for their vacation had an unexpected opportunity to see an interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sat 1, the private commercial television channel. For one hour, the chancellor, unhindered by any trenchant questioning, covered a broad range of issues. 'This was not a political broadcast,' insisted Ms Simone Telgart from Sat 1. 'We interviewed him not as head of the Christian Democratic Union but as the chancellor.' That interview, directed specifically at German holidaymakers, was a foretaste of things to come as television geared up for next Sunday's federal elections. 'There is no doubt television has played a very important role in this campaign and will play a crucial role in influencing the undecided voters,' said Mr Manfred Gullner, head of the Dortmund-based Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis. 'At least 15 per cent of voters have still to make up their minds how they will vote. In this context, the role and influence of television in this campaign is much greater than in other federal elections.' In the past, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s, voters were exposed to only two state-run television channels: ARD, controlled by the 16 states, and the Mainz-based ZDF. Since the advent of private television in 1985, viewers have had a choice of several commercial and satellite channels. These include: RTL, partly owned by the Bertelsmann publishing group; Sat 1, jointly owned by Munich-based mogul Leo Kirch and the Springer group; and Pro 7, also owned by Mr Kirch. By law, the channels are required to provide equal opportunities for expression of opinions. However, they are not required to give equal time to each party outside party political broadcasts. Sat 1, with 16 per cent of the audience, and ZDF, with 17 per cent, have consistently supported the CDU, and particularly Mr Kohl, throughout the campaign. 'You know exactly where you stand with Sat 1,' said Mr Gullner, adding: 'It's the Kohl channel.' Between January and the beginning of this month, Sat 1 had broadcast five hours and 10 minutes of interviews with Mr Kohl, compared to one hour and 24 minutes with Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, junior partners in the Bonn government, was given a mere 47 minutes. The Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), successor to east Germany's Communist party, hardly got a look-in. Mr Joschka Fischer, Hesse's environmental minister and a prominent Green, has been given one minute and 19 seconds; Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS parliamentary leader, seven minutes. Neither has been interviewed. Said Ms Telgart: 'We are concentrating on the main established political parties. And in any case, its natural that the chancellor gets the most air time.' Mr Kohl and the CDU could hardly ask for better coverage from Sat 1, particularly since Mr Kirch is able to extend his influence beyond television. He owns a 37 per cent stake in the Springer group which publishes the conservative Die Welt daily and the Bild tabloid, both staunchly CDU. At Springer, Mr Kirch can rely on Mr Jurgen Richter, its new chairman, to promote the CDU. Like Mr Kirch, Mr Richter is a personal friend of the chancellor from the days when he was running the Rheinpfalz newspaper group at Ludswigshafen, near Mr Kohl's home. It was that newspaper group, backed by the chancellor, which took over the Freie Presse in Chemnitz, one of east Germany's largest dailies. Such support for the CDU is boosted by ZDF. According to Media Control, an independent company specialising in the electronic media, the channel has given Mr Kohl more than five hours of air time between January and the end of September, compared to three hours and 10 minutes for Mr Scharping. In contrast, ZDF has given Mr Kinkel over four hours and 17 minutes. Some of Germany's other television channels and newspapers have tried to provide more balanced coverage. Mr Gullner reckons RTL and ARD are 'comparatively fair'. Indeed, Media Control has shown that there is only about 30 minutes' difference between the air time given the two main leaders, while the Greens, FDP and PDS are given coverage as well, although no channel has managed to have a debate between Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping. But Media Control has also shown that on the four main channels Mr Kohl has received 17 hours and three minutes; Mr Scharping 10 hours and 11 minutes. 'We have complained to the television authorities about the bias,' said the SPD's Ms Mechthild Reith. 'But we had little success. Without a doubt, television has been pro-Kohl and CDU, and ZDF has becoming increasingly pro-Kohl.' The election coverage has convinced Mr Gullner, and Mr Hans Hege, head of the Berlin-Brandenburg Medienanstalen, a body supposed to ensure a wide variety of high quality programmes, of the need to set a ceiling on ownership of television channels, or audience share. 'Once this election is over, there will have to be a major rethink about the ownership structures,' said Mr Gullner.  --------------------------------------------------------        TV TIME* --------------------------------------------------------- Helmut Kohl                                17h 3m 4s Christian Democrats (CDU) --------------------------------------------------------- Rudolf Scharping                         10h 11m 18s Social Democrats (SPD)  -------------------------------------------------------- Klaus Kinkel                         9h 36m 47s Free Democrats (FDP)  -------------------------------------------------------- Theodor Waigel                          5h 19m 1s Christian Social Union (CSU)  -------------------------------------------------------- Gregor Gysi                         3h 11m 12s Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)  -------------------------------------------------------- Joschka Fischer                          2h 36m 1s Greens  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Media Control --------------------------------------------------------- *Discussions/talks by the leading politicians from Jan 1 through to Sept 30, 1994 ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

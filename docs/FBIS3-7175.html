			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Kim Yong-sam, meeting with ROK  correspondents in Tokyo this morning, said that the remark made  by the North Korean delegate at the inter-Korean working contact  held last week threatening that North Korea is ready for war was  premeditated and that he regards it as the remark of the highest  person in authority in North Korea.    President Kim Yong-sam said that he thinks China basically  does not want North Korea to develop nuclear weapons since China  does not want to be isolated as a member of international  community. President Kim said that he will be able to have frank  exchange of views with Chinese President Jiang Zemin through  summit talks with him on the measures to cope with the critical  North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

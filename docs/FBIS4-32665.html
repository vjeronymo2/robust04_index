			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Slovene Justice  Minister Miha Kozinc resigned over his role in a scandal which  involved exploiting legal loopholes to give extremely favourable  housing credits to state officials.    Kozinc, who chaired the government's housing commission,  resigned under pressure from the public indignant that officials  in newly-independent Slovenia should have greater privileges  than those enjoyed by functionaries in the defunct communist  regime.    The commission was paying out up to 100,000 Deutsche marks'  worth of housing credits from the state budget at interest rates  one-sixth of those paid by the man in the street for a housing  credit from a commercial bank.    The favourable credits were used for a variety of purposes  other than housing, such as building a swimming pool in the  pation in the case of rightist M.P. Irena Oman. Kozinc himself  benefited from the scheme to the tune of 70,000 Deutsche marks  in housing credits.    Kozinc is the fifth minister to resign from the cabinet of  Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in recent months, which means that  one-third of the ministers have been replaced under a cloud.</p>

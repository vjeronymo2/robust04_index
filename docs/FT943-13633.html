			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Clarke says economy set for success Britain's economy is 'poised for success', Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told the Commons yesterday in an optimistic end-of-term report which heartened Tory MPs as they prepared for the summer break. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, made a sustained attempt to cloud the horizon by saying that Mr Clarke had made clear his preference for a broader-based valued added tax which permitted a lower uniform rate. Mr Brown quoted a letter written by Mr Clarke to one of his constituents in which he said: 'I have always thought we exempt far too many goods and services from VAT in this country.' He insisted that Mr Clarke, far from wanting to lower taxes as he claimed, was committed to the principle of extending VAT. Mr Clarke intervened to protest that it was 'utterly pathetic' of Mr Brown to make such a charge on the basis of one letter sent to a constituent. The chancellor explained that in his view it would have been better when VAT was introduced to have had fewer exemptions and a lower rate. Earlier Mr Clarke said that the government's strategy had produced 'potentially the most favourable set of economic circumstances which Britain has enjoyed for over a generation'. He said: 'At this stage of recovery from recession no government since the war has produced an economic climate combining steady economic growth with falling unemployment, rising productivity and low inflation of the kind we now have.' Growth was not only set to continue at its current healthy rate, but was becoming increasingly balanced as the recovery spread throughout the economy. Mr Clarke reaffirmed the government's determination to stick to its inflation target of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent - and reducing it to the lower end before the next general election. Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, attacked the chancellor for delivering a speech of 'staggering complacency'. A Labour demand that the increase in VAT on domestic fuel from next April should be reconsidered was defeated by a majority of 41 (302-261).</p>

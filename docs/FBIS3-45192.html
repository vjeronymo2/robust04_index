			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Yunnan News" program] </F>   [Text] It has been learned from the provincial Education  Commission that as of the end of 1993 our province had settled  the long-drawn-out problem of back pay for teachers. For years  the provincial CPC committee and the government have  conscientiously implemented the policy of making education the  foundation and invigorating Yunnan through application of  scientific and technological advances. Year after year, the  province's treasury has set aside sufficient funds for teachers'  pay and has steadily increased spending on education. However,  from time to time last year, reports were heard that some  localities diverted funds for teachers' pay to other projects,  thereby being unable to pay wages on schedule or issuing IOUs in  lieu of cash payments.    Upon learning of this situation, Governor He Zhiqiang  specifically pointed out: No matter how tight our finances are,  we must not let schools and teachers bear the brunt of the  consequences. He instructed localities to take immediate action  to settle back pay for teachers. Thanks to the efforts of  authorities at all levels, outstanding pay for teachers has been  all paid up.

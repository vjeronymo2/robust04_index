			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Stefanel to suspend dividend STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing company, plans to suspend its dividend following a collapse in profits owing to the recession. Group net earnings dropped to L24.1bn (Dollars 15.2m) last year from L37.1bn, in spite of a 7.3 per cent rise in sales to L468.6bn. The pressure on earnings was seen most severely at parent company level, where net profits plunged to L600m against L13.8bn in 1991 as a result of losses at some unspecified subsidiaries. The earnings drop, examined by Stefanel's board yesterday, has triggered the decision to suspend the dividend on the grounds that the company needs to reinforce internal resources and consolidate its finances for future growth. Last year, Stefanel made a payout of L140 a share, unchanged from 1990. The reduction in earnings at group level comes partly on account of a big increase in provisions to L34.5bn against L25.4bn in 1991 as a result of the recession. Moreover, profits in 1991 were lifted by L11bn in extraordinary items. At the operating level, group profits remained virtually unchanged at L51.6bn compared with L51.2bn in 1991. Results at Stefanel, one of Italy's best-known retailers, contrasts with Benetton's upbeat figures earlier this week. Benetton, its bigger neighbour in the Veneto region, raised net earnings by 12.1 per cent to L184.7bn and its dividend to L350 a share.</p>

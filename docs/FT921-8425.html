			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Big trade deficits 'threaten' Emu BRITAIN'S progress towards European economic and monetary union might be jeopardised by large current account deficits, a group of private-sector economists warned yesterday in a report which reflects Labour party thinking. The economists say the big import bills expected as Britain moves out of recession will mean a rise by 1996 in the current account deficit, possibly to 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Such large deficits could damage investor confidence and hinder efforts to reduce UK inflation and interest rates ahead of Emu, which Britain has indicated it might join towards the end of the century. The analysis comes from economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, London Business School, Oxford Economic Forecasting and Warwick University. It was co-ordinated by Mr Jeremy Bray, the Labour spokesman on science and technology, who also has an interest in economic modelling. The Treasury disputed the conclusions, saying it was difficult to look far enough ahead to predict likely deficits in the late 1990s. There was 'no evidence' to suggest Britain would find it difficult to finance any deficits that arose. The economists say the current account deficit - which fell to Pounds 5.8bn last year after Pounds 15.2bn in 1990 - reflects structural difficulties in the economy which will become more apparent during the expected upturn. It argues that as imports rise due to increased demand, any matching rise in exports will be insufficient to prevent a large increase in the de-ficit. Over the period to 1996 the deficit will increase to between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent of total UK output, from about 1 per cent last year, according to the group. In a 'worst case' - assuming exports rise only slowly with a large jump in imports - the deficit could reach 3.2 per cent of output.</p>

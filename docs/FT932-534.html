			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (7): German producers in turmoil - A rough ride is forecast for even the most progressive suppliers ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, recently conducted a survey of its components suppliers to see what they thought of the Lopez medicine. As the earliest 'victims' of the attentions of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, now production and procurement chief at Volkswagen, they might have been expected to post back some tetchy responses. In the event, most felt their operations, and crucially, their competitiveness, had been improved by Opel's internal efficiency drive in which Mr Lopez played a central role in seeking to reduce the cost of bought-in parts. Some even claimed they were able to compete with suppliers in other countries to provide components to Japanese car makers. Despite the clouds of anxiety stirred up by the controversial arrival of Mr Lopez at VW, there is ample hard evidence that German components makers have already started determinedly to act to restore their competitiveness. Indeed, the process began even before Mr 'Strangler' Lopez arrived on the scene. ITT Automotive, for example, the widely-scattered parts division of the US ITT group, started last September on a restructuring programme. Originally intended to come into operation next year, it was unveiled ahead of schedule a month ago. The key strategic shift was to merge ITT's five German businesses, focusing them, together with other non-German subsidiaries involved in brakes and electrical systems, around the operations of Teves, the world's main supplier of anti-lock braking systems. The shift brought 25 factories and the lion's share of ITT Automotive's turnover under the command of Mr Klaus Lederer, currently head of Teves. The main reasons, Mr Lederer says, were to strengthen ITT's bargaining position with vehicle makers, and, by doubling the German-based operation's own annual purchasing total, to increase its negotiating power vis-a-vis its own suppliers. Just as vehicle makers are working on reducing the numbers of suppliers to their factories, Mr Lederer has given himself two years to reduce his list of 2,000 outside parts makers by 30 per cent. At the same time, ITT is stepping up its programme of making mainly labour-intensive or relatively unsophisticated products outside Germany. Projects under way or in advanced planning stages include works in Portugal, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Shanghai. Part of the aim is to cut costs, but the main impulse behind the overseas investment has come once again from vehicle makers. The Chinese plant, for example, is being built in a joint venture arrangement to supply a nearby Volkswagen assembly works. The core business, however, will remain in Germany, despite the much-criticised high wage costs. As Mr Lederer pointed out, labour accounts for only 8 per cent of the manufacturing costs of ABS systems. The ITT strategy represents in concentrated form a process which is under way throughout the German components industry, which currently consists of some 3,000 largely medium-sized manufacturers, representing 40 per cent of European capacity, with sales of some DM130bn a year. The net effect of larger suppliers' transplanting capacity to factories abroad and the growing squeeze on profits as vehicle makers and bigger component companies persist with demands for lower prices, will be a rapid erosion of this core industry. Many are too small to survive alone. The 100 largest of the group account for 84 per cent of the industry's turnover. A grim new analysis by Price Waterhouse in Germany projects that only 500 of the total will emerge from the coming storm of structural change as viable businesses. Of these, around 100 will be 'systems-' or in VW jargon 'first-tier' suppliers, providing their customers with complete sub-assemblies. Although many appear to be modelling themselves on the Japanese competition, German car makers typically have direct contacts with 1,000 to 1,800 suppliers, compared with 160 to 300 among the Japanese. While the domestic industry endures this process, opportunities will emerge for foreign investors to take a hand. PW forecasts that non-German companies will have important stakes in half the front-line companies. At present, fewer than a quarter of Germany's top 100 suppliers have a foreign parent. Once again, the process of change has been under way for some time, prompted by fading profitability. According to the research department at Deutsche Bank, German vehicle prices rose 26 per cent between 1985 and 1992: in the same period, parts prices increased only 11 per cent. Further figures from PW demonstrate that during this period of continuing boom for the German motor industry, the components makers had an increasingly thin time of it. Average return on sales nose-dived from more than 5 per cent in 1987 to 1.5 per cent in 1991. This period was marked by a series of rapid strategic shifts, including takeovers, joint ventures, and increasingly a shift overseas. The Mannesmann engineering group, for example, is still digesting a heavy recent intake of new acquisitions, including Fichtel &amp; Sachs, VDO Adolf Schindling and Boge. Krupp took its unsuspecting neighbour Hoesch by surprise when it launched a successful takeover bid while the two were discussing friendly co-operation. The result is a substantial components business to ease the pain of the slow retreat from the two companies' old core business in steel manufacture. Despite today's atmosphere of turmoil, Deutsche Bank sees a sound and prosperous integrated industry emerging when the dust settles. According to the bank's Mr Rainer Much, the two halves of the industry are fated to a future characterised by 'co-operation instead of conflict'. Rationalising the demands being made on parts makers, he says vehicle makers and their suppliers will conclude long-term pacts rather than short-term contracts. Suppliers with the right products and technology - that is, the most progressive and innovative - will benefit from the increasing tendency for car makers to fit more expensive comfort and safety options in their products. But none is likely to find the ride to this promising new future anything but rough.</p>

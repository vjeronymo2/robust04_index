			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Dumping complaints rising rapidly COMPLAINTS to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over allegedly unfair use of anti-dumping actions to protect domestic industry are rising rapidly, reflecting the growing use of anti-dumping rules to keep out unwanted imports. Dumping is normally defined as the sale of goods in foreign markets below their domestic price or cost of production. New Gatt figures show that anti-dumping investigations by the 25 members of its Anti-dumping Code (the EC counting as one) rose to 237 in the year to end-June 1992, up from 175 in the previous 12 months. Australia (76) led the field, followed by the US (62), Mexico (25) and the EC (23). India (5) and Japan (3) carried out their first anti-dumping investigations. Developing countries are increasingly frequent users of anti-dumping rules, though the main users (and offenders) are the leading industrialised traders. In mid-1992 the US had 236 anti-dumping actions outstanding and the EC 157.</p>

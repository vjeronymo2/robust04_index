			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar revises its derivatives accounting The financial services subsidiary of Caterpillar has reported a Dollars 5.4m loss from derivative instruments, amid signs that auditors in the US are taking a more stringent line in this area. The company said the reported loss stems from a decision to revise its first-quarter figures after receiving an opinion from its auditors, Price Waterhouse. The accounting firm declined to comment. The accounting change led Caterpillar Financial Services to slash its reported profits for the quarter to Dollars 6.4m from Dollars 11.8m. No adjustment was made to the Caterpillar group figures, since the amount was not material in the context of its previously reported profits of Dollars 192m, the company said. The adjustment related to interest rate caps and swaptions which Caterpillar had written (or sold.) Caps give the buyer protection against higher interest rates, while holders of swaptions have an option to enter into a swap contract. In both cases, such instruments amounted to a form of insurance sold by Caterpillar to others who wanted cover against rising interest rates. The practice of selling such option-type instruments is usually limited to sophisticated derivatives traders, since they require constant hedging on the part of the seller to limit its exposure as interest rates rise. As a result, writing options is generally regarded as a risky strategy for an industrial company. Caterpillar said that the instruments had been used as part of an overall strategy to protect its financial services subsidiary's margins from changes in interest rates. The adjustment stems from a forced switch from so-called hedge accounting to mark-to-market accounting. Under the first method, any profits or losses from changes in the market values of financial instruments are set off against the underlying asset the instruments are intended to hedge. Under the second, the instruments are shown at their market value, with any change being booked as an immediate profit or loss, regardless of any offsetting change in value in the underlying assets. The company said that in future it would only buy hedging instruments which qualified for hedge accounting treatment.</p>

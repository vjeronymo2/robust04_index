			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 27 Apr (MENA)--An official Yemeni Defense  Ministry spokesman in Aden has said that a large-scale military  campaign is moving toward 'Imran Camp (which witnessed clashes  between northern and southern units today) to besiege the 3d  Armored Brigade (southern) despite telephone appeals to the  chairman of the Presidential Council and the chief of staff for  a cease-fire.    The spokesman said in a statement tonight that the campaign  does not only target the "steadfast" brigade but seeks to push  Yemen into a devastating war.    The spokesman warned "those who play with fire" against such  acts and demanded an immediate halt to the fighting against the  3d Armored Brigade. The spokesman appealed to the joint  military committee to investigate the incidents and condemn  those responsible for them.</p>

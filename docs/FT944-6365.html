			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Carsberg anticipates a return to his roots: John Ridding on why the OFT chief is resigning Sipping wine in the French economy ministry, Sir Bryan Carsberg appeared relaxed yesterday about his decision to resign as director-general of Britain's Office of Fair Trading. 'There is less to it than meets the eye,' he said, referring to his move to head the International Accounting Standards Committee. 'It is not because of problems in my present job. I haven't had a row with ministers or anything like that. The move is entirely because I was offered a job which I want to do.' In Paris for a meeting on international competition policy, Sir Bryan described his move - which will take effect in six months - as a natural progression. 'Accounting and accounting standards are a central theme of my career,' he said, referring to his academic experience in accountancy and the three years he spent with the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US between 1978 and 1981. It was only in March last year that he left the British Accounting Standards Board. For Sir Bryan, his next step is consistent with the job he is doing now. 'The more the idea of free trade becomes internationally accepted, the more desirable it will be to have convergence on competition policy. For global competition policy we need common accounting standards.' During the next six months, however, it will be business as usual. At the top of the agenda is the sensitive issue of the rival bids from British Aerospace and GEC for control of VSEL, the warship builder. Sir Bryan will not be drawn on a decision on referring the proposals to the government. On the subject of UK competition policy, Sir Bryan appears largely satisfied. He defends the establishment of bodies to monitor competition in newly privatised utilities. According to Sir Bryan, however, further steps are needed in competition policy. One concerns the restrictive trade practices law. Under the present system, no trading practice is automatically prohibited. A review is required to determine whether cartels or other practices are in the public interest. A second reform proposed by Sir Bryan involves a toughening of the Fair Trading Act. He says there is a case to extend provisions against so-called 'rogue traders' - who have broken either criminal or civil law - to other malpractices that do not necessarily break the law.</p>

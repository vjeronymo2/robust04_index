			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: End to isolation beckons as taboo fades on Israel ties - The economic dividends of a likely 'domino effect' of recognition A 'DOMINO EFFECT' of Arab and Islamic states announcing recognition of Israel was predicted yesterday by Israeli officials after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, paid a surprise visit to Morocco. Israelis said an expected tumbling of the diplomatic and trade wall which has surrounded the Jewish state since its creation in 1948 could fuel a boom in trade, investment and tourism. This could help to consolidate Israeli public support for the peace agreements reached this week with Palestinians and with Jordan. 'There's no doubt that this is an opening of the door for many other countries,' said Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, who said steps towards diplomatic relations with Morocco would be a 'formalisation of existing relations' in tourism, economic co-operation and trade. Mr Avi Beker, director of the Israel Council on Foreign relations, said: 'There is a domino effect. It is no longer a taboo to talk with Israel and have relations and the major psychological barriers have now been demolished.' Experts say that recognition by Morocco would lead quickly to ties with moderate countries among the 50 Islamic and Arab countries that currently boycott Israel. Zimbabwe's announcement that it was considering recognition of Israel yesterday is also expected to have a knock-on effect on developing countries and members of the non-aligned movement. Early candidates for recognition include Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia. In remarks published in yesterday's respected Hebrew daily Ha'aretz, Mr Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysian prime minister, said: 'As the Israelis have changed their position we should consider the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with them, especially after the Palestinians recognised Israel.' Mr Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Omani foreign minister, began a tour of Arab states yesterday to discuss 'new realities'. 'This can change the whole reality of Israel within the Middle East,' said Mr Beker. ' Before Israel was completely isolated and surrounded by enemies who were against its existence and looked for allies on the periphery like Turkey and Ethiopia. Now Israel is moving towards its geographic place with its neighbours like Jordan and Egypt which is quite revolutionary.' Israelis are split about the economic impact of the expected change in their status. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, has spoken optimistically about a Middle Eastern common market, regional integration projects and joint ventures. A study carried out by the Tel Aviv University economic department has predicted that Israel could boost its exports by Dollars 2.2bn, a 22 per cent increase, to five Arab countries when trade barriers come down. In a sign of the link between diplomatic and trade relations, an economic delegation including Mr Jacob Frenkel, Israel's central bank governor, and Mr Amiram Sivan, head of bank Hapoalim, is expected in Morocco soon to sign economic and aviation agreements and to discuss the possibility of a joint bank with the kingdom. The optimists will be buoyed by statements made by international fund managers about investing in Israel. However, other Israelis are less optimistic about the economic dividends, pointing to the fact that 14 years of 'cold peace' with Egypt has not yielded significant benefits. 'I think Israel will face major opportunities in economic co-operation but mainly in terms of export markets and import of natural resources but nothing as far reaching as a Middle East common market as envisioned by the optimists,' said Mr Beker. Israel still faces an uphill struggle in striking a peace with its other two neighbours - Syria and Lebanon. Furthermore Israel will continue to face hostility from Arab and Islamic states such as Iran, Iraq and Libya which continue to influence developments and could pose a military threat to the Jewish state either directly or through proxy forces.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAHLAVI -- MAN WHO WOULD BE KING;  </P> <P> DON'T TRUST KHOMEINI, SHAH'S SON WARNS U.S.  </P> <P> "I commend the great Iranian people into the hands of the Crown Prince. . . .  And this is my last wish."  </P> <P>  -- Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, 1980.  </P> <P> As the Bush Administration gingerly explores the chances of mending fences with  the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran, the son of the former shah is  trying to make sure it won't happen.  </P> <P> "I certainly do hope that this Administration is definitely aware that even if  the Khomeini regime is instrumental in the release of the hostages (held in  Lebanon), one should not forget what this regime has done for the past 10  years, what it has stood for," says Reza Pahlavi II, who has proclaimed himself  the current Shah of Iran.  </P> <P> At 28, Pahlavi is a shah without a country, a would-be king with a shy smile  and large ambitions who travels the world seeking somehow to galvanize a  counterrevolution.  </P> <P> These days, his travels have brought him to California. He'll be in Los Angeles  on Saturday, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution that  toppled his father from power. Southern California, he notes, has more than  450,000 Iranian exiles and is the largest such community in the United States.  </P> <P> Over the last few months, Pahlavi has stepped up the pace of his political  activity. He was recently in Britain and France. He was scheduled to stop in  West Germany, but its government banned him from entering the country.  </P> <P> At each of his stops, Pahlavi preaches the virtues of freedom and democracy for  Iran. "I think people have a right to change their minds," observes the heir to  the Peacock Throne. "For a majority of my countrymen, all they have to do is  compare their present situation with what they had."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monarchy Is One Option  </P> <P> If the Khomeini regime were to fall, monarchy would be "one of the options" for  Iran, he says, suggesting that he would like to become a constitutional  monarch, perhaps like King Juan Carlos I of Spain.  </P> <P> "We're talking about the democratic system where the monarchy is not ruling but  reigns," he says. "He is a symbol for the country. He is above politics."  </P> <P> That is, of course, a role far different from the one played by his autocratic  father, whose regime tolerated no political opposition and ran one of the most  feared secret police agencies in the world.  </P> <P> A decade ago, the younger Pahlavi was still a teen-ager, a crown prince who had  been led since birth to believe that he would someday inherit a nation. He was  undergoing military training with the U.S. Air Force near Lubbock, Tex., on  Jan. 16, 1979, when, after months of turbulent demonstrations, his father was  forced to flee the country. Khomeini returned to Iran on Feb. 1, and his  fundamentalist regime took power 10 days later.  </P> <P> His father died in exile in Egypt in 1980. A few months later, Pahlavi, then 20  years old, declared himself shah.  </P> <P> These days, Pahlavi lives in northern Virginia. The small office from which he  operates lies across the street from the main entrance of the CIA. It was that  agency that helped to restore his father to power in a coup against nationalist  Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953.  </P> <P> "I owe my throne to God, my people -- and to you," his father later told Kermit  Roosevelt, the CIA official who organized the shah's triumph over Mossadegh.  (Roosevelt recounted the episode in his book, "Countercoup.")  </P> <P> For the record, the younger Pahlavi says that he gets no direct support of any  kind from the U.S. government, although he leaves open the possibility that  such aid might come indirectly.  </P> <P> "There might be various political groups that have been active in the scene (of  Iranian opposition politics) who have had their ties and contacts with various  governments in the world, among them certainly the United States," he explains.  </P> <P> A CIA spokesman refuses to say whether the agency is helping Pahlavi. "We would  not confirm or deny an intelligence matter," the spokesman says.  </P> <P> At the State Department, one expert on Iran says he believes that the framework  of the Islamic revolution led by Khomeini "is pretty solidly implanted" in Iran  and that the number of people supporting any sort of return to the monarchy is  a "dwindling group."  </P> <P> But the State Department official quickly adds, "Looking back, no one could  have predicted the last 10 years in Iran, so I don't know why we should be able  to predict the next 10."  </P> <P> Pahlavi seems to worry that the United States may try to reach some kind of  accommodation with Khomeini's fundamentalist regime.  </P> <P> "When you end up sending arms to Khomeini, when you end up practically  condoning acts of terrorism . . . to rely on this as a policy of reconciliation  I feel would be a grave mistake," he says.  </P> <P> What Pahlavi wants from the United States, he insists, is not financial backing  but moral support. "All we expect from the outside world is moral support for a  cause that is worthy of defending, because we are talking about a violation of  human rights in our country," he says.  </P> <P> Pahlavi acknowledges that there also were complaints about human rights under  his father's rule. SAVAK, the Iranian intelligence and secret police agency set  up under the shah, was found to have arrested, detained and tortured political  opponents of the regime.  </P> <P> "I'm sure that my father had his sets of problems and mistakes that he made.  I'm sure if he were to be alive, he definitely would admit to them. . . . I am  not condoning any act of what happened. But to suggest that these things were  state policy in the country before (1979), I think would be an exaggeration."  </P> <P> Furthermore, Pahlavi argues, nothing that took place during his father's reign  can compare to the horrors of the past decade. According to Amnesty  International, thousands of people have been executed in Iran since the 1979  revolution, some of them by firing squad or even stoning, and other Iranians  have been punished with amputations, flogging or mutilation.  </P> <P> "It's a return to the 17th Century," says Pahlavi. "At the end of the 20th  Century, we cannot deal with issues in the Dark Ages. You cannot have a period  of Inquisition and at the same time cope with the rest of the world."  </P> <P> Pahlavi's attacks upon the Khomeini regime -- delivered in the country Khomeini  calls the "Great Satan" -- do not go unnoticed overseas.  </P> <P> Last December, a few days after the bombing of Pan American Flight 103, a  caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, a  pro-Iranian group, called U.S. news agencies in London to threaten some  unspecified action this year unless the United States deports Pahlavi.  </P> <P> Pahlavi points to such threats against him as evidence that he still plays a  politically important role in Iran.  </P> <P> He insists that he keeps in close touch with events in Iran, so that "physical  separation does not, in my case, mean isolation."  </P> <P> Ironically, Pahlavi admits that he is now trying from a distance to do to  Khomeini what Khomeini once did to his father: that is, to join together all  the many different elements of Iranian society in opposition to the current  regime. For this reason, he avoids being too specific about his vision of  Iran's future.  </P> <P> "Within 10 years, one learns a lot," he observes. "People are tired of slogans.  People are tired of ideological debates. . . . Everybody wants to be freed from  this nightmare."  </P></p>

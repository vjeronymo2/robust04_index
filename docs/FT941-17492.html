			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Contenders in the main events: FT writers identify the faces to watch in '94, as Europe's political leaders face bruising election battles A nomination as a front runner for high political office can become a poisoned chalice; it alerts opponents and can cause expectations to become inflated. But if 1993 was the year in which faith in European political leaders slumped, this year offers a plethora of chances for unseating incumbents across the continent. There are important elections in Germany, Italy, eastern Europe and the Nordic countries, and the run-up to the 1995 French presidential election begins in earnest. Where there are no elections, the ebb and flow of public opinion offer the chance for new faces to emerge; upsets of the established order are probable. Germany, for instance, could have a new chancellor if Helmut Kohl cannot turn around his Christian Democratic Union's waning fortunes by the general elections in ctober. The man most likely to succeed is the cautious, sober, neatly bearded Rudolf Scharping of the Social Democratic party. First, however, Scharping has to prove to his party, and the electorate, that it is an organisation 'fit for government'. Eleven years in opposition have given the SPD the image of a collection of squabbling preachers and academics, more inclined to philosophical disputes than questions of power politics. Since he became party leader last June, 46-year-old Scharping has moved swiftly to build the necessary pragmatic platform from which to launch his bid for power. Whether or not Scharping succeeds, the other German politician likely to cut a new dash this year is Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound parliamentary leader of the CDU, and the crown prince in the ruling party. The only question is whether he has the physical strength to take on the top job, since he was partially paralysed in an assassination attempt in 1990. Schauble is the consummate politician: quick-thinking, articulate, ruthless in debate and in negotiation, and yet charming. Sometimes he seems like the fast-talking second in the boxing ring, whispering tactics into the ear of his lumbering heavyweight champion, Kohl. In France, the same old cast of politicians threatens to dominate television screens and newspapers. Fighting to carry the conservative colours into the presidential election will be Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and leader of the RPR Gaullists, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. On the left, Michel Rocard has no real rival to carry the standard of his depleted Socialist party into the presidential election, with one exception - Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. But younger French politicians will be jockeying to establish themselves as possible prime ministers in 1995 and/or contenders for the presidency in 2002. One to watch is Alain Juppe, the 48-year-old foreign minister who is also the RPR's secretary-general. He played a crucial part in France's international and domestic negotiations on Gatt. Long close to Chirac, he is now indispensable to Balladur. Gerard Longuet, the vigorous, 47-year-old trade and industry minister, leads the Republican party, the UDF's largest single component, and might make a suitable coalition prime minister under a President Balladur. Also striving to make his mark will be Nicolas Sarkozy, the 38-year-old budget minister and government spokesman. Extremely close to Balladur, he has become the prime minister's medium for controlling economic policy and his principal spin-doctor. It is the left that looks likely to make the running in Italy. Achille Occhetto, leader of the party of the Democratic Left (PDS), starts the year well ahead of the political field. With early general elections almost certain in March, the mustachioed former communist turned social democrat is set to head a broad 'progressive' coalition. The PDS has inherited the formidable organisation of the old Italian Communist party (PCI) and has formed a series of highly effective alliances at local level. If this can be repeated at national level, Occhetto stands a good chance of being the next prime minister, if not a leading element in the next government. Other Italian politicians have been slow to realise the need under new electoral laws to mould alliances among the fragmented parties. But media magnate Silvio Berlusconi sees himself as a catalyst for a coalition built from Italy's dismembered centre and on the right. In November Berlusconi voiced his ambition to forge a coalition to block the PDS's rise to power. He must now decide whether he continues to shout from the sidelines or crosses the Rubicon from business to politics by forming his own party. Elections to the European Parliament in June are likely to bring a fillip for prominent leftwingers. Elisabeth Guigou, the former French minister for European affairs, is relaunching her political career with a bid to enter the parliament under the socialist flag. She seems assured of a seat, and could be one of several women taking their place on the Strasbourg/Brussels benches, including Glenys Kinnock, wife of the former British Labour party leader. At the European Commission, Jacques Delors is expected to serve out his term as president until December. But Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for competition policy and state aid, is forecast to raise his profile. Popular inside the Commission, he has taken a less rumbustious attitude to his job than his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan. But he is quietly proficient and handled the steel crisis last year with aplomb, even if the final solution was less tough than he would have liked. In contrast, the tendency of Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, to shoot from the lip has landed him in trouble. He called Germany 'a bestial giant with a child's brain' because of its desire to open diplomatic ties with Macedonia, while the British press had 'an almost racist tendency' to portray Greeks as mindless hedonists. In central Europe, three young, ambitious politicians, two of them with a communist past, will be aiming for the political big-time. Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old leader of Poland's Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), came a long way in 1993, when his coalition of 21 leftwing political groups became the largest political party in the new parliament after September's elections. This year Kwasniewski is expected to lock horns with President Lech Walesa, challenging the latter's control over the three vital ministries of the interior, foreign affairs and defence, and positioning himself for the big prize - the presidency of Poland - which is up for grabs in 1995. In Slovakia, Mr Petr Weiss, the Slovak equivalent of Mr Kwasniewski, is preparing for a similar challenge to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the introverted, unpredictable prime minister who led Slovakia to independence but gives the impression of having little idea of how to create a modern, democratic state in a region fraught with ethnic rivalries. But it is in Hungary, where voters go to the polls in May, that the challenge to the region's communist past is greatest. Viktor Orban, one of the most impressive of the younger generation of politicians, dreams of lifting Hungary free from its communist history by bringing in a new generation of political leaders. Prime Minister Peter Boross - who replaced Jozsef Antall, the veteran Democratic Forum leader who died before Christmas  -is 65; Orban, the leader of Fidesz, the youth party, is not yet 30. At the opposite end of the age scale, the man who took over as Swedish prime minister when Olof Palme was assassinated by a still-unknown gunman in 1986 could be back in office by the end of 1994. Ingvar Carlsson, 59, leader of Sweden's venerable Social Democrats, survived the party's worst election defeat in more than 60 years in 1991 and will spearhead its attempt to unseat Prime Minister Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition in a general election due in September. Mr Carlsson insists the ideological pendulum is swinging the Social Democratic way again after three tough years of recession. In neighbouring Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, a bluff United Nations diplomat whose main attraction is his lack of political baggage, should be the country's president by the end of February. Although he has slipped in the opinion polls, Mr Ahtisaari, who led the UN operation that brought independence to Namibia, is still favourite to win the presidential election. The first round is on January 16. As an enthusiastic advocate of Finland's application to join the EU, Mr Ahtisaari is set to play a prominent role in persuading the country to back membership in a referendum expected before the end of the year. The task should be made easier by the rise of the far right in neighbouring Russia, which has made the EU's embrace seem much warmer than before.

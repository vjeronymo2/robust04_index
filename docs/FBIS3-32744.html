The sources added that "thanks to some information," police  arrested "El Guajiro" at Los Garzones airport in Neiva as he  prepared to board a domestic flight. The EPL dissident rebel,  who did not want to sign the peace agreement with the government  in January 1991, is being interrogated today by authorities.    Solano or "El Guajiro" is accused of rebellion, association  with criminal intent, and terrorism, among other charges.    Last 29 January, authorities captured another rebel from  that  group in Cartagena de Indias (in the north) called Guido Meneses  Ruiz, the alleged author of the murder of 50 former members of  his organization who rejoined civilian life through the EPL  agreements in 1991.</p>

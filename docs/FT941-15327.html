			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cellular Telecom to get quote in US Cellular Telecom, the UK mobile communications company, is to be quoted in the US following the reverse takeover of a Canadian company once known for its claims to have produced an anti-Aids product. Health Care Products, which was recently delisted from the Toronto stock exchange and currently trades on Nasdaq, is to pay Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) in shares for a 52.17 per cent stake in Cellular Telecom Ltd, the trading subsidiary of Cellular Telecom Holdings. The UK company will have the option to sell the remaining 47.83 per cent for a further Dollars 2.7m in shares. Cellular Telecom is an airtime services provider for the Vodafone and Cellnet networks and is 19 per cent owned by the offshore family interests of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur. Mr Smith is best known for his links with a number of quoted natural resource companies, two of which are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Negotiations for the deal were conducted on behalf of the UK company by Mr Robert Pollock, a former director of Cellular Telecom. Mr Pollock, a discharged bankrupt, resigned from the board of Cellular Telecom in June following controversy over the collapse of Alpine Double Glazing, where he was chairman. Health Care was delisted from the Toronto stock exchange after failing to meet requirements for reverse takeovers. Under TSE rules, companies seeking 'backdoor listings' are required to issue a detailed information circular on their business, and to obtain shareholders' approval for the transaction. Most companies comply with these conditions rather than lose their listing. But Health Care was keen to push through the Cellular Telecom deal as quickly as possible, leaving insufficient time to issue the circular with information on both companies or call a shareholders' meeting. The deal was accompanied by two private placements to raise about CDollars 1.4m (Pounds 700,000) ' half of which was taken up by Oeri Finance of Basle ' for investment in Cellular Telecom. Assuming the second placement is completed and the option to sell the remaining stake called upon, Cellular Telecom's vendors will control about 52 per cent of the enlarged quoted company. Health Care will change its name to Cellular Telecom &amp; Technologies. Health Care provoked controversy about three years ago when the Ontario Securities Commission forced it to withdraw profits forecasts following a significant difference between statements in the 1988 listing prospectus and the actual profits achieved in that year. Mr Frank Strong, chairman, blamed bad publicity for failure to meet profit projections. Health Care was best known at the time for Wipe Out, a disinfectant which claimed to kill viruses on contact. Advertisements in US tip sheets stated that Wipe Out could 'stop the spread of the deadly Aids virus'. The US environmental Agency recently ordered the withdrawal of Wipe Out.</p>

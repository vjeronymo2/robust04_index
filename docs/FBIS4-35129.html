			<p>BFN     [Text] "Above and beyond sectorial interests, which are  legitimate and worthy of attention," Uruguay needs a clear  signal on the projections and strategies that must be  implemented in light of many more variables than those  "pertaining to just one sector." This was asserted by Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu just after a long meeting with members of  the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.    He said the matter was discussed at length with congressmen.  Answering a question on a possible "obstacle" as a result of  government negotiations to find a common external tariff, the  minister said there are no obstacles. He said the schedule that  must be concluded by 30 June 1994 is on target.    Regarding the disagreement expressed by the Chamber of  Industries, Abreu said there will be a meeting today with the  private sector, which will offer an "opportunity to listen to  all opinions.    The minister recalled that "a postponement regarding  external  tariffs has been sought...we want to know what arguments are  being used. We want to know what level of political consensus  can be achieved in such a delicate matter as this. He stated  that Uruguay needs, beyond all sectorial interests, a clear  signal of its prospects and national interests on this subject.    Regarding the possibility of approving the position of  industrialists, Abreu stated that the current opinion is neither  favorable nor unfavorable and that "a schedule was established  during the January negotiations which must be fulfilled. An  effort is therefore being made to define a common external  tariff. This effort seeks to fulfill the various phases of the  treaty without making any changes."    He said he is unwilling to close any channel, adding that  "open dialogue is being conducted internally and externally,"  but without going outside the law.    Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the Batllist Forum's presidential  candidate, stressed on 22 June during several radio interviews  that the report published by EL PAIS on 19 June under the  headline: "Sanguinetti: The Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] Must Be Postponed," does not reflect reality because he  did not propose any such thing. His remarks, which were  broadcast by Radio Sarandi during a rally at Empalme Olmos on 18  June, are as follows: "Through Mercosur we should be able to  enter a new stage of transition. We have already had one stage  of transition. The Mercosur treaty specifies that all tariffs  will be eliminated on 1 January 1995. This is not possible, we  must begin a new stage of transition so that another  readjustment period of four or five years can be implemented,  let us implement another readjustment, let us evaluate every  situation...."    The expected government reaction to Sanguinetti's remarks  was  not long in coming. Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de  Posadas stressed that Uruguay's adhesion to Mercosur "is beyond  the point of no return." He expressed concern that very  important topics for the country--such as Mercosur and the  exchange rate--are being used glibly for election purposes.  During an ACDE [Association of Christian Executives] luncheon on  22 June, the minister said: "The intention now exists to  undermine the government in an international negotiation like  that of Mercosur."</p>

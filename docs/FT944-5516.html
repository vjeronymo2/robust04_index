			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Row over FM radio licence XFM, the commercial radio consortium which recently failed to win a broadcasting licence in London, may seek a judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision. Mr Chris Parry, executive chairman of XFM, which hoped to cater for young Londoners with a taste in 'alternative, independent rock', said he would decide next week whether to seek leave for a judicial review. In October the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, awarded four new licences for London, including two for FM. The authority caused surprise by awarding one of the two FM licences to Mr Richard Branson's Virgin 1215 even though it was already available all over the UK on AM. The second went to Crystal FM, which offers soft adult rock. Mr Parry said he is mainly concerned at the voting mechanism by which Virgin was chosen over XFM. He believes that one of the Radio Authority members, Mrs Margaret Corrigan, who was unable to attend the meeting, had made her support for XFM clear. Mrs Corrigan declined to comment on her views. Mr Peter Baldwin, chief executive of the Radio Authority, has confirmed that there was a deadlock over one of the FM licences. It is believed that in the absence of Mrs Corrigan, Lord Chalfont, the Radio Authority chairman, voted first as a member to tie the vote at four for Virgin and four for XFM. He then used his casting vote as chairman to give Virgin victory. The procedures only allow a vote to members who attend and the chairman has the casting vote in the case of a tie. Mr Parry yesterday said Lord Chalfont's decision to vote twice was outrageous. Virgin has been campaigning for an FM licence for some time because of the poor quality of AM frequencies.</p>

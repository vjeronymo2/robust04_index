			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / LME probe into Chilean futures Codelco, Chile's state copper company, yesterday said the London Metal Exchange had agreed to investigate 'unusual transactions' between Codelco and several brokers that contributed to losses of up to Dollars 270m (Pounds 174m) for the company on futures trading last year. Codelco will this week send a formal report to the LME detailing operations in 1993 by Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's chief futures trader, many of which had 'no commercial explanation whatsoever'. Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco president, said an Ernst &amp; Young investigation showed 'the existence of systematic deceit aimed at distorting the economic outcome of copper futures transactions, creating fictitious profits and postponing losses'. However, he stressed that this did not necessarily imply that the brokers concerned had deliberately colluded with Mr Davila. The announcement of a possible LME probe follows a recent visit by Codelco officials to regulatory authorities in London and Washington when they presented initial findings of the Ernst &amp; Young report. 'LME executives said they were fully prepared to begin the appropriate investigations after receipt of a written request by Codelco, which will be sent in the next few days,' Mr Villarzu said. Mr Villarzu said Ernst &amp; Young had discovered oper-ations between Codelco and London brokers that would have been illegal on the Comex exchange in New York. 'This is not the case on the London exchange whose regulations in this respect are much less demanding' and based principally on 'good faith and gentlemen's agreements'.</p>

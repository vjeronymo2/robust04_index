			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hungary sells porcelain producer Hungary is to privatise Zsolnay Porcelangyar, its largest manufacturer of high-quality porcelain. The state would sell an 84 per cent stake in the company through a one-round tender which would close on November 28, according to AV RT, the state holding company. Because Zsolnay is one of Hungary's oldest and best-known companies, the state plans to keep a golden share with some veto rights, according to Japan's Daiwa MKB which is advising AV RT. The 84 per cent stake has a nominal value of Ft463.6m (Dollars 4.29m) which under Hungarian privatisation regulations is the minimum price acceptable. AV RT said it aimed to find a partner which would keep the Zsolnay name and maintain employment at its factory in Pecs, southern Hungary. Zsolnay, which employs 1,100, had turnover of Ft950m in 1993 and is forecasting Ft1bn this year. Hand-painted porcelain, which the company has been producing for 150 years, accounts for about 30 per cent of output. It also manufactures mass-produced household crockery and porcelain high-voltage insulators, in which it has a local market share of 80 per cent. It has launched a marketing drive to lift exports to 40 per cent of production, from the present level of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent.</p>

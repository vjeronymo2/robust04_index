			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / PM under pressure as Tories fear disaster in Euro-poll Mr John Major's position as prime minister was under fire again yesterday as the Conservative party braced itself for a rout in the European elections. In the wake of Thursday's five by-election defeats and amid fears that Conservative representation in the European parliament will be reduced to single figures, cabinet ministers moved quickly to shore up the prime minister's position. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said Mr Major had 'fought a tremendous campaign', but 'people wanted to give the government a kick up the bottom'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the voters would eventually give the government credit for taking tough decisions and keeping its nerve. However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the government was 'deeply unpopular'. He said he was 'not hopeful about Sunday night', when the European results will be announced. Rightwing backbenchers were careful not to criticise the prime minister publicly ahead of the European election results. But Mr Major is expected to face blunt criticism over the party's poor electoral performance when the Commons reassembles on Tuesday. Rightwing MPs said privately there would be demands for a radical reappraisal of the government's approach to the European Union. Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Euro-sceptic, said the party would 'solve nothing' by replacing Mr Major. But the voters had 'shown in the astonishingly low turnout for the Euro polls that they are fed up to the teeth with Brussels rule'. Conservative officials said they had not given up hope of retaining more than 10 of the party's 32 seats in the European parliament. But Mr David Butler, the leading psephologist and fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, said the Conservatives would be left with no seats if the Eastleigh result was replicated in the 84 mainland European parliament seats. Both main opposition parties claimed that the Eastleigh by-election, in Hampshire, established their position as the main challengers to the Conservatives in the south of England. Mr Paddy Ashdown, whose Liberal Democrats overturned a 17,000 majority to take the seat with a majority of 9,239, said the result was 'a devastating humiliation for the government'.

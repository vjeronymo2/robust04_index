			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Official spokesman's statement"] </F>   [Text] We have seen reports in the media regarding an  alleged Indian offer for talks with Pakistan at the political  level. These reports are wholly speculative and baseless. It  will be recalled, however, that India has always shown readiness  to resolve all outstanding issues with Pakistan bilaterally  through negotiations as envisaged in the Simla Agreement. We  have repeatedly conveyed to Pakistan in the recent months our  willingness to hold a comprehensive dialogue at the foreign  secretary level. We are awaiting Pakistan's formal response.</p>

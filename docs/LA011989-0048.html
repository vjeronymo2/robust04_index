			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DISCO OPERATOR GETS PROBATION  </P> <P> The would-be operator of a teen-age disco was given a suspended three-year  sentence and placed on probation after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine in  his office at the Distillery West.  </P> <P> Among the conditions of Richard Vander's probation are that he enter a  drug-treatment program and pay a fine of $200. He was sentenced Tuesday by  Vista Superior Court Judge Richard Mudd.  </P> <P> Vander, 37, had operated the Solana Beach nightclub for adults and was seeking  to reestablish it as an alcohol-free teen-age club when he was arrested in  November, 1987. The club remains vacant.  </P> <P> In exchange for his guilty plea to possession of cocaine, prosecutors dropped  their charge that he was an ex-felon illegally in possession of a handgun.  </P> <P> The arrest came when sheriff's detectives, saying they wanted to discuss using  Vander as an informant, met with him in his office and detected what they  believed was cocaine in his office.  </P></p>

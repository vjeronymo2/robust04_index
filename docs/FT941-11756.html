			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Japan prepares to enter space race Japan plans to launch its first home-grown rocket today - an important step in its long-frustrated attempts to create a world-class aerospace industry, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The National Space Development Agency's H-2 rocket is designed to carry a two-tonne load, the world standard for the satellite industry. The H-2 is two years behind schedule, after two explosions on the launch pad, in which an engineer died. At Y19bn (Pounds 113.8m) a launch it costs at least 50 per cent more than launches by Arianespace, the European space consortium, or General Dynamics of the US. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry sees the project as vital to developing aerospace expertise and reducing Japan's heavy dependence on US aerospace technology. Government officials stress the H-2 project has no covert military purpose and Japan will stick to its principles of not making, owning or allowing the import of nuclear weapons. They were responding to British and US speculation that North Korea's nuclear weapons programme might tempt Japan to abandon its own non-nuclear stance.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTICLE UNFAIR TO SENIOR HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> The Times' article on June 13 regarding the proposed senior citizen housing  project over a city-owned parking lot in Sherman Oaks was unfair and  misleading.  </P> <P> As a former chief deputy to Zev Yaroslavsky, and a City Council candidate last  April, I believe his proposal is creative in scope and helps to provide  much-needed housing for senior and low-income families in the upscale Sherman  Oaks community.  </P> <P> Howard Katz should be commended for coming up with this proposal to utilize a  very valuable parcel of real estate for senior housing and increased off-street  parking for the merchants of Ventura Boulevard. If this proposal is approved by  the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, seniors will be  able to live in apartments priced at $200-$300 per month instead of the present  $1,000 charged in the Sherman Oaks area.  </P> <P> Instead of pointing out the very positive aspects of this proposal, The Times  insinuates Katz had an unethical involvement in the project because his wife  serves on Yaroslavsky's staff. Should the city prohibit Howard Katz from  offering innovative proposals because his wife is employed by the city of Los  Angeles? I hope not!  </P> <P> JACK McGRATH  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

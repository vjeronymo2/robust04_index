			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norma Couri] </F>   [Text] Lisbon -- Until now only prostitutes, mules,  pineapples stuffed with cocaine, traffickers, and undesirable  emigrants [as published] have ever been detained at the Portela  airport: Never weapons. But customs officials confiscated a  mislabeled package which was found to contain 500 Taurus  revolvers from Brazil bound for Iran.    The Portuguese security service, concerned over the role as  a  distribution point for weapons to the world, decided to shed  some light on the subject. The first to mention the subject was  Eduardo Damaso of the daily PUBLICO, who long ago began tracking  weapons deals from Latin America, via Portugal, to Eastern  countries. It is now public knowledge that Brazil uses Portugal  as an transit point in the sale of weapons through the Barcarena  Gunpowder Company, which denies knowledge of the content.    The company maintains that the shipment "contained 300  barrels and triggers sold as spare parts" and asserted that  "this is not war materiel." Airport customs, which has kept the  package for the past three months, asserts that it contains  revolvers. It is charging $200 per day storage.    The Barcarena Gunpowder Company explains that it was  "tricked" because it thought there were no direct flights  between Brazil and Iran. The Portuguese media has reported the  arrival of Iranians in Portugal, coinciding with the visit of  CIA Director James Woolsey. Damaso reports on meetings between  Iranians and other foreigners in Portuguese hotels to settle  deals involving war materiel.    The Brazilian consulate and the embassy in Portugal deny  knowing anything about the weapons stored at the airport.  Brazilian military attache Colonel Chuquer commented that  Taurus is a private company and that "the United States, for  example, is one of its best clients."</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (4): More flexible options - Printers Until the 'paperless office' becomes a reality rather than just a dream there will be a need for printers to turn personal computer data into words and graphics on sheets of paper. Office printer technology has come a long way since the early days. As PCs have become more powerful, and software more sophisticated, users have sought more flexible print options. The printer market today is fiercely competitive and second only, in terms of volume and value, to PC hardware itself. According to Romtec, the Berkshire-based marketing consultancy, 745,000 printers worth Pounds 617m were sold in 1991. Volume sales are forecast to increase by 50 per cent by 1996 and by at least 20 per cent to about Pounds 740m in terms of value. But the mix of sales is also changing rapidly from older, 'impact' printing techniques such as dot matrix and daisywheel, to newer, non-impact methods such as inkjet and light-emitting diode (Led) and laser. While daisywheel printers have all but disappeared, dot-matrix printers still hold more than 40 per cent of the total printer market and have an important role to play. The latest 24-pin dot matrix printers from companies such as Epson, Panasonic, Star and Oki are capable of producing high quality text and graphics at bargain prices. Meanwhile, dot matrix line printers, with speeds of up to 5,000 lines per minute, are the office workhorses, especially suited to printing multipart forms, invoices and other stationary on continuous-feed paper. Nevertheless, as prices tumble, the underlying trend is towards non-impact machines. These are much quieter than impact printers and combine high speed with advanced text and graphics handling capabilities. The level of demand for inkjet printers, which can now be bought for as little as Pounds 300, has even taken some suppliers by surprise. Hewlett-Packard, the market leader, has had to build a new US factory to turn out 500,000 inkjets a month. Lightweight inkjet printers such as those sold by Cannon, Mannesmann Tally and Kodak are also proving very successful in the fast-growing portable market. But in the office desktop market, where users are demanding higher print capabilities to match their software, those who need speed as well as quality can now buy eight-page-per minute (ppm) laser printers for less than Pounds 1,000 at street prices, or 4ppm lasers for less than Pounds 600. Laser and Led printers accounted for more than a quarter of all printer sales in the UK last year and are expected to take at least a third of 1996 sales. Inkjet printers are forecast to take a further third, giving non-impact technologies about two thirds of the total UK market by 1996. Another important factor driving laser printer sales is the increasing trend towards networking PCs and the growth of workgroup computing, which opens up the possibility of sharing printers and helps justify the steady migration to more expensive, high-speed (16ppm to 20ppm), heavy-duty network laser printers such as Compaq's new Pagemarq printers aimed at a market expected to reach Dollars 30bn by the mid-1990s. The worldwide market for personal printers is forecast to grow by just over 18 per cent 1992 to 1995, while unit sales of network printers are expected to increase by 26 per cent over the same period, according to Massachusetts-based BIS Strategic Decisions and Compaq Computer estimates. According to Romtec, Epson and Hewlett Packard (HP) dominated the UK PC printer market in 1991, with respective market shares by volume of 22.4 and 22.1 per cent. Because Epson's product mix is biased toward lower-cost dot matrix printers, compared to HP's focus on laser and inkjet machines, their market share by value is very different, with HP taking 34.4 per cent and Epson just 13 per cent. Within the laser printer market, HP is the clear market leader, but under increasing competitive pressure from companies such as Lexmark, the IBM alliance company, and Oki, both of which have been increasing market share. HP's success in laser printing owes much to the development of its Printer Command Language (PCL). The vast majority of laser and Led printers support PCL, leaving manufacturers to differentiate their products through other features such as font capabilities, greater speed and easier paper handling. A growing number of laser printers, however, now support Adobe PostScript which offers greater font and graphics flexibility than even the latest versions of PCL. Among the most exciting developments in printer technology is the gradual appearance of colour desktop printing capability. Some dot-matrix machines provide cheap, but somewhat limited, colour options. Colour inkjets provide a more flexible higher quality option and are increasingly popular. But colour lasers are rapidly declining in price although they still command a hefty price premium and therefore serve a specialist niche rather than a mass market. Laser printer manufacturers are focusing on the environment. Most laser printers tend to generate a lot of waste in the form of used toner cartridges and printer drums. In response to growing concern about the environment many manufacturers now operate cartridge recycling schemes. Some manufactures have adopted even more radical approaches. Among them Kyocera claims its new ecologically friendly Ecosys FS-1500 printer reduces the cost of ownership by about two thirds to 0.6p a page. Unlike conventional lasers which need replacement printer drums periodically, Kyocera's Led machine is built around an amorphous silicon (aSi) drum which is durable, scratch-resistant and, it is claimed, will last the life of the printer - even when using abrasive recycled paper. Another potential problem with laser printers, and xerographic copiers, is that they generate ozone which can pose a health hazard to office workers and has been blamed for triggering allergies. The ozone is normally trapped by an air filter, but with use the filter clogs up and ozone emissions can rise. Now Canon, which makes 80 per cent of the world's laser printer engines, has developed a way to reduce ozone emission substantially by replacing the highly charged wire in a laser printer with a special charge transfer roller so that even if the filter clogs there is still no significant release of ozone. Other printer manufacturers, including both HP and Kyocera, are following Canon's lead.</p>

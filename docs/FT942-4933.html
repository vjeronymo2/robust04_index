			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Argentina to sell off remaining 20% of YPF Argentina yesterday came out in favour of selling the government's remaining 20 per cent stake in YPF, the privatised oil company. The deal is expected to raise about Dollars 1.8bn at current prices. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, said that the government was in favour of the sale with one condition. The sale of the stake is being heavily promoted by members of the governing Peronist party in Congress. Mr Cavallo said: 'It depends on the use the resources would be put to. If used for development of the interior, we would view it positively. If there was a one-off distribution of the resources as assistance, it would be an error.' YPF, Argentina's biggest company, was privatised in June last year in a Dollars 3.04bn local and international share offering. The government sold 45 per cent of YPF to investors, held on to a 20 per cent stake and sold the remaining shares to workers, provincial governments and pensioners. YPF now has a market capitalisation of close to Dollars 9bn. Last week members of Congress proposed selling the government's shares in YPF to finance construction of 100,000 houses in the run-up to next year's presidential election. Mr Cavallo said the sale would be carried out through a public offering, but warned that debates in Congress and discussion over the use of the money meant that a final decision would probably only be taken in two or three months.</p>

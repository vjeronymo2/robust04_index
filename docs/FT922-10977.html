			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Markets rise on hopes for recovery STERLING, leading UK shares and government gilt-edged securities all rose yesterday, on the back of strong hopes that a UK recovery will begin later this year. While the pound gained 1 1/4 pfennigs against a weaker D-Mark to close in London at DM2.9375, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares climbed 15.2 points to close at 2,658.2. Gilts, which are bonds sold to finance UK government borrowing, also rose by up to half a point as investors took a favourable view of growth prospects. Sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) against the D-Mark was helped by news of mounting political and economic problems in Germany. Worried international investors switched money out of D-Marks into other currencies, including sterling, the Japanese yen and the French franc. The pound's rapid gain against the German currency since the UK general election has taken it to within nearly 1 pfennig of its central ERM rate of DM2.95. In the past two weeks, it has leapfrogged the Danish krone, the French franc and the Italian lira in the ERM. Against the dollar yesterday, the pound closed in London at Dollars 1.7795, up three quarters of a cent, and in New York at Dollars 1.7765. In late trading in New York the pound was at DM2.9381.

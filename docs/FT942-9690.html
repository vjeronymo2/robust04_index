			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Ministers to press for U-turn on CrossRail Ministers plan to send the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project for a cross-London rail link back to the four-man private bill committee which recently voted to reject it. The government believes the only realistic way of reviving the project is to persuade the committee to change its mind. Officials have all but ruled out the only other options. They are to present a 'hybrid' bill - one which involves both public and private interests - to parliament or to use the Transport and Works Act of 1992. The Department of Transport is already committed to one hybrid bill for the high-speed rail link. It is unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a second in November's Queen's Speech. The use of the Transport and Works Act would involve the project's sponsors requesting Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to lay an order before parliament. But because objections are then heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along the route, Whitehall officials believe the process could take at least 10 years to complete. Ministers have started lobbying two of the three MPs on the private bill committee which rejected CrossRail, as the only realistic way of saving the project. Only Mr Matthew Banks, Tory member for Southport, supported the bill on the committee. Government officials are pinning their hopes on persuading Mr John Marek, Labour member for Wrexham, to change his mind. They have taken comfort from the support for the measure given by Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's shadow transport secretary. Mr Dobson has urged the government to put a motion before the Commons sending the bill back to the committee and instructing them to look at it again. Mr Ken Purchase, the other Labour MP to oppose the bill, is not expected to reverse his vote. He is understood to be sceptical about the benefits of private finance in public-sector projects such as CrossRail. Mr Tony Marlow, the committee's Tory chairman, has said he thinks it unlikely that the government would be successful in asking the committee to reconsider its decision. This would require it to show that the committee had not acted according to the proper procedures or that there had been a significant change in the circumstances of the proposal. The committee was influenced by the decline in travel demand in recent years and by the development of other travel routes such as the Jubilee Line, he said. The CrossRail project would provide a six-mile east-west link under central London. Commuters could reach their destinations without changing trains. Letters, Page 9</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BITTER CHARGES SIGNAL A LONGER SCHOOL STRIKE;  </P> <P> ACCUSATIONS OF LYING MARK START OF SECOND WEEK AS TEACHERS HOLD RALLY; DISTRICT  POLICE ARREST 11  </P> <P> With accusations of lying flying back and forth, relations between the two  sides in the Los Angeles teachers' strike reached the boiling point Monday as  thousands of teachers rallied and 11 union leaders and supporters were arrested  later outside district headquarters.  </P> <P> Sources said it is increasingly likely that the strike, entering its second  week Monday, may not be resolved until after school board runoff elections June  6 and could last the rest of the school year. The last strike in 1970 lasted 23  days.  </P> <P> "I'm not holding up much hope at the moment," school board President Roberta  Weintraub said.  </P> <P> Helen Bernstein, a vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers'  union, called the standoff an "absolute disaster for Los Angeles. I don't know  if we'll ever have school again this year," Bernstein said.  </P> <P> She was among 10 adults and one juvenile who were arrested on suspicion of  trespassing Monday afternoon after they allegedly attempted to cross school  district police lines at district headquarters downtown. Those arrested  included two other UTLA vice presidents and the secretary and treasurer of the  union. The union charged school district police with brutality in the arrests,  an allegation that was denied by the district's officers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged the harshest rhetoric since the strike  began, most of it over whether or not the district had indeed put a better  offer on the table.  </P> <P> According to school board member Jackie Goldberg and other sources, negotiators  for the school board on Sunday had offered teachers a three-year contract with  guarantees of 8% raises each year, regardless of how much the district may  receive in new state funds. Such a contract offer would be a significant  advance from an earlier offer, in which the raise in the middle year ranged  between 5.5% and 8%, depending on the availability of state money.  </P> <P> "It was eight, eight and eight, with no formula," said Goldberg, who had acted  as a go-between in the labor dispute. "No ifs, no contingencies, nothing."  Goldberg said she decided to violate a news blackout on the latest negotiations  and reveal what had taken place because "I believe the people in the city have  a right to know."  </P> <P> The union had privately indicated that it would accept such a 24% increase.  Union official Bernstein said a lot of figures were mentioned during the  bargaining but an offer of 24% was never formally made. Goldberg, she insisted,  was not present during the sessions.  </P> <P> Union leaders claimed that the offer was still tied to the state windfall. They  also said the district refused to make concessions on teacher pay docked for  job actions and on the issue of sharing decision-making at schools.  </P> <P> UTLA President Wayne Johnson, in a bitter speech to about 7,000 teachers at a  Sports Arena rally, called district leaders and negotiators "desperate,  despicable people" and said of the board's money claims: "They are lying, they  are lying, they are lying."  </P> <P> Johnson ridiculed Weintraub for what he claimed were naps as long as two hours  she took during bargaining sessions. "We finally made a condition that Roberta  had to be awake and at the table," he said.  </P> <P> Asked about those charges, Weintraub said in a telephone interview:  </P> <P> "I have no comment on anything like that. If I were really to reveal what went  on in those sessions . . . about the language used by the other side. . . ."  She declined to be more specific, citing the news blackout, but added that "Mr.  Johnson has made it impossible to bargain."  </P> <P> Symbolizing how quickly the situation had changed in a day, the union held its  massive pep rally Monday in space it had rented to vote on a new contract.  </P> <P> At a press conference Monday, school Supt. Leonard Britton insisted that the  district had increased its pay offer during weekend negotiating. Of union  charges to the contrary, Britton stated: "You will have to choose which one of  us is lying."  </P> <P> Britton said talks collapsed after union leaders refused a package that the  board was told would be acceptable.  </P> <P> Board members Julie Korenstein and Warren Furutani proposed a settlement  package Monday which Goldberg confirmed was identical to one offered by the  district Sunday. The package, among other things, included a provision that the  district reimburse teachers for about half of the wages they were docked last  winter for failing to report student grades for the fall semester. The rest of  the wages lost during job actions before the strike could be made up by working  extra hours.  </P> <P> The proposal also called for the membership on school management councils,  which would decide such things as school discipline, to be evenly divided  between teachers and district appointees. In addition, elementary school  teachers would have 40 minutes a day for preparing lessons and be paid for  voluntary schoolyard duty.  </P> <P> Union leaders said the non-monetary proposals are unacceptable because they do  not give teachers enough power in deciding school issues.  </P> <P> Britton said that no talks are scheduled with union leaders and the district is  prepared to weather the strike "for as long as it has to." The district is  continuing to recruit and hire substitute teachers and the state mediator who  was called into the talks over the weekend has returned home, he said.  </P> <P> The district saved about $12 million in salaries during the strike last week,  money that could be used as part of a final contract settlement, Britton said.  </P> <P> UTLA spokeswoman Catherine Carey said the union will return to the bargaining  table immediately if the offer of 24% is formally made.  </P> <P> Current starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the top is  $43,319, although that amount can be raised by extracurricular and summer  school duties.  </P> <P> At the campuses, student attendance and the number of regular teachers at work  both increased Monday, the district said. But it was clear that about half the  students and two-thirds of the teachers remained out.  </P> <P> Morning rolls found 293,482 of the nearly 594,000 district students in  attendance. That was 34,362 more than on Friday, which had the lowest  attendance of last week, possibly because youngsters wanted a three-day respite  from substitute teachers and makeshift educational programs.  </P> <P> The number of regular teachers at work increased by 654 Monday, to 9,314. The  union said such attrition was expected and that the numbers of its strikers  remains above 20,000 of the 32,000 regular teachers, nurses, counselors and  librarians. The number of substitutes jumped by 74, to 2,527, the district  said.  </P> <P> Some board insiders speculated Monday that the district may not be back to  normal until two school board seats are decided next month and the board  members inaugurated July 1. Up for reelection in runoffs are Korenstein, who  has union backing in her West San Fernando Valley district, and Alan Gershman,  who is facing a union-backed challenger in the race for his Westside seat.  </P> <P> The school board met for about an hour Monday morning and then canceled its  usual public Monday afternoon meeting. Several hundred strikers rallied in  front of the building housing the offices of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, the  district's law firm, and at the district's office about five blocks away where  the arrests were made. Among the protesters' chants was "Wake up, Roberta,"  another reference to Johnson's charge that Weintraub napped during talks.  </P> <P> UTLA spokeswoman Carey accused district police of using "excessive force,"  saying Frances Haywood, a union vice president, was thrown onto a district  police car and handcuffed when she and the others tried to enter district  headquarters to express outrage over the stalemated talks. In addition to  Bernstein and Haywood, other union officials arrested were Vice President Nina  Greenberg, Treasurer Betty Karnett and Secretary Deborah Harrison.  </P> <P> School Police Chief Wesley Mitchell, denying that his officers used excessive  force, said: "I am confident that the officers handled themselves in a very  professional manner."  </P> <P> Police said the arrested demonstrators were released later in the day on their  own recognizance.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers John Mitchell and Tim  Waters.  </P> <P> MOOD GROWS DARK -- The mood of students and teachers grows dark in second week  of strike.

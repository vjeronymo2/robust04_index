			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Tension in Moscow unnerves the Continent THE PROSPECT of a month's heightened political uncertainty in Russia took European equities from last week's effective stasis into a clear decline, writes Our Markets Staff. A week ago, Goldman Sachs said that global equities could lose 2-3 per cent on continuing political instability in Russia but that German equities were likely to be affected most. On the day, among senior bourses, this turned out to be the case. The Milan bourse fell by more than 3 per cent against the 2.2 per cent drop in Frankfurt but Italy seemed mesmerised by its own political problems. FRANKFURT's DAX index fell 37.41 to 1,661.40. Goldman Sachs said last week that the German market could 'justifiably' fall by 5 to 6 per cent over a period, indicating that the 1,600 level is under threat. Mr Mushtaq Shah, a strategist for the brokers, said that Goldman had also thought that the German market was overvalued, and that the Russian problems could act as a trigger for a correction in the market. Turnover fell from DM20.5bn, inflated by Friday's options expiry, to DM6.8bn. Weakness in derivatives spilled over into the cash market and affected Allianz, the insurer, subject of a recent attempt to manipulate the options market; Allianz ended DM67, or 2.9 per cent lower at DM2,242. Some construction stocks, and financials were hit harder than most. Hochtief and Holzmann fell by DM43 to DM1,135 and DM47 to DM1,037 on the thought that Mr Yeltsin's problems could threaten contracts to build flats for Russian soldiers returning home from east Germany. Among banks the main fallers were Bayernhypo, Commerzbank and Dresdner, down DM15.90 to DM438, DM10.50 to DM289.50 and DM16 to DM405 respectively. Brokers said that the Bavarian bank was hurt at the outset by misreporting of its results - it recovered a token DM2.50 to DM440.50 in London later - while the other two, like some of the builders, had been popular with investors recently. MILAN tracked the mood of other markets but had domestic worries of its own which acted as an additional depressant. The Comit index reacted with a fall of 15.09 or 3 per cent to 481.57 but turnover was reported to have been low as many international investors remained absent. The already beleaguered government suffered a further setback with the resignation of the agriculture minister, the sixth cabinet member to have quit in connection with investigations into widespread corruption and bribery. However, some consolation was found in suggestions that March inflation data would show a decline over the previous month. Nevertheless, many investors were dismayed by further delays in the privatisation programme in spite of comments by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, that the government was committed to forcing through the proposals. He added that the cabinet hoped to be able to approve a plan for the flotation of ENI units by the end of the month. The market was unimpressed by news late in the session of terms for Montedison's sale of its majority stake in its pharmaceuticals subsidiaries to Procordia of Sweden. The shares fixed L59 lower at L1,240. Fiat, up sharply on Friday on reports that Renault might take a stake in the group, eased L197 to L5,400. PARIS had already factored in a victory for the right wing in Sunday's first round of the elections, so it looked further afield for stimulation. The CAC-40 index lost 23.4 to 1,939.28, but ended off the day's low of 1,927 as turnover slipped to FFr2.2bn. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe in London said that the new government would aim to raise some FFr50-60m a year through privatisations, with Elf Aquitaine, Rhone Poulenc and Renault among the favoured early candidates: 'Prospects for the latter would be damaged by the widely rumoured acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Fiat, a move denied by both companies but widely believed by industry sources.' Suez eased FFr4.70 to FFr309.60 on worries over the suspension of Baltica Holdings, the Danish insurer, in which it has a stake. STOCKHOLM followed the mood of the day with a fall in the Affarsvarlden general index of 24.00, or 2.5 per cent to 983.2. Turnover was low at SKr569m. Handelsbanken, however, went against the trend with gain of SKr0.50 to SKr71.00 assisted by the prospect of easier European interest rates. VIENNA reacted to Russia's weekend showdown, and Austria's physical proximity to eastern Europe, with a fall of 4 per cent, the ATX index closing 33.09 lower at 783.86. ZURICH was lifted off the day's low by news that the Union Bank of Switzerland plans to cut its mortgage rates by half a percentage point on June 1. The SMI index fell by a below average 21.0 to 2,161.6. COPENHAGEN was depressed further by worries over Baltica Holding, the insurer, which announced restructuring proposals. The KFX index shed 1.96 or 2.4 per cent to 78.87 with Baltica down DKr55 at DKr100. Its main shareholder, Den Danske Bank, was off DKr10 at DKr305.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 22                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1134.90      1130.91      1130.41      1130.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1213.25      1207.42      1207.98      1207.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1131.36      1128.76      1128.82      1129.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1207.29      1204.52      1205.14      1204.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 19    Mar 18    Mar 17    Mar 16    Mar 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1145.37   1148.55   1146.10   1151.53   1153.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1223.70   1222.53   1214.92   1222.33   1219.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1134.90; 200 - 1213.25 Low/day: 100 - 1127.45  200 - 1203.10 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Saltykov article: "Slave Laborers in the Defense </F> Industry's Salt Mines"]    [Text] "So, we will have to fight on. It will have to be  guerilla warfare." This is how Aleksey Shulunov, president of  the League for Assisting Defense Enterprises, ended our  nighttime conversation. It was published by PRAVDA 19 January.  A month has passed. Reflections in the upper echelons are  turning the defense industry and conversion into abandoned salt  mines. Guerilla warfare is becoming slave labor.    The mass stoppage of defense enterprises has begun. As a  sign of protest? No, Russia's armorers, in line with their  centuries-old traditions of selfless service to the fatherland,  are not contemplating a strike. It is just that the majority of  production units have been rendered insolvent.    Certain high-ranking compatriots and foreign consultants  suggest that this is the outcome of unwise moves in an  over-hasty conversion process. But the old defense complex in  its current form is no longer a military-industrial complex.  Some 80 percent of its output is civilian. Moreover, in a  number of sectors this output is capable of competing on the  world market.    The point is, it seems, that it is not the actual  enterprises  which have been rendered insolvent but the state. When summing  up the results of 1993, it was made clear that our government  has a striking talent for tightfistedness. It has managed to  run up debts to the defense sector amounting not to the 700  billion rubles [R] mentioned previously, but to R1.5 trillion.  And given that the matter has not gone as far as the courts  (the Prosecutor's Office has enough riddles from the past to  solve), there is no hurry to advance state defense orders for  1994, or, more especially, to release credits for conversion  projects.    Moreover, in this year's budget submitted by the Ministry of  Finance, allocations for national defense needs continue to be  pared to a minimum. They have been reduced to 46 percent of  last year's level. It should be noted that this calculation is  not in dollars, but in rubles. When converted into world  currency, it will amount in all to just 10 percent of last  years's state expenditure.    Unlike the fledgling entrepreneurs, armaments workers can do  their sums with the utmost accuracy. Otherwise Russia would not  still be in possession of advanced military hardware. So it is  that by their estimation -- which is apt and unbiased -- all  these things signify the total destruction of the country's  defense complex. Savings in this sphere have already surpassed  what is feasible: The average wage in Russia last year was  R58,400, while defense sector workers earned just R28,400. And  although they grumbled, they remained patient, understanding  that pre-market battles are being waged. But now, in just three  or four months, around 20 million people will find themselves  completely bereft of the means to survive.    The consequences of this type of social explosion are  unpredictable. Especially as it is not clear where the  government will find trillions of rubles to meet the costs of  driving this mass of the most highly skilled workers, designers,  and technicians into unemployment. Or has the government  drafted decrees to defer all this as state debts over the next  five years or so?    The conversion of defense enterprises is becoming  nonsensical. Taxes, price deregulation, interest rates for bank  credits, duties, and other government deductions reduce the  capacity of the domestic market and artificially generate a  sales crisis. The living standards of 90 percent of the  population and people's purchasing power are at the lowest  possible level. When fighting for survival, who needs household  gadgets, crockery, television sets, motorcycles, bicycles,  sewing machines, and so on and so forth?    Efforts to survive at the expense of the export of military  hardware and arms have come to nothing. Moreover, the matter no  longer concerns the sale of the latest weapons, but annual  assistance in the safe operation of nationally produced combat  hardware purchased not so long ago by the countries of Asia and  Africa, and being used with relish by the states of Europe.  Russia could earn around $5 billion for the prompt supply of  spare parts alone.    Furthermore, many of these armaments are in need of  upgrading. For instance, it is time to reequip combat aircraft  with the latest missiles and more accurate weapon sights.  However, according to information received, the Israelis and  the British are already mounting French and U.S. missiles onto  our MiG-21's. Whereas copyright dictates that Russian missiles  be used. But our government's inconsistency in military trade  forces foreign consumers to disregard Russian rights.    The result is depressing. Last year, the value of sales for  routine repair work, and exports of consumables and spare parts  was just $2.2 billion, instead of $5 billion. Meanwhile, the  impact of last fall's decision to set up the new  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, which is subordinate not to the  Defense Ministry, nor to the State Committee for the Defense  Industry, and not even to the government head, but to the  President, was felt. And what came of this was not state  discretion, but utter confusion which goes above and beyond  secrecy.    The League for Assisting Defense Enterprises deemed it  necessary to discuss ways of implementing the laws proclaimed by  the Constitution. At the beginning of February it convened an  enlarged session of its presidium. This involved leaders of the  League's regional branches from Moscow, Nizhnyy Novgorod, Tula,  Rostov-na-Donu, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Saratov. And the  directors of the largest enterprises from Moscow and Bryansk  regions. There was even an envoy from St. Petersburg, even  though it is still undecided there whether to join the league or  operate autonomously. First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey  Kokoshin traveled to the conference, as did Yuriy Glybin and  Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairmen of the State Committee for  the Military Industry; Security Council Commission Chairman  Mikhail Maley; and even Viktor Samoylov, manager of the newborn  "Rosvooruzheniye." There were almost 60 of the most  authoritative and knowledgeable slave laborers of Russia's  defense industry.    Journalists, unfortunately, did not have the chance to  attend  the conference. However, according to the testimony of visiting  participants, who did not touch upon secret matters, the  industrialists themselves were able to exchange all the details  of their enterprises' impending period of slave labor. They  coincided absolutely. And they outlined the formidable impasse  of the world's largest industry. Then they demanded  explanations: After all, Premier Chernomyrdin gave instructions  that last year's state debts should be repaid by 1 February.  But so far not a single ruble, not even a defunct kopek, has  been forthcoming.    Andrey Kokoshin admitted that absolutely nothing was paid  out  in January. But the Defense Ministry will pay off at least 60  percent of its debts in the first quarter. Payments will start  as of 10 February. At the same time he announced that he  intends to petition the government to increase budget  expenditure on defense. But whichever way you look at it, there  are as yet no guarantees.    Viktor Samoylov for his part brushed aside the urgency of  the  need to supply spare parts abroad and service our military  hardware sold there. He stressed that it is not worth  discussing this yet, as it is a very complex question.    Yuriy Glybin noted that many problems have accumulated, but  that it is necessary to concentrate on one: The oddities of the  budget proposed by the Ministry of Finances.    Finally, Mikhail Maleyev revealed that the Security Council  has in fact examined the requests, demands, and proposals  submitted by defense enterprises back in November. And in the  course of just two hours, everything was resolved successfully.  The president confirmed his council's decisions. But although  the instructions issued under these decision were addressed to  specific individuals, nobody is in any hurry to act upon them,  and some have no intention of carrying them out. The time might  be ripe if not to start legal proceedings, then at least to  apply some form of punishment....    The results? There are none as yet. A letter was sent to  Government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets on behalf of the  league 14 February. It stressed: "We earnestly request that  you take all measures within your power...to support the  prioritypsectors of the country's economy. We consider it  essential that the funds allocated to defense needs in 1994  should exceed the level of planned allocations for 1993 in  comparable prices by a factor of 1.3 at the very least." It was  signed by the chief designers of nine of the largest science and  production complexes and associations, including "MiG," "Antey,"  the A.A. Tupolev Aviation Science and Technology Complex, the  "Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau," and others.    Oleg Nikolayevich showed an interest. A meeting was set for  16 February. But it did not take place. Soskovets was occupied  with urgent matters until late into the evening. A new week  began. Will something happen today, or tomorrow?...    Admittedly, the hope remains that after the President's  message to parliament opening the discussion by the People's  Deputies of the budget for this year, the chance will emerge to  take account of the league's appeal, which was handed over to  State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin.    People, while you stll have your senses, save your  fatherland. Do not repeat the experience of Slovakia.</p>

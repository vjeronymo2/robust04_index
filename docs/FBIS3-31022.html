"It would provoke a big war in the Balkans and even in  Europe  and UN peacekeepers would then become enemies of the Serbs,"  Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic said in reponse to NATO's  ultimatum warning the Serbs to withdraw all of their heavy  weapons from around Sarajevo by February 21 or face raids by  NATO warplanes.    His warning, carried by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA,  was the first official Serb reaction to the ultimatum, which was  sparked by the weekend attack on a Sarajevo market that left 68  people dead and 197 wounded.    Stojadinovic said the massacre was nothing but a "bloody and  fabricated farce" adding that he backed calls by Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic for an investigation into the attack.    Karadzic walked out of peace talks in Geneva Thursday,  saying  he refused to participate unless the responsibility for the  mortar attack was determined.    The semiofficial Yugoslav news agency TANJUG also criticized  the NATO ultimatum Thursday saying that it reflected a decision  made by "mediocre politicians."    "A group of mediocre politicians, especially those within  the  European Community, are making mistakes that are becoming more  and more serious, without learning any lessons from previous  mistakes," the agency, which generally reflects the Serb  government's opinion, said.</p>

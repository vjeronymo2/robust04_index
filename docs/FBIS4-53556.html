			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- An unusual supplement to an  earlier stopgap budget nearing expiration cleared the last  parliamentary hurdle to become a law Friday upon approval from  the House of Councillors.    The plenary session of the upper house of the Japanese  parliament passed the 10.89 trillion yen supplement to extend  for 40 days an earlier 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05  trillion yen.    The revised stopgap budget, totaling 21.94 trillion yen,  will  expire June 29, when the current Diet session ends.    The rare revision of a stopgap budget -- the first since  fiscal 1990 -- was necessitated by the political confusion  following the abrupt resignation of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection of Tsutomu Hata as his  successor.    The political turmoil had long stalled Diet deliberations on  the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for fiscal 1994, which  started April 1, until Tuesday when budgetary debates finally  began.    The chances for quick passage of the full budget, however,  are viewed as slim because the Hata government holds only a  minority in the Diet.    The revised interim budget earmarks as little as possible  for  the running of administrative bodies, while boosting outlays for  public works projects.    Revised outlays for administrative expenses are set at 25  percent of the full budget, up from 14 percent in the initial  stopgap budget.    Public works got an additional 1.07 trillion yen, bringing  the total so far to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of  such investments envisaged under the full budget.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Secretary believes that additional changes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate in the regulations to prevent institutions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing elongated instructional schedules that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an appropriate workload throughout that period for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student. Institutions offering credit hour programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without terms have more flexibility in shifting the workload  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for their programs over an indefinite period, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary believes that it is appropriate to establish some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum instructional periods that must be used for full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students attending these institutions. No corresponding changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be made where students are already required to receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum amount of clock hours of training per week to be full-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time students, or where the institution has fixed terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also believes it is important to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through regulations that full-time students are performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable workloads regardless of the type of institution they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are attending, and that such work should be ratably allocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the period of instruction. The Secretary notes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is an area of abuse that is not fully addressed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour'' regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather than changing the proposed definition of full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student to require measurement of student workloads, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification is being made to require a minimum number of days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction per week for institutions that offer credit hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs without terms. A discussion of the specific change is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the section of the Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that addresses the definition academic year (&sect;668.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Undergraduate student. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to defining an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as a student who has not earned a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baccalaureate or first professional degree. The commenters noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this would prevent students who were pursuing further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undergraduate studies from receiving any Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance. The commenters noted that this was a departure from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current departmental practice that permits such a student to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA loan programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary recognizes that there are legitimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons supported by statute for separate definitions of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> based upon the different statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the various Title IV, HEA program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes it is not appropriate at this time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a general definition of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student Assistance General Provisions regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from these final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third-party servicer. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters asked the Secretary not to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer services or software in the examples of activities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute administration of a Title IV, HEA program, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds that this type of service encompasses activities in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad spectrum, from computer software distributors of popular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial spreadsheet programs to computer on-line Federal news  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. Several commenters stated that computer services are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply technological means utilized in administering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs; computer servicers who actually perform administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions would be covered, therefore there is no need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately include such providers in the definition. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters argued for the inclusion of computer services or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software in the examples of a Title IV-related activity. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters argued that it was necessary to include providers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer services and software in the definition of third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer because many distributors of software certify that their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer programs_represented to satisfy Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements_comply with all applicable Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. As a result, institutions contracting with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider for the software take for granted that the software is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in compliance with all Title IV, HEA program requirements. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement occurs because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the software, the provider of that software should be held  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible. Several commenters argued that those software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers could be subject to potential liabilities for Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program violations, even though the computer programs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider could be modified by the user.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with those commenters who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either objected to the inclusion of computer services or software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers in the examples of Title IV-related activities, or who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saw no need to separately include such providers. In adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of third-party servicer, the Secretary is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including providers of those services or software because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that this type of service is simply a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological means to assist in carrying out certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative functions that are already included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed definition of a third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters were concerned that a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer could avoid the requirements of these regulations by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply not entering into a written contract with an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to administer any aspect of that institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the regulations stipulate that the acceptance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees by the servicer from the institution for administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program would constitute a contract with the institution for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the definition of third-party servicer under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that contracts with an eligible institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be exempt from these regulations simply by not executing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written contract with that institution. A third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is defined as anyone who contracts with an institution, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to only those entering a written contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Oral contracts, payment of fees for services rendered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other arrangements also constitute enforceable contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary recognizes these types of contracts and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider an individual or organization employing such a method to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer and therefore subject to these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary cautions institutions and third-party servicers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that verbal contracts or other non-written contracts do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt institutions from documenting in writing the contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations of both parties, including the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.25, and submitting a copy to the Secretary, if so instructed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter felt that the activities of Multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data Entry (MDE) Processors and the Central Processor should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the examples of what constitutes administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in a Title IV, HEA program because the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by MDEs or the Central Processor is the foundation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining a student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has previously explained in the NPRM published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1994, that MDEs serve under contract with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department and are already bound by that contract and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education requirements. Therefore, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not believe it necessary to separately regulate MDE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities as part of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] The armies of Nicaragua and Honduras have agreed to  conduct "small, joint operations" at the border in which 3,000  men will participate up to the company level, "without entering  each other's territory," to neutralize armed groups that operate  on both sides of the border.    "I can neither confirm nor deny if the operation will be  directed against the FN 3-80 Northern Front; we will  investigate. I prefer to leave it in general terms," Lieutenant  Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman of the Sandinist People's  Army, EPS, has said.    Jose Angel Talavera, El Chacal, has denied the military  operations are against the FN 3-80, and he said his 250 men who  are still armed will demobilize on 15 April. "In addition, the  EPS knows the exact location of my men," El Chacal has said in  Managua.    Wheelock praised the FN 3-80's demobilization, but in his  opinion, he has said that action will not end violence in that  area, stressing the EPS will have to fight against the rearmed  groups.    "What will permit the disarming of the FN 3-80 will be  assigning more funds for the struggle against the rearmed  groups," he has said.    This past weekend, General Luis Alonso Discua, Honduran  Armed  Forces chief, ordered the reinforcement of the border with  Nicaragua to repel recontras who are constantly attacking the  people in that agricultural and forest area.  <H5>  EPS Deployment </H5>   According to Wheelock, that was the Honduran reply within  the  framework of existing agreements to a recent clash in which a  Honduran NCO and two Nicaraguan rebels, one of whom was recontra  Kaliman, were killed.    There will be no movement on the Nicaraguan side, Wheelock  has said, because the 1,500 Nicaraguan soldiers were deployed  some time ago.    The reasons for this joint operation, the first since 1976,  are due to the existence of thousands of weapons on both sides  of the border and an alarming increase in crime in an area that  was the theater of war: the Honduran former rear guard, and the  Nicaraguan northern border.    According to Wheelock, the EPS believes civilians in the  northern region have at least 15,000 rifles, which are sold in  Honduras at prices that are 20 times higher than in Nicaragua.    The third reason is the existence of arms caches the contras  "planted" in Honduran territory, from where its remnants  operate. Honduran soldiers have promised to destroy them,  Wheelock has said.    According to EPS statistics, last year armed actions in the  Nicaraguan countryside caused the death of 48 soldiers, 225  rebels, and 176 civilians. Twelve soldiers, 49 rebels, and 33  civilians have been killed so far this year.    The same statistics give a breakdown of those casualties as  follows: 95 EPS members, 602 rearmed, and 397 civilians.</p>

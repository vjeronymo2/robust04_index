			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Surveillance sees fee income rise by 12.6% SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance, the Geneva-based international inspection group, said its total fee income in the first eight months rose 12.6 per cent and net income was comparable with the same period of last year. No figures were given. Of the growth in fee income, acquisitions accounted for 4 per cent and foreign exchange 2.3 per cent. The discrepancy between fee income and profit performance was due to a setback in loss adjusting in the US and Australia because of mild weather. A better result is expected in the final third of the year because of the effects of Hurricane Andrew. European markets, which account for nearly half of total fee income, grew 18.5 per cent. North America, which accounts for a quarter of fee income, grew only at 1.9 per cent. The Asia-Pacific region continued to grow at a strong 11.1 per cent, and the company said that its important contract for pre-shipment inspection services with the government of Indonesia had been renewed in July.</p>

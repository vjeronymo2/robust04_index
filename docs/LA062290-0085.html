			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LARRY KING GOES TO BAT FOR BABE RUTH MUSEUM  </P> <P> All shapes and sizes of organizations have tried to recruit Larry King, one of  the most distinctive voices in America, with the hope he might agree to stand  up and offer an appeal for this or that cause. But it's not his game. He didn't  want to be linked with fund-raising, or putting one charity ahead of another.  So he declined, ever so politely.  </P> <P> He has an imposing stature in the field of broadcasting and, in fact, has  earned a presence for himself that rivals such luminaries of the past as Arthur  Godfrey, Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan. There's an ethical awareness that  prevents him from using his network platform to solicit contributions.  </P> <P> But then along came the Babe Ruth Museum, located in Baltimore, and it asked  King if he would become national chairman of its membership committee. His  answer was a ringing acceptance and endorsement of a new campaign that will  extend the facility's physical dimensions via an extensive expansion effort.  </P> <P> King will be the point man, the personality who is out front selling the idea  to individuals and corporations all across the nation. "The name Babe Ruth  catches everyone's attention," he said. "The Babe was symbolic of baseball. He  was and is baseball."  </P> <P> A historian of a sport he enjoys and understands, King knows Ruth towers above  all players, past and present, in talent and a sense of the dramatic. King  never saw Ruth play and wasn't old enough the one year, 1939, when he served as  a first-base coach for the Brooklyn Dodgers and took batting practice, which  was a cheap grandstand ploy to sell tickets.  </P> <P> "No, but I was in Ebbets Field and heard his farewell speech (April 27, 1947)  when baseball celebrated Babe Ruth Day all over America. The comments Ruth made  in Yankee Stadium about what baseball represented to the boys of our country  and the other things he had to say, with a voice weakened by cancer, were  pumped into Ebbets Field and to all other ballparks."  </P> <P> What Ruth had to say and how he struggled against the pain to speak in not much  more than whisper so impressed King that he hasn't forgotten the tugging  emotion of the moment. "No doubt, he was America's greatest athlete, born and  raised in Baltimore and, in fact, as a child lived on the exact location where  center field is going to be located in the new ballpark."  </P> <P> On the subject of a stadium name, King reiterated his position. "It should be  Babe Ruth Park," he emphasized. "To ignore Ruth's ties to Baltimore amid so  much rich background would be some sort of craziness to me. Imagine the  marketing value of the name. Without Baltimore, plus the Orioles signing him,  the world never would have heard of him."  </P> <P> And if you want a little-known note about Ruth, listen as King provides it.  "With all of Ruth's hitting attainments, don't forget he won 94 games as a  pitcher. And do you realize that in winning percentage against the New York  Yankees, he stands second in percentage. When he was with the Boston Red Sox,  he beat the Yanks 17 times and lost only five."  </P> <P> King has long been a Baltimore booster. He was raised in Brooklyn, worked in  Miami and is now based in Washington. But if he has adopted a city by  acclamation it would have to be Baltimore. That's because two of his broadcast  friends, the late Bill O'Donnell and Joe Croghan, continually talked of its  place in history and what it represented.  </P> <P> So King was impressed. The Orioles draw his personal attention as no other team  in sports. King is a student of the game, knows its Hall of Fame heroes as well  as the utility journeymen and talks with in-depth knowledge of the character  and nuances of baseball.  </P> <P> He mentioned the unprecedented achievement of the Orioles winning seven  straight pennants in the International League, a dynasty that stands alone in  the record book. And then he pointed out that Al Kaline, a Baltimore-born Hall  of Famer, lived only five minutes away from where Ruth was born, the site of  the museum at 216 Emory St.  </P> <P> More than 28,000 men, women and children visited the "House of Ruth" last year  and the total should continue to climb. It's the largest baseball museum in the  country -- next to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- and features  exhibits that pay tribute to Ruth, to the Orioles and to other distinguished  Maryland players.  </P> <P> King wants to send out a message to stimulate more interest in the United  States and Canada among fans, with the enthusiastic expectation they will want  to go to bat for Ruth, in a manner of speaking and, in turn, enable the museum  to enlarge. The Babe would've liked that.  </P></p>

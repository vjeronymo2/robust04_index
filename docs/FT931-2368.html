			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / MPs to challenge agency on lost Pounds 21m MPs ON THE Commons public accounts committee are to challenge officials from the Benefits Agency about how the failure of its computer system contributed to the disappearance of some Pounds 21m from the agency's accounts. A report by the National Audit Office said a total of Pounds 37m went missing from the 1991-92 accounts for the social fund, which makes loans to people in need for important or emergency purchases. Of that Pounds 8m was lost through accountancy errors. A further Pounds 8m was lost through 'normal' delays in putting new loans into the system. Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the committee - the Commons' watchdog on spending - said the agency should have had much better control systems and should have planned its computer system more effectively. The agency yesterday said the discrepancy had been caused by an inadequate rather than a faulty computer system, and said it thought only a 'small part' of the Pounds 21m would have to be written off. The system consists of a stand-alone personal computer in each office and was installed in 1988 when the agency was founded. It does not transfer records from one office to another and its software is unable to deal with more than one loan per individual. If someone repaying a loan through deductions in social security benefits moved without leaving a forwarding address any money owed became 'lost' in the system. A new system intended to connect individual offices has already been installed in two offices and should link every office by January 1994. Mr Sheldon said that the errors were particularly serious since the amounts represented such a large proportion of the social fund's annual budget of more than Pounds 300m.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 350,000 MARCH IN FAROOQ RITES  </P> <P> About 350,000 mourners beating their breasts and crying for revenge marched  today in a funeral procession for the chief Muslim cleric of Kashmir, who was  assassinated in his home by three unknown gunmen.  </P> <P> The procession passed peacefully although police say at least 50 died Monday  when security forces fired on thousands of Muslims who seized Mirwaiz Maulvi  Farooq's body from a hospital and carried it through the streets.  </P> <P> Police reported 25 of the 50 victims had died in hospitals after shootings  Monday.  </P> <P> Police took no chances at the funeral, deploying thousands of combat-ready  troops across the tense summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state. The  predominantly Muslim Kashmir area has been convulsed since mid-January by an  uprising against Indian rule.  </P> <P> A curfew was lifted in the areas through which the 3-mile-long funeral  procession passed today and authorities withdrew security forces from those  areas to avoid provocations.  </P></p>

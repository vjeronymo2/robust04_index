			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.2.1. Type of Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tests designed to measure the presence or absence of an effect are usually different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from those used to assess the degree of toxicity or the lowest exposure level required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce an effect (Tilson, 1990a). Screening procedures are first-tier tests that typically permit the testing of many groups of animals. Such procedures may not require extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources and are usually simple to perform. However, these techniques may be labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensive, provide subjective measures, yield semiquantitative data, and may not be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitive to subtle effects as those designed to characterize neurotoxic effects or second-tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests. Specialized tests are usually more sensitive and employed in studies concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms of action or the estimation of the lowest effective dose. Such testing procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are usually referred to as secondary tests and may require special equipment and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive resources. Secondary tests are usually quantitative and yield graded or continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data amenable to routine parametric statistical analyses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing at the first tier is used to determine if a chemical might produce neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following exposure, i.e., hazard detection. In this case, there may be little existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information concerning the neurotoxic potential of an agent. Examples of first-tier tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include functional observational batteries (FOB), including an evaluation of motor activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and routine neurohistopathology. For some chemicals or types of chemicals, there may be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific interest in screening for a particular presumed mechanism of toxicity (e.g., inhibition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cholinesterase or neurotoxic esterase) or neurobiological response (e.g., a site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuronal degeneration). In these cases, specific neurochemical or neuropathological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints can be used in conjunction with first-tier tests. It is desirable that tests selected for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in hazard detection provide a suitable level of sensitivity using the smallest number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A decision to test at the next tier is based on data suggesting that an agent produces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity. The information used to make a decision to test a chemical at the secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level can come from a variety of sources, including neurotoxicological data already in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature, structure-activity relationships, data from first-tier testing, or following reports of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific neurotoxic effects in humans exposed to the agent. Testing at the secondary level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes detailed neuropathological evaluation as well as specific behavioral tests, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to assess learning and memory, or sensory function. Tests at the second tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually measure the most sensitive endpoints of neurotoxicity, and are the most suitable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the no observable adverse effect level or benchmark dose. At this stage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, the use of a second species is considered to address the issue of cross-species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extrapolation. At the present time, tiered testing approaches in neurotoxicology rely heavily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on functional endpoints. It is possible that future testing protocols will employ a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy as more information concerning neurotoxic mechanisms of action become available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and biologically based dose-response models are developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.2.2. Dosing Regimen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Goldberg and Frazier (1989) have indicated that first-tier evaluations identify effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of substances following acute or repeated exposure over a wide range of doses. Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are simple, focused on detection of effects, and results are used to help establish parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the second tier of testing. The subsequent stage(s) of tier testing are designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize more fully the toxicity of repeated dosing. In this case, animals are exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeatedly or continuously to define the scope of toxicity, including latent or delayed effects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of tolerance, and the reversibility of adverse effects. The subsequent stage(s) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing also provide information about specific effects or study mechanisms of neurotoxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This tier uses methods appropriate to characterize the effects observed in the first tier of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.3. Endpoints of Neurotoxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.3.1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As applied to the safety assessment of chemical substances, neurotoxicity is any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse change in the development, structure, or function of the central and peripheral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nervous system following exposure to a chemical agent (Tilson, 1990b). Measures used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal neurotoxicological studies are designed to assess these changes. Neurotoxicity can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described at multiple levels of organization, including chemical, anatomical, physiological, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavioral levels. At the chemical level, for example, a neurotoxic substance might inhibit protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or transmitter synthesis, alter the flow of ions across cellular membranes, or prevent release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals. Anatomical changes may include destruction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the neuron, axon, or myelin sheath. At the physiological level, neuronal responsiveness to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stimulation might be enhanced by a decrease of inhibitory thresholds in the nervous system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical-induced effects at the behavioral level can involve a variety of alterations in motor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensory, or cognitive function, including increases or decreases in frequency or accuracy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responding. Although behavioral and neurophysiological endpoints may be very sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators of neurotoxicity, they can be influenced by other factors. The uncertainties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with data from functional endpoints can be reduced if interpreted within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context of other neurotoxicological measures (neurochemical or neuropathological) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systemic toxicity endpoints, particularly if such measures are taken concurrently. Behavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects that reflect an indirect effect secondary to systemic toxicities may also be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse. Table 4&hyph;1 provides examples of potential endpoints of neurotoxicity at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavioral, physiological, chemical, and structural levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

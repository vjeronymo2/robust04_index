			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Long View: Gold prospecting ONE DAY this week a generous gentleman from the London bullion market handed me a standard 400oz bar of gold. It was worth, he said, Pounds 95,000. As it happens, gold is quite cheap at the moment in historical terms. As recently as late 1987 the same bar would have been worth Pounds 155,000, adjusted for inflation. At the time of the record high for the gold price back in early 1980, when the price hit Dollars 835 an ounce, it would have been fetched more like Pounds 340,000, again expressed in terms of present-day purchasing power. What might it be worth in five years' time? I can't answer that question, but the gold bulls are getting restless again. Thirteen years is an awfully long time for a bear market to run. The price hit a low of Dollars 285 in 1985 and staged a very decent rally to hit just over Dollars 500 in the panicky aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, but it has subsequently drifted. It has really followed the declining pattern of commodities in general, with production rising and costs falling, while demand remains fairly flat. Earlier this year those two veteran speculators George Soros and Sir James Goldsmith decided to stir things up. At their prompting all sorts of other gold bugs reappeared from the woodwork and the price of the metal jumped from Dollars 326 in March to Dollars 405 at the end of July. Unfortunately the fragility of this move was soon demonstrated as the price tumbled back again to Dollars 344 in September. This week it has showed just a flicker of life and has been trading above Dollars 360. The chartists say that it has bottomed out after its prolonged downtrend, though that does not imply that a big further rise is imminent. As the ultimate in speculative investments gold has strong and distinctive financial characteristics. It is best known as an inflation hedge, and for that reason its price moves in opposite directions to the stock market (equities do not go up with inflation, at least in the short to medium term). Since 1980 gold has been disastrously outpaced by the stock market: while the bullion price has been tumbling since 1980 the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index, for example, has risen from 230 to over 1,500. In non-inflationary currencies the picture is worse: from the Japanese point of view the price of gold in yen has come down consistently from a 1980 high of 200,000 yen to under 40,000 yen at present. Whatever the temptation to find dramatic statistics, however, too many comparisons with the freak high attained at the end of the inflationary 1970s can be misleading. In fact it is little more than 20 years since gold was freed from its fixed rate of Dollars 35 an ounce under the postwar Bretton Woods monetary system. The tenfold rise in the dollar price since then leaves it well ahead of inflation over this period. Studies over the very long term suggest that gold maintains its real value, that is, it produces a zero real return. For investors in advanced economies this is a turn-off because British pension funds, for instance, expect to get a 6 per cent annual real return from equities (and in practice have achieved about twice that figure since 1980). Nevertheless there is a theoretical case for holding gold in a portfolio if you want to stabilise the overall returns, because the price of the yellow metal moves in opposite directions to those of stocks and bonds and therefore smooths out the fluctuations. Yet institutional investors tend to have other ways of handling volatility, and gold can prove very hot to handle: there are still vivid memories in the City of London of how Rothschilds, the merchant bank, bought gold for its client pension funds in 1974. It performed extremely well that year as the stock market crashed, but was left spectacularly stranded when share prices rocketed up again early in 1975. The long-term investors in gold tend to be wealthy private individuals in unstable jurisdictions who are more interested in preserving wealth than investing it for a return. Equities do not appeal at any price, however. After a long period of rising share prices, even the staidest institutional investors are casting around for better value. US pension fund managers are dubious of the value in Wall Street's blue chips and have been pushing capital overseas, for instance into emerging market stocks. Gold and other commodities are also being touted at present as possible beneficiaries of this move to diversify away from overpriced core investments. The conditions of the 1970s bull market in gold are not present, however. Then, a world economy growing at 6 per cent a year collided with supply constraints in commodities, and most Western governments tried to inflate their way out of trouble as domestic real incomes were squeezed. Today the advanced economies are limping along at an average growth rate of maybe 1 per cent and although shortages will predictably develop eventually  -notably in energy - the problem scarcely appears to be imminent or general. In the 1990s the gold bugs are focusing on a rather different challenge. Economic weakness resulting primarily from excessive private sector indebtedness is pushing governments into heavy fiscal deficits. The US Federal Reserve, in particular, is adopting a brave but some would say dangerous strategy of pumping liquidity into the banking system. If the US economy is not stimulated into self-financing expansion the next step just might be a loss of control of monetary growth and a lurch into serious inflation. The gold price over the next few months will be best viewed as an important indicator of underlying international investor sentiment as the long global bull market in stocks and bonds reaches a highly mature stage. As for my own block of gold, in case of any possible misunderstandings I should add that the bullion dealer had a guard in attendance and insisted that the bar should be returned safely to the vaults whence it came.</p>

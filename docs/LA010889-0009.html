			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BATTRAILERS  </P> <P> Batfans take note: The first trailer of the still-filming $35-million-plus  "Batman" -- with Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader -- is now showing.  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. PR exec said that 350-500 trailers have been sent to "premiere  houses" and "everyone seems to love them."  </P> <P> But reactions from the Bat-critics we polled were mixed.  </P> <P> One Batcritic said that as Bruce Wayne, Keaton looks like, well, Keaton -- "a  nebbish." But the shots of him in his Batcostume were heralded as "awesome!"  </P> <P> But is it Keaton or the costume that's awesome? The way it's made, even a  97-pound weakling would look Schwarzeneggian.  </P> <P> What's more (or less), you can't even tell it's Keaton in the costume -- until  a shot in which Our Hero, while effortlessly lifting a bad guy, squeakily  proclaims, "I'm Batman."  </P> <P> A Warners rep stressed that the trailer was made up of raw daily footage, and  that Keaton will later re-do his lines.  </P> <P> One thing that may not need reworking is the Batmobile: One Batfan proclaimed:  "It's absolutely incredible! Every kid will have to have one next Christmas."  Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 8 (BTA) -- The Partnership for Peace  Programme is called upon to ensure greater security for all  regions of Europe at the same time, President Zhelyu Zhelev said  in a speech before the Atlantic Club tonight. Dr. Zhelev is a  member of the Honorary Board of Directors and a founder member  of the Atlantic Club, established in 1991. Every year since  then he has given a lecture on Bulgaria's foreign policy to  diplomats, Bulgarian politicians and public figures. "The  programme is not intended to divide Europe again; on the  contrary, it removes `grey' and `buffer' zones, often subject to  demagogic praise as regions of the so-called `absolute  neutrality,'" the Bulgarian president said.    Present-day Bulgaria sees its place among the European  democracies, in the civilized free world, President Zhelev said.  He stressed that integration into the European and  Euro-Atlantic economic structures and security systems gives  scope to Bulgarian national interests and reduces to the maximum  the danger of a relapse into unilateral dependence or a  reversion to familiar doctrines of limited sovereignty.  President Zhelev recalled that Bulgaria's policy of moderation,  stability, balanced relations and pragmatism is blazing the way  for modern international relations in the Balkan part of Europe.  He expressed certainty that "finally it (Bulgaria's policy)  would be assessed on its merits."    President Zhelev said Partnership for Peace was of  indisputable importance for the new Eastern democracies. These  ideas are in harmony with the interests of Bulgaria, which has  been making tremendous efforts for several years now to change  the nature of regional interstate relations and has been doing  its best to set them on the track of good-neighbourly relations,  cooperation, stable development, gradual opening of the borders  and real integration into the rest of Europe, Dr. Zhelev  stressed. He said the programme would help "clean the Augean  stables" of the legacy of suspicions and prejudice. It may help  to prevent the worst danger for the Balkans, the emergence of  all kinds of regional alliances -- "Orthodox or Pan-Slavic  axes," "an arc or crescent of Islam" -- formations which  historically preceded and lead up to Balkan wars and  catastrophes, Dr. Zhelev stressed.    According to the president, Partnership for Peace can fill  the vacuum in regional balances created by the breakup of the  Warsaw Pact and by the non-accession of some Balkan states to  European disarmament treaties. He recalled Bulgaria is  surrounded by military superior neighbours and that imbalances  tend to be growing. Therefore this country is especially  interested in a mutually acceptable levels of the different  components of the military balance and in transparency and  predictability in the implementation of the Conventional Forces  in Europe Treaty, Dr. Zhelev emphasized.    Understanding of Partnership for Peace would be incomplete  if  it is viewed only in the field of military cooperation, the  president said. According to him, the initiative may have an  impact on the reform in the Bulgarian Army, in the defence  sector and Bulgaria's defence potential. He named social  security, the combatting of organized crime, narcotics  trafficking and smuggling as other fields of cooperation within  Partnership for Peace.    Bulgaria sees a chance for cooperation with NATO in the  training of specialized troops for missions under the auspices  of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), said the president. He recalled  that within the framework of the Partnership for Peace, the  Bulgarian Defence Ministry is preparing an international  military exercise Breeze '94 to be attended by battleship of  U.S. 6th Fleet, Turkey, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and  Bulgaria, and observers from Georgia. Close cooperation with  NATO is a prerequisite for the reform in the Bulgarian Army and  for ensuring a proper place for the Bulgarian military in a  democratic civil society, the president said in conclusion.</p>

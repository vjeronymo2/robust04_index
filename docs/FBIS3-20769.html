			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bozena Kriznik: "Flirting With the Old Markets"] </F>   [Text] In practice, very little is left of the not so very  old idea of free trade zones with the former Yugoslav republics  and of closer economic cooperation with them. Economic relations  between countries are a reflection of political ones, and depend  primarily upon the general situation in an individual country.  And what can Slovenia expect in the near future?    Let us take the former Yugoslav economic community as our  starting point for such reflections. We obviously cannot erase  the fact that mutual ties, including commercial ones, were  tightly knit, and that Slovenia, for instance, sold almost a  third of its goods to other republics, although perhaps at this  time it is politically more expedient and generally popular to  try to prove that nothing ties us to the south.    To be sure, there is no clear picture of trade among the new  states, because the pertinent services only started to monitor  exports and imports in terms of individual states by means of  customs declarations last year, but we can see a lot of  "tectonic shifts." The share of the former Yugoslav states in  the structure of Slovene foreign trade has shrunk drastically in  the years since independence. Trade has declined by more than 80  percent (which is 28 percent of total trade). As economist Dr.  Franjo Stiblar notes in an analysis of Croatian-Slovene economic  relations, trade with Croatia also declined, although admittedly  somewhat less. Before Yugoslavia's collapse, Croatia was  Slovenia's number one economic partner. The data indicate that  the total volume of trade has fallen from about $8.2 billion in  1990 to less than $1.5 billion last year. Last year, Croatia  thus did not even reach 11 percent of Slovenia's foreign trade.  (Now both of them, Slovenia and Croatia, are each other's third  partners, after Germany and Italy.) Trade is unbalanced, and  Slovenia has a considerable surplus. In spite of this, Stiblar  thinks, Croatia remains an important and interesting trading  partner for us. "That is why, in view of the development of  political relations, and just because of pragmatic economic  interests, it is to be hoped that Croatia will succeed in  stabilizing its economy, since that would also have a favorable  effect upon reviving Slovenia's."    It actually seems surprising to Josip Skobermet, vice  president of the GZS [Slovene Chamber of Commerce], that in such  uncertain and changeable political conditions, in spite of all  the tension and obstacles, trade with Croatia is still as high  as it is. The enterprises that had serious economic interests  have obviously coped and bypassed the obstacles in various ways.    Dr. Tone Hrastelj, in the role of a practician and economic  expert, a specialist on foreign trade, also has a similar  opinion. In his opinion, political disagreements are the biggest  obstacle in doing business with Croatia. Since we did not reach  an agreement on a free trade zone, and since Croatia is treating  Slovenia like every other foreign country and imposing customs  duties, there is not enough interest in trade, and that harms  both economies. In Hrastelj's opinion, Croatia is a more  interesting trading partner for us than Serbia. That is why it  would seriously be useful to institutionalize free trade with  our immediate neighbor, whereas there would only be a  theoretical possibility of that with the Serbs to start with  (although, he admits, the Serbian economy is somewhat more  complementary to Slovenia's than the Croatian economy). "In  Serbia, Slovenia will probably be under the same foreign trade  regime as West European countries, but I believe that trade will  proceed in spite of everything. In comparison with Western  competition, we will have certain advantages: private  acquaintances, old commercial ties, knowledge of the language,  the Serbian deficit in knowledge of foreign languages, Serbia's  remoteness and foreigners' fears in connection with traveling to  the southern Balkans...."    Last year trade with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia --FYROM], in contrast to other countries, was more  successful than the year before. The two countries signed an  agreement on economic cooperation, payment transactions,  clearing trade based on commodity lists (that agreement from  1992 did not go into effect), and they have also established a  joint Slovene-Macedonian chamber of commerce. Slovenia only has  a real free trade zone with Macedonia. Trade, however, is still  associated with several difficulties, among which the  Macedonians are primarily emphasizing the high deficit on their  side, and problematic payment transactions, while on the other  hand Slovenia does not see enough products of interest to itself  in Macedonia. In spite of that, last year's results (about $300  million in trade) are favorable in comparison with 1992, and  expectations are still optimistic, but it will probably never be  possible again to achieve the record trade in the amount of more  than $1 billion in 1990.    Slovenia had already started to negotiate with  Bosnia-Herzegovina on economic relations on a new basis, but in  the meantime the war in Bosnia came. Trade with  Bosnia-Herzegovina, converted to dollars, has declined abruptly  from independence onward: from about $250 million in 1990 to  about $29 million in the first 11 months of last year. One  cannot expect anything else in the future either in a war  situation. No one knows how much longer the war can drag on.  When it is over, devastated Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be  rebuilt. The country's rebuilding will probably rely on  international aid. Slovenia, whose advantages will be--if  nothing else--geographic proximity and familiarity with the  market and language--will certainly also apply for some of the  work. The main limitation, however, will be the established  practice of investors, who in such cases prefer to employ their  own economic capacities.    Future cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro, in  particular,  is arousing polemics. At the moment the issue is still not too  urgent, as the UN Security Council embargo is still in effect  for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. As Slovene state  authorities, the chamber of commerce, and enterprise directors  assert, Slovenia is observing the embargo. It only trades in  products for which the UN Security Council's sanctions  commission issues a special permit, namely medicines and goods  for humanitarian purposes. Thus, Slovenia's trade with the FRY  (including miscellaneous items) during the first 11 months of  last year reached $7 million in exports and $0.3 million in  imports. Ljubljana's Lek, for example, is exporting several  medicines to Serbia, with a permit. This is not a continuous  business, Lek's director Metod Dragonja says, and it depends on  Serbia's (modest) ability to pay. In terms of volume, it is only  about a tenth of deliveries three years ago. Medicines actually  "sell themselves," and no particular commercial activity is  needed, but Lek also does not have any privileges in comparison  with foreign competition. At least a minimal presence in the  Serbian market, however, is especially useful for the enterprise  in the long term, "so that later, with more optimistic  developments, it can improve its position in that market."    In spite of that, there are many suspicions about violation  of the embargo. On the shelves of Serbian shops one can find  products from well-known Slovene producers, and sometimes  Belgrade television even shows them, claiming that trade (even  with Slovenes) is proceeding in spite of the sanctions. In some  people's opinion, the Slovene surplus in trade with Macedonia is  also ending up in Serbia. Josip Skoberne rejects such hints.  "Slovenia does not border directly on Serbia. Consequently, they  should not ask us how Slovene goods have ended up in Serbia;  instead, they should ask our neighbors first--the Greeks,  Romanians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, and also the Croats and  Macedonians. Our data on exports to Serbia's neighbors also  indicate that exports, with the exception of Macedonia, are not  growing, and instead have decreased. And if Slovene products are  ending up in Serbian shops, the producer does not necessarily  even know about it; it can be due to the middlemen, dealers."  Finally, the Croats and Serbs are also trading actively with  each other, not to mention the Greeks, who are the craftiest  merchants in the world and Serbia's allies.    Joze Drofenik, head of the republic coordinating group for  implementing sanctions against the FRY, confirms that Slovene  violations of the embargo are rare. The Security Council takes  care of oversight at Serbian border crossings, and Slovenia  controls its own borders. If a Slovene enterprise turns up among  the suspected violators, the proper authorities receive  information about it, and the suspects, if the violation of the  sanctions is proven (there are difficulties in proving it, to be  sure), also pay monetary fines, and the goods are confiscated.    Any consideration of future economic relations with Serbia  and Montenegro, or the FRY, just as in connection with  Bosnia-Herzegovina, starts with a condition: if (when) the  Security Council sanctions are lifted, when the war is over, and  when transportation routes are opened... The resounding  declaration that the FRY and Croatia recently signed, to be  sure, does not bring any sort of guarantees that relations  between the signatories will really be normalized. If it does  contribute to opening transportation routes to Eastern Europe,  that will be of great significance for the Slovene economy as  well, Skoberne thinks.    The Chamber and the economy particularly favor the idea of a  free trade zone, and forms of trade with mutually accorded  privileges (in all former Yugoslav republics). There will not be  free trade, for which an agreement obviously has to be reached  at the state level, if politics prevails over sound peasant  intelligence, they think. "Free trade means benefits for both  partners, especially with respect to third parties, developed  ones. Finally, we already have experience with free trade in the  former Yugoslavia." State institutions, as far as the FRY is  concerned, are somewhat more restrained, saying that regulation  of mutual relations at the institutional level is a matter for  both sides, for coordination of interests, for negotiations.    Vojka Ravbar, secretary in the Ministry of Economic  Relations  and Development, says: "It is hard for me to say how we will  negotiate with Serbia. When political relations are normalized,  after a UN resolution, we will try to establish normal economic  relations. Time, and also Serbian interests, will show whether  it will be a free trade area, and at how high a level relations  will be. Specifically, it is usually harder for the weaker  partner to decide on liberalization, since it has to protect its  own economy against outside competition. There are usually  transitional periods for it, and agreements are a result of hard  negotiations. We therefore expect a gradual normalization of  economic relations, to which the former commercial ties,  knowledge, and experience in that market will contribute."    The former republics' share in total Slovene sales will  never  be 30 percent again. There is no reason, however, for it to  remain at last year's 6 percent. It can increase substantially;  about 20 percent would be a logical, realistic level, naturally  under normal conditions, Josip Skoberne of the GZS thinks. When  the war and the embargo are over, trade in spare parts can begin  very quickly. There are a multitude of products, technical  items, capital equipment, machines and devices, in the former  Yugoslavia that are associated with a brand and a producer. It  will all need to be serviced and rebuilt. Since there will be  difficulties in payment, the enterprises that have experience in  supplying the southern markets are already thinking about what  goods they will buy in exchange for what is exported; they will  conclude barter arrangements. And if, or rather where, there are  free trade zones, the partners will trade in products which that  market is already accepting, but which are noncompetitive in  demanding Western markets.</p>

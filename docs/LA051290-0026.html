When I saw the photos (May 4) of the students at Mills College, my  heart skipped a beat! What tragedy had befallen these fair maidens?  </P> <P> When I read the article about accepting men in 1991 creating all this havoc,  could I fairly ask -- "Is this an expression of female chauvinist sows"? Please  -- spare us!  </P> <P> EDMOND B. NASIF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

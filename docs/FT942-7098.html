			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Bank fends off escudo attack Pressure on the Portuguese escudo eased yesterday after the central bank intervened on the foreign exchange market to protect the currency from a second attack by speculators in less than two months. The currency fell to a low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark on Wednesday from Es103.2 and rallied yesterday to close at Es104.0. Overnight money market rates rose from 11 per cent before the attack to 30 per cent yesterday but fell back to 12 per cent as speculation against the currency subsided. After announcing large purchases of escudos on Wednesday, the central bank changed tactics yesterday by suspending its money market intervention and emergency lending rates.</p>

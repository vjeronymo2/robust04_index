			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial agents' regulations are not so easy to avoid Sir, Your article on the new commercial agents' regulations which implement European laws in the UK on January 1 ('Agents lose jobs ahead of EU laws', November 15) draws attention to the action which is now being taken by many British companies in order to avoid being caught by these regulations. This action, however, may itself lead companies engaging agents out of the frying pan and into the fire. The reason for this is that some companies are encountering a particular problem when giving notice to terminate. Unless the notice brings the agency contract to an end before December 31 1993, the commercial agents regulations will apply to the contract. In this case manufacturers, suppliers and importers will be stuck with the benefits provided to agents under existing contracts, plus the consequences which the regulations entail. In particular, these will be the minimum period of notice to be given to agents and compensation payable on termination. Failure to have given the requisite notice will itself trigger a claim for damages. S L Sidkin, Fox Williams, City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU</p>

Thompson, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the  nation, announced today that he will not seek a fifth term in 1990.  </P> <P> Near tears and with his voice wavering at times, Thompson told reporters that  his decision was based on family and career reasons. He added that he would  "enjoy the challenge of the private sector" but also said he might seek another  government office.  </P> <P> The 53-year-old Thompson, a moderate Republican who has served 12 years, was  mentioned as a possible presidential candidate early in his career and as a  vice presidential candidate last year.  </P></p>

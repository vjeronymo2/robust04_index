			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Bilateral trade relations 'framework' agreements Since 1990, the US has established formal structures for the conduct of bilateral trade relations under a series of 16 'framework' agreements in Latin American and one in Singapore, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. While the agreements are viewed by some as 'just pieces of paper', they hold the promise for the US, as senior partner, of achieving bilaterally or regionally many reforms which have proved difficult to get in Gatt. In Latin America, they are paving the way for free trade agreements. The pacts generally establish trade and investment councils to monitor trade and investment relations, pursue the goals of open markets and negotiate agreements. A typical pact was signed with Honduras in November 1990. It set out, as an agenda, co-operation on the Uruguay Round, increased market access, improvement of intellectual property rights protection and reduction of trade and investment barriers.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTER THOUGHT UNLIKELY TO BE NAMED FOR KING  </P> <P> One day after the San Diego Board of Port Commissioners refused to rename the  city's new $160-million harbor-side convention center after the Rev. Martin  Luther King Jr., Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Wednesday that chances now are  slim that the structure would be named for the slain civil rights leader.  </P> <P> "I've been around politics long enough to know that, realistically, you should  not hold out much hope that the convention center is going to be named for  Martin Luther King Jr.," O'Connor said at a press conference at City Hall.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a San Diego black leader on Wednesday launched a campaign for a  nationwide boycott of the convention center, which is due to open on Oct. 31.  The Rev. George Stevens said he will try to pattern the boycott after a  successful one in Arizona.  </P> <P> There, blacks and others were urged by community activists not to travel to the  state because former Gov. Evan Mecham canceled a state holiday honoring King.  The resulting protest cost Arizona significant convention business.  </P> <P> San Diego has been embroiled in controversy on the sensitive matter of a  tribute to King. Two years ago, the City Council voted to rename Market Street  as Martin Luther King Jr. Way. That decision was overturned by voters in a  referendum.  </P> <P> Opponents of changing the name of the new convention center maintained that it  would confuse tourists and hurt the city's convention business. They said the  new facility already was being billed to out-of-towners as the San Diego  Convention Center.  </P> <P> The mayor expressed disappointment and surprise at the Board of Port  Commissioners' 4-3 decision to propose turning the center's outdoor bay-front  terrace into an "Avenue of Honors" and make King its first inductee. But  O'Connor said that it may be time for the council to compromise on the issue in  order to end divisiveness and racial animosity that has surrounded debate on  the subject. The council has not yet scheduled new hearings on the issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vote on Renaming  </P> <P> On Jan. 10, seven members of the nine-member City Council voted for the name  change. The council directed its three appointees to the Board of Port  Commissioners -- a seven-member body composed of representatives of the five  cities ringing San Diego Bay -- to vote for the renaming.  </P> <P> Those three votes plus another from the appointee from National City, whose  City Council also favored changing the name, seemed to assure a majority. But  at a contentious commission meeting Tuesday, San Diego appointee Dan Larsen was  the swing vote on the Avenue of Honors proposal. The commissioners never voted  on the proposal to name the entire center for King.  </P> <P> Larsen maintained that he had not changed his mind but that the Avenue of  Honors proposal was something new and that the City Council "deserved the  opportunity to take a look" at it.  </P> <P> Chula Vista's representative on the commission, Robert Penner, proposed the  Avenue of Honors. He said he was seeking a consensus on how to find a tribute  to King.  </P> <P> The Port District is building the new convention center, which the city will  operate. Both must approve any name change.  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt, the only black on the council, called the Avenue of  Honors "an inadequate compromise." Pratt, who represents the largely black  southeast section of the city, said he would press the City Council to reject  the new proposal and reaffirm naming the center after King.  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Oftel probes BT telex charges OFTEL, the telecommuni-cations regulator, is investigating whether large increases in British Telecommunications' telex charges are justified. The move follows complaints from users about a 20.7 per cent increase in telex line charges which is to start next month. Mrs Vivienne Peters, executive director of the Telecommunications Users' Association, a leading user group, said yesterday that the rise in charges was 'totally unacceptable'. BT defended the increase in its basic telex line charge from Pounds 352 to Pounds 425 a year on the grounds that it needed to bring charges into line with costs. It added that there had been no rise since 1984. Telex is a declining service because many users find it more convenient to use faxes for messages. BT said that, as usage has declined, unit costs had risen. But it refused to say whether telex was profitable. Oftel said it had asked BT for information about the cost of providing the telex service. The regulatory body's preliminary view is that the rise is justified. Oftel has no direct control over BT's telex charges as the service is not included in a basket of the company's main services covered by a price formula. But the regulator is entitled to object to rises. Telex is still used extensively, particularly in the export-import business since many developing countries are not fully converted to fax. Moreover, telex messages, unlike fax ones, are legally binding.</p>

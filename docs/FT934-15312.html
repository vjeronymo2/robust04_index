			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (13): Persistent and determined - Klaus Rauen, mayor of Halle LIFE would have been much simpler and easier for Mr Klaus Rauen if he had stayed in Bonn. But Mr Rauen, the former Christian Democratic Union mayor of Germany's seat of government, is a restless man who rises to challenges. German unification provided the perfect opportunity. 'I wanted to contribute to this great event. I felt that by becoming mayor in Halle, I could really help to do something.' He took up office in the city's Rathaus in May 1991. But instead of the normal eight-hour day he was accustomed to in Bonn, Mr Rauen now works at least 12 hours. His time is divided between reforming the local administration, meeting foreign investors, opening new enterprises, visiting schools, and above all, helping to restore the self-confidence of Halle's community. Mr Rauen, who is 57 years old, believes the self-esteem of the eastern Germans has been shattered largely because of what happened after German unification. 'People here feel ashamed in the sense that they feel that everything they had worked for over the past 40 years under the former communist regime was a complete waste of time,' he says. 'They feel disorientated because they feel they were living in a system which had lost any respect. We must restore that self-confidence.' One of the ways Mr Rauen has set about this is by trying to restore parts of the old city. Unlike other cities in eastern Germany, Halle was not seriously damaged during the second world war. Its elegant central square is still intact. But its elegance has been impaired by dull, concrete buildings put up by the former communist administration. 'There was no need to put these buildings up around the square. But I feel that the former regime wanted to destroy memory, or a kind of historical consciousness. I want to help restore the best of Halle's past,' explains Mr Rauen. The fact that George Friedrich Handel, the composer, was born in the city, has helped. But one name is hardly enough to compensate for 40 years which led to the complete neglect of the infrastructure. Nor is it enough to shake up the local administration so as to attract west German and foreign investment which could help revitalise and renovate the city. Mr Rauen has the misfortune to be saddled with the old communist local council constitution. This means that he cannot dismiss certain senior officials, even though they may be incompetent. One particular official is in charge of settling property disputes. The current law states that all owners of property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the communists between 1949 and 1990, are allowed either restitution or compensation. 'We have been so slow in resolving these disputes,' explains Mr Rauen. 'In fact, Halle is one of the slowest in eastern Germany. We have settled only 6 per cent of all cases.' He says the city's solicitor is partly to blame. 'He just looks for problems, rather than solutions,' he adds. The upshot is that the 11,000 old delapidated houses and apartments in the centre of the city are still the subject of property disputes. The longer they take to resolve, the greater cost for repair. And investors will stay away . . . Another problem facing Mr Rauen is the size of the local administration. In common with all city councils in eastern Germany, he inherited a bloated bureaucracy of 13,000. He wants to pare it down bo 4,000 by the end of the year. After that, by law, the staff at the city hall will have tenure. Pushing through cut-backs might be blocked by Halle's coalition, in which the social democrats, the PDS, the former communists, and the Greens hold the majority, while the CDU holds 30 per cent of the council seats. But Mr Rauen is a persistent man. 'We have to turn round the city and make it more efficient. It's the price we have to pay for the past four decades.'</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ford pins its hopes on Windstar / A look at the US multi-purpose vehicle market The first shots in a multi-billion dollar battle for the hearts and cheque books of affluent suburban American families will be fired in Detroit this week at the city's annual international motor show. For the show, which opens to the public at the weekend, will mark the official unveiling by Ford Motor of its new Windstar mini-van, which poses the most serious threat yet to Detroit rival Chrysler's hold on this fast-growing and highly profitable segment of the US vehicle market. Mini-vans, as they are called in the US, are seven-seater passenger vehicles which look similar to small vans but have the handling characteristics of a car. In Europe, they are generally called multi-purpose vehicles and the best known is probably the Renault Espace. In the decade since Chrysler pioneered the mini-van in 1983, the vehicles have largely replaced the family station wagons which once dominated suburban America. Mini-vans, bought mainly by parents between the ages of 35 and 50, can accommodate more children, in much roomier, more comfortable and flexible conditions than traditional estate vehicles, and still leave plenty of luggage space. They can significantly reduce the stress inherent in travelling with a young family. Sales have risen by over 10 per cent a year in the past two years, topping 1m units in 1993, and are expected to keep rising as the baby-boom generation moves through its child-rearing phase. Chrysler still dominates the sector, accounting for about 45 per cent of sales with its boxy but easy-handling, front-wheel drive Caravan and Voyager vehicles - having beaten off repeated challenges from domestic and foreign rivals. Ford currently holds around 24 per cent of the market. Its main entrant in the sector, the Aerostar, is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a very truck-like appearance, although in late 1992 it introduced a more attractive small vehicle, the Mercury Villager, which has sold well. General Motors, the least efficient US manufacturer, holds about 22 per cent. Its Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac TransSport vehicles, which have a beaky nose and plastic body, have sold poorly since their introduction in 1990. Japanese companies largely make up the rest of the sector, but they have failed to increase their market share, partly because of design, partly because of the high yen and partly because of anti-dumping suits against their vehicles filed by Detroit's Big Three. The new Windstar poses a threat to Chrysler because it is an easy to handle, front-wheel drive vehicle which essentially matches the largest of Chrysler's vans in size and most popular features and adds an additional dash of style. Its curvy, aerodynamic appearance makes it look much more car-like than most competitors. Ford plans to build up to 270,000 Windstars a year, which would put it among the company's 10 top-selling vehicles. As it is, Ford increased its share of the US car and truck market from around 23 per cent in 1987 to some 25.4 per cent in 1993, thanks to a string of successful new or revamped vehicles such as the Taurus family car and the Explorer sports utility. It has also just launched a new version of its Mustang sports car to strong demand, and this year will bring out American versions of its prize-winning 'world' car, known in Europe as the Mondeo. But for all this success, Ford is currently far less profitable in North America than the much smaller Chrysler, which has bounced back from financial problems with a series of hit vehicles of its own, as well as strong controls on costs. And Chrysler, which makes around 480,000 mini-vans a year, is hardly going to give up its share of this market lightly. The invention of the mini-van played an important part in saving it from financial crisis in the early 1980s and it still refers to the vehicle as a 'crown jewel' because of the fat profit margins it generates. Many analysts expect Chrysler to greet the Windstar with a pre-emptive price cut - repeating a tactic it pursued three years ago when GM launched its beaky mini-vans. Chrysler has also been giving journalists sneak previews of a totally re-engineered mini-van it plans to launch in the 1996 model year. Mr Bob Lutz, Chrysler chairman, boasts that 'our mini-van will come out a year after Windstar, but it will clearly be a generation and a half beyond, both aesthetically and functionally'. However, Mr Ed Hagenlocker, who heads Ford's North American automotive operations, says that, because of growth in the mini-van market, Ford and Chrysler will be able to 'co-exist very nicely'. He points out that this happened in another fast-growing market segment, for sports utilities. These are four-wheel drive vehicles, similar to a Land Rover, which give the driver a sense of off-road ruggedness, even though they are bought mainly by baby-boomers whose prime experience of the wild is jostling for parking space in a suburban mall. When Ford burst into this market with its Explorer vehicle, which has become the market leader, many analysts forecast it would seriously depress Chrysler's sales volume. But Chrysler's sales have also risen strongly, thanks to the introduction of a new vehicle of its own, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the rapid growth of the overall market. 'It really hasn't been a head-to-head confrontation,' says Mr Hagenlocker. 'We both sell everything we can build, because the segment is product-driven.' As for mini-vans, he says existing owners tend to be loyal to the products they drive but around six out of 10 new purchasers are switching from car ownership. 'Among the 60 per cent that come from the car park, we think the Windstar will do very well.' Several analysts agree and suggest that Ford could boost its share of the market to around 30 per cent - although not necessarily at Chrysler's expense. The biggest loser could be GM, which is not due to replace its mini-vans until the middle of the 1996 model year. Whatever the outcome, a longer-term issue is just how long the mini-van market can keep growing. Mr Joel Pitcoff, research manager for Ford in North America, points out that 'the age group that spawned the success of the mini-vans is approaching the age of empty nesters. A big question is what will happen to their tastes when their children go off to college. 'Only in Jack and the Beanstalk,' he adds, 'do things grow to the sky.'</p>

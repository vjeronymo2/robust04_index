			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese  representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) Guo  Fengmin has rejected the groundless charge from the British side  on the responsibility for the delay of the new airport to be  built in Hong Kong.    The Chinese side put forward a whole set of opinions on the  overall financing plan on the airport construction at Chek Lap  Kok as early as last August. But the British side failed to  respond for a half-year period, Guo said after attending a local  Spring Festival gathering.    Therefore, Guo stated, China should not be responsible for  the delay of the construction of the new Hong Kong airport.    He regarded two British blames as "contradictive". One  saying China doesn't raise any proposal on the airport financing  plan, while other saying the new proposal recently advanced by  the British side satisfied all the demands raised by the Chinese  side.    If the Chinese side never advanced any opinions, how could  it  be possible to say the British side has satisfied all the  Chinese demands? Guo asked.    He said the Chinese side had studied some problems with the  British plan, the fourth one proposed by Britain.    However, he added, "the airport issue covers a wide range of  subjects, we are studying further into some problems and will  exchange opinions with the British side."    The Sino-British negotiation on the airport issue will have  to be opened. But it depends necessary preparations before  hand, he said. [sentence as received]</p>

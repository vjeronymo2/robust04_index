			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UN asks world's leading companies to join war on drugs THE United Nations is to ask leading companies to watch their share registers for signs that drug barons are trying to launder money through international stock exchanges. The aim is to pool information to help identify what UN officials believe is one route through which the profits of drug dealing are made legitimate. Money laundering experts in UN or other international agencies would look for patterns of share buying and selling in international markets by the same, or connected, nominees. The share register watch would be one function of a partnership the UN wants to form with the private sector worldwide to involve companies in the global war on drugs. Much of the UN's anti-laundering work is relatively unsophisticated at present, and is related to training police officers in Third World countries. Apart from helping in the fight against organised crime, companies will also be asked to sponsor public awareness initiatives to reduce demand for illegal drugs, and to support industrial development in the Third World. UN projects in drug-growing countries have shown that crop-substitution campaigns only work if there is parallel development of economic and physical infrastructure to enable transport and sale of new crops, such as strawberries and vegetables. Large retail chains buying out-of-season produce from across the world could help by providing guaranteed markets. Six large US companies - Exxon, Texaco, Boeing, Delta Airlines, Coca Cola and IBM - have agreed to a preliminary meeting in May in Vienna, where the UN's Drug Control Programme is based. Hoffman La Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, will also attend. The May meeting will set an agenda for a large conference in Vienna in October, to which the UN will invite about 200 leading companies. Targets include Fiat, Lufthansa, Philips, Volvo, BP, Hyundai, Canon, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Mitsubishi. The UN wants the private sector partnership to be a forum and information exchange on the world's illegal drug markets so that companies can be more aware of trends in drug production, trafficking, abuse and laundering activities, and how they can help. A voluntary share register watch is regarded as a potential source of crucial intelligence. Combined with similarly networked intelligence from banks on money transfers, it opens the possibility of tracking back some illegal funds to their sources. Tracking is very difficult because nominees - often based in offshore financial centres - can disguise what they are doing by buying many small stakes to frag-ment their efforts worldwide. The UN particularly wants co-operation from chemicals and drug companies. The UN already has agreements with them to monitor sales of chemicals needed to refine raw opium and coca, or to manufacture drugs such as LSD and ecstasy. One way way of cutting down illegal drug production would be to control sales of such chemicals more tightly, although the difficulty is acknowledged of controlling sales of commodity chemicals such as acetone, which is used in cocaine production.</p>

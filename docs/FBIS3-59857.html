			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoubir Ferroukhi: "28,000 Workers To Strike on 6 </F> December"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] Phase two of the Rouiba unionists' action plan to  win acceptance of their demands: First came the sit-in, now they  have served notice of a strike.    Feelings boiled over this time, and the trade unions of  Rouiba passed from words into action: a general strike. Top  union officials from the Rouiba industrial zone required little  time at their meeting yesterday to decide to serve notice of a  one-day strike to be held on 6 December. If no concrete progress  is made toward satisfying union demands (see LIBERTE of 26  October and 20 November 1993) within the next two weeks, some  28,000 workers will down tools. In a nutshell, immobilization of  the Rouiba industrial zone will also paralyze such enormous  economic entities as CVI (industrial vehicles), SNTR [National  Highway Transport Company], SNTV [National Passenger Transport  Company], Naftal-Distribution, ENIPEC (hides and leather), ENEL  [National Electric Power Board], and ENATB [expansion not given].    Warning signs that a strike was ahead have been building for  some time now, so the move took no one by surprise. Over the  last few months (nine months, to be precise), a handful of  issues--no more than five or six--have dragged on unresolved,  even though the whole lot of them could have been settled in  less time than it took union representatives yesterday to vote  for a strike.    What they decided was to stage a thrice-postponed  "solidarity" general strike, basically to demand that the  "dialogue" between the social partners (labor and management) be  more than a polite fiction.    Workers and union representatives have been laid off at  INDEFOC (training), ERWA (salvage), INFRAFER (railroad  infrastructure), Hydrotechnique, and one or two smaller  enterprises. UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers]  representatives have held that these layoffs were unjustified  and improper. The national syndicate brought the matter to the  general inspectorate for labor, which has acknowledged  unionists' complaints were well founded. Overall, the  inspectorate opined that the layoffs were not justified, at the  same time serving notice that efforts by management to  intimidate or harass served only to expose their incompetence.  On several occasions the inspectorate demanded, in vain, that  sanctions be lifted and personnel rehired. Spurred to action by  the syndicate's national leadership, the ministries concerned  ended by sending faxes directly to the enterprises under their  jurisdiction, urging them to act immediately to resolve the  disputes. This was the situation as it stood a day or two before  2 November.    On that date, at the sit-in held by 500 to 600 Rouiba  unionists at People's House (site of UGTA headquarters), Mr.  Sidi Said, UGTA's national secretary for social affairs and top  conflict resolution expert, claimed victory too soon when he  happily announced news of the ministerial directives. But the  unionists quietly dispersed, trusting completely in the promises  of the authorities as relayed to them by national syndicate  officials. By yesterday, however, no further progress had been  made toward resolving this handful of issues. And of course the  workers, or at least their representatives in the industrial  zone, believe they were "taken in" for too long. Mr. Sidi Said  called it a "provocation." Indeed. Even so, the unionists,  including those in the most moderate wing of the UGTA, have not  fully appreciated the significance of the fact that these  relatively simple layoff disputes have not been resolved as  rapidly as issues much thornier were in the past.    One might also ask, in the context of Algeria's current  situation, whose interests are being served by pushing UGTA out  of its high-level role as instigator and articulator of  proposals for economic recovery and social peace and miring it  down in petty, secondary issues. Along the same lines, one  wonders whether driving nails into the coffin of some sector of  an economy already in its death throes might tend not only to  discredit the UGTA but also to exacerbate social tensions,  adding fuel to the fire.    That said, it must be noted that not all the news is bad:  Within the Rouiba industrial zone, some enterprises deserve  kudos for good management and for maintaining good  communications between the social partners.</p>

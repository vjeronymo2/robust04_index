			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W in demand Telecoms group Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) surged as analysts returned positive from a meeting with Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority stake. Market forecasts were raised for the Hong Kong group after it told the meeting that planned price reductions in some of its overseas markets were being postponed to later dates. Analysts said they now expected earnings growth of around 15 per cent, against previous market forecasts of some 10 per cent. There were also reports of some profits upgrades in C&amp;W as a result of the new HK Telecom estimates. Late trading was spiced by rumours that US telecoms giant AT&amp;T was planning a spectacular bid. C&amp;W shares jumped 26 1/2 to 814 1/2 p in turnover of 4.4m. There was some switching into C&amp;W from BT as investors continued to fret over the near-term outlook. The shares slipped 2 to 415 1/2 p, as did the partly paid, to 172p.</p>

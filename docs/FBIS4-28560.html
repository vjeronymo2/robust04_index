			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan protested to China on  Friday [10 June] against its underground nuclear test earlier in  the day and warned it could adversely affect Tokyo's economic  assistance, now being detailed, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Vice Foreign Minister Jiro Saito called Chinese Ambassador  to  Tokyo Xu Dunxin to his office and "strongly" protested the test,  officials said.    Saito told Xu that Japan, the world's only country to have  suffered atomic bombings, has especially strong feelings against  nuclear testing and called on China not to repeat such tests in  the interest of bilateral relations, the officials said.    Another senior ministry official took similar action in a  separate meeting with a Chinese embassy minister, voicing  concern that such a test would have an undesirable effect on  Tokyo's effort to win understanding and support of the Japanese  people toward economic assistance for China, they said.    It was an indirect reference to Japan's fourth package of  yen  credits pledged to China. The two countries are currently  identifying projects to be financed by the loans.    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also urge  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their meeting in  Beijing on Sunday to refrain from nuclear tests, the officials  said.    Earlier Friday, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a  statement in which he called the Chinese test "extremely  regrettable."</p>

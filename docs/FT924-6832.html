			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Commitment to Personal Investment Authority Sir, Your report, 'Insurers challenge proposed regulator' (November 14), seriously misrepresents ABI's attitude towards the proposed Personal Investment Authority. On November 12, we stated publicly and in writing: 'ABI remains committed to the establishment of the PIA but it is not realistic to expect insurance companies to continue to offer support unless a very large majority of other product providers and advisers agree to join.' It is therefore totally incorrect to state that we have advised our members to steer clear of PIA. We have defined 'a very large majority' as at least 95 per cent of all product providers and advisers in the retail investment market. We should hope for this level of commitment from life companies if PIA receives a similar level of support from product providers and intermediaries currently regulated by the Securities and Investments Board and and IMRO. M A Jones, chief executive, Association of British Insurers, 51 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ</p>

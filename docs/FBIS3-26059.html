			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yuan Shan (0626 1472)] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen, 28 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Some  foreign businessmen in Shenzhen have become very mean and  operated in a barbaric way, causing endless complaints from  workers.    So-called becoming very mean and operating in a barbaric way  refers to the situation in which some foreign businessmen do not  care about China's laws and regulations, do not respect workers,  and do not go through formalities when hiring workers; they beat  and swear at workers, treat them badly, embezzle their wages and  own them remuneration, and let them work in poor working  conditions.    Recently, a Taiwan-funded footwear company with limited  liability in Songgang, Baoan District, Shenzhen, has been  sanctioned for violation of the relevant regulations in China.  According to information, each month, the company deducted from  every worker 20 yuan of deposit money, and 11 yuan of management  fee, but it did not refund the money to the workers 16 months  after the agreed upon time. The average overtime work of a  worker is 150 hours every month, but the overtime pay is only 1  yuan per hour. What is particularly mean is that workers are  not allowed to go out of the door of the factory during daytime,  or to visit one another; they are not allowed to talk when  eating meals, and those who break the rule will be fined 30-50  yuan. When they come to work or leave the workplace, or when  they enter and leave their dormitories, or when they go to the  canteen, there are fixed routes for them to walk, and once they  trespass over the line, they will be fined or asked to stand for  a period. The incidents of beating and swearing at workers have  often happened. An electric worker whose name is Zhou was  suspected of stealing by a responsible person of the company,  and although no evidence against him has not found, Zhou has  been beaten and his head bled.    After an investigation, the Shenzhen City's Labor Bureau and  the trade union have sanctioned the company.    In January this year, in just 10 days or so, Shenzhen City's  Labor Bureau received over 160 complaint letters sent by  workers, and met 370 people who came to complain. The  complaints mainly involved wages and project remunerations not  paid by bosses to workers, resignation allowances not paid to  workers after they resigned, security deposits the workers paid  at the time they were hired by factories were not paid back to  them, barbaric management, maltreatment of workers, and so on.  Among all these phenomena, the phenomenon of outstanding  payments to temporary workers is very serious. According to the  statistics provided by Luowu District Labor Disputes Arbitration  Office, in the district alone, the outstanding wages amount to  more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

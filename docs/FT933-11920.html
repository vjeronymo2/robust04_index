			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Suez in bid for full control of Victoire SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies, last night made a bid for full control of Victoire, the French insurance group in which Suez already holds a majority stake. Suez owns 63.21 per cent of Victoire, after having exchanged its own shares for a stake in Victoire owned by Japan's Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company. Together with the insurance group Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), with which it is acting in concert, Suez holds 98.05 per cent of Victoire voting rights. Suez is offering FFr1,480 per share. Victoire shares were suspended yesterday, having closed at FFr1,408 on Friday. The bid marks another stage in the feud between Suez and UAP - which is one of its larger shareholders and also a minority investor in Victoire - over control of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. UAP, a candidate for privatisation, has for years been pressuring Suez to cede control of Colonia in return for its shares in Victoire. However, Suez recently broke off negotiations. Suez acquired Victoire in 1989 but helped to pay for the deal by selling a stake to UAP. Victoire made net profits of FFr214m (Dollars 39.6m) in 1992, down from FFr1.8bn in 1991. Suez last year fell in to the red for the first time in its 135-year history, with a net loss of FFr1.87bn. The Victoire offer comes at a time when Suez is struggling to regain the stock market's confidence and when UAP, which reported net profits down to FFr1.08bn in 1992 from FFr3.77bn in 1991, is anxious to defuse its row with Suez in the approach to privatisation.</p>

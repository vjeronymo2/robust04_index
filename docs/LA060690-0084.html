			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IRANIAN LEADER RENEWS RUSHDIE DEATH DECREE  </P> <P> Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated Tuesday that a  religious death warrant against British author Salman Rushdie is irrevocable  and "must be carried out."  </P> <P> There had been reports Iran was relaxing its stance on the death sentence,  issued by the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini before his own  death last year, in order to improve relations with Europe.  </P> <P> TThe sentence stems from Rushdie's book, "The Sataanic Versus," which Moslems  consider blasphemous.  </P> <P> Khamenei told clerics in Tehran that the death edict is based on "divine  messages and is equally solid and irrevocable."  </P> <P> "Salman Rushdie is a criminal and the divine sentence on him must be carried  out," the Iranian leader said. The statement came a day after the official  first anniversary of Khomeini's death.  </P> <P> Sunday, Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hussein Musavian categorically denied  a report in a London newspaper, The Sunday Times, quoting him as saying the  death warrant might be revoked.  </P> <P> Musavian told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that remarks attributed  to him in The Sunday Times were a distortion.  </P> <P> But Iran's state radio Sunday quoted Musavian as saying: "The Iranian  government has not formally insisted on the murder of Salman Rushdie. If  Britain condemns the insults to Iran and demonstrates its respect to Islam,  this could help in improving relations and be effective in the release of  British hostages in Lebanon."  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a  phone-in question program that Great Britain has the "greatest respect for  Islam. But obviously we cannot do anything to hinder freedom of speech in this  country."  </P> <P> Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain in March 1989 after Khomeini  issued the religious decree sentencing Rushdie to death.  </P></p>

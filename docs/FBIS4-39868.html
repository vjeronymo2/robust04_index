			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Mikhail </F> Shevtsov and Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku June 11 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev ended his talks with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev  on Saturday and left for Moscow.    Grachev described his talks with Aliyev as "successful." The  discussion focused on two military issues -- the future of the  Gabelinskaya missile attack warning station in northern  Azerbaijan and the establishment of a united air-defence system  in the Trans- Caucasus.    The sides agreed that the station is of strategic importance  not only for Russia and Azerbaijan, but also for other CIS  states and foreign countries. Experts have been ordered to  discuss the question and work out an agreement for signing.    Grachev also called for establishing a common air-defence  system in the region. Earlier the idea was supported by Armenia  and Georgia. Grachev expressed the hope that Azerbaijan will  give a positive answer, adding that if it agrees otherwise,  Russia will proceed with building the system in cooperation with  Armenia and Georgia.    Speaking about the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict, Grachev said that he learnt many new things about it  from Aliyev, particularly about the impact of the political  situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict and that no cease-fire  deal can stop the conflict unless a comprehensive political  agreement is signed between Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia on  conflict settlement.    The minister said he will inform President Boris Yeltsin  about the talks, adding that such a document is now being  considered by the Russian Foreign Ministry and other concerned  agencies.    Azerbaijan and Armenia have been observing the cease-fire on  the whole, Grachev said. However, according to available  information both sides are building up strength in preparations  for a new wave of hostilities. At the same time, he noted that  Russia as a mediator controls the situation in the region.    He said the deployment of Russian peace-keeping troops in  the  region was not discussed at the talks.    During his June 8-11 tour, Grachev also visited Armenia,  Georgia and Abkhazia.</p>

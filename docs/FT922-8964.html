			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (3): Focus shifts to the ground - How services may be improved THE NEXT revolution in business air travel in the 1990s will most probably not come from enhanced in-flight services but from the less glamorous, but arguably more important, improvements in services on the ground. The way in which business travellers book flights, get to and from the airport, check in and then make best use of their time in the terminal is becoming as important to the business traveller as the size of seat in-flight. But with international airlines unlikely to be in the position, given the economics of international air travel, significantly to increase the size of seat for business travellers this decade, the attention of the airlines is thus focused firmly on the ground. British Airways, for example, recently opened a 20,000 sq ft lounge at Heathrow's terminal one for its Club Europe passengers which it claims to be one of the largest at any European airport. The aim is to provide an area for frequent business travellers away from the bustle of the main terminal. The lounge has some 40 telephones as well as fax machines and photocopiers. The importance of this lounge is its capacity: it can hold up to 400 travellers at any one time, which is estimated by BA to be in line with demand. BA is not alone in improving lounge facilities at its home base: most other international airlines are seeking to improve their business lounges at their operational bases. KLM, for example, has opened a new lounge similar in scope to BA's at Amsterdam's Schipol airport; Singapore Airlines has an opulent lounge at Changi; while Air France's facilities at terminal two at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris are spacious and stylish. Over at terminal one, where most other carriers fly from, the story is different with far less salubrious accommodation for business travellers. The problem, however, for travellers is gaining access to airline lounges when flying away from the airline's home base. Even when their preferred carrier has a lounge, this is often small and cramped. Executives frequently find they are reduced to joining the throngs in the main departure lounges. Clearly, this is an area where the airlines are keen to improve their services, although the problem is restrictions on space at most international terminals. Probably the most significant on-the-ground development in recent years has been the introduction of free limousine services for some business travellers. It was Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic which first brought this innovation to the UK; originally its Upper Class passengers qualified for a limousine to and from the airport only within a radius of 40 miles from the airport. Now it offers a limousine transfer from any mainland point in the UK. Other international airlines have, not surprisingly, emulated Virgin's approach rather than lose valuable executive travellers. But not all offer this service from anywhere in the UK, so it is worth checking when making a reservation if a limousine is included. BA, which has flirted with the idea of providing similar facilities, has so far found it impracticable to offer this service in the UK because of the large number of flights it operates. Limousine services are not available at all international airports because of government restrictions on 'inducements' to travellers. Thus business travellers to and from Tokyo's Narita airport are offered by Virgin, for example a 'limousine bus service' instead of individual transport. Those travellers preferring to arrive by car have welcomed new developments at Heathrow airport this year aimed at giving a fairer deal to the business traveller. Mr Barry Gibson, Heathrow's retailing director, explains that 'we were using prices as a deterrent in the short-term car park because of congestion, but we failed to understand the different types of passenger. We weren't offering a business product, and that's 50 per cent of the market at Heathrow.' Heathrow now offers over 21,000 car parking spaces at three classes of park  -short-term, business and long-term. It is the business park development which offers most for executive travellers: designed for those who usually go away for two to four days and who previously used (at great expense) the short-term car park or were forced to hike to the long-term parks. The new business parks offer special three-day rates plus a rapid transfer system from car park to terminal. Though there have been reports of teething problems, most executives find the system is a cheap and convenient way of taking their car to the airport. But others prefer to pay more to use a commercial valet parking operation at the airport. Under these schemes, the car is dropped off at the airport and, on the executive's return, a call is made from the terminal to have the car waiting outside. Car rental companies are also following this trend towards seamless service on the ground. Avis, for example, has taken advantage of new computer technology to offer its Preferred Service. Under this scheme, frequent renters can arrive at a car rental office, see their name and car bay number in lights, and go immediately to their car, which contains both keys and rental agreement. Other efforts to ease the path of the executive traveller on the ground are being launched all the time. Last month, for example, the ABC World Airways Guide, published by the Reed Travel Group, launched a special simplified guide for business travellers. This guide enables executives to steer themselves through the complexities of airline schedules, with full details of airline business classes, terminal plans and other essential information. But perhaps the area where most still needs to be done to improve the lot of the business air traveller on the ground is at check-in. Changes have been introduced to make life easier for the travelling executive - such as the check-in facilities for Gatwick at London's Victoria rail station - but many of those flying first class or business class from most terminals can still find themselves having to queue. The airline that can get this right for the 1990s will be ahead of the game in wooing the business traveller on the ground.</p>

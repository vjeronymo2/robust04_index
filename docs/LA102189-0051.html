			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> RENOVATED 'ADAM-12' ON CABLE LAYS DOWN THE LAW  </P> <P> Has it been that long? The "old" "Adam-12" ran from 1968-75, and now coppers  Martin Milner and Kent McCord are together again, this time promoted to civvies  and moved to Nashville, Tenn., with brand new identities but the old business.  </P> <P> "Nashville Beat," a Nashville-shot movie that unashamedly begs for series  status, premiers tonight at 6 on cable's Nashville Network. This would be TNN's  first creation of a dramatic series.  </P> <P> The "boys" were old LAPD partners. Brian (Milner) now is a captain on the  Nashville force, teamed with ever-suffering cop-wife Kate (Rosemary Forsyth),  and Mike (McCord) is an L.A. detective who tracks a drug gang to Nashville,  where it aims to open a franchise.  </P> <P> McCord, who is a co-executive producer, has taken most of the interesting  shtick and "smart" lines for his Mike, who does sit-ups and eats California  Flakey, to the amusement of new friends.  </P> <P> The story is incredibly routine and flat, which, if memory serves, was usually  the problem with "Adam-12," even though the collaboration worked. The boys  still look terrific, with some great new "character" wrinkles, and balance each  other nicely.  </P> <P> A series? Well, Mike has his eye on Nashville, with an especially hot eye on a  blond barkeep. She has hot eyes back. Hmmm.  </P> <P> (As for "Adam-12," a new version -- with new stars -- debuts Monday at 7 p.m.  on KTTV Channel 11.) IRV LETOFSKY  </P></p>

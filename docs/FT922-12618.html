			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound buoyed by ERM talk STERLING held firm yesterday, buoyed by the raft of rumours over a weekend move to the narrow 2.25 per cent band of the exchange rate mechanism, writes Peggy Hollinger. Speculation mounted in the early part of the day that the UK and Spain would move jointly over the weekend to join the narrow band. However, traders dismissed the actual possibility that UK or Spanish authorities were ready to yield the flexibility of the wider band. Yesterday's rumours were only the opening shots in what will be a weekly occurrence, some suggested. The trend has been for realignments, new parities and moves to narrower bands all to occur after trading hours on a Friday. This would mean that every Friday until the currency is actually moved into the new band, rumours would support sterling. 'This is the first and I don't believe it,' said Mr Nick Parsons of CIBC. 'You will not see sterling join the narrow band this side of midsummer's day.' The UK currency ended the day in London 50 points higher at DM2.9175. This reflected both the strong underlying demand for sterling and the general weakness of the D-Mark. The peseta suffered from the narrow band rumours, as the interest rate implications filtered through to the market. The Spanish currency weakened from Pta 62.54 to Pta 62.79 per D-Mark. The Spanish authorities refused to comment on the rumours. The French franc took traders by surprise with a late rally leaving it at a 12 month high against the D-Mark. Most were hard-pressed to explain the rise, suggesting that D-Mark weakness was again to blame. However, others said the franc had gained some support from the promotion of former finance minister Pierre Beregovoy to Prime Minister, and from France's record in dealing with inflation. The dollar had another frustrating day, with markets muted ahead of the Easter holiday. US industrial production figures - which were virtually flat  -had little effect. The greater influence came from comments out of Tokyo that the US and Japan were ready to protect the yen if need be. Dr Gerard Lyons, of DKB International argues that the focus is likely to switch to the yen in the next few weeks. Speculation over deals between Washington and Tokyo at the G7 meeting later this month could fuel more volatile movements in the Japanese currency. The dollar ended the day in London a touch stronger against the yen from Y132.75 to Y133.45. The fact that traders were reluctant to be short of dollars ahead of the long weekend helped the US currency ignore otherwise depressing factors.</p>

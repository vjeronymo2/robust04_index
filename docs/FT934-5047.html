			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Low inflation a key objective of medium term strategy - Red Book details The overall objective of the government's economic policy is to promote sustained economic growth and higher living standards. This section describes the role macroeconomic policy plays over the medium term in delivering that objective. It also sets out projections for the evolution of the economy and the public finances, taking account of the government's new spending plans and the Budget tax proposals. Economic policy over medium term Economic growth is generated by businesses and their employees, not by governments. But governments do have the responsibility for ensuring that markets work properly and that the regulatory and tax burden on business is kept to an absolute minimum. The government also has the essential task of establishing a macroeconomic framework which provides the stability that businesses need to plan for the future. Volatile inflation, unsustainable public finances and sharp fluctuations in economic activity are all undesirable. As a major trading economy the UK cannot hope to insulate itself from events abroad. But domestic policies which keep inflation down and stabilise the public finances create the right conditions for sustainable growth. Under the MTFS, the government therefore directs monetary and fiscal policy towards two key objectives: low inflation on a permanent basis and sound public finances. Monetary policy It is the role of monetary policy to deliver low inflation. The aim is to keep underlying inflation (as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) in the range 1 to 4 per cent and to bring it down to the lower half of this range by the end of the present parliament. However, monetary policy influences inflation with a lag. Interest rate decisions are therefore based on an assessment of the prospects for underlying inflation in one to two years time. That assessment is based on a range of monetary indicators and other data. The main monetary indicators are those described in the 1993-94 MTFS, in particular the growth of narrow and broad money and movements in the exchange rate and asset prices. Estimates of the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the overall stance of fiscal policy are also taken into account. The medium-term monitoring ranges of 0 to 4 per cent for narrow money (M0) and 3 to 9 per cent for broad money (M4) are unchanged from those set in the 1993-94 MTFS. However, M0's monitoring range will remain under review, as there is still considerable uncertainty about the trend of M0 in relation to GDP. Funding policy will continue on the basis set out in the 1993-94 MTFS, with sales of debt to banks and building societies from 1993-94 onwards counting as funding in the same way as sales of debt to other sectors. It was announced in March that sales of gilts to banks and building societies in 1992-93 - which were not at that stage counted as funding and totalled Pounds 6.8bn - would be taken into account in implementing funding policy over the following two to three years. Funding operations so far this year have not made any use of this flexibility. But the government's intention is that full account will be taken of it between now and the end of 1994-95, so that gilt sales will be some Pounds 6.8bn lower than indicated by the normal operation of the full fund policy. This will help to ease the exceptional degree of cash shortage in the money markets, which has resulted in large part from the gilt sales to banks and building societies in 1992-93. The objective of the government's fiscal policy is to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term, and to ensure that when the economy is on trend the public sector borrows no more than is required to finance its net capital spending. The public sector accounts now distinguish more clearly between current and capital spending and provide estimates of net capital spending and the public sector's current balance. In addition the government believes that a steadily rising proportion of capital investment in the public services should be financed by private capital, based on a proper transfer or sharing of risk. The direct effects of the tighter public expenditure ceilings and increases in tax revenues announced in the Budget will build up over time and will reduce the PSBR by some 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. But the pace at which the PSBR declines will also depend significantly on the growth of the economy over the medium term. On the basis of the main projections for activity and inflation the PSBR is expected to return steadily towards balance. By 1997-98 the current deficit is eliminated. By the end of the five year period covered by the MTFS the PSBR is broadly in balance. The main fiscal projections are based on the illustrative path of the economy shown in the accompanying table. Output growth averages around 3 per cent a year over the medium term, as the economy moves back toward trend. These growth assumptions are similar to the average of the projections made by the Panel of Independent Forecasters, and close to those in the March 1993 MTFS. Spare capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation over the medium term and underlying inflation is projected to fall to the lower half of the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range by 1996-97. Projections of the public finances consistent with these assumptions about the economy are shown in the accompanying table. The PSBR is projected to fall rapidly over the next few years, and by 1998-99 it is broadly in balance. The public sector's current account deficit falls rapidly and is projected to have disappeared by 1997-98. Publicly financed capital spending is projected to remain roughly constant over the period to 1996-97 covered by the survey, and to grow in line with the control total thereafter. Except where future changes have already been announced, the revenue projections are based on the conventional assumption of constant tax and national insurance rates from 1994-95, with allowances, thresholds and specific duties indexed on the usual formulae. All proposed Budget changes are taken into account. The ratio of general government receipts (GGR) to GDP is projected to rise as the economy recovers and the tax increases announced in March and in this Budget are implemented. The cyclical downswing of the early 1990s reduced the GGR ratio significantly. For example, the share of mainstream corporation tax in GDP has halved over the past four years, largely because of the recession-induced fall in taxable profits. But this should be reversed in the upswing, albeit gradually given the lags in tax collection and assessment. The government's public expenditure total for 1997-98 and 1998-99 is assumed to grow 1 per cent a year in real terms. The ratio of general government expenditure (GGE), excluding privatisation proceeds, to GDP was on a downward trend for much of the 1980s. In recent years, the impact of the recession has caused it to rise. The new plans will reduce the GGE ratio from 1994-95 onwards. Public sector debt is currently rising rapidly as a per cent of GDP and this is increasing the burden of debt interest payments. With the new public spending plans and the tax measures announced, the net public sector debt ratio peaks at around 44 per cent, below the levels of the first half of the 1980s, before starting to fall in 1997-98. There are inevitably uncertainties about the medium term. Given present spare capacity, growth could be stronger for a time without causing inflationary pressures. On the other hand, a weaker than expected world economy could hold back the pace of recovery.

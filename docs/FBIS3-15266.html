			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Boris Yeltsin at an expanded meeting of </F> the government in the Kremlin -- live]    [Text] Esteemed participants in this meeting. Eight days  have passed since the presentation and sending of the  president's message to the Federal Assembly. Quite a few  deputies have already voiced agreement with the main provisions  of the message. The long-awaited outlines of a common approach  to the resolution of economic problems are becoming clear. I  intend to do everything possible to strengthen it. This is all  the more necessary in the present situation, when the danger of  confrontation has appeared. I refer, first and foremost, to the  political amnesty.    I am fully aware of how contradictory the Duma decision is  and of how hastily it was implemented. I considered, and still  do consider, that a violation of the Constitution, the law, and  moral standards has been committed here.    The amnesty decision posed a most acute question for me as  president: either a new schism, a new round of implacable  struggle or, despite everything, the preservation and growth of  a base for interaction, for cooperation in the state and in  society.    For the country, for the benefit of its citizens, for  security, for civic peace, the first path is ruled out. It can  only lead to confrontation.    The address to the Federal Assembly spoke of the need for  all  healthy forces in society and all authorities and political  forces to cooperate in what is currently the main issue -- the  strengthening of the state, nor was it said for the sake of  style and form.    Russia now is an altogether different country: it has a  constitution, it is able to resolve its problems peacefully. I  think that together we will be up to the task of breaking the  habit of always struggling and that we will be able to  neutralize the adverse effects of the amnesty.    I am convinced that a majority of our deputies' corps does  not suffer from political amnesia and that it does understand  the absolute need to link efforts to surmount the crisis and to  strengthen the state.    There is a platform for consensus -- the presidential  address. I think the time has come to create firmer guarantees  of civic peace in the country. The president, the Federation  Council, the State Duma, the government, the power-wielding  structures, parties, movements, and public organisations should  share the responsibility for preserving that peace.    The adoption of a memorandum on civic peace in Russia could  become the first step along this path. Such a memorandum should  to include not just a declaration of intent, but also mechanisms  stipulating accountability for decisions that are being adopted.  The leadership of the State Duma has reacted positively to this  proposal.    I have no doubt that the government will also support it.    Today in Russia democracy means first and foremost  stability,  order, cooperation. The government is faced with an extremely  important task. I would like to start with the situation in the  coal-mining areas. It is inadmissible that wages should not be  paid for several months. I shall keep an attentive eye on the  development of events, on the position of the trade unions.  Naturally urgent decisions will be made, but in the future let  those first and foremost who are late in paying for the coal,  who hold up wages bear responsibility.    The entire legal mechanism regarding liability for breaches  of labor legislation needs to start working, beginning right  from the very bottom. One should not rely solely on the  government for everything. Judges and the procuracy should at  last take a more active stand regarding workers' complaints.  You see what things have come to. The Norilsk city court  rejected several actions brought for breach of the collective  contract. Some similar cases have come to light in the Kuzbass,  too.    In the immediate future I intend to submit to the State  Duma,  by way of a legislative initiative, a package of amendments to  the criminal code and to the law on collective contracts.  Liability for breach of labor legislation needs to be stepped  up. Let those who fail to honur obligations pay fines. Of  course the problems cannot be solved by strikes today, but the  liability of those who condemn the workers to strike must be  stepped up. That is our common task.    The government has to determine the mechanisms to implement  the strategy for the new stage of the reforms as set out in the  message and to determine the tactics. It will not be easy to do  this. This year the situation in the economy remains difficult.  The sociopolitical conditions are rather tough. There is not  much freedom of maneuver.    The government has a program which was adopted in August  1993. It must, of course, be refined, but the main thing is that  it must be fulfilled. What is required of the government today  is for it to have a long-term policy. Economic reform at any  price is a mistaken slogan. People could reject a reform which  is too burdensome. Life has shown that it is not just the  reform, itself, which entails certain costs. Even greater losses  are caused by delaying changes which are urgently needed.    The main thing today is the energetic transformation of the  economic mechanism. The government has to continue to take upon  itself the main burden of the problems. This is a sign of  weakness of state power. The reform of the economic mechanism  leaves the state those problems which the market system does not  cope with. It will become not only strong but also cheap.    A qualitatively new stage of privatization is one of the  main  reserves of reform. The voucher stage must be completed without  hindrance and on time, but it is necessary now to create the  legislative basis and to create the organizational mechanisms  which will make it possible to obtain from privatization much  more than now. It is necessary to attract into it Russian and  foreign investors in order to use this money for the  technological renewal of production.    Of course, it is time to coordinate privatization with the  structural and other areas of economic policy. The drafts of  the Russian Civil Code and other top-priority laws will be sent  to the State Duma very soon. Their adoption will lay a stable  legal basis for the market economy and will help Russian  entrepreneurship gain a firm foothold. Both parliament and the  government need to support it, not only by adjusting regulation  procedures but also by tax reform.    The urgent necessity of this is obvious, as is the  difficulty  of implementing it under inflationary conditions. All the same,  tax reform must not be postponed until the summer, as is  sometimes proposed. There are outlines and they should urgently  be made use of. The system of settlements and the work of the  banking system constitute a bottleneck in the reform. Profound  changes are needed here, including reform of the Central Bank  with the aim of creating a Russian federal reserve system and  this should also be begun without unnecessary delays. The  anti-monopoly reserve of the reforms needs to be skilfully  managed. It is clear that the de-monopolization of our economy  will require time. So preventive measures blocking the  emergence of new monopolist structures are particularly  important.    At the same time, we must not regard everybody as having  been tarred with the same brush. Not every enterprise behaves  as though it is a monopoly enterprise. Natural monopolies are  another matter altogether -- an effective state control is  needed here.    The system of management of state enterprises is to be  seriously transformed this year. To be more precise, this  system, to all intents and purposes, must be built anew. State  property is being used in a most ineffective manner. State  property, or at least a proportion of it, is here to stay and in  this area the Federal Assembly and the government alike have a  great deal to accomplish.    The importance of creating Russian financial and industrial  groups is well known. It is a way to concentrate resources in  growth areas and maintain investment activity and  competitiveness. The government must find a correct line -- not  to impede nor accelerate this process, but to control it,  eliminating harmful effects.    The reform of economic mechanisms in the agrarian sector is  a  problem of enormous importance. It will continue to falter if  no mechanism is created to implement the right to private  ownership of land and if a modern banking infrastructure  continues to be absent, along with a great deal else that is  also lacking.    Financial discipline must be firmed up and this goes for the  state itself, first and foremost. The primary task is to make  inflation moderate, controllable, and predictable. The  guidemark remains as before - about five percent per month  toward the end of this year. The government has enshrined this  mark in its program adopted on 6 August last year, and there is  currently no convincing evidence to necessitate a review here.    It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that, in  Russia's  present conditions, the war against inflation will be a  positional [pozitsionnyy] one. I think that military  terminology is fully appropriate in this matter. Inflation  cannot be beaten by a single fierce attack. To win the battle,  total coordination of the actions of the president, the Federal  Assembly, and the government will be required. It is necessary  to involve all the forces that are available, all resources --  both monetary-credit and financial and structural-investment  resources--and fiscal policy. The inflation-proofing of the  economy must be completely guaranteed. This is a vital political  limitation from which we cannot depart. An exclusively  inflationary budget is unacceptable.    The other limitation is the due level of social protection  for those who are unable to do without state assistance. Any  draft decisions causing the standard of living to fall below the  minimum levels must be referred back for reconsideration. They  are not to be implemented. This applies primarily to the budget.  Any reduction in the share of expenditure on culture, science,  and education is impermissible.    Acting within the framework of these limitations, the  government has to immediately activate schemes to address the  full acuteness of the nonpayments crisis.    This year, it is time to make a real start on registering  debt in the form of securities, reorganizing and improving  economically unviable enterprises, and applying the bankruptcy  procedure. An economy in which factories calmly feel that  they have no prospects will never be a truly market-based,  efficient, and non-inflationary economy.    The government must at last launch a structural investment  policy. Otherwise the technological retreat of Russian industry  will not be halted, and we may lose even what little we have:  industries which have kept their staff, technologies, and  well-established positions in the world market, as well as our  country's intellectual potential. We have no alternative now to  using the potential of reforms to get us out of the crisis and  restore the economy. I am convinced that together we are  capable of making 1994 a year in which we see a steady fall in  the inflation rate, stabilization of living standards, a  significant slowdown in the decline of output, an increase in  investment activity, and positive structural changes.</p>

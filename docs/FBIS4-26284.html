			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third part of a serial report on the Spratly Islands </F> entitled "Dedication on the Nansha Islands" -- by station  reporter Hu Zhanfan; from the "News and Press Review" program]    [Text] Many things which are considered ordinary and  trivial on the mainland become very important on the Nansha  [Spratly] Islands. For example, letters from one's family.  More than once, we saw how fighters guarding the Nansha Island  reefs beamed with joy when they received a letter from their  family and how those who did not receive any mail became  dejected. However, more than any other story, we heard  family-letter-related stories about the silent dedication by  soldiers guarding reefs at the remotest corner of China's  territory.    There is a political instructor called Wu Guisong on the  reefs. When he was 30, a baby boy was born to him. He named his  baby Weiguo. He left home and returned to the reefs before his  baby was one month old. Fighters have called him Weiguo's  Father since then, and he would happily answer to this.  Unfortunately, three months later he received a letter from his  wife telling him that the baby had died of pneumonia four days  after he left home. Although it was like a bolt out of the  blue, Wu Guisong put up with the blow. He kept the bad news to  himself and did not mention a word of it to others. He  understood that any personal joys, anger, and sorrows would be  contagious and would be shared by others in this small community  far away from human habitation. He could not let his personal  sorrow affect the general mood of the fighters. Whenever  unknowing young fighters called him Weiguo's Father, he felt  pain as if his heart had been stabbed with a knife, although he  loudly responded to their calls with a smiling face. He shed  his tears when he was alone.    More often than not, on the reefs, whoever received a letter  from his family would read it aloud in public. One day, platoon  leader Qian Renping received two letters from his family. One,  dated 13 February, was sent by his wife, and the other, dated 17  April, by his father. Gathering around him, fighters asked him  to read aloud the letter from his Snow White as quickly as  possible. He opened the letter and read aloud a paragraph:  "Renping, I am in very good health. You have to go through  hardships on the Nansha Islands. Take good care of yourself. I  have been looking forward to receiving your letter for three  full months. To date, I still have received none from you.  This time, you must send me as many letters as you can write."  Here, he stopped reading and folded the letter. He wanted to  enjoy reading it at his ease sometime later. Then, he opened  the other letter from his old father. After he had read a few  lines, tears began welling in his eyes. His father told him  that Qian's wife had contracted liver cancer and had passed away  two months ago. His wife spent a whole afternoon writing the  short letter to him on her deathbed. Qian Renping could not  bear the sudden blow. However, when he received a notice to  immediately return home by the next available vessel, he shook  his head and said: "There are no previous arrangements. I  cannot just go and leave my work unattended." Wiping tears off  his face, he silently sat at his desk again.    In a pillbox on the Nansha Islands, we saw the following  scene on a TV screen: A few fighters stood in the waist-deep  seawater; holding guns in their hands and standing close to each  other, they were defending a national flag. We also listened to  the story about the deeds of Fighter Zhou Jianguo, who  gloriously sacrificed himself during the construction of a  pillbox, and we heard about the instances of asphalt felt  melting and thermometers bursting under the scorching sun of the  Nansha Islands. Officers and men repeatedly told us stories  about such incidents. We found the story about the arduous  struggle at sea unforgettable. In October 1993, Typhoon No. 20  hit the main pillbox. High waves rolled over the rooftop of the  three-story-high building. Erected structures and equipment  lying on an area of 600 square meters of the construction site  were swept away. Seeing the erected structures and equipment on  the construction site disappearing before their eyes, the  fighters wept. Swept away before their eyes were kitchen  utensils, foodstuffs, materials, towels, soap, toothbrushes,  toothpaste, clothes to be washed, and equipment for fighters'  activities. What else could they use for food, clothing, and  equipment on the construction site? The party branch decided  that what had not been swept away by the typhoon must be used in  a centralized way. Officers and men contributed for common use  all the canned food, cigarettes, towels, and instant noodles  that they had saved for themselves. Cans were used as bowls and  washbasins as pans. Bamboo broomsticks which had not been used  were split open and cut short for use as chopsticks. Two people  took turns wearing three sets of clothes. The fighters received  a cookie every other day. Despite such hardships, the fighters  did not fail to perform their duties at their posts or to stand  guard for 20 days in a row.    Such was the dedication by sentries at the remotest corner  of  China's territory. The spiritual force supporting them was,  there is no doubt, the four large characters inscribed on the  (Yushu) Reef of the Nansha Islands -- Long live the motherland.</p>

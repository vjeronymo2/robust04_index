			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Arts: The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Theatre Though Victor Hugo wrote Notre Dame de Paris (1831) as a novel, it was being staged soon after its publication in 1831. Thanks to Charles Laughton, it is now better known as The Hunchback of Notre Dame; but there have also been operas, and the ballet Esmeralda, which Jules Perrot made for London's Her Majesty's Theatre in 1844, has continued in Russian repertory (I saw it at the Maly in St Petersburg ten years ago). No wonder the tale takes to the stage so well. Five very distinct leading roles; a strong mix of love and jealousy (four men all in love with one woman); an important role for the crowd; and the marvellously theatrical background of Notre Dame and the thieves' quarter of late-mediaeval Paris; not to mention the bells, the bells. All these are vividly present in Phelim McDermott's staging at the West Yorkshire Playhouse (the smaller Courtyard Theatre, downstairs) - and with only a cast of six. A large part of the fun of this staging lies in Julian Crouch's design. As you enter the theatre, the interior of Notre Dame faces you, with all its depths and heights and windows and galleries and aisles. Most marvellous of all is that Crouch's three-dimensional stage world is just a series of painted, two-dimensional surfaces. This kind of scene-painting went out of fashion years ago, and yet it endures in many of our minds as part of the very essence of theatre. Crouch's designs plunge you back like a child into the enchantment of toy theatre. And his most virtuoso touch of all is his skill with masks. This Hunchback is partly populated by gargoyles, as the six actors don grotesque masks (and gloves, and feet) inspired by mediaeval stonework. The six also tell the story with many visually compelling images. Esmeralda's dancing, evoked in just a few slow gestures, has an ideally serious, spellbinding quality. Jon Linstrum's excellent lighting has a masterstroke when Frollo (Psycho-like) stabs Phoebus; suddenly, darkness makes Notre Dame's rose window (the centre point of the set) vanish, as the priest's crime of passion wipes out his sense of God. McDermott has a fascination with fantastic oddity - the depths of spirit that lie beneath ugly surfaces. The hunchback Quasimodo, so touchingly set amid the gargoyles here (and played by Martin Gent), is the latest in an enthralling line of McDermott's ugly fantasticoes. One would like to see him tackle Hoffmann's Nutcracker (with or without Tchaikovsky's help), or Caliban (with or without Shakespeare's). But McDermott - who works in mime, radio comedy, acting on screen and stage, direction - is an an all-rounder who has not yet learnt how to make an all-round theatrical experience. His six actors cannot handle all the plot's verbal emotion convincingly; and the pacing, amid a generally brisk narration, sometimes sags. Above all, McDermott's love of comedy overbalances the show. No Hunchback of Notre Dame should be lightweight, and this one is like pantomime, albeit engrossing. It is obvious that his work is immature, and it seems probable that he clings to this immaturity (rather than attempt the polish and rhetoric of other directors' work). But he and Crouch are in love with theatrical illusion, and they make an audience love it too in a way that is all too rare. At the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Courtyard Theatre, Leeds, until May 21</p>

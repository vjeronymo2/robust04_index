			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK dividend rises exceed predictions With the UK results season well in train, the London stock market has reason to be encouraged by the reports from the corporate battle front. There have been few nasty shocks among large companies, while dividend increases have exceeded expectations. Nearly all of the financial sector has reported on 1993, while around a third of industrial groups have announced. If there has been any disappointment with reported profits figures, it is largely due to higher than expected provisions. Perhaps the largest surprise came from British Gas, which announced a Pounds 1.65bn restructuring charge, while Unilever set aside Pounds 490m for reorganisation, and British Aerospace's profits were hit by a Pounds 308m exceptional charge. Even so, some take comfort from the view that one year's provisions are the next year's profit increases. The forecasts for corporate profits are distorted also by the introduction of the FRS 3 accounting standard, which has put such provisions above the line. Thus many brokers have two forecasts, one for FRS 3 profits and a second of underlying profits. Mr Mark Brown, strategist at Hoare Govett, the stockbrokers, says he is disappointed by the results so far but blames the higher incidence of provisions. His forecast of an FRS 3 pre-tax profits rise of 35 per cent for the industrial sector has been undershot so far by 13 percentage points. By contrast, Mr Roger Barker, equity strategist at UBS, the securities house, says he is happy with the results he has seen. He expects his 13 per cent forecast for underlying industrial profits growth from the top 250 companies in 1993 to be beaten, with the out-turn probably at around 16 per cent by the time the results season winds up at the end of this month. That ties in with Mr Brown's calculation that earnings growth stripping out exceptionals has been 17 per cent from industrial companies that have reported so far. Like UBS's Mr Barker, Mr Robert Buckland at NatWest Markets says that the results so far have been much in line with expectations. There has been no rush to downgrade 1994 forecasts as there would have been if companies had disappointed, he says. The good news has been on the dividend front. Large or unexpected increases have come from Vickers, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Reuters, BTR, Standard Chartered and BAT Industries. At the other end of the scale, Fisons and Ladbroke have each roughly halved their payments. As a result, forecasts of dividend growth in 1993 will have been too pessimistic. UBS's forecast of 3 per cent growth could turn out to be 2 percentage points too low, says Mr Barker. At Hoare Govett, Mr Brown says dividends reported so far by large industrial groups are up 8 per cent. Analysts had expected companies to rebuild their dividend cover before increasing payouts significantly. But it appears that companies are taking advantage of their much strengthened financial position to reward shareholders and possibly they are sufficiently convinced that the UK has entered a low-inflation era to feel comfortable with lower levels of cover. In addition, perhaps they are showing in dividends a greater confidence about 1994 than they have been prepared to express in chairmen's statements. This also explains the lack of rights issues. Only last week Barclays Bank, BAT and Cadbury Schweppes all denied plans to call on shareholders for new capital. Only two rights issues so far this year have exceeded Pounds 100m, from GKN and Burford Holdings. Those and the third largest, Berisford International's Pounds 56.1m call, were all to finance acquisitions. After Pounds 30bn of rights issues in the past four years, the corporate sector is now sporting a financial surplus instead of a deficit. Takeover activity - aside from the three mentioned - has been low. In the coming months one question exercising the minds of companies and economists is whether that financial strength will be channelled into investment to build new capacity, which will be required as demand in the economy picks up. If the results season has been generally better than expected, it has not been reflected in the performance of the stock market. Equities have been affected by other concerns, such as the performance of the bond markets and worries over interest rates. As Mr Barker observes, many companies need to produce good profit increases simply to justify the ratings their shares are on. At Hoare Govett, Mr Brown is advising investors to stick with the companies which are increasing dividends by more than the average. With uncertainty abounding in markets, investors are attracted to higher yields and faster dividend growth. These, he feels, will come from the consumer and service sectors, where dividend cover is higher and the potential for growth better than in the manufacturing area, where profits may recover but dividend cover is still low. Glynwed, for instance, reported a 47 per cent rise in profits, but it has paid the same dividend for five years in a row and this is the first time in three years it has been covered by earnings.</p>

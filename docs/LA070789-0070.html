			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EX-BOYFRIEND EXTORTED $15,000 FROM HER, WOMAN, 71, TESTIFIES  </P> <P> A 71-year-old Sylmar woman testified Thursday that she gave her former  boyfriend $15,000 because she believed that a Colombian terrorist organization  would kill him and members of her family.  </P> <P> Suletta Watters said during a preliminary hearing in San Fernando Municipal  Court that she gave Richard Ramirez, 68, of Burbank $5,000 on three occasions  after he delivered threatening letters that demanded money to support a  revolution.  </P> <P> The unsigned letters led Watters to believe that Ramirez was merely a messenger  for the terrorist group and would be killed if she did not give him money,  Watters testified.  </P> <P> "Life is in jeopardy," one letter threatened. "He who disobeys suffers the  consequences, which will be the violent death of your loved ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Blood in Texas'  </P> <P> Another letter said it was Watters' obligation "to help the revolutionary  peoples" and threatened "blood in Texas," where her brother and other relatives  live, if she did not comply with the demand for money. It also said the life of  her "symbolic husband" was in danger.  </P> <P> Ramirez was ordered to stand trial on three counts of extortion and one count  of attempted extortion. If convicted of all the charges, he faces a maximum of  16 years in prison. Ramirez is in county jail in lieu of $75,000 bail.  </P> <P> Watters said that after he delivered the letters, Ramirez called her to arrange  meetings when she gave him the money.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said that this was not the first time that Watters gave Ramirez  money. Watters supported Ramirez for 15 years, paying him $90,000 in living  expenses, after the two met at the company where Watters was a publications  editor and Ramirez was a security guard, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn P.  Lacey.  </P> <P> Watters fell in love with Ramirez, Lacey said, and he told her that he would  marry her after he received $1 million from an estate settlement that was in  litigation in Colombia. But in the interim, Watters complied with his request  for money for living expenses, giving him a stipend of $500 a month during the  15 years, Lacey said. She also gave him large sums, which he told her he needed  to pay for an operation and for attorneys in Colombia, Lacey said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broke Off Relationship  </P> <P> Watters broke off the relationship in 1986. She received the first letter  asking for $5,000 in September, 1988. She complied with that and with a second  letter demanding two separate payments of $5,000. A third letter, which she  received on June 6, demanded two payments of $10,000 each.  </P> <P> Watters was prepared to comply with the third letter, Lacey said, but to get  the money from the bank, she had to tell a relative who called the FBI.  </P> <P> Ramirez was arrested June 22 after police who searched his house discovered  several blue envelopes with rose emblems on the back. The distinctive envelopes  were the same type of envelopes in which the extortion letters had been  delivered, Lacey said.  </P></p>

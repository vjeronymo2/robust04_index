			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: A light grace and effortless intuition - Rembrandt in London The great Rembrandt Circus has reached London at last, via Berlin - where we first reviewed it on this page - and Amsterdam. With its sideshows and diversions, it makes for a wonderful show, cumulatively as important as any we could hope for, or are ever likely to see. Yet in its very strengths, unless we take care, lies a threatening if but temporary weakness. For Rembrandt scholarship is currently such a hot-bed of controversy, that the debate on authenticity and reattribution may all too easily mask this unique opportunity to confront the undeniable work of the master himself. Plus c'est la meme chose, as it were, plus ca change: as in Berlin and Amsterdam, here at the National Gallery we have the bulk of the show drawn from those three principal holdings of Rembrandt's work, with particular additions. And though the show consists of more or less the same things, its feeling and emphasis are necessarily different, the ample spaciousness of the Berlin display, for example, or the unrepeatable proximity of The Night Watch in Amsterdam, giving way to more close and intimate a display. Indeed, it may be argued that large as some of the works are, they are hung here, in the new galleries of the Sainsbury Wing, in rooms more like those they were made for than before. Certainly the group portrait of the Sampling Officials of the Drapers' Guild seems more at home than in the draughty spaces of the Rijksmuseum. The transition, too, from the undisputed to the reattributed paintings, with their comparative works, is less confusing than before. With the Rembrandt Research Project now at the mid-point in its sceptical trawl through the oeuvre, this joint exercise by the three museums in setting an independent bench-mark of authenticity, was more than a good idea: it was necessary and right. And how good it is to learn that at least one of the demotions, the National Gallery's own Anna and the Blind Tobit - given to Gerrit Dou, by whom it manifestly is not - is under active reconsideration. However, the extent to which the Project has bedevilled the whole field of Rembrandt studies is nicely pointed by the coincidental display at the Wallace Collection, which by statute cannot lend its works, of its 12 putative Rembrandts, all but one of which are now discounted. It is only right that any truly gifted pupil, such as Willem Drost, should be given his due at last, but to be given the Frick's Polish Ride is something else. These things can go too far. So it continues at the British Museum, where London's unique contribution to the Rembrandt festival is to be found. Instead of the loan group of drawings that travelled with the etchings to Berlin and Amsterdam, the prints are shown by themselves at the National Gallery, while the Museum is showing its entire collection of drawings by Rembrandt, some 80 in all and the largest in the world. Alongside these are displayed drawings from his a circle, again many of them uncertain and controversial. The problem with the drawings is, if anything, even more contentious than with the paintings, given the essential immediacy of the medium, the images so often transient, perfunctory and incomplete, caught on the wing. Once material contemporaneity is established, the question can only be resolved by eye and intuition, qualities in which scholars are by no means certain of distinguishing themselves. When it comes, as sometimes here, to a matter of identifying a drawing as one by a pupil but retouched by Rembrandt, the convolutions are infinite, every question begged. Of a reclining lion, c1648 (no. 88), we read in the catalogue that 'the generally cautious draughtsmanship. . . betrays the hand of a pupil. . . Yet the broader lines. . . with a reed pen. . . are more vigorously executed and with a superior comprehension of the forms depicted. These retouches have been interpreted as corrections to a pupil's work by Rembrandt himself. . .' Yet it is not beyond probability for an artist to use two sorts of pen on the same drawing, nor for him to pull it all together at the last. Why should not Rembrandt here be correcting himself? Ink, which he used so much, is by its nature a committing medium, the mark once made difficult to change or modify, let alone remove. It bespeaks caution, at least initially, and there are very many of the uncontested drawings of which we can say as much. And in a drawing, the artist is not on oath. If it goes wrong, it goes wrong and hardly matters, yet too often the instinct of the scholar is to remove it from the canon. So we read, of the tethered lion (no. 92), that 'the surmise that Rembrandt retouched the darker outlines. . . is not convincing: some of the least secure parts. . . including the front paw, are executed in the darker ink.' The miracle with Rembrandt, as with any great artist, is not so much the success, beauty or indeed security of the particular drawing, as that it is there at all, and we so close to his touch and presence and visible thought. That the image that results should indeed be beautiful and convincing is merely a miraculous bonus, a function of the artist's process and engagement with his subject and material. That it should be carried off with so light a grace, as Rembrandt so often does, is for us to wonder that these things can be done at all. A sleeping girl, a self-portrait, he conjures on to the page in a few strokes of the brush. He draws a landscape as he would write a note to tell you the way, with effortless intuition - 'you go down the lane', he would seem to say, 'over the bridge, on past the inn and into that wood. . .'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sison, CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines]  founder, denounced chief government negotiator Howard Dee for  expressing willingness to talk with breakaway communist groups.    Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger, CPP spokesman, also  issued strong statements against Dee. Rosal said the Alex  Boncayao Brigade (ABB), headed by Felimon Lagman, is a vigilante  group working with the military.    "The Ramos regime bears full responsibility for closing the  door to any kind of talks with the NDF (National Democratic  Front)," Sison said in a statement from his base in Utrecht, the  Netherlands. Sison said Dee revealed the government's decision  to get out of peace talks with the NDF in a statement issued by  Dee on 5 February. [passage omitted]    "Dee is in effect delivering the message to the  revolutionary  forces that they must continue to wage the people's war," Sison  said. "Howard Dee is more interested in being a psy  [psychological]-war agent of the Ramos regime than in looking  for a way to the negotiating table. He is below the caliber and  style of Representative Jose Yap," he said. Yap was  presidential emissary to the NDF during the exploratory talks in  September last year in the Netherlands.    Sison said it will be futile for Dee to "pretend that the  Lagman gang is something that the regime can negotiate with." He  said the NDF had in fact demanded that the government stop  coddling and using the "criminal Lagman gang" as a tool to  "sabotage" the communist movement before peace talks can proceed.    Sison said Dee's statement was meant to "deflect public  attention from the outrageous raising of oil prices and  electricity and power rates." In a separate statement, Rosal  said the ABB's bombing of the three oil companies following the  increases last 28 January was aimed at sabotaging the peace  talks. [passage omitted] "From being part of the NPA [New  People's Army], the ABB has become a vigilante group and worse  as an instrument of the U.S.- Ramos regime," Rosal said.</p>

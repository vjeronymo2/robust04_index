			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recreational Harvest Allocation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment 11 also proposes to modify the subarea allocations for the recreational fishery south of Cape Falcon when the allowable recreational coho allocation for the entire area is equal to or less than 167,000 fish. This modification is intended to maintain the historical catch distribution between Oregon and California when stock sizes are at low levels, so that one geographical area is not disproportionately affected by the harvest reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the northward migration pattern of the affected coho stocks, coho landings occur early in the season off California and gradually move north into Oregon. Coho landings south of Humbug Mountain, Oregon (42 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; 40 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;30 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. lat.), taper off dramatically after July, whereas central Oregon fisheries tend to reach peak coho landings in July and August with fish available into September. Currently, when the recreational coho quota south of Cape Falcon is reached, the recreational fishery for coho remains open south of Humbug Mountain. In the past, the south of Cape Falcon coho quota has generally been reached after mid-August; the impacts of allowing the California recreational fishery to continue have been minor, as the season has been near the end and coho catches are generally very low south of Humbug Mountain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the reduction in the coho quotas and overall harvest rates caused by low coho abundance, it is possible that early fisheries to the south could catch most of the available coho impacts before fish become readily available off central Oregon, resulting in a shift of the harvest to southern Oregon and California fisheries. An example of such a redistribution occurred during the 1993 season. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, 68,000 coho were available for the recreational fishery south of Cape Falcon. The recreational season off central Oregon was closed on August 10 with 56 percent of the recreational harvest caught south of Humbug Mountain and 25 percent occurring south of Horse Mountain, California (40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; 05 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;00 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. lat.). From 1976 to 1992 for comparison, the recreational coho harvest south of Cape Falcon averaged over 200,000 coho and the harvest south of Humbug Mountain averaged 23 percent, with 2 percent occurring south of Horse Mountain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To maintain the historical catch distribution given the current low harvest levels, Amendment 11 establishes two subareas with independent impact quotas to ensure that a large southward shift in the recreational harvest does not occur. Of the total recreational allocation, the subarea from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, Oregon, receives 70 percent and the subarea south of Humbug Mountain receives 30 percent, with the percentages being based on avoiding large deviations from historical harvest shares. Except for the area south of Point Arena, California (38 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; 57 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;30 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. lat.), the two subareas will be managed for their respective impact quotas, and the recreational fisheries for coho salmon in each area may be closed upon attainment of the quota. South of Humbug Mountain, there are 2 additional conditions: (1) An impact guideline of 3 percent of the overall south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation will be applied from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California; and (2) the recreational fishery for coho salmon will not be closed south of Point Arena, even if the fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena is closed, upon projected attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota, but the projected harvest through the end of the year will be included in the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota. Quota transfers between subareas are allowed on a one-for-one basis, but only if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of 167,000 as the trigger for this allocation is based on 2 factors: (1) It represents a low harvest level at which a southward shift is likely due to the migratory pattern of coho and the timing of normal fishing seasons, and (2) it is the upper limit of the recreational allocation that is subject to reduction to meet hook-and-release mortality in the commercial all-salmon-except-coho fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of Amendment 11 would require changes to the regulatory language in the appendix to 50 CFR part 661. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The attacks on newsmen and the lynching threats against  the university caravan are just the most visible element of a  tense plot that could drive the entire region into a new theater  of combat. First, the shock wave of the initial explosion, which  has not yet faded, evidenced the regional (and national) absence  of the rule of law and even of a state apparatus that could take  responsibility for solving problems. In this context it is very  significant that Don Samuel Ruiz is sought after today by  Indians, peasants, and workers all over the country as an  intermediary in dealing with a government that has been  conspicuous by its absence or that simply fails to acknowledge  its responsibility to anyone. This is even more significant  because one of the government's tactics has been to set up  several "autonomous commissions" and "consensus-building boards"  that are substituting for already existing institutions and that  will supposedly help to ease the conflict and to develop, at  last, sectoral solutions for ethnic groups around the country.    A sort of honeymoon period of civil liberalization and  rebirth inspired from below was created regionally in this  vacuum. The new context evidenced the nature of the  authoritarian regime, the true essence of regional cacique  power, which has been sustained for several years from the  center and has been embodied in the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] governors, the chiefs of small groups that  have broken every law and laid waste to Chiapas at their whim.  The spontaneous municipal revolt (which has now spread to a  third of the state's municipalities), the teachers' rebellion,  the protests by the employees of several services, the blockades  of creditor banks and roads, the takeovers of ranches and large  and mid-sized landholdings in Chilon, Simojovel, and elsewhere,  and widespread civil disobedience, etc., have now created an  environment of change that has exposed the parallel structures  of the State in Chiapas: complicity and corruption, the partisan  contracts awarded to several cabinet secretaries (among them,  the construction firms of the Zedillo Ponce de Leon family), the  indiscriminate looting of public coffers during the  administrations of Castellanos and Gonzalez Garrido, the  fraudulent dummy companies, the systematic violation of human  rights, and in particular the existence of a complex array of  armed parapolice groups in the city and the countryside (the  so-called "white guards") that receive weapons, training,  protection, and even lands from the state and federal government  and that derive at times from the very disintegration of the  peasant movement, which has accelerated over the past three or  four years.    Chiapas once again seems to be a boiling cauldron whose  special hue colors all of the forces that are remodeling  themselves there. The sudden emergence of a dissatisfied  citizenry is also a relatively new phenomenon (although it does  have powerful forerunners in the 19th and early 20th century),  because "civil society" there has expressed itself over the past  20 years almost exclusively through the peasant movement and  certain fiercely persecuted opposition newspapers. The weakness  of this emerging civil society, which lacks mediating sectors  between the peasants and the State apparatus, which is far  removed from civic-electoral matters, and which is just barely  beyond the control of the State party and its elaborate  networks, also explains some of the fragility of the new  balances. Paradoxically as well, the strong and recurring  peasant social movement reflects the entire range of hopes and  dangers and very possibly foreshadows the scenarios of the  immediate future; all of the paradoxes and contradictions of  Chiapas society are mirrored in it.    We can say today that the peasant movement, which has  regrouped around the 280 associations that make up the State  Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has a very  diverse makeup, as no more than 14 organizations in it truly go  beyond the local or municipal level. And although its components  range from simple cooperatives and production units (and several  sham groups) to more or less independent regional organizations  and three overtly official ones, they all have in common a  treatment of political matters that is a factor today in the  movement's structural weakness and in several immediate dangers.  It is on this weakness that the corporative control of the old  PRI mainly rested, lubricated in recent years by the economic  disbursements of Pronasol [National Solidarity Program]. As a  result, the bridges that could link this widespread movement to  the civic-electoral arena and thus allow for the honest election  of a civilian governor of Chiapas do not, in fact, exist today.  The two basic currents that began it, the radical leftist  organizations of the 1970's and the so-called Mass Line, have  come together here to reject a political-electoral approach. The  former feel that such a struggle is "bourgeois" or a losing  cause from the outset against the backdrop of a "farce." The  latter are deliberately disregarding politics so that they can  pursue what they have called the "policy of the two faces" (or  the thousand masks), which consists of turning the peasant  economic movement over to the networks of official  "consensus-building," financial corruption, and the captive,  corporative PRI vote. When the Salinas administration took  office, some of the local advisers to the latter became  second-rank federal officials of Pronasol, Sedesol [Secretariat  for Social Development], or the CNC [National Peasant  Confederation] and established their control over the official  part of the Chiapas peasant movement: Peasant-Teacher Solidarity  (Socama), ARIC [Rural Associations of Collective Interest]-Union  of Unions, and to a lesser extent, the state CNC.    It is for these and other reasons that in recent days the  CEOIC has become one of the hubs of the Chiapas problem in  discussions and battles between those who are calling for an  independent, unified peasant movement and those who are trying  once again to yoke the entire movement (as if nothing had  happened) to the networks of the State apparatus, of the  Permanent Agrarian Council (CAP), of the ruling party, and of  the "advisers" of PRI and Pronasol. For the time being, in spite  of opposition by the majority, attempts have been made to  overturn peasant support for the besieged Zapatists  (unconditional backing by the main Indian groups in the CEOIC  for the EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation]). Efforts  have also been made to thwart the "plan of action" of protests,  marches, rallies, peaceful takeovers, and widespread resistance  and to legitimize in the CEOIC's eyes the presence of advisers  to President Salinas de Gortari (such as Javier Gil of UNORCA  [National Union of Autonomous Regional Peasant Organizations]  and of the CAP) or to bring in as leaders of the process the  "Three Wise Men" of the "autonomous" commission (appointed, but  of course, by Salinas and Gonzalez Garrido on 8 January): writer  Eraclio Zepeda, Patrocinist [partisan of Patrocinio Gonzalez  Garrido] anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Castellanist  [partisan of former Governor Absalon Castellanos] Senator  Eduardo Robledo, who is also seeking the PRI nomination for  state governor.    In this context, the nascent CEOIC, which has achieved a  fleeting unity that would have been unthinkable before the  explosion (inasmuch as the movement was seriously divided and at  odds), would paradoxically be the "natural base" of support for  rebuilding PRI domination in Chiapas. The philanthropic ogre is  thus endeavoring to lead its "favorite sons," the peasants of  Chiapas, once again down the sinuous pathways of the "Laberinto  de la Pronasoledad" [Labyrinth of Pronasolitude].    The promises of loans and aid of all kinds, the control of  some leaders, the promotional roundup and transporting of people  to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, Sedesol's gift of 10  vans to the CEOIC, and many other promises and traps are already  being strewn in the path of this nascent organization, this  brand-new grass-roots alliance that will have to become one of  the guarantors of a local transition to democracy. Nevertheless,  most of the groups that make up the CEOIC (the rank and file  much more than their advisers), including the battered state  CNC, are still alerting domestic and international public  opinion "to prevent the CEOIC from becoming another of the  instruments of control and manipulation that the federal and  state governments are using to avoid addressing the real causes  of the social, political and military violence that is wounding  Chiapas and the country." (LA JORNADA, 16 February 1994, p 14)    If the horizon were to become even more cloudy and if the  fancy footwork that the Salinas advisers are doing were to be  successful (once again plugging up the hole that the  insurrection has opened up in society), some of today's clouds  could turn stormy and develop into extremely dangerous  situations, such as a turbulent regional civil war. This depends  on the evolution of the State's two policies towards the  conflict: the mediation of Manuel Camacho Solis, on the one  hand, and the political-military siege of the insurgents, on the  other. The former policy is weakened by the fact that it binds  only the current government (and the Executive Branch more than  the subordinate Legislature and Judiciary), which also has just  a few months of nominal power left. It is constrained by the  fact that the meager legal representativeness of the "mediator"  and the EZLN could turn the negotiations into mere "sessions."  The latter could turn into a structural solution that in the  long run would lead to a low-intensity counterinsurgency that  would seek to involve the communities in the highlands and the  forest, especially after a military assault on the regions  controlled by the rebels.    This scenario, unfortunately, is not being ruled out and is  already to be seen in several respects: the tightening of the  military siege and the creation of the 38th Military Zone in  Tenosique; the erratic, irresponsible actions of the government  of Absalon Castellanos's former education secretary, Javier  Lopez Moreno (appointed from the center, like his corrupt  predecessors and accomplices); the traditional repression of the  civilian insurrectionists in the municipalities; Los Pinos  support for the traditional caciques; and the false promises to  "audit" the humblest representatives of a true Mafia (the mayors  and lower-level officials), without even trying to do anything  about the widespread impunity of the State apparatus in the  region (it has always enjoyed a complete, permanent amnesty).    The greatest danger, however, looms in the regions in  conflict, in which the Salinas administration has not renounced  violence as a solution. The forerunner of the future  counterinsurgent "civil patrols" (which resemble the ones that  are laying waste to the Guatemalan countryside today) was  created in Ocosingo in 1992 to deal with the agrarian insecurity  prompted by the ongoing invasions of ranches and estates. Called  the "Citizen Defense Unions," they were armed and trained,  according to the ranchers themselves, by the Federal Army and  can already claim several evictions and assaults, as well as  prior confrontations with the Zapatists. The next step can be  seen coming: using the official peasant organizations in the  forest region, especially the ARIC-Union of Unions (which is  bitter over the support of several of "its" communities for the  Zapatists) to provoke confrontations, to create an unpopulated  corridor by relocating refugees, to intone official propaganda  (which would be pro-peasant and pro-Indian) against the rebels,  to administer the new disbursements of Pronasol, and to  manipulate the displaced persons (as the pro-PRI ranchers in  Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas have already done). All  of these actions would pave the way for the final "siege and  annihilation" of the rebels by the Federal Army.    There is still time to prevent such a scenario if the  government acts in good faith, if the peace negotiations pan  out, if intelligent, creative actions are taken (a democratic  opening, participation of all parties and forces in a new social  pact, comprehensive agrarian reform...), and if the basic  premise is that we are looking at a radically new situation. But  if the Federal Government remains "tied up in knots" and thinks  only about the partisan interests of the small "interest group"  and its multimillionaire sponsors or if it continues to act as  it has, perpetuating landowner domination of Chiapas and the  wild-eyed centralism and presidentialism of the president and  his friends, who have done so much harm to the country (in a  word, the ignoble peace before the explosion), then we will be  hurtling towards a precipice that could engulf the country in  violence for several years.    As the rebels have been proclaiming since 1 January and the  citizens of the entire country have been proclaiming for some  time now, a solution to the Chiapas conflict is possible only  through a true national transition to democracy. Political  parties, which have been overtaken by events, must realize that  the fate of the entire nation is at stake in Chiapas and that it  is not just some minor obstacle on the campaign trail. It is  that easy and that difficult.</p>

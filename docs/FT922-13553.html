			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: The rising workload of insolvency practitioners - The secrets behind the way banks allocate their appointments of receivers IF INSOLVENCY specialists get much of their business by scratching influential backs in the City, London may have developed some very red backs indeed over the past year. While a handful of high profile insolvencies such as Polly Peck and BCCI have drawn public criticism for the high level of fees charged, less attention has been given to how business is allocated between the practitioners. As an analysis conducted by the Financial Times shows, while the pattern is far from clear-cut, there are signs that particular banks favour certain receivers. Cork Gully, the largest firm and the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, reported Pounds 64m in fee income in April last year. KPMG Peat Marwick, its largest competitor, showed insolvency fees of Pounds 44.5m at its year end on September 30 1991, compared with Pounds 26.4m the previous year. Insolvency income is likely to rise significantly in absolute terms as the firms report later this year. Given the decline in other activities, it is also likely to make up a larger proportion of total fee income from all accountancy services. Practitioners point out that not only will appointments continue to rise with the effects of the recession, but even after the economy has begun to pick up, there is a substantial lag during which expanding businesses will not be matched by enthusiastic banks and further insolvencies will occur. The FT analysis uses the announcements of 5,513 receiverships made in the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes, for the 12 months to the end of March. These name both the bank and the receiver which it calls in to sell the business or its assets. Receivership - as distinct from administration and other insolvency procedures - is driven by banks, which hold security over assets held by the company to which they have loaned money. The nine banks illustrated account for 79 per cent of all receiverships during the period, easily led by National Westminster. The top ten insolvency and accountancy firms shown make up 76 per cent of all receivership appointments. Eight of the ten firms are names familiar as among the top ten accountancy firms by fee income. The exceptions are Leonard Curtis, which specialises purely in insolvency work, and Levy Gee, the 25th largest firm by overall fee income, which has boosted its receivership work substantially over the past two years. The proportion of receiverships given by the banks to each firm varies widely. Some banks appear to distribute their work relatively evenly, but others clearly favour particular firms. Cork Gully dominates the appointments overall. In all but two cases it has a higher proportion of appointments than any other firm. The exceptions are Hill Samuel and Yorkshire Bank. Hill Samuel gave 23 per cent of its appointments to Levy Gee. Yorkshire Bank gave 20 per cent to Grant Thornton and 8 per cent to Stoy Hayward. Another unusually high figure comes from 3i, which gave 16 per cent of its appointments to Stoy Hayward. Partly the pattern is explained by the strong regional office structure of firms like Grant Thornton, which offer a local presence around the country. Some banks, such as 3i, also have a strong devolved management structure with appointments made locally. Most importantly, banks and receivers alike point out that receiverships are allocated under the Insolvency Act to named qualified practitioners, not simply to insolvency firms. That is not simply a pedantic point. 'Receivership is a very personal type of work,' says Mr Maurice Moses from Levy Gee. 'The banks are trusting you with their money so they are not just going to pick up the phone and ask anyone. It really boils down to relationships and trust. It is the individual not the firm who is appointed.' He says four of the nine partners in the firm have close links with Hill Samuel and says they do make efforts to cultivate individuals within the bank. 'But the best cultivation is doing a good job,' he stresses. In the past, some appointments by banks may have gone to the practitioners which banked with or were audited by them. But the banks deny any accusations of favouritism, and stress that they distribute work based on their assessment of the expertise of individual practitioners, how well they have performed with previous assignments, and their understanding of the workload facing a particular firm at any one time. One senior banker says: 'Obviously we meet the receivers socially. It is important to know the sort of people they are. But the wining and dining counts for nothing when it comes to appointments. Like pop stars, they are as good as their last appointment.' The data in the analysis needs to be treated with some caution. They only show the number of appointments made, and give no idea of the value of each appointment - a figure often not likely to be revealed for a year or more after the insolvency practitioner moves in if ever. They do, however, treat receiverships from a connected group of companies as a single appointment, which prevents the statistics from being inflated by dormant or related companies.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               HOW THE BANKS DIVIDE THEIR RECEIVERSHIPS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Receivership appointments April 1991 - March 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Total     NatWest     Barclays    Midland   Lloyds                      Appts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total appointments              1236         933         750      598 Coopers/Cork Gully   928          17          19          16       19 KPMG Peat Marwick    655          15           7          15       13 Ernst &amp; Young        529           8           8          16       12 Touche Ross          486          11           7           8       15 Grant Thornton       457           8           9          10        3 Price Waterhouse     320           5           4          10        6 Arthur Andersen      293           3           4           6       12 Leonard Curtis       188           6           4           5        0 Stoy Hayward         165           4           2           3        2 Levy Gee             162           3           6           2        1 Other               1330  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Royal     Bank of       Hill     Yorkshire    3I                      Bank      Scotland    Samuel        Bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total appointments   415         162         134          80       62 Coopers/Cork Gully    18          22          22          10       19 KPMG Peat Marwick      9           4           7          10       15 Ernst &amp; Young         10          17           4           4       15 Touche Ross            4           7          14           5        7 Grant Thornton        15          14          10          20        5 Price Waterhouse       7           7           7           3        8 Arthur Andersen        4           3           0           5        0 Leonard Curtis         1           1           3           0        2 Stoy Hayward           1           1           2           8       16 Levy Gee               0           0          23           0        5 Other  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT analysis of London and Edinburgh Gazettes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / US jets bomb Kuwait desert B-1 and B-52 bombers flying non-stop from bases in the US bombed the Kuwaiti desert yesterday to remind Iraq of the global reach of US military power following a flare-up on the Gulf War border. Two B-1s and two B-52s dropped 110 bombs on the desert floor 13 hours after takeoff from bases at Elsworth, South Dakota and Minot, North Dakota. The B-1 Lancers and B-52 Stratofortresses were part of exercises by 100 British and US warplanes staged over Kuwait and also in part over a western-imposed no-fly zone in southern Iraq.</p>

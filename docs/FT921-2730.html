			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Provision for oil unit hits net profits at Cavendish CAVENDISH International, the property-to-energy subsidiary of Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa, announced a 5 per cent drop in net profits, to HKDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 162m) for 1991, compared with HKDollars 1.32bn in 1990. However, the results included a HKDollars 462m provision for the diminution in value of the oil and gas reserves of 24.5 per cent-owned Canadian associate Husky Oil. The company saw a significant increase in contributions from 34 per cent-owned Hong Kong Electric Holdings. Profits there climbed to HKDollars 2.34bn in 1991, from HKDollars 1.93bn. However, the Husky provision held the contribution from associate companies to Dollars 1.27bn, only Dollars 1m higher. Cavendish saw significant profits from the sale in 1991 of residential blocks in the Belvedere Gardens and South Horizons property developments. However, the 100 per cent-owned Hong Kong Hilton Hotel suffered a reduction in profits because of global recession and the impact of the increased supply of luxury hotel rooms on Hong Kong island. Mr Simon Murray, chairman, warned of 1992 that 'overall results could be adversely affected by the performance of Husky Oil and in particular the future trend of oil and natural gas prices'. However, analysts do not rule out another privatisation offer for Cavendish this year, as a result of its discount to net asset value and the potential recovery of its Canadian energy interests. Cavendish recommended a final dividend of 14 cents, making a total 1991 payout of 21 cents.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Farnell advances 18% to Pounds 49m - Strong organic growth in the UK and overseas behind profits rise Farnell Electronics, the electronics components manufacturer and distributor which acquired the Multicomponents distribution business from ITT in December, yesterday reported sharply higher full year profits, reflecting strong organic growth in the UK and overseas. At the same time, the group revealed that it had negotiated an Dollars 11.3m (Pounds 7.7m) reduction to Dollars 58.5m in the price it paid for Multicomponents following the discovery of a 'misrepresentation' by a local financial controller in the accounts of the Multicomponents branch in Denmark, overstating operating profits for the previous three years. The value of the net assets acquired by Farnell was not affected, however, and the group has already taken corrective action including replacing the local financial controller and operational manager. Group pre-tax profits for the year to January 30 rose to Pounds 49.1m, an improvement of 18 per cent over the previous year's Pounds 41.6m when profits were swollen by a Pounds 6.3m gain on the disposal of a dormant subsidiary. Turnover increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 320.1m (Pounds 254.3m) including an initial Pounds 26.6m two-month contribution from Multicomponents. Earnings per share edged higher to 24.4p (23.7p), but on an adjusted basis increased by 42 per cent from 17.2p to 24.4p. A final dividend of 4.2p makes a total of 7.4p (6.2p) - an increase of 19 per cent. Operating profits increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 36.3m), including a modest Pounds 353,000 contribution from Multicomponents. Farnell's core distribution division performed well, lifting turnover by 27 per cent to Pounds 265.9m and operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 46.8m. The performance of the manufacturing division was also much improved as a result of last year's restructuring and improved market conditions. The manufacturing operations, which mainly make power supplies, reported operating profits of Pounds 4.15m (Pounds 1.04m) on turnover of Pounds 59.2m against Pounds 50.5m. Interest costs fell to Pounds 329,000 (Pounds 1.03m) and the group ended the year with net gearing of 19 per cent. COMMENT Farnell's underlying performance last year was impressive, reflecting strong organic growth across the group including the established overseas catalogue operations in Australia and Germany. The acquisition of Multicomponents - a deal which looks even better following the renegotiation of the price - provides a huge opportunity to expand the business internationally. Multicomponents has annual sales of about Pounds 170m and although current operating margins of 2.4 per cent look anaemic, Farnell should be able to cut out some Pounds 3m of duplicate costs and in time lift operating margins to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m look possible this year, producing earnings of 29.6p. The shares are trading on a forward multiple of 19.6, but could go higher.</p>

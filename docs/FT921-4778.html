			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes subside ANOTHER busy day on the UK money market saw continuing jitters and evaporating rate cut hopes prompt operators to take money back and reduce their exposure risk. Rates moved firmly into line behind a 10 1/2 per cent base rate, reflecting widespread resignation that the long-awaited cut will not come next week, or even before the general election, owing to continued sterling weakness. Nervousness was fuelled by an opinion poll showing the Conservatives running neck-and-neck with the UK clearing bank base lending rate 10.5 per cent from September 4, 1991 opposition Labour party, threatening a hung parliament and a long period of political uncertainty. The three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent, with the yield curve looking flat all the way to the 12-month end, which eased  1/16 to 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent The March short sterling contract firmed slightly to 89.60 down from 89.58, while the June contract ended unchanged at 89.79. Most market participants had cut their book right back, and were awaiting Tuesday's Budget to re-assess the situation. This hampered the authorities' efforts to relieve a large shortage - first put at Pounds 1,450m, and raised to Pounds 1.5bn at midday. The shortage, due mainly to treasury bills and maturing assistance of Pounds 1,239m and bills for repurchase worth Pounds 237m, apparently lay not with the discount banks but the clearing banks, which can always cause problems. The discount houses seemed to have contributed as much as they wished to in the early round, when the Bank purchased only Pounds 10m of band 1 bank bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 200m for repurchase by the market on March 26 and 27 at 10 7/16 per cent. At midday, the Bank purchased only Pounds 207m of band 1 and 2 bank bills, and Pounds 164m for repurchase. In the afternoon, the situation improved as the Bank was able to purchase Pounds 668m of band 1 and 2 bank bills outright, and provided late assistance of Pounds 180m to take the day's total up to Pounds 1,429m. This kept overnight rates around 11 1/4 -11 per cent, dropping to around 9 per cent towards the close. German call money rates were unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent, but traders said activity was hampered by strikes by some bank workers.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Observer: Debt limbo Guyana's foreign debt of Dollars 2,333 per citizen is pretty steep, much worse than that of some more notorious South American mega-debtors. So imagine the horror of Guyanese government officials when new figures put the total debt at 50 per cent more than last year's Dollars 2.1bn. Calculators were produced; sighs of relief followed. The extra red ink was a mathematical error. It 'occurred on the exchange calculations made by the accountant general for loans denominated in Japanese yen and Italian lira', says Ashni Singh, acting auditor general. Asgar Ally, the embarrassed finance minister, sheepishly blamed Anand Goolsarran, the auditor general, saying Goolsarran ignored ministerial advice and submitted the figures to parliament before they were double-checked. No comment from Goolsarran, who's abroad somewhere. Hope he checks his change, wherever he is . . .</p>

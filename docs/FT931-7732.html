			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: Minimal into the invisible - Robert Ryman at the Tate The Robert Ryman retrospective, jointly organised by New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Gallery, which opens its international tour with its showing at the Tate, is as important as it is timely. It is sure to puzzle quite as many as it will irritate, and as many again both at once, but it also comes at a moment when the serious questioning of the received wisdom and prejudices of the avant garde has risen to the surface, to be aired on all sides. We can safely disregard the nine-days'-wonder school of journalistic response, with its instinctive anti-modernism which amounts to a profoundly anti-art philistinism - all art was modern in its day. But what seems to have happened is that a number of the more serious commentators have come quite independently to a broadly similar conclusion. For all the creative energy and excitement generated by the modern movement, in all its forms, over the past century and more, for all the profound truths of human experience it has realised, and for all the very real creative achievements that have marked its course, we have come at last to recognise that when the avant-garde becomes academic, it is more than time to take stock. It should be the stuff of serious and constructive debate. What must be challenged is the assumption that whatever may be identified as avant-garde is of itself important and significant: from which it follows that the common curatorial and international dealing view that all too patently finds interest, so far as contemporary art is concerned, only in art of such a kind, is dangerously narrow, partial and unfair. The real usefulness of this Ryman exhibition is that it is both wonderfully even-handed and particular, offering both sides of the question, the radical and the academic, in the clearest terms. Such considerations were doubtless far from the Tate's mind when arranging it, seeing the show simply as the celebration of an established and respected modern painter. But it is exactly what it should be doing, presenting the work at issue, holding the ring. The justification for a great deal of modernist activity has always been not so much the actual production of great art, or of art at all, but rather as the necessary experiment and investigation into what Art is, or might be, and into the mechanics, actual or potential, of its achievement. What has always bedevilled the debate has been the mindless subsequent acceptance that the fruits of such activity, whatever else they are, are also, without question, works of art. Art is what artists do, or propose, and so it follows that a walk in a field, a bare canvas, a beer can, a proposal, a mere idea, may itself be elevated to the status of Art. It is a seductive heresy, but heresy still. In Robert Ryman we have an artist who was actively engaged with what was, in the 1960s, one of the central issues of painting. Following upon the more intuitive indulgences of abstract expressionism, the tougher questions were addressed, of what a painting was, and how to make it more itself. If an image is but an illusion, leave it out. If a painting is but a coat of paint upon a surface, leave it at that. And if variations of colour or surface-texture begin to seem arbitrary and unnecessary embellishments, then reduce the variation to uniformity, and drain the colour away until only white is left. The most fascinating part of the show is indeed that given to this earliest phase in Ryman's progress - he is now 62 - when he was wrestling with these problems, simplifying and recomplicating his surfaces and, in the process, achieving results that were highly personal, inimitable, and often, in the sensuality of the paint itself, very beautiful. But just how reductive, how simple, could he afford to be? The deceptive aesthetic of simplicity too soon seduced him, and he has been playing the game of elegant, pseudo-radical simplicity ever since, sustained it must be said (and good luck to him) by the enthusiasm of the museums and the market place. Successive stripes of paint cross the canvas, leaves inevitably a record of every insensible variation of touch and pressure. Every painter who ever primed a canvas knows the wonderful thrill of that first loaded brush, and has played the game of leaving it that, or just one more, and just another - but it is only a game. We all know that to put anything, anything at all, on a bare white wall is to invest it for the moment with an aura of cosmic significance. A blank sheet of paper, four pins to describe a square, a length of aluminium beading - to go through the later rooms of this retrospective is to see the radical minimalist become but an aesthete working his endless decorative variations, and wondering to himself: whatever next? A sad business. ***** The Lisson Gallery's Out of Sight: Out of Mind is another salutary and entirely justifiable historical exercise, but again the fundamental issue is inescapeable. It is an ambitious group show which deals rather more comprehensively with the graphic, photographic and cerebral manifestations of 1960s and early 1970s conceptual art than Gravity &amp; Grace, at the Hayward, has lately done for sculpture of the time. From Carl Andre and Art &amp; Language to Bob Law and Bill Woodrow, it offers a stimulating and enjoyable trawl through the fashionable and technical preoccupations of the time, a ferment of ideas and possibilities. But as Art? Bruce Maclean at his most ironical, with photographs of his evaporated puddle, and of himself as Henry Moore's 'Fallen Warrior', says it all. Robert Ryman: Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until April 25, then on to Madrid, New York, San Francisco and Mineapolis; sponsored by the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation and the Patrons of New Art. 'Out of Sight: Out of Mind': Lisson Gallery, 67 Lisson Street NW1, until April 3</p>

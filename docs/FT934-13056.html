			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Injunction on 'Clockwork' clips lifted CHANNEL FOUR Television is to screen an arts documentary including clips from the banned film A Clockwork Orange after a Court of Appeal decision to lift an injunction preventing the programme being shown, John Mason writes. The injunction had been won earlier this month by Time Warner, the film producer and distributor, which claimed the use of the clips broke copyright law. However, three appeal court judges ruled yesterday that Warner had failed to show Channel Four had infringed the 'fair dealing' provisions of the Copyright Act 1988 which allows excerpts of films to be used for review purposes without permission from the copyright owners. The documentary is scheduled for next Tuesday's Without Walls arts programme.</p>

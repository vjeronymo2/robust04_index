			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SEC MAY CREATE A 'SMOKE DETECTOR' TO SPOT BROKERAGE ILLS  </P> <P> Federal securities regulators voted Thursday to consider creating "the  corporate equivalent of a smoke detector" to head off potential financial  troubles at big brokerage firms such as the one that sank Drexel Burnham  Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to seek public comment on  proposed changes in the net capital rule, which requires broker-dealers to  maintain minimum amounts of cash and assets easily converted into cash to  offset the risk of the securities they trade.  </P> <P> But last February's sudden collapse of the parent company of junk bond giant  Drexel Burnham has raised concerns that regulators are not getting enough  advance notice when the parent companies of Wall Street firms withdraw large  amounts from capital reserves.  </P> <P> While financially sound itself, the Drexel brokerage business was a victim of  money woes at its parent Drexel Burnham Lambert Group. DBL Group filed for  bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on $100 million in short-term  debt. The SEC and the New York Stock Exchange refused to allow it to draw down  cash from the brokerage to repay its debt.  </P></p>

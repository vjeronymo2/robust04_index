			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Overnight rate at 20% THE OVERNIGHT interest rate in the sterling cash market was quoted as high as 20 per cent yesterday after some of the leading players in the market refused to offer bills to the Bank of England at the start of trading, writes James Blitz. There was a lack of liquidity in the market after the Bank of England forecast a comparatively large shortage of Pounds 2.35bn. Only Pounds 315m of bills were offered in the early round and it was not until the afternoon session that the bulk of the shortage was removed. Banks and discount houses borrowed Pounds 730m via the 'late assistance' window, at which it is suspected that they pay punitively high interest rates. Yesterday's difficult conditions appeared to be the result of several factors which are again causing concern to discount house dealers and commercial banks in London. The shortages in recent months have become very large because of the government's huge sales of gilts to fund its Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. At the same time, one or two UK clearing banks are thought to have built up a substantial share of the sterling bill market in the wake of changes in the Bank of England's reserve requirements in the late 1980s. Dealers say that this gives them the power to dictate the overnight rate level, depending on the state of their lending positions. Yesterday's conditions pushed up three-month money by  1/32 percentage point to 5 29/32 per cent. One dealer also said that they contributed to a fall in sterling interest rate futures, with the December contract closing 4 basis points down at 94.42. By chance, conditions in the German market were not much of a recommendation for the repo system of money manage-ment either. German call money jumped a full percentage point to 7.75 per cent after commercial banks bought far fewer funds from the Bundesbank at the prevailing repo rate of 6.80 per cent. The German market was again locked into the same mentality that dogged it before the last Bundesbank meeting. Dealers believed that the discount rate would be cut today and preferred to borrow funds through the discount window. There was a larger drain of funds from the market than had been expected.</p>

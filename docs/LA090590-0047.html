			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICEMAN'S MOTHER SEEKS SUPPORT GROUP  </P> <P> Diana Contatore of Playa del Rey, whose Army son is scheduled for deployment to  the Middle East, is looking for mothers of other deployed servicemen and women  who might be interested in forming a support group.  </P> <P> "If there are other mothers out there who think it might be helpful to trade  information, maybe work to drum up people to be supportive and send cards, just  anything, I'd like to do that," said Contatore. "Maybe we can give each other  comfort."  </P> <P> Contatore's son, Army 2nd Lt. Daniel Kral, is at Ft. Hood, Tex., awaiting  deployment. Contatore asks that people interested in a support group call her  at (213) 937-0916 or 937-0917.  </P></p>

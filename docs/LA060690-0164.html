			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MUSTER TOPS IVANISEVIC; GOMEZ BEATS CHAMPION;  </P> <P> TENNIS: THE SEMIFINAL MATCHES ARE ESTABLISHED. FOUR PLAYERS WILL MEET FRIDAY --  AND NONE HAS EVER WON A GRAND SLAM EVENT.  </P> <P> Thomas Muster shook off a self-inflicted crack on the shin and Andres Gomez  silenced an ailing local qualifier and his hometown fans to complete the men's  semifinal matchup at the French Open today.  </P> <P> Muster, the seventh seed from Austria, beat Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia 6-2,  4-6, 6-4, 6-2, before Gomez, the fourth seed from Ecuador, defeated Thierry  Champion 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.  </P> <P> They meet for a berth in the final Friday, when American Andre Agassi, the  third seed, goes against unseeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden. None of the final  four has ever won a Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> Muster beat Gomez in the Italian Open semifinals three weeks ago, on his way to  winning that clay-court event.  </P> <P> Muster slammed his shin with the racket so hard on one second-set shot that he  started bleeding and was afraid more extensive damage might have been done.  </P> <P> "It hurt pretty bad," Muster said. But it was not enough to affect the outcome  of this quarterfinal against the unseeded Yugoslav, who eliminated Boris Becker  in the first round.  </P> <P> In reaching his second Grand Slam semifinal, Muster stayed on the baseline and  blasted shots at Ivanisevic, who attacked with volleys and dropshots.  </P> <P> It was an effective strategy in the second set, when the Yugoslav came back in  the late games and closed with an ace.  </P> <P> But it was too little against Muster, who has recovered from a severe knee  injury suffered when he was hit by a drunk driver in Florida last year to  become recognized as one of the world's top players.  </P> <P> Muster won the last four games to close the first set, blasted a forehand so  hard that Ivanisevic couldn't handle it at the net to finish the second and  flipped a forehand topspin lob over his charging opponent for match point.  </P> <P> "It is very hard to play against players like Goran," Muster said. "You get  tired and start to lose concentration. But I made some important shots at the  end."  </P> <P> Gomez, ranked seventh in the world and the owner of one of the best clay-court  games around, was just too much for Champion, the first qualifier to reach the  French Open quarterfinals since the open era of tennis began in 1968.  </P> <P> It took just 1 hour, 38 minutes for Gomez to reach his first Grand Slam  semifinal. The 30-year-old, the oldest by far of the four semifinalists, said  it had been a long time coming.  </P> <P> "I've waited 20 years for this moment to come," Gomez said. Helped by the  first-round elimination of second-seeded Becker and a fourth-round walkover  against injured Magnus Gustafsson, the 14th seed, Gomez has reached the semis  without playing a single seed.  </P> <P> "I had a bit of luck in the draw," he said. "And even if I don't believe in  luck, sometimes you want some."  </P> <P> Gomez broke Champion's service in the first game and never was troubled. He  allowed just one break himself, for 4-3 in the final set, but won three of the  last four games to close it on Champion's long service return.  </P> <P> Champion, who played eight matches in the last two weeks, said he felt ill  throughout the match. He also was bothered by a groin strain suffered while  beating Karel Novacek in the fourth round.  </P></p>

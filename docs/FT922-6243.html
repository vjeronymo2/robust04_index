			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Italy's MPs elect compromise candidate as new president ITALY'S two houses of parliament last night voted by a substantial majority to elect Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, as the country's ninth president. His election, ending lengthy political squabbling, took place against the sombre background of the funeral in Palermo of Mr Giovanni Falcone, the anti-Mafia magistrate assassinated at the weekend. The 73-year-old Mr Scalfaro, a magistrate and veteran member of the Christian Democrat Party, emerged as a compromise candidate after 15 abortive attempts to elect a new head of state. His election was made possible by the backing of the former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The PDS agreed to him after he was proposed by the Christian Democrats as an 'institutional' candidate to underline the need for thoroughgoing reform in Italy. His first task will be to name a new government to replace the caretaker cabinet of Mr Giulio Andreotti, who resigned on April 24 after inconclusive general elections earlier in the month. The broad party agreement behind Mr Scalfaro should enable the choice of a new government well beyond the outgoing four-party coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats. The new government is expected to have as its platform a reform of Italy's proportional representational system, a review of the seven-year term and role of the president, and introduction of tough austerity measures to ensure Italy complies with the conditions of economic convergence laid down in the Maastricht treaty on European union. Mr Scalfaro polled 672 votes of the 1,002 votes cast in a joint session of the Italian parliament - far more than the 508 votes he needed to get elected. He replaces Mr Francesco Cossiga, who resigned on April 28. The tortuous voting process began on May 13, when it was marred by a scuffle between rival parliamentarians. It would have been difficult for the 16 parties in parliament to continue horse-trading much longer over the presidency in view of the public mood since the Palermo magistrate's assassination. The public outcry at the murder has been directed as much against politicians as against the Mafia. Mr Falcone was blown up on Saturday evening along with his wife and three bodyguards when about a tonne of explosives was detonated under their three-car convoy near Palermo airport. At his funeral, government members were jeered and jostled as Sicilians vented their anger at the vacuum of authority and the inability to protect Mr Falcone, who was known to be at the top of the Mafia's hit list.</p>

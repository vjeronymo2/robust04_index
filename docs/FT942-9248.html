			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Dostoyevsky's 'The Devils' brought to life - Alastair Macaulay hails the Maly Theatre's three-part production in Glasgow The climax of the Maly Drama Theatre's current tour has been its three-week residence in Glasgow. Only in Glasgow, as part of its annual Mayfest splurge of artistic activity, has this Russian company been able to present all eight plays in its current British repertory: four at the Citizens Theatre, four at the Tramway. This is only just, for it is the Tramway's programme director, Neil Wallace, who has worked hardest to plan the Maly tour. And it is only at the Tramway that the greatest Maly event of all has occurred - its three-part, all-day production of Dostoyevsky's The Devils. To carry superlatives further, I add that this is the most marvellous theatrical event I have yet seen this year. It is also the first adaptation of a novel I have seen that can be compared with the RSC's 1980 Nicholas Nickleby. The scenery - by Eduard Kochergin - is wonderfully effective, indeed eloquent, but what carries all three parts of The Devils is the acting. Not only are Dostoyevsky's psychologically extraordinary studies brought onto the stage, but also the tremendous way in which each leading character is shown in a completely fresh psychological light in scene upon scene. Thus, the first time we see Piotr Verkhovskensky (actor: Sergei Bekhterev), at Mrs Stavrogin's house, we see him as a socially awkward blabbermouth, newly returned home, who tries, fairly disastrously, to ingratiate himself. Scene by scene, however, he emerges as a horrifying nihilist, a pathetic hero-worshipper, a heartless planner of murders. And we are still seeing new sides of him in the trilogy's long penultimate scene, during which he engages in half-ludicrous religious and epistemological debate with Kirillov, often thereby delaying his own purpose, which is to egg Kirillov on into committing suicide. This kind of plasticity of characterisation originates with the genius of Dostoyevsky, but it is heartstopping to see it achieved in the flesh onstage. I was amazed at the robust diablerie - dangerous, colossal, warm, vulnerable, by turns - that Igor Ivanov (so different in his lower-key role in Stars in the Morning Sky) brought to the role of Lebiadkin. This is the kind of towering force you can find in records, photos and accounts of Chaliapin; yet not only have I never really encountered it onstage before, but Lebiadkin is eventually only a minor role. Fully as fine are the performances of Piotr Semak as Stavrogin (the work's most heroic and self-doomed character), Sergei Vlasov as Shatov (whose death is the most affecting of all because his life has been irradiated by the most hope), and Sergei Kuryshev as Kirillov (whose mad obsession with self-extinction is seen as noble, funny, intellectual, pointless, vain by turns). It is astonishing that acting in Russian can be so enthralling to non-Russian-speakers. The Devils makes one grateful for surtitles, and impatient of them too; they are so needed and helpful amid a complex plot, yet they are also so inadequate - and, worst, they take one's eyes off the stage. The Maly actors are performers you want to watch at all times; I would pay money to watch these actors in these roles simply listening to each other. Yet this is not particularly 'physical' theatre. These actor make Russian sound as beautiful as great singers do; and their vocal eloquence catches character, emotion, mood, in astonishingly natural abundance. The staging is by the Maly's director, Lev Dodin. Praise for the acting is also praise for him, but I also praise the brilliant use of silent imagery (such as the twice-seen view of a young girl slowly climbing a ladder - which in due course makes alarming sense) and various sound effects (such as the distant drumming that so excitingly catches the pounding of Stavrogin's heart during his great confession). I have only space to skim the surface of this enthralling production. The Devils must, must, be brought back to Britain, to other cities. Lucky Glasgow. The Maly Drama Theatre tours to Newcastle this week and to Nottingham next week.</p>

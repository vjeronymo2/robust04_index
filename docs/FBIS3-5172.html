Lapresse  said that Khmer Rouge [KR] forces delivered logs to Thailand for  sale to earn money for use in their fight against the Cambodian  Government and they also use Thai territory as a base for their  operations.    Lt.Col. Somkhuan said such a statement is groundless and  affects the image of Thailand. If one considers the issue  thoughtfully, it is obvious that the present Thai Government has  a clear policy to maintain good relations with Cambodia. One  indication is the visit to Cambodia and Phnom Penh by Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai in January this year. Another indication  is that the Thai Government has provided Cambodia with  assistance for rehabilitating the country in various fields.  These are factors that assure very well the sincerity of  Thailand. All this is because the Thai Government wishes to see  peace established as soon as poosible in this region and if  fighting continues in Cambodia, Thailand will suffer also.</p>

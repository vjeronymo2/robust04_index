			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Equilibrium forecast for aluminium Cutbacks in world aluminium production agreed by the world's main producers could see the market restored to balance in 1996, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. At the same time, it warns that the outlook for bauxite (aluminium ore) and alumina (aluminium oxide) producers is 'not encouraging'. Reduced demand from aluminium smelters will coincide with significant additions to bauxite and alumina capacity planned for this year and next. In a report to a meeting of bauxite producers and consumers in Geneva this week, Unctad says the informal agreement on production cutbacks reached in Brussels in January could lead to last year's record aluminium stocks of 4.5m tonnes being reduced by 1.15m tonnes this year and another 2m tonnes in 1995. The Brussels agreement envisages output reductions of up to 2m tonnes a year compared with late 1992. Cutbacks so far amount to 1.2m tonnes, including 300,000 tonnes by Russian producers. Surging exports from the former Soviet Union have been chiefly responsible for the massive stock build-up of the past two years. Unctad estimates that, assuming world consumption rises by 4 per cent a year over the next two years, stocks at the end of 1995 will be down to 1.35m tonnes, a little more than one month's world consumption (excluding eastern Europe). 'It appears likely that a gradual return to close to full capacity utilisation in 1996 would be consistent with market equilibrium', the report says. In the long term Unctad expects aluminium consumption to continue to grow faster than industrial output or GDP as the metal increasingly replaces other materials, especially in packaging and vehicle manufacture. It warns producers not to retire too much capacity on a permanent basis, so that they are in a position to meet increased demand when the market revives.</p>

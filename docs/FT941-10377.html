			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Civil service head asks Scott to 'undo damage' of inquiry Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Home Civil Service, yesterday urged Lord Justice Scott to issue a statement about the media coverage that had 'permitted wild allegations and prejudging of issues' in the arms-to-Iraq inquiry. Sir Robin, who is also cabinet secretary, urged the judge to 'put the record straight' about the conduct of ministers and officials in the arms-for-Iraq affair. In a prepared statement, he called for the inquiry to 'undo, so far as (is) in its power, the damage which has been unfairly done to our system of government, to the reputation of the civil service and to individuals'. Sir Robin issued the statement after consulting Sir David Gillmore, head of the Diplomatic Service, and Mr John Major, the prime minister. While Sir Robin said that he made no criticism about the inquiry's procedures, his attack does challenge the judge's insistence that the hearings should be in public and openly reported. Sir Robin described as 'victims' middle-ranking officials who 'could not have been expected to be thrust into the limelight in the way in which they have'. Lord Justice Scott said yesterday that Sir Robin's statement 'would be listened to by those to whom it was addressed'. One of Sir Robin's concerns was the reporting of 'arms sales to Iraq'. He said there had been no licences issued 'for the export of arms, that is, lethal goods'. This is a question on which the judge has pressed former witnesses. Sir Robin yesterday repeatedly clashed with the judge and his counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale, QC, over the nature of ministerial responsibility, the duty of civil servants, and his own role in the Iraq affair. The cabinet secretary told the inquiry that ministers should only resign if they were 'personally culpable', and justified 'half-answers' to parliament. He said one of the strengths of Britain's system of government was 'that invariably you can find out what happened'. The judge interrupted: 'I think I would qualify invariably.' Lord Justice Scott questioned Sir Robin about how former civil servants had been stopped by the government from giving evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the Iraqi supergun. The judge urged him to 'think critically about the established practices and convention' of Whitehall. Sir Robin is to give further evidence in public today.

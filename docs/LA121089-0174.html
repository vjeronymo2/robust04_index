			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERCHANTS COMPLAIN OF METRO RAIL DISRUPTION;  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN: BUILDING THE SUBWAY HAS HURT BUSINESSES ALONG A STRETCH OF 7TH  STREET. POOR LIGHTING AND BAD TRAFFIC HAVE DETERRED CUSTOMERS, RETAILERS SAY.  </P> <P> Merchants in the heart of downtown Los Angeles are finding it difficult to get  into the holiday spirit this year.  </P> <P> In what should be their busiest season, the shopkeepers instead are coping with  a decline in customers and an increase in vandalism, and they blame the  Southern California Rapid Transit District.  </P> <P> Metro Rail subway construction has snarled traffic in a two-block section of  7th Street, between Figueroa and Hope streets, disrupting pedestrian access to  stores, cafes and businesses. High fences seal off the construction zones and  screen the storefronts from sight. To find the shops and showrooms, shoppers  must navigate narrow pedestrian alleyways that are more like tunnels and barely  wide enough for two people to pass. And at night, the merchants complain,  hoodlums lurk in the dimly lit passageways.  </P> <P> "This construction is killing our business," said Toni Ortega, manager of See's  Candy store in the 700 block of 7th Street. In addition to fewer customers, she  said, some sweet-toothed vandals -- hidden by the temporary fences -- broke  into her shop three times in one recent week, smashing display windows and the  glass front door to gain entry.  </P> <P> Construction of the Metro Rail and the smaller-scale Long Beach Light Rail Line  has caused problems in other commercial zones. But most transportation  officials agree that this stretch of 7th Street, which has endured the  construction for two years now, is by far the worst trouble spot.  </P> <P> Downtown merchants warn that their problems might serve as a preview of what is  to come to others as the massive Metro Rail is extended through some of Los  Angeles' most densely populated neighborhoods into Hollywood and the San  Fernando Valley. While they acknowledge that the disruption is the price to be  paid for any major construction project, the shopkeepers complain that many of  the problems caused by Metro Rail could have been avoided.  </P> <P> Three small 7th Street businesses have folded since Metro Rail construction  began. Court documents show the owner of one of the shops was $20,000 behind in  his lease and was forced out of business because, he said, the construction  barricades blocked customer access to him.  </P> <P> Rapid Transit District officials acknowledge that construction work has  hampered access and created problems. But the RTD contends it is doing what it  can to help merchants survive the disruptions caused by the $48-million subway  station project. The job, started nearly two years ago, is scheduled to be  completed in September, 1990.  </P> <P> "Yes, we've had many complaints," said Rebecca Barrantes, RTD director of  governmental affairs. The complaints fall into four categories -- noise, dust,  security and access, she said. "We know these have an impact on businesses. . .  . We know their problems and have dealt with their individual complaints  quickly."  </P> <P> Throughout the country, big construction jobs like Metro Rail have been managed  to mitigate the worst of the problems, said Elaine Stewart, a retail expert  with the Los Angeles Central City Assn. For example, she said, work on the  Portland Light Rail Line -- built through the heart of that Oregon city -- was  shut down during the Christmas Holidays to help merchants in the construction  zones.  </P> <P> "In Portland, Seattle and other cities, the construction managers were very  sensitive to pedestrian and retail activity," Stewart said. The RTD put up  small signs at the street corners listing businesses that still operate there.  But Stewart contends that the district should have done much more to ease the  disruption.  </P> <P> Stewart made it clear that the association and the merchants in the area  strongly support Metro Rail. Their complaint is that the construction managers  are not sensitive enough to the retailers' needs.  </P> <P> The Metro Rail underground station at 7th and Flower streets will be the  largest stop on the 17-mile subway that will link downtown Los Angeles to  Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. When completed, the station also will  connect with the Long Beach Light Rail Line.  </P> <P> Under the street, three train tunnels converge on the 80-foot deep cavern that  will house the two-level station. The heart of the station, which is shaped  like an X, is directly under the 7th and Flower intersection and extends more  than a block in each direction. There was barely enough room between the  buildings to excavate the enormous hole needed to build the station, engineers  explained.  </P> <P> "This is a very big job in a very tight space," said Dan Riggs, project manager  for the private engineering firm that supervises construction for RTD. Heavy  timbers were used to roof the cavernous pit so that traffic could still move on  the streets. He said that more than half the street and sidewalk, however, is  needed for work sites, material storage and equipment parking -- bringing  greater disruption for merchants.  </P> <P> "Major jobs like this have major impacts," Riggs said. "We know we are causing  problems, but we're working hard to get along with the merchants."  </P> <P> Riggs said that the contractors voluntarily agreed to widen the sidewalk space  from the minimum four feet required by the city up to five and six feet to  increase pedestrian access. And, when merchants complained about the dark  walkways, Riggs said the RTD authorized the purchase of higher intensity light  bulbs for street lighting.  </P> <P> On 7th Street, however, managers of Fowler Brothers -- Los Angeles' oldest book  store and stationers -- are not impressed.  </P> <P> Business is off 20% for the second year in a row and at Christmas that  translates to about $50,000 for the month, according to store vice president  Randall Clarke. Comparisons to the Dr. Seuss story "How the Grinch Stole  Christmas" are quite appropriate, he said.  </P> <P> "The fact is that RTD has done nothing to help out," Clarke said. "It's been  total neglect and we feel defeated."  </P> <P> The brighter bulbs didn't come close to solving the problem, Clarke said: "No  way. It's still dark (in the walkways), we want floods, we need light to deter  the hoodlums."  </P> <P> A short way up the street, the 7th Street Bistro last week was hidden from view  by piles of construction materials. Patrons trying to get to the upscale  restaurant for lunch or dinner were forced to follow an intricate route through  a back alley off of Wilshire Boulevard to reach the front door.  </P> <P> "It's a very bad situation," said chef and owner Laurent Quenioux. He estimated  that the bistro's business was off $500,000 already this year, and the problem  is worsening. He added: "They (RTD) can destroy our business."  </P> <P> Other merchants complain that construction workers park cars and pickups on the  job site and that huge storage containers are stacked high, blocking the view  of their display windows.  </P> <P> Riggs, the construction consultant, said the parking and storage areas were  established according to Los Angeles City Department of Transportation  guidelines and permits.  </P> <P> City officials said they have tried to work out some kind of balance between  the needs of the Metro Rail contractors and the need to keep traffic flowing.  However, city officials, contradicting Riggs, said the city did not intend for  these areas to be used for vehicle parking or for storage.  </P> <P> "This is a sore point between RTD . . . and us," said James Okazaki, a city  transportation official. When city inspectors tried to get materials moved or  parking restricted, the contractors and RTD protested. "We've had a running  battle," Okazaki said, "and we sort of lost. It's been difficult."  </P> <P> Across the street from Fowler's, at the big Broadway Plaza shopping mall and  office complex, property manager Jon R. Bradford said the construction has the  plaza hemmed in on three sides -- Hope, 7th and Flower streets. Half the street  and all of the sidewalk along Flower Street has been turned into a storage  yard, he said.  </P> <P> "We'd like our sidewalks open and for them to move that storage," Bradford  said. He explained that before the RTD took over this section of Flower, it was  a staging ground for construction crews building the Long Beach Light Rail  tunnel into the 7th Street Station. The light rail project is managed by the  Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. When the commission finished its  tunnel job, the RTD took over, Bradford said.  </P> <P> While he was critical of the RTD's "insensitivity," Bradford praised the county  commission, saying it had been "very responsive" to the merchants' needs during  construction of the tunnel. Unlike the RTD, he said, the commission and its  contractors worked hard to minimize the impact of the construction on nearby  businesses, including providing 24-hour private security guards to deter  vandalism.  </P> <P> "We did a lot of hand-holding with the merchants," said Robin McCarthy, the  commission's community relations director. The commission staff also staged  business promotions to attract customers during the last Christmas season, she  said.  </P> <P> The RTD wants to be more sensitive to the retailers' problems, said district  spokeswoman Barrantes. "We're learning. We are planning to go into more  mitigation on the next (construction) phase," she said, adding, "In the future,  we want to avoid problems like 7th Street."  </P></p>

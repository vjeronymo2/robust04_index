They exchanged Spring Festival  greetings and best regards, and happily posed for a group  picture with comrades in Shanghai.

Deng Xiaoping looks frail and  motionless. There is very little head movement (either  laterally or horizontally) or upper body movement. When people  talk to him, Deng continues to look straight ahead, and people  have to either lean in close to him or one of his daughters  apparently repeats what is said while leaning close to his ear;  sometimes a daughter speaks to the other person immediately  after Deng speaks, apparently repeating Deng's response.]    This is the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping  joined the Shanghai people in marking the Spring Festival since  1988.    The hall was decorated with flowers and imbued with the air  of spring. In high spirit and in firm strides, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, with a smile, walked toward to the comrades in  Shanghai and shook their hands cordially one by one. [video  continues to show medium close-ups of Deng Xiaoping shaking  hands with well-wishers]    Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee,  and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped forward to express their  sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping.    Comrade Wu Bangguo said: On behalf of the 13 million people  in Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival. I wish you  health and long life; and I wish your whole family happiness.  [video shows Wu Bangguo talking to Deng, Deng speaking and his  daughter, her head very close to Deng's left ear, apparently  repeating Wu's words]    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I wish leading comrades of the  central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a happy  Spring Festival and good health. I wish people in the country a  happy Spring Festival, happy family life, unity, and greater  victories in the new year. [video shows scenes of Deng walking  into a room and being greeted by Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju; Deng  takes very small steps, his daughters have a hand on his back  and at each elbow, and he looks straight ahead with little or no  head or upper body movement]    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: I come to Shanghai once a year  to wish people in Shanghai happy Spring Festival.    Comrade Wu Bangguo said: This is your encouragement for  people in Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the  work in Shanghai.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping happily said: You people in Shanghai  have done a really good job in accomplishing your work. [video  shows Deng Xiaoping and his wife, Zhuo Lin, having a group  picture with 18 officials in Shanghai; Deng looks ahead with  little or no body movement]    In Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great concern for  Shanghai's material and spiritual construction. He fully  endorsed the successes the people in Shanghai have accomplished  over the past year. He said: Shanghai has accomplished its  work very well. Shanghai has special qualities and characters.  Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster.

Deng is framed by his two  daughters, walking with very small steps, with little or no head  and upper body movement]    On 13 December, Shanghai was engulfed by grade six chilly  winds and drizzle. The mercury dropped to about zero degree  Celcius. On the afternoon of that day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  in the company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, inspected Pudong.  Despite the winds and the rain, he ascended Yangpu Bridge to  take a view of the teeming construction projects in Pudong.  After inspecting the two overpasses -- the Pudong Section and  the Loshan Road Longyang Road sections of the inner-ring lines  -- which were completed last year, Comrade Xiaoping [words  indistinct] and said with a smile: Watching these overpasses  today is better than reading books for 100 years. He told  Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: These words are from the  bottom of my heart. [video shows Deng Xiaoping posing for a  group picture with his daughters on either side of him and some  Shanghai officials on a bridge, cutting to show Deng shaking  hands with unidentified officials].    Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping,  holding the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the Yangpu  bridge construction, and praised him, saying: This is a victory  of the working class in Shanghai. My salute to them.    On the eve of New Year's Day, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in the  company of Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, ascended to the top floor of  the New Jinjiang Hotel to look at the brightly illuminated  Shanghai. He said emotionally: Shanghai has changed. [video  shows a large van driving in crowded and brightly illuminated  streets, cutting to show close-ups of Deng shaking hands with  hotel officials and waving momentarily with small hand motions  to people in the foyer]    When the Chinese and foreign tourists marking the New Year  Day saw Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, they could not help  giving him a long applause and expressing their respects and  regards to him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to the  tourists in acknowledgement. Tonight, he also visited the  congested Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the Spring Festival  with them.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very happy when he realized that  the Dayawan Nuclear Station No. 1 generating unit was  successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade  Li Peng to convey his congratulations and his thanks to the  builders, scientists, and technicians of the nuclear station.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHERS DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK  </P> <P> The persistent demand by some San Diego Community College district faculty  members for a financially accountable school district paid off this week when  the teachers reached a tentative settlement of their lawsuit over the  district's unusual nonprofit foundation. The teachers deserve a collective pat  on the back for their zealous protection of public money.  </P> <P> Under the settlement, the foundation will turn over control of its $8-million  endowment to the district's trustees and pay more than $1 million more into the  fund over the next two years. More importantly, the foundation's directors will  resign as overseers of the endowment and relinquish their authority to the  district's elected trustees, who have had no control over the foundation board  for the past three years.  </P> <P> That should end a situation that had created considerable distrust between the  teachers and the district's board over the highly questionable financial  arrangement and its impact on faculty salaries, which historically have been  among the lowest in the state. Ultimately, the dispute ended in court.  </P> <P> Former Chancellor Garland Peed revived the dormant foundation in the early  1980's to serve as a fund-raising arm of the community college district, which  includes 100,000 students at Mesa, Miramar and City colleges. Each year, the  foundation gives half of the endowment interest to the district.  </P> <P> But according to the faculty, the foundation illegally took revenue belonging  to the district and actually competed with the district when it bid on  educational contracts. Even worse, the foundation's books were not open to  faculty and its directors were not elected or accountable to students, faculty  or the public.  </P> <P> Then there were the unusual honorariums that the foundation paid to legislators  for speaking engagements. In 1986, the foundation gave out $33,860 -- $10,000  to State Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) alone.  </P> <P> In 1988, Peed, who was heading both the district and the foundation, announced  that he would give up his duties with the school system to lead the foundation.  He later left to head a community college in Cupertino.  </P> <P> The public -- and the community college district -- will be served best by an  end to the unseemly arrangement with the foundation. Public agency money  belongs under the control of elected trustees, who will be wise to spend it on  student and teacher needs instead of political lobbying.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Groupe Bull, NEC close to accord on mainframes GROUPE Bull, the state-owned french computer manufacturer, said yesterday it was close to completing an agreement with NEC of Japan on collaboration in mainframe computers. The agreement, expected to be announced in September, will represent a strengthening of ties between the two groups. NEC owns 4.3 per cent of the loss-making French computer group, and the two have had a technological partnership for more than 10 years. An accord on mainframe computers would also be a further step in Bull's strategy of extending alliances with other international manufacturers. This strategy is aimed at developing models and expanding its presence in international markets. Last month, Bull signed an agreement with Packard Bell of the US for the development and manufacture of personal computers. The French computer company is in talks with its government on a strategy to reduce its losses. Last year, Bull suffered losses of FFr4.7bn (Dollars 800m). Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has said the state cannot continue to fund the deficit.</p>

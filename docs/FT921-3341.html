			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: A poet of contradictions JAMES THOMSON 1700-1748: A LIFE by James Sambrook Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 40, 332 pages JAMES THOMSON earned immense fame in the 18th century as a result of his poem The Seasons, a work full of landscape description and wide-ranging speculation about the natural sciences, topography, and human history; he is now relatively neglected. The success of The Seasons stemmed to a large degree from its role in contributing towards the fashion for sensibility - the cultivation of reflective, tranquil sentiment rather than unruly passion. This 'sentimental' style has often provoked great irritation; Horace Walpole wittily explains his preference for more full-blooded poetry by the malicious analogy: 'I had rather be put into the roundhouse for a wrong-headed quarrel, than sup quietly at eight o'clock with my grandmother.' In the light of Thomson's literary reputation, James Sambrook's account of his life and character makes amusing reading. Sambrook emphasises the contrast between the poet's literary idealisations of women and his ribaldry in conversations with men. When the poet apparently falls in love for the first time, in his forties, the biography neatly juxtaposes his letters and poems to the adored 'Amanda', expressing 'the utmost Ardor, the most perfect Esteem, and inexpressible Tenderness', with a contemporary description of a mild dispute between them: 'she pulled off his wig and threw it on the ground, and he threw a glass of punch at her.' Sambrook also cites accounts of Thomson's excesses in food and drink, his 'negligence over money', and above all his slothfulness; his poem The Castle of Indolence was written in a spirit of ironic self-reproach. Many anecdotes stress his languorous habits: he was once reportedly 'seen lounging round Lord Burlington's garden, with his hands in his waistcoat pockets, biting off the sunny sides of the peaches'. An acquaintance, finding him still in bed at two in the afternoon, asked the reason why: 'Mon', replied he, 'I had no motive to rise.' The side of Thomson which the biography portrays most fully is his role as a participant in London literary life: in 1725 the poet, in his mid-twenties, left his native Scotland for the opportunities and diversions of the capital. For a while, he took a job as a tutor: 'a low task you know not so suitable to my temper'. By cultivating rich and influential patrons, he managed to go on the Grand Tour as travelling companion to a young aristocrat, and later gained two useful sinecures. In noting Thomson's alliances with various Whig patrons, Sambrook offers an account of the poet's role as a public man, actively involved in political machination. Oddly, however, the examination of political themes in Thomson's poetry is usually restricted either to the poet's allusions to the current situation, or to his patriotic vision of Britain as a land of liberty and industry. (Thomson's masque Alfred, written in collaboration with his fellow-Scotsman David Mallet, contains the song 'Rule Britannia'.) The biography offers none of the more ambitious analysis of Thomson's view of British society, and of the role of the wise and virtuous statesman, which is found in the writings of critics such as John Barrell. Nonetheless, this study of Thomson is a work of distinguished scholarship, produced in the face of a lack of detailed information about the the poet's life. Its main drawback is a tendency towards understatement; a more ebullient biographer is needed in order to convince a wider readership of the interest of Thomson's poetry.</p>

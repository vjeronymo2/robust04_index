			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur records an eight-month high Buying by public funds, investment trusts and overseas investors countered corporate selling and the Nikkei index gained ground in spite of the higher yen and the overnight decline on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index rose 48.11 to 19,885.38 after a high of 19,961.59 and a low of 19,691.44. The index initially fell on worries which were triggered by the yen's rise against the dollar and by declines in US stock and bond prices. Arbitrage unwinding coupled with selling by companies looking to boost their interim earnings weighed on prices. However, postal savings and postal insurance, together with investment trust funds, lifted the index in the afternoon. The US currency closed below the Y98 level for the first time in two months in spite of heavy Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention. The dollar's weakness was triggered by the larger than expected US trade deficit figures released on Tuesday. Volume rose to 380m shares against 342m. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 4.85 to 1,585.96, while the Nikkei 300 rose 0.88 to 289.84. Advances led declines 546 to 458, with 182 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.00 to 1,296.33. Large capital steels were traded actively amid profit taking by corporate investors and buying by public funds and overseas investors. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y388 after hitting a year's high of Y390 and NKK added Y5 to Y285. Semiconductor related stocks were higher. Oki Electric rose Y16 to Y788. The company had said earlier this week that its pre-tax profit would rise to a record Y30bn thanks to firm sales of semiconductors and its rationalisation programme. Brokers were mixed. Yamaichi Securities fell Y11 to Y773 and Nikko retreated Y10 to Y1,110 while Nomura Securities gained Y10 to Y2,120. After the market closed, the Big Four and second tier brokers announced downward revisions of interim earnings due to the lower than expected trading volume on the Tokyo stock market. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 107.97 to 22,089.58 in volume of 462.7m shares. Roundup Wall Street's overnight fall dampened the mood in much of the region although there were exceptions. Hong Kong and Seoul were closed for public holidays. KUALA LUMPUR was spurred to an eight-month high by gains in key blue chip stocks, although the broader market was easier as investors locked in profits. The composite index closed 5.49 higher at 1,191.14, but falls led rises 287 to 156. Volume was a heavy 585m shares as retail investors swarmed into rumour-driven stocks. MBf Capital again led the pack on takeover rumours, adding another 22 cents to MDollars 4.20 in volume of 50.9m shares. Berjaya South Island jumped MDollars 9.30 or 62 per cent to MDollars 24.0, after Tuesday's MDollars 2.70 advance, amid talk of a water sewage project. SHANGHAI's volatile A share index surged 6.2 per cent in a technical rebound after the heavy losses of the previous six sessions. The index put on 58.31, through the 1,000 level, to finish at 1,003.22 in turnover of Yn3.92bn. The day's star performer was Fuzhou Dong Jie Kou Department Store, up Yn1.90 or 17.6 per cent to Yn12.68 in huge volume of 7.12m shares. Shanghai's B share index edged up 0.40 to 83.76 on very thin volume. Shenzhen's A share index rose 10.51 or 4.9 per cent, to 227.04 but the B market halted trading for the public holiday in Hong Kong. BANGKOK rebounded from early falls amid buying of finance and communications issues. The SET index closed 1.93 higher at 1,531.98 after falling as low as 1,506.90. Securities One soared Bt56 to Bt884 after announcing a capital increase. SYDNEY was lower in line with Wall Street's overnight decline, and the All Ordinaries index dropped 18.5 to 2,026.6, its lowest closing level since July 14. The media sector recorded heavy falls with News Corp 24 cents lower at ADollars 8.21 after its ADRs fell in New York. TAIPEI finished lower in active trade amid profit-taking on financials and worries about uncertainty in overseas financial markets. The weighted index ended 48.80 lower at 6,999.44, off a 7,092.06 high. Turnover was TDollars 64.3bn. Elitegroup Computer rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 51 on its debut. MANILA was steady with mining issues rising to counter the downtrend in commercial issues. The composite index settled 0.27 up at 2,920.46 in volume that dropped to 2.5bn shares from Tuesday's 3.1bn. Philex Mining led the mining issue rally as its share price jumped 3.9 per cent to 2.70 pesos. BOMBAY was led ahead by late buying by domestic mutual funds, which reversed an easier trend during the first half of the session as Calcutta-based traders liquidated holdings on the last day of their fortnightly account. The BSE 30 share index, which had lost more than 120 points in the previous two sessions, picked up 18.73 to 4,507.11.

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The many faces of a tax-efficient investment Peps: the options. Every UK resident aged over 18 is allowed to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a year in a general Personal Equity Plan, and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep, so a couple can invest up to a joint total of Pounds 18,000 a tax year. way. You can only start one of each type of Pep a year but you can choose different managers for the general and single company plans. The Pep investments must be predominantly based in equities and in European community investments. This means that if you choose to invest in a collective fund, less than 50 per cent of its investments can be bonds or gilts, or in shares outside the EC. A maximum of Pounds 1,500 a year can be invested in funds, such as a Japanese unit trust, which do not qualify in this way. General Peps: Managed. These are plans operated by stockbrokers, financial advisers or fund management groups. You give them the discretion to invest in a range of shares, investment trusts and unit trusts. Performance statistics for these Peps are difficult to obtain, so often the only information you can base your choice on is their charges or the perromance of another fund by its manager. Investment trust. These are usually run by investment trust management companies, and use a Pep to invest one investment trust, or several managed by the same group. You can invest through regular savings schemes. There are likely to be extra charges for Peps, so basic rate taxpayers need to work out carefully whether the charges outweigh the tax benefits. Unit trust. Similar to investment trust Peps, but investing in unit trusts. Savings schemes can be used. There is usually no additional charge for a Pep on top of the up-front and management charges - so if you are going to buy a unit trust, you might as well buy it in Pep form. Self-select. You make your own choice of one or several shares, but the paperwork is handled by a manager, who charges for the service. The level of charges is the main deciding factor, but some managers also offer investment advice. If you wish to transfer shares you already own into a Pep, you must sell them and buy them back again. This 'bed and breakfasting' mayresult in a capital gains tax charge. Corporate. These schemes are organised by a company through an outside manager to encourage employees or other investors to buy its shares. Corporate schemes have the advantage of lower costs, but they are inflexible  -there is no opportunity to switch your investment if it does not perform well. A few corporate Peps also allow investment in some collective funds or other companies' shares on top of the main company's shares. Single company Peps: Particularly useful as a tax shelter for shares transferred from employee share option schemes, or for investors who have already used up their general Pep limit for the year. Only one company's shares can be held at any time, but it is possible to switch between companies. Single company Peps cannot be used to buy unit or investment trusts.</p>

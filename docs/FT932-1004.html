			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Tour operators The stock market was clearly unnerved by the news of an Office of Fair Trading investigation into the package holiday industry, knocking some 4 per cent off the shares of both Airtours and Owners Abroad. The vertical integration rapidly developing between tour operators and travel agents is certainly worth investigation. The uncertainty is whether the outcome will prove a damp squib or a regulatory Catherine wheel. Under the terms of the Fair Trading Act, the competition authorities could recommend any number of measures, such as divestment of travel agencies, transparency of treatment for independent operators, or pre-notification of further acquisitions. Moreover, considerations affecting consumer interest and market structure are likely to prevail over parity of treatment. This could, for example, theoretically result in Airtours being forced to divest recently-acquired agencies leaving Thomson's long-established link with Lunn Poly intact. But although the OFT may be in earnest, there is little evidence the DTI will be similarly minded. Mr Michael Heseltine's brusque dismissal of the OFT's recommendations at the time of the Airtours bid for Owners Abroad suggests the DTI may take some persuading of the case for intervention. This may be especially true given the embarrassing mess it caused in the brewing industry through the implementation of its beer orders. But until such uncertainties are resolved, the quoted tour operators will remain under a cloud, no matter how many tourists they whisk away to sunny beaches.</p>

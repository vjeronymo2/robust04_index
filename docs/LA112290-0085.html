			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOOMED BUILDING TO GET HISTORICAL  EVALUATION  </P> <P> The demolition of Glendale's 61-year-old Public Service Building has been  halted while its historical value and the costs involved in preserving it are  explored.  </P> <P> Glendale's three-member Environmental and Planning Board last Thursday  unanimously ordered the preparation of an environmental impact report on the  building after the Glendale Historical Society and the Los Angeles chapter of  the American Institute of Architects objected to its proposed demolition.  </P> <P> The board -- which consists of Glendale's planning director, public works  director and city attorney -- rejected a staff proposal that the building be  preserved only in photographs and videos.  </P> <P> The panel's decision does not guarantee that the building will be saved, said  David Bobardt, a city planner. But he said the environmental study will  evaluate the building's historical significance and look at ways to keep it in  public or private use.  </P> <P> He said the study will take about eight months to complete.  </P></p>

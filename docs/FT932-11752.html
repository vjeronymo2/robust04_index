			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Engineers urged to establish single body BRITAIN'S 42 professional engineering institutions could be merged into a single body in the second half of the 1990s under controversial proposals unveiled yesterday by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council. The main recommendation is for a new relationship between the council and the professional institutions to be drawn up at the end of this year. Institutions would be grouped into colleges, and the steering group formed by Sir John recommends that the council and institutions should produce a proposal by the end of 1995 to move gradually from the new relationship to a single institution. 'We do believe that a single institution would be a logical step to ensure our overall objectives are met,' Sir John said. Presidents of the four biggest institutions, while 'warmly welcoming' the proposals, said the case for a single engineering institution had yet to be made. However, Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: 'It identifies the main concerns of companies employing engineers, including improving the influence and status of the engineering profession.' Sir John said the profession lacked recognition because it found it hard to speak with a single voice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] International political and financial support to  Croatia depends to a considerable extent on the implementation  of the Washington agreement, Mate Granic, deputy prime minister  and foreign minister, said today in the Parliament's House of  Counties, where he presented his report on current Croatian  foreign policy issues. [passage omitted]    Among other things, he stressed that extensive diplomatic  activities were under way to simultaneously resolve the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and reintegrate the UN protected areas  into the Croatian legal system and to ensure that the sanctions  against Serbia are linked to the progress in the talks on the UN  pretected areas. He described the Vienna talks on the  implementation of the Washington agreement as extremely  important. He also mentioned, as he put it, good relations  between Croatia and its neighboring European countries, and in  particular with the United States, and went on to stress that  the international political and financial support to Croatia  depended to a considerable extent on the implementation of the  Washington agreement. He said that the attempt to destabilize  the Croatian parliament had somewhat affected Croatia's  international position.    [Begin Granic recording] Foreign countries would certainly  welcome a negotiated solution. The deepening of the crisis will  certainly not benefit anyone and will be to the detriment of the  Republic of Croatia. [end recording]    During the question time, Mate Granic said Croatia would  definitely not extend the UN Protection Force's mandate unless  it deployed its forces on Croatian borders with Serbia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent armed provocations and ethnic  cleansing.

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Reports may show bill payment soon LARGE COMPANIES could be required to disclose how quickly they pay their bills in their annual reports from as soon as the end of the year. Under the preferred option in a Department of Trade and Industry consultative document issued yesterday, companies would publish the ratio of trade creditors at the end of the financial year to average purchases during the year. Baroness Denton, the small-firms minister, who announced the document in a parliamentary answer, is seeking responses by March 27 with a view to applying the regulations as soon as possible. That could lead to secondary legislation to implement the change in time for the next annual report of companies with December year-ends. It would apply to large companies as defined in the 1985 Companies Act - those with two or more of: a turnover above Pounds 11.2m, a balance sheet total above Pounds 3.9m, and more than 250 employees. Alternatives put forward include recording when bills are received or invoices dated; and analysing the age of bills.</p>

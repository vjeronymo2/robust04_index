			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke urged to 'repair damage' Today's Budget gives the government an opportunity to 'repair some of the damage' done to people in the West Midlands, Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said in the Dudley West by-election campaign yesterday. But, she added, she had no doubt that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would fail to do so and accused him of being 'completely out of touch' with ordinary people. As she spoke, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was campaigning on behalf of Mr Graham Postles, the Tory candidate in the by-election called following the death of John Blackburn, the sitting MP. In the past five years in the West Midlands alone, she said, there had been a 10 per cent increase in the number of consultants. Junior doctors' hours had been cut by 23 per cent and there had been more than Pounds 124m of capital investment. Mrs Bottomley said everyone who was on a waiting list in the West Midlands on July 1 this year would be treated no later than the end of the financial year. After that no-one would have to wait more than nine months for any operation. The poor have more chance of winning the National Lottery than of gaining tax cuts in today's Budget, the Low Pay Unit said yesterday. The campaign group said that the chancellor might raise income tax 'through the back door' by freezing tax thresholds and allowances. This would draw a further 300,000 of the lowest-paid into the poverty trap, the group said. The Low Pay Unit has called for an increase in tax thresholds above the rate of inflation, a reform of National Insurance contributions, the scrapping of value added tax on fuel and an increase in child benefit. Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'The chancellor has enough revenue to redress the injustice of past tax policy, which has helped to turn Britain into the most unequal nation in Europe.' He added: 'Champagne pay rises and windfall tax cuts for the better off, alongside wage and benefit reductions and tax increases for the poor mean that inequalities are greater than at any time this century.'</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS SHOW INTEREST IN GREENWOOD, REACH AGREEMENT WITH A. C. GREEN  </P> <P> Free-agent forward David Greenwood, who played at UCLA in the 1970s and most  recently was not re-signed by the Denver Nuggets, passed a physical examination  commissioned by the Lakers Friday and may sign with the club before training  camp opens next week in Honolulu.  </P> <P> Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, confirmed that Greenwood, 32, passed  the physical, but the team still is considering other options in its search to  fill retired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's roster spot.  </P> <P> "Greenwood seems to be physically healthy and in shape," West said. "But at  this point, we don't know what we are going to do. We're exploring all the  possibilities. We'll continue to explore (Greenwood's availability). We want to  do something by Monday."  </P> <P> Greenwood, who is 6-feet-9, has played for four National Basketball Assn. teams  and has a career scoring average of 11 points a game. He missed parts of last  season with Denver because of an injured left Achilles' tendon.  </P> <P> West also said the Lakers have reached a tentative agreement with power forward  A.C. Green, a restricted free agent. West said a copy of the contract, which  figures to pay Green more than $1 million for the coming season, has been sent  to Marc Fleisher, Green's New York-based agent.  </P> <P> "I would hope to have (Green's contract) done by Monday," West said.

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / BA goes on offensive in Virgin row SIR COLIN MARSHALL, chairman of British Airways, yesterday denied prior knowledge of the 'dirty tricks' his airline played on Virgin Atlantic Airways, which led to an apology and a Pounds 610,000 payment to Virgin in January. He attacked Virgin's continued pursuit of legal action in courts in London and with the European Community in Brussels and renewed his call for arbitration in the long-running dispute between the two carriers. Sir Colin's account of the Virgin affair was the central plank in his first speech to BA's annual meeting as chairman. 'I did not direct, authorise or implement any improper activities or conduct against Virgin or its chairman. I did not know about them at the time they occurred,' he told the 1,000-plus shareholders. He conceded: 'There had been a few unconnected incidents of conduct by a few British Airways' employees so as to give Virgin cause for concern. Some employees did obtain some information which related mainly to the number of passengers travelling on Virgin flights.' Sir Colin said: 'We do not believe that what was done caused significant damage to Virgin or brought significant benefit to BA.' He argued that Virgin's continued claims consisted only of vague accusations. The new chairman admitted that the Virgin affair and a strike last month by some employees had hurt morale, but that this was now being rebuilt. Sir Colin's intense and strident delivery contrasted with the laconic and sometimes brusque style of his predecessor Lord King at previous meetings. Lord King refrained from commenting on the Virgin affair which had hastened his retirement and sat silently in the front row of yesterday's meeting. He received praise from the platform for his contribution to the company then rose to acknowledge loud shareholder applause. Sir Colin's defence of BA came shortly after Mr Brian Basham, its former public relations consultant, arrived for the meeting saying that Sir Colin should resign. 'He must take responsibility for the actions of his staff,' said Mr Basham, who was sacked as a freelance consultant by BA when the Virgin row broke. Virgin last night rejected Sir Colin Marshall's arbitration proposal. 'We agreed to an arbitration on another dispute in 1990. It is yet to go through four years later,' said the airline.

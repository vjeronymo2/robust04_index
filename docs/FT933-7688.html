			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Tokyo orders blitz against regulations JAPAN'S new coalition government promised yesterday to produce within a month an emergency programme aimed at deregulating the economy. Its intention is both to curb the rise of the yen and ensure that the benefits of the currency's present strength are felt by consumers. Each ministry is being told to identify regulations that could be lifted to achieve these ends - ranging from import barriers to price controls. The electricity power federation last night yielded to official pressure to cut its charges, in order to reflect cheaper imported energy. The initiative, decided at the first meeting yesterday of a special ministerial council on the economy, followed persistent calls for action from industry, which is suffering under the twin burdens of a prolonged slowdown at home and a currency squeeze on export earnings. The move also reflects the wish of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who became prime minister last week and chaired yesterday's meeting, to tilt the balance of economic power in Japan from producer to consumer. His seven-party administration was elected on a platform of political reform, but Mr Masayoshi Takemura, its chief spokesman, acknowledged yesterday that the state of the economy and the foreign exchange markets meant 'we are now snowed under by these daily issues instead'. Mr Hosokawa later met Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, the largest business federation, and agreed the yen had gone further than economic fundamentals justified. The government appeared not yet to have decided whether the measures put in train yesterday, which it said would be ready by September 20, should include a fiscal stimulus. Mr Takemura said only that ministers would seek to ensure that two packages of public works spending and tax cuts, unveiled in the past year by the previous Liberal Democratic government and totalling Y23,900bn (Pounds 157bn), had their desired effect. By contrast, the electric power federation said its plan to cut consumers' bills would put just Y150bn into the economy. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, endorsed the view expressed on Wednesday by Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, that no further cut in the central bank's official discount rate from its present 2.5 per cent was yet needed. Mr Takemura admitted that there were 'wide-ranging viewpoints' at the meeting. Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the economic planning agency, said the EPA would not withdraw a declaration made in June that the economy had bottomed out, although acknowledging 'new unfavourable factors'. These included the dampening effects on consumer spending of a cool summer, as well as the impact on international competitiveness of the yen's further rise. Mr Fujii, citing the same factors, said they made the outlook 'even more austere'. The best way to deal with it was by passing on its benefits to consumers, he added. The yen fell against the dollar after the meeting, closing in Tokyo at Y101.98 after trading as high as Y101.10. It was down Y0.51 on the day.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canadian combination creates new CDollars 20bn unit CANADA'S financial services deregulation, coupled with the long recession and rising competition, have forced the big Desjardins credit union movement to consolidate with the publicly-held Laurentian Group. The newly-formed group will have corporate assets of around CDollars 20bn (USDollars 15.6bn) and a further CDollars 50bn under administration through its subsidiaries. It will rank as Canada's fifth or sixth biggest financial services conglomerate, including units in banking, trust services, life insurance and mortgages. Laurentian had been seeking a strategic partner for more than a year, partly to inject new capital into its life and general insurance unit. Desjardins operates 1,500 banking units, mainly in Quebec, while Laurentian Bank operates in both Quebec and Ontario. Desjardins will have majority control of the new Desjardins Laurentian Financial Corp, taking in the financial services units of both groups. However, Laurentian General, a property and casualty insurer, is excepted from the deal. Laurentian Group's 50 per cent holding in this unit is being sold to its partner, La Victoire of France, for an undisclosed sum. The French company paid about CDollars 50m for its 50 per cent share in 1990. Both Mr Claude Beland, head of Desjardins, and Mr Jacques Droin, chairman of Laurentian, said the consolidation had been dictated by heightened competition resulting from globalisation of financial markets. The two main life insurance subsidiaries of Desjardins and Laurentian will be merged, although this arrangement excludes Imperial Life in Toronto. Laurentian Group minority shareholders will receive a combination of cash and common shares of Desjardins Laurentian Financial.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME, SUNS DON'T SLACKEN PACE;  </P> <P> WESTERN CONFERENCE: AFTER WASTING 22-POINT LEAD IN GAME 2 LOSS AT PORTLAND,  THEY TAKE A 46-POINT LEAD AND CRUISE AT PHOENIX, 123-89.  </P> <P> It would not happen again, or so the Phoenix Suns hoped. Another 22-point lead  against the Portland Trail Blazers, this time by the end of the first quarter  here Friday night, would not be lost.  </P> <P> It turns out they didn't have to hold that lead.  </P> <P> No, it grew to 28 by halftime, then 30, then 40 before finally hitting a high  mark of 46 points late in the third quarter of a 123-89 victory over the Trail  Blazers in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.  </P> <P> Two days ago, the concern was whether the Suns could recover after wasting a  22-point lead and losing Game 2 in Portland. Now, the question is whether the  Trail Blazers will be the demoralized team.  </P> <P> Portland leads the series, two games to one, with Game 4 here Sunday. But the  Suns may be in control.  </P> <P> "Everybody knew what happened the other night," Sun guard Jeff Hornacek said.  "That was a good lesson for us never, never to let up. But that happens to  teams in the playoffs. You lose leads."  </P> <P> This blowout, which must have reminded Trail Blazer forward Buck Williams of  his days as a New Jersey Net, was not a record. But only because Sun Coach  Cotton Fitzsimmons cleared the bench in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Phoenix, which made 61% of its shots, fell short of a franchise playoff record  for margin of victory. The Suns beat the Golden State Warriors by 37 points  last season.  </P> <P> The Suns' starters made a combined 35 of 42 shots (83.3%). Tom Chambers had 24  points, guards Hornacek and Kevin Johnson had 17 each and power forward Kurt  Rambis got 14 on six-for-six shooting. Center Mark West scored eight of his  nine points in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "We wanted to play every single quarter like it was 0-0," Kevin Johnson said.  </P> <P> Fitzsimmons was asked if he had ever seen his starters make 83% of their shots  in a game before.  </P> <P> "I probably have been involved in a game like that, but it had to be in junior  college where nobody ever plays defense," Fitzsimmons said.  </P> <P> Fitzsimmons wanted it known he was not comparing the Trail Blazers to a junior  college team or knocking Portland's defensive effort.  </P> <P> But the Trail Blazers knocked themselves.  </P> <P> "We just played horribly," said Clyde Drexler, who made only five of 14 shots.  "We know we're a better team than that."  </P> <P> But, on the road in their last two playoff series, the Trail Blazers have  resembled the Sacramento Kings in February, folding at the first hint of a  deficit. In their last four road playoff games, the Trail Blazers have lost by  an average of 20.4 points.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well offensively -- that was our biggest breakdown," said Trail  Blazer guard Terry Porter, who made two of eight shots and had six points.  </P> <P> "Our offense made their offense look great because we missed so many shots we  got their break going."  </P> <P> The Suns took a we-told-you-so attitude about not letting down after Game 2.  </P> <P> "You hear all kinds of things after our game up there," Hornacek said of Game  2.  </P> <P> "People said we were doubting ourselves. But, as players, you just go out and  play the game. You don't worry about the last one."  </P> <P> Instead, the Suns made strategic adjustments. Fitzsimmons said the key was a  multifaceted offense.  </P> <P> That was evident in the first four minutes, when the Suns took an 18-4 lead.  West scored inside, Chambers made a jump shot, Kevin Johnson made free throws  after driving, Rambis scored inside and Chambers scored twice off fast breaks.  </P> <P> "I thought we had them both games up there," said Chambers, who made 11 of 13  shots in only 26 minutes.  </P> <P> "But we allowed them to come back. Tonight, we did not allow that."  </P> <P> Just as Fitzsimmons scoffed at the notion his Suns would fold after the Game 2  loss, Portland Coach Rick Adelman vowed his team would not wilt, despite making  36.3% of their shots and playing only token defense.  </P> <P> "They dominated the game in every way," Adelman said. "But I don't care how  many points you get beat by. The series is still 2-1, with us ahead."  </P> <P> Friday, that was the only statistic the Trail Blazers could embrace.  </P> <P> Western Conference Notes  </P> <P> Sun guard Eddie Johnson has renewed his vow of silence for the third  consecutive playoff series. But Johnson has done so much explaining about why  he is not talking with the media it might be easier for him to answer  questions. "You guys are going to write whatever you're going to anyway,  whether I talk or not," Johnson told reporters. "I have my job to do. I need to  concentrate." . . . Before Friday night's game, Sun forward Tom Chambers had an  0-10 record in Western Conference finals. Chambers was a member of the 1986-87  Seattle SuperSonics that lost four consecutive games to the Lakers. He was with  the Suns last season, when they lost four in a row to the Lakers. And the Suns  lost the first two games of this series.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong achieved a  GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of 5.5 percent in 1993  and is expected to retain the same economic growth in 1994, the  Financial Secretary Hamish MacLeod said here today.    Delivering the 1994-95 budget in the Legislative Council  this  afternoon, the financial secretary said inflation rate in 1994  will also keep to an average of around 8.5 percent in 1994, the  same as it was in 1993.    The financial secretary said GDP per head in Hong Kong in  1993 reached 18,500 U.S. dollars in 1993 and is expected to  reach 20,600 U.S. dollars in 1994.    Expressing confidence about the prospects for 1994, Sir  Hamish said Hong Kong can look forward to better economic  prospects in its major overseas markets, and to continued the  high growth in the region. "Above all, we have a vital role to  play in China's economic modernization," he said.    "Increasingly, the key to our future economic success will  lie in our ability to sell our services to the world, to the  region, and above all to the Chinese economy," he said.    The financial secretary said that the successful conclusion  of the Uruguay Round and the improved prospects in major  overseas markets will also help boost trade potentials.    Speaking of problems in Hong Kong's economic development,  the  financial secretary said, "inflation remains a difficult  challenge."    "Property prices are rising to increasingly uncomfortable  levels because of acute shortage of land combined with growing  prosperity and the understandable ambition of families to own  their own homes," he said.    The financial secretary proposed a number of income tax  concessions which would enable about 420,000 taxpayers, or a  quarter of the total, to drop out of the tax net entirely.</p>

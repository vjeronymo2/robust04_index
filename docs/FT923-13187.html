			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Aitken declines to Pounds 2.33m AITKEN HUME International, the banking and financial services group, turned in a reduced pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.33m for the year to March 31. This was cut from Pounds 3.01m last time, when the accounts were qualified as a result of a dispute over payments due in connection with the acquisition of the Bachmann Group, a Guernsey-based financial services company. The 1992 pre-tax figure was struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 1.09m to reward management of Aitken's US fund management arm for its improved performance. This charge was mitigated by a refund of surplus funds amounting to Pounds 510,000 from its UK pension scheme. The US arm made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.3m), whereas the UK and Channel Islands banking activities, hit by bad debts, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 635,000 against profits of Pounds 634,000 last time. The accounts included the results of the Bachmann group - a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.74m) - up to its disposal in March this year. Disposal costs of Bachmann were taken as an extraordinary debit of Pounds 12.9m, leaving the group with an attributable loss of Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 1.9m profit). Losses per share were 19.84p against earnings of 3.01p. There is no final dividend (0.5p), giving a reduced total of 0.5p (1p).</p>

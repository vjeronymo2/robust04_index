Director General Kubota indicated that she was  thinking in a forward-looking manner about the study on  including macroeconomic plans, telling reporters, "We are now at  a stage where we must come up with all possible alternatives."    Kubota did not speak plainly about the contents of the  possible macroeconomic plans, but she noted, "the need for tax  cuts and the expansion of domestic demand have been pointed out;  of course, then there is the problem of the current-accounts  surplus." Adding "I think we should discuss these things in a  little more orderly manner," she indicated the likelihood that  these issues will be considered as the plans.</p>

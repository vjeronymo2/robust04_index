			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Delta shares fallas group douses recovery hopes SHARES in Delta fell 8 per cent after the UK cables and engineering group became the latest industrial company to disappoint the market's hopes of recovery. The group said: 'The UK recovery as far as manufacturing is concerned remains more anaemic than many observers suggest, and activity in continental Europe has yet to see the benefit of progressive interest rate reductions.' Delta has cut its workforce by a third since 1989 and had been identified as one of the companies best placed to benefit from any upturn. The shares were marked up sharply in the spring, but yesterday fell 43p to 511p after the group announced a small drop in profits. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said that in April he had seen renewed signs of a slow, if patchy, recovery except in continental Europe: 'This pattern has persisted with continental European markets remaining depressed and any recovery in the UK and Australia being limited to specific sectors of the economy.' Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 30.97m to Pounds 29.11m in the six months to July 3, in spite of a 6 per cent increase in sales, from Pounds 402m to Pounds 428m. Mr Wilson said exports from the UK rose by 14 per cent from the already high levels reached last year to a new record of Pounds 83.8m, greatly helping to offset low domestic demand. Currency translation added Pounds 1.25m to the profits figure. Cables continued to suffer from volatile markets and severe price competition, with operating profits down from Pounds 5.6m to to Pounds 5.4m. However, restructuring improved the performance at Surprenant, Delta's US cable subsidiary, which suffered from defence cuts. Lower demand across continental Europe reduced the profitability of the engineering division from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 10.4m, but industrial services increased profits to Pounds 9.1m (from Pounds 8.4m), as did circuit protection, to Pounds 8.1m from Pounds 7.4m. Group gearing rose slightly, from 26 to 28 per cent. Interest payments rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 3.9m. Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said Delta was continuing to invest in new products and was interested in further acquisitions, particularly in the US. Earnings per share dipped to 12.5p (from 12.7p), but the interim dividend was held at 4.2p. Lex, Page 26</p>

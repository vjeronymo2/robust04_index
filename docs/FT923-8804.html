			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Strikes halt seven BA flights SEVEN British Airways flights to European destinations were cancelled yesterday after cabin-crew members of the TGWU general union held lightning strikes at Manchester and Birmingham airports. BA said all passengers affected by the two-hour early-morning stoppages were accommodated on other services. There had been some delays. The TGWU regretted any inconvenience to passengers and said the action followed the breakdown late on Wednesday night of talks over new pay and conditions. BA denied that the talks had broken down and said they had been adjourned indefinitely. The dispute arose over BA's attempt to improve the profitability of its European and domestic services by reorganising them in a subsidiary company, BA Regional. The reorganisation meant new terms and conditions for staff, including 1,000 cabin crew who face pay cuts of about Pounds 2,000 a year on salaries of Pounds 14,000. BA said union leaders agreed to the move and that cabin crews then rejected it. The TGWU said it only agreed to the principle of a new company.</p>

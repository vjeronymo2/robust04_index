			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Chrysler Corp., one of many advertisers to yank its ads from NBC's  titillating "Nightingales" series, has now pledged to sponsor the show if it is  renewed in the fall. Chrysler's decision follows producer Aaron Spelling's vow  last week to clean up "Nightingales" in cooperation with the American Nursing  Assn. Spelling and series star Suzanne Pleshette have both expressed fears that  NBC might ax the show to avoid controversy. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

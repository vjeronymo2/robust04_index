			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TENN. CITY FLOODED; DRIVER KILLED  </P> <P> Relentless rain sent a creek roaring from its banks through the center of  Lebanon early today, killing a woman driver, trapping dozens of families in  flooded homes and sweeping away fire trucks on rescue missions.  </P> <P> The rampaging Sinking Creek carried away one motorist who ignored police  warnings and drove her car into the racing water two blocks from Lebanon's  public square, police dispatcher Neal Blackburn said. Her body was recovered.  </P> <P> More than 5 inches of rain fell overnight around Lebanon, 25 miles east of  Nashville, and forecasters warned of more downpours through tonight.  </P></p>

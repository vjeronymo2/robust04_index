Application Contents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An eligible applicant must submit an application that includes the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The State's comments on the application. The local partnership serving a higher poverty area must submit its application to the State for review and comment before submitting the application to the Department. Many States have designated a State School-to-Work Opportunities contact. Applicants should call the office of their Governor for the name of the School-to-Work Opportunities contact. The Departments expect that all State School-to-Work Opportunities team members (e.g., the Governor; the State educational agency; the State agency officials responsible for economic development, employment, job training, and postsecondary education; and other appropriate officials on the State team) will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on the local partnership's application. Of particular importance to the Departments are the State's comments on the consistency of the local partnership's planned activities with the State's plans for a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system and the relationship of any proposed activities with other local plans, especially where the grant applicant is not an identified local partnership within the State system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's comments must be included in the local partnership's application; however, the local partnership may submit the application without State comment if proof of receipt by the State office is provided that the State was given the opportunity to comment, but did not do so within ten (10) days of receiving the request. A State's written comments received by the Department after this time will still be given consideration, if received within ten (10) days of the closing date for receipt of applications in order to be considered, although the local partnership will no longer be responsible for the submission of the State's comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

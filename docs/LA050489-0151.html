			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> INTERSECTION STUDY OKD  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, this week decided to  allocate $20,000 for a study the agency hopes will lead to an innovative and  relatively inexpensive design for the Slauson Avenue/Marina Freeway  intersection.  </P> <P> The agency has been working for several years on plans for a flyover, or  viaduct, at the intersection that would cut delays caused by vehicles turning  left onto Slauson at the end of the freeway. City staff members said  preliminary estimates for the cost of such a project run from $8 million to $9  million.  </P> <P> The conceptual study approved by the agency calls for a design for the  intersection that would keep all traffic on the same level, yet improve traffic  flow while permitting left-hand turns. The cost of implementing the design, if  feasible, would be less than $1 million, according to an agency report.  </P> <P> A representative from F. Mier &amp; Associates, which will prepare the study,  said the company is working on a similar design for two intersections in New  York City and has a patent pending on the concept.  </P></p>

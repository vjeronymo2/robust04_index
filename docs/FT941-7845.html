			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / BR to compete for service franchises British Rail plans to take an active part in bidding for franchises for parts of its own network, it emerged yesterday. It had previously been widely assumed that BR would have a passive role, buying parts of the network for which there were no other bidders. BR will still have to satisfy Mr Roger Salmon, the franchise director, who will oversee the bidding process, that it is not misusing its powers to bid to run railway services. However it plans to remain an active operator of train services. 'The view of the BR board is that it will bid where it can and seek to make services profitable,' BR said. 'We will bid where we are allowed and where it makes commercial sense. We will positively go out there and won't get franchises by default.' BR takes the view that its long experience of running the railway network will put it in a strong position to provide value for money from any franchises it wins. 'It would be irresponsible not to bid, knowing we were the most experienced,' it said. BR's plans to bid for franchises appear to have been fortified by a belief that there will not be many bidders. The first franchise, for the Gatwick Express airport service, is due to be offered for sale at the end of 1994 with a further seven expected to go on sale in 1995. When the government framed the railways bill it excluded BR from bidding for franchises because this would place management teams keen to stage buy-outs in a very difficult position. Last-minute opposition in the House of Lords, however, led to an amendment which allowed BR to bid if no credible private-sector bidder emerged. In an apparent attempt to defuse criticism from managers who might want to stage buy-outs, BR said that if it won any franchises it would operate them commercially before selling them on to management buy-out teams or to private buyers. Mr Salmon said he would consider any bid for a franchise seriously but he did not think that BR would be permitted to bid in the early stages of the auction. 'In the early days I would expect there to be buy-out bidders who would have difficulty bidding against their own employer so I would be inclined to resist a BR bid.' Mr Salmon said there had been no change in his office's policy towards bidders but he would be opposed to BR bids if they discouraged other bidders and reduced competition for a franchise. He said he would have no objection to BR selling on a franchise to an acceptable purchaser.</p>

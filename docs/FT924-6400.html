			<p>921121 FT  21 NOV 92 / Ninth plea for freedom fails MR Lorrain Osman, the banker who is Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, failed yesterday in his ninth court move to avoid extradition to Hong Kong for trial on fraud charges. Two High Court judges refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus and accused him of taking the action 'to filibuster'. Mr Osman has been fighting extradition for five years.</p>

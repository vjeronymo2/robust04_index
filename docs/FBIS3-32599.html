"I do not believe the country's positive image abroad has  been harmed. Undoubtedly the Codelco affair is significant and  serious, but it is hardly fair to see it as some sort of  collapse. It would be a gross exaggeration to do so. As I see  it, Codelco is not broke and the country is operating normally."    Krauss categorically stated that no human rights have been  violated in Chile, contrary to what a U.S. Department of State  report has claimed.    "Human rights are most definitely respected in Chile. I do  not believe that any Chilean or foreigner who truly knows how  things are here could say that human rights are violated in  Chile. Any resident of this country who may feel that his or  somebody else's human rights have been violated is free to go to  court."    Krauss explained that in any democratic state violations  must  be reported to the courts, not to the government.</p>

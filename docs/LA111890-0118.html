			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> APHORISMS by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, translated by R. J. Holingdale  (Penguin: $7.95) This anthology contains more than 1,000 aphorisms the German  philosopher jotted in a series of notebooks between 1769 and his death in 1799.  Goethe, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche all praised Lichtenberg's work, but it's  difficult to understand why.  </P> <P> Many of these odd bits of prose read more like incomplete thoughts ("Never  before had a mind come to a more majestic halt.") or commonplaces than maxims  ("However did men arrive at the concept of freedom? It was a great idea."). The  reader looks in vain for the insight of Montaigne, the devastating clarity of  La Rochefoucauld or the thought-provoking paradoxes of Wilde. These aphorisms  may have lost something in the translation, but their general shallowness  suggests that they lost it in the original. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

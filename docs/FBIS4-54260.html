			<p>BFN     [Text] The Malaysian Government is currently monitoring in  detail the British media's change of attitude toward Malaysia.  Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, minister of international trade and  industry, said this to British Trade Minister Mr. Richard  Needham, who called on her in her office this afternoon.    Speaking to reporters, Datuk Sri Dr. Rafidah said Mr.  Needham, who also called on the prime minister, made a long-term  proposal aimed at further enhancing Malaysia-Britain relations  because Britian considers Malaysia an important trading partner.    Meanwhile, during her meeting with Mr. Peter Sutherland,  chief director of GATT agreements, she said they agreed that the  international community is uneasy over the U.S. Congress'  reluctance to approve the agreement which was signed in  Marrakech, Morocco. The U.S. action in delaying the approval  could create new problems which could result in the dissolution  of the decision reached at the Uruguay Round. This would  negatively affect all trading nations.</p>

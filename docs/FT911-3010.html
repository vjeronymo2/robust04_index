			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Helping the homeless - What's New? / . . . with a possible 40% return THE ASSURED-tenancy Business Expansion Scheme survived the Budget without a scratch. Most advisers had expected these relatively low-risk BES investments to come under the hammer. So all the better for House the Homeless of London II, which has launched its second assured-tenancy scheme. It has two aims: one, to ameliorate the plight of homeless in the capital and; two, to guarantee a 40 per cent return on investments. The scheme is run in conjunction with the Peabody Trust, a registered charity, founded in 1862. House the Homeless will buy vacant properties on a leasehold basis, letting them to the homeless. At the end of five years, the Peabody Trust guarantees to buy the properties at 140 per cent of the asking price. The risks? As with most assured tenancies, everything hinges on the viability of the prospective purchaser. 'Peabody Trust has a property portfolio of just under Pounds 1bn and gets grant of millions of pounds from the government every year,' says Keith Turpin, of Touche Ross, financial advisers to House the Homeless of London. But no matter how profitable the company, there is no guarantee that a change of government will not see off assured tenancy schemes. A sobering thought, with a general election due next year, if not this. The biggest Budget boost for the savings industry was aimed at friendly societies - and children, says Mark Rittner, of financial advisers Rathbone Brothers. In other investments, 'if a parent makes a gift to a child, the income on that gift is attributed to the parent and taxable. In friendly societies, however, the income is solely attributed to the child and tax-free,' says Mr Rittner. This year, the chancellor raised the annual tax-free investment level in friendly societies from Pounds 150 to Pounds 200, and revived the right to issue children's life policies on a tax-exempt basis. The government imposed a quota restriction on life policies for children in 1985, the effect of which was to stop many friendly societies from issuing them. 'We are particularly thrilled,' said Peter Gray, general manager of Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society. 'And we are definitely bringing back a Baby Bond (a bond written on the life of the child, which can be redeemed at a certain age or continued indefinitely).' Tunbridge Wells Equitable offers two types of baby bond - a traditional with-profits policy, and a unit-linked one based almost exclusively in equities. Clive Scott-Hopkins, of independent advisers Towry Law, recommends Tunbridge Wells's with profits contract: 'It's very competitive and has been one of the top 10 performers for years.' While providing a nest-egg for children is a good idea, and the friendly-society route a relatively affordable one, parents would do well also to plan for education. The average annual fees for independent boarding schools in 1990 was Pounds 6,000, according to statistics from the Independent Schools Information Service. For independent day schools, the figure stood at Pounds 3,300. Educational trusts are a route to be recommended only if you are sure the money will be used for school fees, and as long as they retain their charitable status. These conditions met, then Save and Prosper and the School Fees Insurance Agency have unusual features in their schemes. A lump-sum buys an annuity to provide termly payments. Although the yields on this investment are relatively low, income tax, which is usually deducted from the taxable element of the annuity payments, can be reclaimed. Parents wishing to provide for their children's future would also be well advised to examine ways of minimising inheritance tax. M &amp; G's Estate Protection Plan - a life policy written under trust  - was named the winner of the Financial Adviser's product of the year award for its user-friendly and flexible approach. (Financial Adviser is a weekly newspaper for financial intermediaries, published by the FT). At its simplest, the plan sets up a trust outside the client's estate, designed to pay the inheritance tax when it falls due, says David Druce, life product development manager of M&amp;G. The premiums on the life policy can be paid in either monthly or annual instalments - or, unusually, in a lump sum. M &amp; G also produces an easy-to-understand inheritance tax guide, which was part of the package commended by Financial Adviser judges.</p>

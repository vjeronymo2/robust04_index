			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's address by President Lech Walesa; place and date </F> not given -- recorded]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: 1993 is receding into the  past and becoming a part of history. It is not possible now to  know how it will be recorded or how the nation will remembered  it. To a large extent, it will depend on its background in  light of subsequent years. For now, we still lack the necessary  distance for a thorough examination and a fair assessment.    The passing year was rich in important events. It was a time  of disputes and emotions, of thorough political reshuffles. The  September elections changed the political configuration of the  parliament. They handed over the helm of government to the left  wing. They closed the first chapter in the history of the Third  Republic, the chapter whose substance and form had been  fashioned by political forces originating from Solidarity. The  elections brought them the bitterness of defeat. Their actions  and efforts did not get the voters' approval. I am convinced  that time will correct this opinion and do them justice.    Once the memory of things which are transitory in the lives  of peoples fades, the true dimension of the achievements will  become clearer--the undeniable achievements that have changed  the face of Poland.    The passing year was a year of disappointments but also of  hopes. Our hopes came from a variety of sources. For some  people these were the economic results heralding the beginning  of growth, the overcoming of the economic collapse. For other  people these were the political changes that have been carried  out. These sources need not be mutually exclusive.    I wish all of us to be able to receive hope from both of  them  in the coming year. May the new team not disappoint those for  whom it was their hope. May it dispel the fears of those for  whom it was a denial of hope. May it be bold but also prudent.  While improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the state,  may it not dampen its citizens' enterprise and initiative, and,  while improving things that need improvement, not destroy the  things that have started to bear fruit.    The year that has passed was also a year of promises. That  is a natural thing in an election year. Now comes the time of  their verification. We have to change from electoral poetry to  prose of governance. The next few months will show whether the  force of words is backed by a real force of ideas and  implementation.    So may the year of promises not be followed by a year of  disappointment. I wish the people wisdom of their rulers. I  wish the country peace and success. I wish the state  prosperity. May the year we are going to greet in a few hours'  time be happy and more prosperous.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> MAAZEL LEADS ORCHESTRE NATIONAL DE FRANCE AT UCLA  </P> <P> Much has been written about the national characteristics of orchestras, most of  it on the level of casual stereotypes rather than serious analysis. Here to  open the ears of doubters about French orchestras -- and to buoy admirers -- is  Lorin Maazel and the Orchestre National de France, back almost three years to  the day since their last local appearance.  </P> <P> Maazel's program, Sunday evening at Royce Hall, UCLA, was certainly a paragon  of typecasting -- familiar snippets from Berlioz, Debussy and Roussel, plus  Messiaen's "Les offrandes oubliees." An encore? The Farandole from Bizet's  "L'Arlesienne" music.  </P> <P> There was variety and abundant opportunities for orchestral glory on that  agenda, if not much occasion for probing from the podium. The weightiest piece  was the opening Messiaen, and there Maazel opted for detachment, divorcing the  sounds from the composer's mystical passion in a cool, quick and impersonal  performance.  </P> <P> Maazel reserved his emotional and psychological insights for the love music  from Berlioz's "Romeo et Juliette," in an expansively developed account of  great sincerity and sonic beauty. He prefaced it with a gossamer Queen Mab  scherzo and followed it with Romeo's soulful agitations and the Capulet's  party, both clearly defined.  </P> <P> Parties and processions served Maazel and company well Sunday, with crisp,  colorful, thoroughly physical performances of the Second Suite from Roussel's  "Bacchus et Ariane," and Fetes from Debussy's "Nocturnes." If their abilities  in moody soundscapes needed testimony, there was an evocative Nuages from  "Nocturnes."  </P> <P> The orchestra proved itself again an alert, idiosyncratic and unanimous  ensemble of balance and sheen, capable of a great noise and subtle murmurs.  Occasionally, it sounded a bit thin on top, and thick around the middle, but  the sectional and individual solos were brilliantly realized, particularly the  distinguished lyric efforts of principal violist Tasso Adamopoulous.

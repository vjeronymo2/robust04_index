			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AXL ROSE URGES A TEST OF TRUTH  </P> <P> Singer Axl Rose today challenged a West Hollywood neighbor he allegedly hit  with an empty wine bottle to take a lie detector test about the incident.  </P> <P> Prosecutors are expected to decide Thursday whether to try Rose, the lead  singer of the rock 'n' roll band Guns 'N Roses, on felony charges stemming from  the Oct. 30 incident.  </P> <P> In a statement released today by Geffen Records, Rose's record label, the  singer said he passed a polygraph test when telling his version of his  confrontation with Gabriela Kantor, 37, and that "my truth rating was so high  there wasn't room for doubt."  </P> <P> Now Rose is offering Kantor, whom he describes as an obsessed fan, the chance  to take a similar test at his expense.  </P> <P> Rose was arrested and jailed for four hours before posting $5,000 bail after  Kantor told sheriff's deputies he confronted her outside his condominium.  </P> <P> Kantor said she knocked on Rose's door and when he came out "he was in one of  those crazy moods and he attacked me." She alleged Rose threw her keys off a  12th-floor balcony, grabbed a wine bottle from her, emptied it and then struck  her with it.  </P> <P> Rose, 28, denies the allegations.  </P> <P> "I never touched her with a wine bottle or anything else," Rose said. "I only  asked her to stop making so much noise in the hallway because my wife had been  ill and was sleeping. Kantor was banging incessantly and hysterically on my  door -- which still has the marks to prove it -- and threatened me!"  </P></p>

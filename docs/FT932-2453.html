			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Regalian loss soars to Pounds 83m REGALIAN Properties incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83.5m for the year ended March 31, after taking further provisions against the falling value of its property portfolio. Last year the loss was Pounds 26.8m. The dividend is passed; previously there was an interim of 1.5p. Net asset value per share has fallen from 104.8p to 36.5p. Mr David Goldstone, chairman, brushed aside the losses and said he 'took a very positive approach' to the future. 'We must have turned the corner,' he said. Further reductions of borrowings this year would 'enable the company to exploit its expertise in inner city residential projects,' he said. Net bank debt has been reduced from Pounds 130m to Pounds 42m since March 1992. Regalian's banks have extended its facilities to December 1994. As well as taking Pounds 52.9m provisions against stock, the company made Pounds 22.1m of exceptional items including a Pounds 7.2m loss on the sale of a Southwark office building. About half of the Pounds 44.9m provisions against residential property were against Kensington Palace Gardens, the luxury block of flats near Kensington Palace. Regalian has now sold nine out of the 20 flats. Provisions of Pounds 14.8m were made against development sites to reduce the carrying value to Pounds 4.5m. Mr Goldstone said that the office development market showed 'very little, if any improvement.' Regalian was rethinking its scheme at Bishopsbridge in Paddington, which is a joint venture with NFC. It was prudent to consider 'an alternative form of development, primarily residential where there would be an immediate demand, with offices in the later phases,' it said. It has taken a Pounds 5.4m provision against the site. A Pounds 2.7m provision was made against a site in Cardiff, which will not be developed until the market improves. Turnover fell from Pounds 98.9m to Pounds 55.4m. Losses per share increased from 19.74p to 68.29p. The 1991-92 figures have been adjusted for FRS 3.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Motoring: Citroen's Xantia sets standard for its rivals - This BX replacement is a high-class act THE MONDEO is more than just the car expected to power Ford's recovery; it is the benchmark against which many of the 1993 models will be judged. This thought kept occurring as I tried three examples of Citroen's new Xantia range in Spain last week. Just as the Mondeo goes beyond being a mere Sierra replacement, the Xantia steps up half a class in succeeding the BX. It goes on sale in France early next month, will be available in left-hand drive markets soon afterwards and reaches Britain with right-hand steering in June. To begin with, there will be a choice of three petrol engines - 1.8-litre, 103 horsepower; two-litre, 123 horsepower; and a 16-valve two-litre developing 155 horsepower. Diesels, naturally aspirated and turbo-charged, follow rapidly and will be on sale in Britain well before the L-registrations start in August. So will a 1.6-litre, petrol-engined entry model. The Xantia is as crucial to Citroen in Britain as the Mondeo is to Ford, although for different reasons. Ford believes the Mondeo will restore its fortunes and rebuild market share. Citroen, meanwhile, seemingly cannot put a foot wrong in the UK. Last month, it took more than 6 per cent of the new car market, overhauling Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen-Audi. It also grabbed almost 18 per cent of a record 29,540 diesel car registrations. Ten years ago, the BX was the car that started to change Citroen's image - and build its sales - in Britain. Before the BX, Citroens were bought mainly by enthusiasts loyal to the marque. They had to be; the only sensible price they could get at trade-in time was from a Citroen dealer - against a new Citroen, naturally. The BX changed all that. Although idiosyncratic in styling and suspension (a self-levelling system using high-pressure gas instead of steel springs), it was not quirky. People who had never contemplated owning a Citroen bought a BX and liked it. Soon, it became a mainstream motor car. Its owners are natural buyers of the Xantia, although the new car might appeal also to drivers of Sierras, Cavaliers, Nissan Primeras, Peugeot 405s and Renault 21s looking for a change. The Xantia is a typical new-generation Citroen. Its wheelbase of 108.3in (271cm) is the longest in its class; its lean though rounded styling is distinctive; and it has the unique gas/hydraulic suspension. Inside, there is plenty of room for four full-sized people to stretch out. Rear-seat head and leg room is better than the Mondeo's although boot capacity is the same. The seats, yielding and well-shaped, and the interior appointments generally are closer to those of the big XM than the BX. Most of my driving in the 1.8-litre Xantia was on well-surfaced and almost deserted motorways. It was as comfortable and refined as one expects a car of the Xantia's class to be. At what most business motorists consider a normal cruising speed of 80-85 mph (128-136 kmh), I was aware of the engine spinning at 4,000 rpm-plus, perhaps because wind and road noise were negligible. In a motorway downpour, the air-flow kept the back window completely clear and dry. The two-litre Xantia felt a little more urgent. Lower profile tyres sharpened its steering response, but ride comfort and road noise were affected less than they were on the Mondeo equivalent. Citroen's gas/hydraulic suspension was evolved 40 years ago to give motorists an armchair ride on rough surfaces, and there is still nothing like it for comfort on a neglected D-road. Spain's highways have been transformed in recent years, but there are plenty of fast, uncrowded and ill-maintained minor roads. On their patched and wavy tarmac and acute bends, the Xantia rode serenely. Best of all was the 16-valve model. This had XM-style Hydractive II suspension, which adapts automatically to road surface and driving technique. Even at silly cornering speeds, it prevented body roll. The squat - though not at all noisy or hard-riding - Michelin 55 series tyres, and a small degree of rear wheel steering (like the smaller ZX model's), combined to make it feel exceptional nimble and safe. Equipment levels for the UK market have not been decided, nor has the price. Experience suggests it will cost no more - and probably slightly less - than its class rivals. All Xantias have power-assisted steering with a height-adjustable wheel, remote-controlled central locking and crash protection bars in the doors. Anti-lock brakes are extra on the cheaper models. Airbags (which General Motors announced this week had been made standard on the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra, just pipping the Mondeo at the post) will not be available until 1994. By that time, an estate car probably will have been added to the Xantia range. If the BX is anything to go by, up to 30 per cent of Xantia buyers will chose diesels, especially turbo-diesels, which will have the 1.9-litre engine now used in the ZX. There appears to be enough under-bonnet space for the Xantia to take the 12-valve, 2.1-litre turbo-diesel used in the Citroen XM. A highly-specified 2.1td Xantia with automatic transmission, ABS brakes and air-conditioning is a thought for Citroen to toy with for the mid-1990s.</p>

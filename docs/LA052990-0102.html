			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOING BUSINESS ;  </P> <P> IF THE SHOE FITS, JAPAN STILL MAY NOT BUY IT;  </P> <P> AN AMERICAN FIRM SLAMS UP AGAINST PROTECTIONISM ROOTED IN A BIZARRE SOCIAL  TABOO. BUT THIS MAINE COMPANY IS SHOE-LEATHER TOUGH -- AND 'IMPATIENTLY  PATIENT.'  </P> <P> When America's cobblers got trampled by a wave of foreign-made footwear in the  1970s, a modest, family-run shoemaker based in Dexter, Me., hunkered down,  rationalized its operations and emerged as one of the few survivors. Now,  Dexter Shoe Co. is doing something that might have been dismissed as next to  impossible not too long ago -- selling shoes in Japan.  </P> <P> Or, at least Dexter is trying to sell shoes here.  </P> <P> The problem is, its distributor is stuck with a government quota on the number  of imported shoes it can sell at the standard 27% tariff rate: 7,312 pairs  every six months. Above that, a punitive tariff of 60% is levied, making retail  prices prohibitively high.  </P> <P> And a Catch-22 prevents importers from expanding their quotas, which, in  principle, are allocated on the basis of the number of shoes already being  imported. In other words, you had to sell foreign shoes last year to import  them again this year.  </P> <P> "Dexter is not a company in a hurry," said Daniel A. Miller, president of  Dexter's marketing division in Boston, who recently visited Japan to make the  rounds of government officials and business contacts. "We're impatiently  patient."  </P> <P> Japan's protected shoe industry offers one of the most blatant examples of the  kind of market barriers frequently blamed for stopping U.S. exports and  preserving America's $49-billion trade deficit with its Asian ally.  </P> <P> At the heart of the shoe barrier is a delicate political accommodation and a  murky social taboo: The Japanese leather and footwear industry is ostensibly  dominated by the burakumin, a hereditary caste discriminated against over the  ages for engaging in "unclean" trades such as tanning and mortuary work.  </P> <P> To compensate for past -- and present -- injustices, the government shields the  leather industry from foreign competition.  </P> <P> "Japan is now paying the price for unequal treatment (of the burakumin) and is  not able to apply free-market principles," said Yutaka Kosai, president of the  Japan Center for Economic Research and a member of the Industrial Structure  Council, a panel of prominent academics and industry leaders advising the  government on trade policy.  </P> <P> "No one wants to discuss the burakumin," said Dallas Pyle, an export agent  based in Portland, Me., who introduced Dexter to the Japanese market. "It's an  extremely sensitive issue -- so sensitive it doesn't exist."  </P> <P> Still, by all accounts Dexter is doing everything the right way in its efforts  to sell to Japan. After being approached by Pyle and a Japanese distributor in  1986, the company retooled, investing $200,000 in new equipment to make shoes  sized for Japanese feet. The goal was to export 50,000 pairs worth about $1.5  million each year.  </P> <P> "In the past, nobody in the Dexter Shoe organization was export-oriented," said  Miller. "It's sort of the bad old New England mentality, that selling overseas  is more trouble than it's worth.  </P> <P> "We had been exporting, but we were doing it more by accident than by design --  the hard way," he said. "God forbid if someone sent us a telex to place an  order. We didn't know how to answer."  </P> <P> Privately held Dexter, which bills itself as "America's largest independent  shoemaker," currently has annual sales of between $250 million and $300  million. Exports account for less than 1% of total sales.  </P> <P> The scheme to sell in Japan got off to a strong start. In 1987, Dexter shipped  35,000 pairs of shoes after its Japanese distributor acquired options on unused  import quotas from other dealers. But last year, it was not so lucky. The quota  was cut in half, and Dexter now has thousands of pairs of Japanese-sized shoes  sitting in a Boston warehouse.  </P> <P> "Dexter in a way is a model company. They've been trying very hard, but they're  a victim of the system," said a U.S. official in Tokyo. "To their credit,  they're not complaining about the past. They're looking to the future."  </P> <P> Part of the past about which Dexter might complain is a deal struck in 1986  between U.S. trade officials and the Japanese government.  </P> <P> The U.S. side agreed to drop charges in a trade dispute over Japan's closed  leather industry in exchange for limited liberalization -- from absolute quotas  to the tariff-quota system -- and "payoff" tariff concessions for unrelated  U.S. commodities, such as aluminum.  </P> <P> "It obviously didn't help much if you were a shoe exporter," said the U.S.  official, who spoke on condition that he not be named.  </P> <P> More than U.S. shoes are at stake, however. High-priced fancy brands made in  Europe dominate the imports, and multilateral negotiations on the restrictions  are now pending before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, possibly  paving the way for further liberalization.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Dexter is constantly being "shopped" by the big Japanese trading  houses that broker in the coveted shoe import quotas. But Miller said he feels  loyalty to the family-run distributor, Chukyo Moonstar of Nagoya, which has  been conscientiously promoting Dexter's "image" in Japan as well as lobbying  for an increased quota to sell the shoes.  </P> <P> "We could do more business here tomorrow if we went with one of the large  trading companies," Miller said. "But we have too much respect for the efforts  of Chukyo Moonstar to seek alternatives. We made our deal with them, and we're  going to stick with them."  </P></p>

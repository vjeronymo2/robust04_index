			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: Down and Out IF YOU are looking for Anglo-French collaboration in the theatre, you could hardly get a better title than this - an adaptation of George Orwell's first published book. The cooperation goes deep. Down and Out had its British premiere at the Salisbury Playhouse this week. It has already been shown in France at a theatre called l'Abbatoir in Chalon-sur-Saone. The cast is British, but British bilingual. The same players do it largely in French when they cross the channel; the performance in Salisbury is mainly in English. The bulk of the financial support, one is told, comes from France. Any reservations are more about the play than the principle, which is to be applauded. Orwell's Down and Out is very much a personal book, a mixture of description, anecdote and social comment. It does not easily lend itself to sustained drama. Still, Nigel Gearing, the writer in residence at Paines Plough, the touring company responsible, has had a commendable shot at adapting it to the stage. The first impression is one of surprise at the size of the cast. At times, there are up to 40 people among the down-and- outs. That is a very large number for a regional theatre and even nowadays for the West End. Presumably the intention is to show the scale of the social problem. On the other hand, having so many people tends to limit the focus on individuals. The exception is Orwell himself or, to give him his real name, Eric Blair. The acting surprise is how remarkably like Blair the actor, Andy McEwan, looks. All the nervous tension that one would expect, down to the continuous smoking of cheap cigarettes, is thrown into the part. This is a riveting performance. Gearing, however, has made two major departures from the original text. In the book one of the reasons why Orwell finds it so difficult to get a down-and-out job in Paris is that he insists on being accompanied by a Russian called Boris. Boris is fat, lame and sounds generally off-putting. Yet in the stage version, where he is played by Jonathan Burn, Boris looks eminently employable, even as a head-waiter at the Ritz. Some of the poignancy of Orwell's personal odyssey - the sense of genuine despair - has been lost as a result of this change. Nothing really disgusting happens, which is not the case when the story is read in Orwell's prose. The other change is to introduce the girl Kathleen, a rich Hampstead socialist, for whom Orwell partially falls and she for him, though he keeps walking out on her. One can see the point of this: it demonstrates that Orwell looks down on conventional socialism at least as much as he does on conventional capitalism. Yet the dialogue between them never really gets going. The London scenes, specialising in such places as Salvation Army hostels, struck me as better than those in the kitchens of Paris restaurants, perhaps because this is Orwell talking to Englishmen and possibly because the cast are more at home in English parts. Directed by Anna Furse, the show stays at Salisbury till February 15 and will then tour. It will open at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, which seem admirably suited for it, on March 12.</p>

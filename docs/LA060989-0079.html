			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate committee reviewing the controversial nomination of William Lucas to  head the Justice Department's civil rights division has asked him to provide  about 200,000 pages of documents, a Justice Department spokesman said. A  committee source denied that that many documents were requested. The source  refused to disclose what kinds of documents the Senate Judiciary Committee is  seeking "because we don't want to be unfair to the nominee by raising unfair  implications about what we're looking at." The department spokesman, David  Runkel, said that the amount of paper work requested was "unusual." Lucas'  nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups on the grounds that he lacks  legal experience in civil rights.  </P></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson chairman likely to resign after review MR ANDREW REID, chairman of Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retailers, is expected to announce his resignation on Monday, following the completion of a review of the company's purchase of a subsidiary from Mr Bryan Duffy, its former chairman. Yesterday, Henry Ansbacher and Co announced that 75 per cent of the subsidiary, Advanced Technology Industries, would be transferred back to its original owners in exchange for an agreement to drop claims to nearly Pounds 11m of the original purchase price. Also, ATI's loans to Brown &amp; Jackson are to be converted to debt and redeemable preference shares. Ansbacher had agreed to act as B&amp;J's financial advisers last October on the condition that Mr Reid would resign, if necessary, following an internal review. Ansbacher recently completed that review and concluded that as much as 40 per cent of ATI's profits between 1988 and 1990 may have been questionable. Remuneration to the former owners, including Mr Duffy and Mr Christopher Bailey, another former B&amp;J director, were based on profits earned by ATI in that period. Profits were negligible in 1987 and ATI is estimated to have made a Pounds 2.3m loss for 1991. However, in each of the three years upon which payments were based, ATI showed profits of more than Pounds 1m. Overall, B&amp;J has paid more than Pounds 8m for ATI. Shareholders had urged the resignation of Mr Duffy late last spring, saying they would not inject the needed new capital unless he left. Last September, Mr Duffy announced his resignation following a Pounds 4.3m loss for the first half of 1991, saying he would take responsibility for the company's poor performance. However, he had sought to remain with the company as a consultant, which was opposed by shareholders. Among other things, shareholders questioned the terms of the investment in ATI which had been recommended by Mr Reid, a director at the time.</p>

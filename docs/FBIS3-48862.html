President Clinton met on 25 January with other U.S. Government  officials to review the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  The same senior U.S. Government official made it clear that  during the meeting, President Clinton approved of U.S.  negotiators taking a tough stance and making no concessions at  the bilateral economic framework talks.    The same senior U.S. Government official also disclosed that  during the meeting, a U.S. official, while pointing out that no  substantial progress has been made in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, stressed the need for both Japan and the United  States to work to make a success of the Japan-U.S. summit talks  scheduled for 11 February, and asserted that the talks should  hammer out trade accords beneficial to the United States.</p>

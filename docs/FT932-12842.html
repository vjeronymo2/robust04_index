			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Joint venture on Vietnamese port A GROUP of Singapore-based and Japanese investors will undertake a Dollars 905m joint venture project to redevelop the southern Vietnamese port of Vung Tau, according to property consultants Colliers Jardine, writes Victor Mallet, South East Asia Correspondent, in Jakarta. Foreign investors include Singapore-based Tredia Investment and the Japanese trading companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi. The Vietnamese partners are the provincial communist people's committee and the state-owned National Maritime Bureau (Vinamarine). The Japanese government, which recently resumed aid to Vietnam, is anxious to help Japanese investors and traders by improving Vietnam's battered infrastructure, and is expected to provide financial assistance for the project. Colliers Jardine, part of the Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson group, said it had arranged the deal as a 'build, operate and transfer' project, with a 70-year lease on the property. Mr Ong Beng Kheong, Colliers Jardine's executive director in Vietnam, said the project would allow Vung Tau port to overtake the Saigon river port in Ho Chi Minh City as the country's busiest. Under the first phase of the project, construction of a terminal for bulk, conventional and containerised cargo should begin next year, boosting handling capacity to 18m tonnes per year by 1998 from the current 4m tonnes.</p>

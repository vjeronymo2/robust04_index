			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / NatWest in Dollars 500m US bank buy National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank, yesterday announced that it was buying Citizens First, the New Jersey retail bank, for Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m). The US bank will be merged with NatWest Bancorp, the bank's existing US retail operations. The purchase is the most substantial by a UK bank in the US since the losses endured in the late 1980s, although Royal Bank of Scotland has made smaller acquisitions for its Citizens Financial Group US subsidiary. The move strengthens NatWest Bancorp's position in northern and central New Jersey, particularly in Bergen county which is one of the richest areas in the US. NatWest is paying Dollars 9.75 per Citizens First share, which represents 2.47 times estimated book value at the end of last year. The deal will be funded by cash and an ADR issue in the US. A maximum of 43m NatWest ordinary shares may be issued - about 2.6 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital. Citizens First shareholders will be able to choose cash or ADRs. Mr Derek Wanless, group chief executive, said that the acquisition of Citizens First, the last independent commercial bank in the northern part of New Jersey, would move NatWest Bancorp from 17th largest in Bergen county to second. The addition of about 250,000 customers to NatWest Bancorp's existing 1m will give it 10-15 per cent of the local personal banking market. The fragmented US banking industry is going through a period of consolidation. Mr Wanless said NatWest expected to make 30-35 per cent cost savings within 24 months, and also expected an enhanced income stream from selling NatWest products to Citizens First customers. The savings, the affluence of the customers and the bigger product range had been factored into the financing. Analysts said that the move was not a great surprise in terms of NatWest's strategic development in the US, as the bank had signalled that it had not finished building its US business. The transaction raises NatWest Bancorp assets to Dollars 26bn. After the merger NatWest Bancorp will have a branch network of 183 offices in New Jersey and 127 in surrounding areas. NatWest Bancorp will earn between dollars 73.2m and dollars 96.1m in the first quarter, Mr John Tugwell, chief executive said yesterday, Reuter reports. The first quarter would beat its 1993 fourth quarter core earnings of dollars 73.2m, but not exceed its net income of dollars 96.1m, which included tax benefits from accounting change. 'The consumer business is excellent,' he said, noting the bank is 'seeing nice income' in several areas, including credit cards, consumer loans, and car finance. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> SUNDAY BELONGS TO THE KIDS AT LA JOLLA SUMMERFEST '89  </P> <P> Though the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest '89 continues to serve a  high-protein menu of chamber music to its ample Sherwood Auditorium audiences,  the organizers have saved the sole orchestral program for the kids. Sunday at 2  p.m., festival artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama will conduct a 40-piece  chamber orchestra in Prokofiev's classic "Peter and the Wolf" and Rossini's  Introduction and Variations for Clarinet and Orchestra. Gail Eichenthal, host  of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's regular radio broadcasts, will narrate and  host the young people's concert.  </P> <P> "My earliest memories of classical music are those of my father taking me to  children's concerts given by the Los Angeles Philharmonic," Eichenthal  recounted. "I don't know what I took away from those concerts at age 2 or 3,  but I remember looking forward to them because it meant I had a date with my  dad. I also remember that in those days Henri Temianka conducted the concerts."  </P> <P> Some musical influence was undeniably stirred, however. Eichenthal began her  piano studies at age 6 and continued them through college. In 1978, she broke  new ground when she went to work for the Los Angeles Philharmonic as the first  female host of a nationally broadcast radio series of orchestra concerts. She  has also accompanied the orchestra on four international tours as its official  reporter and has hosted the Philharmonic-sponsored youth concerts conducted by  Ohyama.  </P> <P> Eichenthal views a young people's concert as a chance to educate without  appearing to be too educational, and she is not above such theatrical tricks as  changing her costume or wearing a disguise.  </P> <P> "In the first part of a concert of this type, I offer some musical  explanations, but I try to sneak the music theory in through the back door.  Rather than teaching, I hope to stimulate the children to listen to the music."  </P> <P> In public appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Eichenthal has been  given several serious assignments, including delivering the narration to a  concert performance of Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle." But she has also been a  soloist in Leopold Mozart's "Toy" Symphony (along with the likes of L.A. County  Supervisor Ed Edelman and former television actress June Lockhart) at a  Hollywood Bowl performance, and she executed a critically acclaimed solo on a  beer bottle for a Hollywood Bowl "Hoffnung" festival concert.  </P> <P> Recently, Eichenthal has expanded her professional horizons beyond the  classical music arena and is reviewing motion pictures for CBS radio's Los  Angeles affiliate, KNX-AM. Although she will continue to host the  Philharmonic's radio broadcasts, she has ensured her long-term connection with  the orchestra. In 1988, she married Philharmonic clarinetist David Howard, who,  coincidentally, will play the solo in the Rossini "Introduction and Variations"  on Sunday's young people's concert.  </P> <P> Due to the generous underwriting of the La Jolla young people's concerts by  Peter and Peggy Preuss of Del Mar, tickets for Sunday's program are a genuine  bargain -- $3 for children and $5 for adults.  </P> <P> Get the inside story. Although some of the SummerFest '89 concerts are expected  to sell out, among the least noticed of the festival's offerings are the master  classes held at, and co-sponsored by, UC San Diego. This year's clinicians are  cellist Gary Hoffman and pianist Jeffrey Kahane. The two classes (which are  held simultaneously at 7 p.m. Thursday in Mandeville Center) are free and open  to the public. Each performer will work with four previously auditioned  students, offering critical comments and demonstrating approaches and  interpretations. These master classes offer a unique opportunity to learn how  these world-class performers approach their repertory.  </P> <P> Theme and Variations. The Thomas Luis de Victoria Choir of San Diego, the  area's newest choral ensemble, will make its debut Sunday at a 2 p.m. concert  in the Chapel of the Carmelite Monastery in North Park. Kenneth Nielsen will  conduct this inaugural program devoted to the motets of Victoria and  Palestrina, as well as a "Missa Brevis" by Palestrina. Nielsen, music director  of Our Lady of Grace Church in El Cajon, studied conducting with Germany's  noted Bach conductor Helmut Rilling; he is also a composer whose recent work,  "Four Saints," will be premiered by the Oregon Repertory Singers this fall in  Portland. . . . San Diego Opera General Director Ian Campbell will take to the  airwaves (KFSD-FM) at 5 p.m. Sunday to give local opera fans their last chance  to acquire a subscription to the 1989-90 five-opera season. Single tickets will  go on sale Sept. 11. The usually shy Campbell will play music from the upcoming  season and gently hawk subscriptions. . . . This week's SummerPops offering is  a tribute to the wit and suave compositional style of Cole Porter. Guest  conductor Skitch Henderson will take the San Diego Symphony though its paces  Wednesday through Saturday evenings at Hospitality Point. . . . West Coast  Lyric Opera will present soprano Debra Pearson in a lieder recital Sunday at  the Words and Music Gallery in Hillcrest. Pearson, who won the 1987 regional  Metropolitan Opera Auditions here, will be accompanied by pianist Chris Allen.  </P></p>

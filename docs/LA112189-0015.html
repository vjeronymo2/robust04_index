			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> A TRADITIONAL 'BUTTERFLY' IN SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> Supertitles can be cruel.  </P> <P> Early Saturday evening, the translation projected above the proscenium at the  War Memorial Opera House described the heroine of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly"  as a "delicate flower." A few moments later, Cio-Cio-San fluttered in, and  looked like the whole greenhouse.  </P> <P> To those who insist on visual credibility, Nikki Li Hartliep was at an obvious  disadvantage. Physically, she simply could not convey the conventional image of  the instantly irresistible, tragically vulnerable child-bride.  </P> <P> But she did convey that image vocally. Unlike many a sylph before her, she  floated rapturously to the optional D-flat that crests the entrance aria. She  caressed and shaded the line sensitively. She suggested sweetness, purity and  fragility by musical means.  </P> <P> She managed to make "Un bel di" a poignant affirmation of deluded hope, not a  showy aria. She sang the little lullaby to her child in the last act with  arching tenderness. In the emotionally precarious suicide scene, she never  crossed the line that separates pathos and bathos.  </P> <P> Hartliep's voice is not huge. She could not make a mighty exultant impact, for  instance, at the climactic sighting of Pinkerton's ship. She is too intelligent  and too resourceful, however, to resort to forcing for effect.  </P> <P> She scored her points tellingly, on her own expressive scale. This was a brave,  enlightened performance.  </P> <P> The soprano found a sympathetic ally in John Fiore, the young American  conductor who led this revival in place of the ailing John Pritchard. Fiore  accompanied the singers carefully, never losing propulsion or climactic stress  in the process. He conveyed Puccini's passions without bombast, his sentiment  without goo. It was a considerable accomplishment.  </P> <P> Apart from the protagonist, the cast proved solidly routine. Vyacheslav  Polozov, the former Bolshoi tenor, turned out to be a blustery Pinkerton with a  tendency to sing sharp. Gaetan Laperriere, the Canadian baritone, repeated the  well-mannered, well-manicured Sharpless he introduced to Seattle last season.  </P> <P> Robynne Redmon served as a robustly attentive Suzuki whose voice blended  beautifully with Hartliep's in the Flower Duet. Douglas Perry was properly sly  as Goro, Philip Skinner properly menacing as the Bonze, LeRoy Villanueva  properly dejected and strikingly mellifluous as Yamadori.  </P> <P> Essentially, this was pretty much a business-as-usual "Butterfly." At least it  was a pretty "Butterfly." Toni Businger's decors offer no dramatic  illumination, but they also offer no distortion. Matthew Farruggio's stage  direction savors tradition without pausing to think about theatrical comment.  </P> <P> The production, now 23 years old, has served its purpose honorably. It is time,  however, for some probing reassessment.  </P></p>

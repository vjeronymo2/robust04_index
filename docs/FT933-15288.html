			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: One very sexy Dream You would think that an Irish ancestry had suddenly been discovered by the Bard. This Gate Theatre project is the second Shakespeare comedy to be given a major production in Dublin this year, and there are two productions of Romeo and Juliet and two Hamlets coming up, plus Othello and The Winter's Tale in the autumn. This is a director's Dream, a bold inheritor of the famous 1970 Peter Brook production, deriving from the same theories of the Polish critic Jan Kott which, baldy summarised, suggest that the Dream is in fact all about sexual repression. The director, Joe Dowling, is one of the best things to come out of the Abbey Theatre in the last 20 years. Since leaving there after policy disagreements in 1985 he has worked mainly in North America and the West End. The opening scene at the court of Theseus is played on a bare stage, with the royal thrones on a central dais raised above the heads of the defiant young lovers. From the very start a masterly directorial hand is evident in the way that gesture, even pantomime, is used to subvert the familiar words. For example, when Hermea refuses to marry the chosen suitor, Theseus's sulky bride-to-be Hyppolita silently gives her a sisterly kiss. The transformation of Hayden Griffin's originally austere set into an earthy, menacing fairyland owes much to the art of the lighting designer, Rupert Murray. Large phallic inflatables take up most of the floor space and are shaded in ever-shifting browns and greens. The funky-punk fairies dance dementedly in painted body suits embellished with feathers and fur. Oberon glides on as a cross between Dracula and Superman with heavy brown y-fronts worn over his cat suit, a long translucent cape swinging from his shoulders. It is essential for this reading of the play that the parts of Theseus and the fairy King Oberon are played by the same actor, similarly Hyppolita and Titania are doubled, as are the Master of Revels Philostrate and Puck in order to emphasise the parallels between the rigid, repressed court and the freedom of the fairy world. This tightens the play up and makes sense of hitherto problematical sets of characters. Stephen Brennan struts a sexy Oberon, but also gives him warmth and depth, while his Theseus is cold and pompous, but not beyond redemption. Flo MacSweeney's Titania is a bit of an airhead, but her Hyppolita is a woman of commanding presence. Evroy Duur, as a black Philostrate, is unremarkable; as Puck his colour makes him, as he should be, different from the fairies, but his heavy build and lithe movements and his strange way with the verse count for more. His accent also contributes to the pleasantly cosmopolitan feel of this production, in which Irish accents mix easily with more conventional English ones. So does the score by the Canadian composer, Keith Thomas. Do not be put off by the fact that it contains elements of rock and rap; it is also influenced by Irish dances, Elizabethan music, Broadway hits and more, but Thomas never overdoes an effect. One of the best of these is a live percussionist who greatly enhances the fairy scenes. Outstanding among an exceptionally good cast of 'mechanicals' who present a more than usually hilarious 'play within the play' is Stanley Townsend, whose swaggering Bottom will be long remembered not only for an uncannily realistic ass's head, but also for a gloriously protracted death in his role as Pyramus. In fact all 21 members of the cast display admirable polish and generate extraordinary energy. If there is no great subtlety in Dowling's vision, at least his interpretation is clear, and its lively presentation provides an often magical and consistently enjoyable evening of theatre.</p>

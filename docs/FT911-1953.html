			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (29): Perilous pollution problem - The scale of environmental woes is daunting HIGH in the Sudeten mountains, the forest is dying. One or two lone, grey skeletons of trees stand stripped of their foliage, surrounded only by tree stumps stretching away up the hillside. Caught in the crossfire of air pollution from Czechoslovakia to the south, and Upper Silesia to the north, the forest is a victim of rain with a pH value measured at 2.8 on occasions - the equivalent of medium-strength acid. Upper Silesia, the centre of Poland's coal mining and heavy industry, is just one of five regions designated 'areas of environmental disaster' by the Polish government in 1983. Twenty-two others were classed as 'areas of environmental hazard'. Together they account for 11 per cent of the land and more than a third of the population. The scale of Poland's environmental woes is daunting. Poles suffer an abnormally high rate of chronic bronchitis and asthma from inhaling polluted air. They are exposed to some of the highest dosages of carcinogens in the world through eating food grown on soil contaminated with metal deposits. By 1987, 95 per cent of surface water was unfit for human consumption, while 30 per cent was so heavily salinated by discharges from the mining industry that it was as to be unfit even for industrial use. Although the problems were recognised in the 1980s, only now is the government able to start to confront them, helped by loans from the World Bank, the European Community, the US and Sweden. When the Paris Club of western creditor nations cut Poland's official debt by 50 per cent earlier this year, the US unilaterally reduced a further 10 per cent, and agreed that another 10 per cent (Dollars 380m) would be converted into Polish zlotys and spent on environmental projects. The government hopes to spend a total of Dollars 1.5bn on environmental and water supply investment in 1991, triple three times the former annual expenditure. But the gap between what can realistically be spent in the 1990s and what is internationally called for is reckoned to be more than Dollars 1bn a year. To bridge the gap, Dr Maciej Nowicki, the environment minister, called in March for a trust fund to be set up - with money diverted from servicing Poland's foreign debt - to provide financial support to projects of international importance. These would include controls on trans-boundary air pollution and contamination of the Baltic Sea. At home, new environmental laws are expected to be enacted by parliament before the summer recess, and the government is already implementing its environmental protection programme drawn up at the end of last year. Underpinning the programme is the principle of 'sustainable development' to attain a balance between social, economic, technical and environmental conditions and development. In practice this means investment in the treatment of pollution at source, and the reduction of polluting industries when restructuring of the economy. The programme stresses the efficient use of energy. Assistant Professor Stanislaw Sitnicki, director of strategy at the Ministry of Environmental Protection, believes that energy consumption could be cut by 20 per cent. To this end, the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency was founded last year, with sponsorship from the US government, the World Wildlife Fund Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Conservation Foundation. Two centres in Warsaw and Katowice will conduct research and provide training and education, as well as advising on joint ventures. The planned legislation will include punitive fines for polluters, and a new 'no excuses' approach. Previously many enterprises negotiated special exemptions, or under the old accounting system were able simply to budget for paying fines as part of their production costs. More important, polluters will not just merely be fined, but will be held financially responsible for the environmental damage they cause. The ministry of environmental protection is embarking on an education programme, which will stretch as far as mounting a special exhibition for members of parliament. Politicians are eager to talk about abortion, complains Mr Sitnicki, but are not so interested in the environment. He adds that there is also a lack of understanding of environmental problems among the general public, but not necessarily of their scale. Short-term priorities in the environmental programme are to tackle problems which place human health - or life - at risk. Food production in areas such as Upper Silesia, where the soil is affected by toxic substances, will be gradually phased out, with compensation paid to farmers forced to switch to different crops. The 80 biggest polluters in Poland, identified in a government study last year, have been set strict targets for reducing pollution by 1994-5. In the medium term, it is hoped that Poland will come near to reaching EC pollution targets by 2000. the turn of the century. However, the picture is not all black. Twenty-seven per cent of Poland's land area is virtually unspoiled, including one of the last areas of primeval forest in Europe. to the east. Protecting these areas  - home to bison, lynx and the occasional bear - is crucial. a major priority.</p>

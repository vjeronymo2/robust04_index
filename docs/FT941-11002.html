			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Un ballo' falls flat - Andrew Clark reviews the first production to bear Peter Jonas's imprint at the Bavarian State Opera Peter Jonas has had the misfortune to start his new job in Munich with an artistic flop. Un ballo in maschera, the first production at the Bavarian State Opera to bear his imprint as intendant, is leadenly conducted and dramatically inert. Its first-night woes were compounded when Dennis O'Neill developed a throat infection, leaving Jonas to find a substitute tenor at 24 hours' notice. But that alone cannot explain the production's pedestrian impact. Since his arrival in Munich last autumn, the former ENO general director has adopted a high media profile, preaching renewal, accessibility, a more contemporary style. Backstage and front-of-house, the Jonas charm has worked wonders, just as it did in London. But Jonas himself admitted that the real test would come at curtain-up. Ballo was a curious way to begin. Verdi has never been central to Munich's repertory, and the success of his operas there has usually depended on a star conductor who knows the style. Ballo was in the hands of Jonas's music director, Peter Schneider, who gave the kind of heavy, plodding account one expects in middle-ranking German theatres. The performance lacked inner tension, textural transparence, a sense of melodic shape. There were too many lapses between stage and pit. Only in the Renato-Amelia confrontation at the start of Act three, with its brassy outbursts and gentle instrumental solos, did Verdi's expressive accompaniment breathe naturally. The staging was entrusted to Tom Cairns, one of several British-based artists invited by Jonas to work in Munich. On this evidence, Cairns should stick to designing and leave producing to someone else. His decor - a different setting for each scene - mixed surrealist and naturalistic imagery in a variety of distinctive shapes and colours. Ulrica's hut was a transparent white box on a promontory overlooking the ocean. The midnight tryst took place under a giant suspended boulder. Renato's library was a wedge of space boasting a pair of deer-antlers. There were touches of rococo in the opening and closing scenes. Costumes were historical and handsome. The visual symbols could have been subtler and the scene changes shorter, but Cairns at least created space for human drama. Sadly, this was where the production degenerated into dullest routine. Cairns made no identifiable impact on the principals, while the chorus movements directed by his co-producer, Aletta Collins, would have been more at home in Gilbert and Sullivan. None of the cast could flourish in such circumstances, but Julia Varady did her best. This was her debut performance as Amelia, sung from the heart like all her other Verdi heroines, and acted with the vulnerable intensity that distinguishes a noble artist. Wolfgang Brendel's Renato was bland and disengaged. As the last-minute substitute, Kristian Johannsson sounded more of a Turiddu or Calaf than a Verdi stylist. Nina Terentieva was the imposing fortune-teller, Julie Kaufmann a sprightly Oscar. The comprimarios were good. Ballo may have dented Jonas's credibility, but with the Sawallisch legacy still strong, Munich's loyalty was not to be won on a single production. Operatic traditions and expectations there are a world apart from ENO, and it is fitting that Jonas, the outsider, should work for change gradually. He must find a more inspiring house conductor than Schneider. He also needs to notch up a popular success. Next month's new Giulio Cesare, with Richard Jones, Ivor Bolton and Ann Murray, would do nicely.</p>

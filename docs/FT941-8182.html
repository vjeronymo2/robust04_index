			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Support for Balladur slips Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below 50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to a poll published yesterday, John Ridding reports from Paris. The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10 points to 43 per cent. This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in unemployment, as well as specific issues such as the fishermen's strike this month. Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high, compared with previous French prime ministers and his international counterparts. The decline in his popularity, however, has given heart to political opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge the prime minister in presidential elections, due in May next year. In an interview with Le Figaro, Mr Rocard said the prime minister had failed to provide a vision for where France would stand in 10 years. Mr Balladur has also faced criticism within the his own centre-right RPR-UDF coalition government because he is seen as not doing enough to revive the economy. A package of fiscal measures to boost the economy were announced at the end of last month and criticised as timid by some members of the RPR. Public discontent over Mr Balladur's failure to check unemployment of 12 per cent has also been rising after initial satisfaction with his crackdown on crime and firmness in world trade talks. Riots by fishermen this month have been cited as a sign of simmering anxiety.</p>

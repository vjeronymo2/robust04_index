			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Exclusive interview by Peter Lennon with Leader of Egypt's </F> Islamic Fundamentalists, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, date and  place not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A figure, relatively unknown  in the West, is now emerging in Egypt in the Islamic challenge  to President Husni Mubarak. He is 77-year-old Sheykh Muhammad  al-Ghazali, a former mosque manager and professional Islamic  proselytiser. Over the years he has worked in Iran, Kuwait and  Algeria spreading the message of Islam. He received Saudi  Arabia's FaIsal Prize for Services to Islam in 1989 and a state  award from Pakistan in 1990.    Sheykh al-Ghazali achieved international notoriety last June  when he appeared for the defence in the case of the two alleged  assassins of the author Dr Faraj Foudah. Dr Foudah had been  murdered by Islamic extremists after his work had been branded  apostate. At the trial, al-Ghazali had declared that it was the  duty of the government to carry out the death penalty on  apostates; if it failed to do so, he made plain, he understood  why others should feel entitled to carry out the sentence.    In his first interview with the foreign press in many years,  al- Ghazali raised the stakes an unhealthy notch by declaring it  might become his duty to "mobilise the people and overthrow the  government." [passage omitted]    Al-Ghazali was accompanied by two watchful sons who  monitored  the translation. He is small of stature, with a rather cross  expression but very courteous and candid. There is a certain  heated intensity of manner when defending his faith and  castigating the corruption of the West. He claimed to have been  able to muster 300,000 faithful for his last oration. Even a  third of this figure would be an intimidating congregation to  make any president think. [passage omitted]    He had made it known through my interpreter that he would  answer any question, so I brought up his public defence of the  alleged assassins of Dr Foudah. "We find it very hard to  understand," I said, "how a scholarly and cultivated person  could be seen to be inciting ignorant people to take the law  into their own hands."    Al-Ghazali denied he had incited anyone to kill. Indeed, he  had declared in court that "if everyone did that there would be  chaos." But in decribing what had happened in court he made his  attitude towards apostates very clear. "I was not in court to  issue fatwas," he said, "but as a witness. Faraj Foudah had  denied the Rule of Islam to me personally in open debate at the  Cairo book fair two years ago. Now a man is free to believe  that if he wants to; he can go and sit at home and say it. But  this man went out into the streets and worked against the Rule  of Islam. This is unacceptable because it strengthens Zionism  and colonialism and I am against anything that strengthens  these." [passage omitted]    What, I asked, would be his attitude to an Egyptian  government which failed to carry out its duties towards Islam?  "If it does not do so it is up to me to mobilise people to  overthrow the government."    Was this an eventuality which he felt might arrive in the  near future? al-Ghazali laughed and said: "Why overthrow a  government when you can organise elections and do it through the  ballot box?" But were there free elections in Egypt? "You  should be asking that question of the people who rig the ballot  boxes."    Al-Ghazali is technically an employee of the government in  his role of member of the influential Islamic Research Council.  [passage omitted]    The government would have particular reason to be wary of  al-  Ghazali. A few months ago the Algerian government accused him  of having been instrumental in setting up the resistance  movement FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) during the years he spent  in Algeria. al- Ghazali had said that in Egypt the state feared  the label "Islam" because it was afraid of alienating the West.  [passage omitted]    "I want my religion to be strong, Because I want my nation  to  be strong, to be able to defend itself. We are militarily  defeated, we are a defeated nation and the only way we can  regain our strength and self-respect is through religion."  [passage omitted]</p>

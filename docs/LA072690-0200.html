			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> POLICE TO ATTEND 'VERBAL JUDO' CLASS  </P> <P> The city will spend $6,500 next month on a "verbal judo" course designed to  train its police officers to defuse potentially dangerous conflicts by using  body language and the spoken word.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday night unanimously approved the allocation from  narcotic seizure funds. The course has been acclaimed by many Southern  California law enforcement agencies as effective in reducing complaints against  departments, Chief James Cook said.  </P> <P> Around 100 officers and dispatchers will attend the program, tentatively set  for mid-August.

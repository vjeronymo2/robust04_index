			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Claus Gennrich report: "Germany Does Not Want To Act as </F> Mediator"]    [Text] Bonn, 23 February -- If the Bosnian peace  negotiations ever get so far that an agreement only requires  final approval, a meeting between Western heads of government  and Russian President Yeltsin might be considered, in the German  view. Bonn has not yet definitely approved this idea. However,  it is said that the implementation of a peace plan is the  decisive thing; following the movement that brought Moscow into  the political game Russia wants to continue to be visibly  involved.    Regarding Moscow's role, one can hear it said in Bonn that  the NATO ultimatum permitted Yeltsin to put pressure on Serbia;  this permitted the Serbs to preserve their face by saying they  were heeding the wish of the friendly Russians. While Yeltsin  remained incommunicado for days, the plan for Russian influence  on the Serbs and participation in the decisions of the United  Nations and the Western states was worked out in Moscow, it is  said in Bonn.    Obviously, Russia's "Yugoslavia" envoy Churkin let Foreign  Minister Kinkel know in Bonn on Tuesday [22 February] that the  West should not set new ultimatums because Moscow could not tell  the Serbs every day that they have to give in again or else NATO  would take action. Kinkel indicated that Russia should be  included in the process, but Moscow could not claim a veto  right. Now the respective possibilities of influence should be  used: The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands are the  most important interlocutors of the Muslims; Germany could  influence the Croats; Russia, France, and Greece are listened to  by the Serbs.    In Germany's view, Russia should particularly influence  Serbian leader Karadzic so that Tuzla airport can be opened. In  Bonn one can hear that Russia is trying that, but it does not  want pressure to be exerted on Moscow to accept new ultimatums.  In a telephone conversation with Kinkel, NATO Secretary General  Woerner warned against threats by the West against the Serbs so  long as military actions have not been examined thoroughly as to  their effectiveness and have been prepared. Nevertheless, NATO  must reserve itself the right to set further ultimatums.  Kinkel, too, thinks that ultimatums can be applied to other  areas in Bosnia; however, action will not be taken by  automatically following the pattern of Sarajevo.    The Federal Government does not want to act as mediator in  the search for peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel wants to  provide a an "offer of good services" in arranging meeting  places in the technical sense. Chancellor Kohl's many telephone  conversations with President Clinton, contacts between European  foreign ministers, and the German humanitarian performances are  also below the threshold of concrete mediation. In Kinkel's  view, Germany should not permit itself to be thrust into the  role of an official mediator; because of the still unclear  interpretation of the Basic Law and the historic burdens,  Germany must be cautious. One must also bear in mind the Serbs'  sensitivity about Germany. Obviously, Bonn does not want to  push ahead against the smaller partners in the European Union  and potentially distrustful governments, such as the British.    However, it is said that the Federal Government is already  preparing for the fact that it will hardly be possible for  Germany to continue to play its modest and restrained role in  this way, if in May the Federal Constitutional Court were to  affirm that out-of-area military operations are permissible. In  addition, the German presidency of the European Union during the  second half of this year requires the Germans to coordinate  efforts. So far, the Federal Government has insisted that, for  historical reasons, participation in missions in the area of the  former Yugoslavia will not be possible even if the controversy  about the interpretation of the Basic Law is settled.    On Wednesday Foreign Minister Kinkel talked to Croat Foreign  Minister Granic in Bonn about the latter's talks with Haris  Silajdzic, the representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bonn  meeting was dedicated to efforts to harmonize the differing  attitudes of the Croats and the Muslims in negotiations about  varieties of a confederation plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina. On  Wednesday there was a round of talks in Zagreb with mediators  Stoltenberg (United Nations) and Own (European Union). Kinkel  gained the impression that the Croats are flexible regarding  confederation plans. The events surrounding Sarajevo are  causing pressure on the parties to the conflict and, therefore,  the prospects for an agreement have improved.    Kinkel also discussed with Granic suspicions that regular  Croatian troops are fighting in Bosnia. Granic answered that  there are three groups. Bosnian Croats, who had been in Croatia  during the fighting there, and who returned to Bosnia after the  war in Croatia and are now fighting in Bosnia. The Government  in Zagreb cannot do anything about them. In addition,  volunteers from Croatia have gone to Bosnia and are  participating in the fighting against Muslim units in central  Bosnia. The Croatian Government cannot stop volunteers.  Finally, regular Croatian troops have also stayed on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina along the Neretva River, which  flows into the Adriatic. A total of 600 of these soldiers have  been withdrawn over the past few days. The rest -- Granic  obviously did not say how many -- will follow. The accusation  of involvement by Croatian troops in the fighting only refers to  the last group and will soon be settled.    Kinkel asked Granic about Croatian prison camps in Bosnia.  Granic said that 100 Muslim prisoners-of-war are being held in a  prison near Mostar. In addition, the Bosnian Croats have a camp  with 1,200 inmates. The other camps have been disbanded. The  Red Cross has free access to those camps that still exist. In  contrast, the Muslims are holding 5,000 to 6,000 prisoners in  camps, and the Red Cross does not have access to them.    Granic asked Kinkel about the possibilities of German  economic aid. Kinkel promised that, after an overall settlement  has been achieved and if Zagreb shows the appropriately flexible  attitude, Germany will support Croatia's wish to be quickly  brought close to the European Union. Germany will also provide  economic aid. Kinkel did not supply any figures for this  declaration of intent.</p>

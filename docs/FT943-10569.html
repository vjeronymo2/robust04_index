			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Technology: Supercomputers For a glimpse into the future of massively parallel supercomputers, step into the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory 'Cave'. A virtual reality environment created using an IBM SP2 massively parallel supercomputer, the cave can be used to simulate complex processes enabling researchers to see and hear physical changes as they occur and to test and modify their experiments. IBM has demonstrated two potential applications of the cave. The first, which could provide a powerful new tool for drug development, is based on a molecular dynamics simulation program, running on the IBM SP2. It enables a researcher to watch and interact as a drug molecule docks on to its human protein target. To show how virtual reality could be used to enhance standard industrial processes, the cave simulates a grinding process. As material is ground away from a piece of material - wood, metal or plastic - changes in temperature and stresses created by the grinding can be simulated. 'Virtual reality is most often thought of as an exotic technology for entertainment purposes, but it also has vast potential to revolutionise applications in scientific, engineering, medical and commercial industries,' says Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's power parallel systems group. The Argonne virtual reality experiments demonstrate the new role that US National Labs are playing in developing technologies that are expected to have broad commercial applications. As pioneers in the use of MPPs, the labs are providing a testing ground for new computing technologies.</p>

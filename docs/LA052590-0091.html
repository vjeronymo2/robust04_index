			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE WINE COMMISSION TOASTS SELF GOODBY  </P> <P> The California Wine Commission, the major marketing tool of the state's  $6-billion wine industry, has voted itself out of existence, the Department of  Food and Agriculture reported.  </P> <P> The vote announced Thursday was 125 to 111.  </P> <P> Smaller wineries protested that the commission dictated overall industry policy  even though members represented only 11% of the more than 700 wineries in the  state. Only those wineries that crush more than 100 tons of grapes a season  were eligible to vote on industry matters.  </P> <P> The immediate effect of the commission's demise could be a cutoff of about $6  million a year for the Wine Institute, a private trade organization of the  industry.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heinz Vielain: "Kanther Regards SPD/Greens </F> Coalition as Danger for Internal Security"]    [Text] Bonn -- Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther,  of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], is worried "about a  serious danger to internal security in Germany" if a coalition  between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and Greens  were to take power after the 16 October Bundestag election.    "Such a change in government in Bonn would be a high-grade  security risk," Kanther told WELT AM SONNTAG after the SPD  obstructed the anticrime law in the Bundesrat, after it had  passed in the Bundestag.    The SPD-led laender refused to pass the "1994 anticrime law"  in the Bundesrat on Friday [10 June] after it had been adopted  by the coalition government of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP]. Although they welcomed the more severe  punishment of neo-Nazis as provided for by the draft law, they  especially reject additional measures to fight crime involving  international gangs.    Minister Kanther gave examples to WELT AM SONNTAG of what,  according to their election program, the Greens want to enforce  in a coalition with the SPD.     -  "The Greens call for the  dissolution of the Federal Intelligence Service [BND] and the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV],  because they regard these institutions as a danger to  democracy."    -  "The Greens press for weakening the police.  Important instruments for fighting crime should be banned, such  as electronic devices for collecting evidence, the use of  undercover investigators, and the permission to raid entire  neighborhoods."    -  "Riot police in the laender should be dissolved.  The Greens also regard the Federal Border Police as  superfluous."    -  "The Greens reject stricter detention laws.  Instead, the conditions for probation should be extended."     Kanther pointed out that common positions were emerging, at  least between parts of the SPD and the Greens. One case in  point was the drugs policy: "According to the Greens, trade in  hashish and marijuana should be legalized, and heroin should  even be distributed to addicts by the state. The SPD is ready  to put such trends into practice wherever it assumes power."</p>

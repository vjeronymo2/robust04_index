			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Full reconciliation between France and Iran expected THE recent improvement of political relations between France and Iran was taken a large step forward over the weekend during talks in Tehran between the two foreign ministers. It is now expected to culminate in a full-scale reconciliation, with a visit to France soon by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Relations between the two countries became strained after the Shah was overthrown by the Islamic revolution of 1979, and were aggravated by a wave of Iranian-sponsored kidnappings and terrorism attacks in France in the late 1980s. In the last two years, however, the pragmatic moderation of Iranian policy under President Rafsanjani has opened the door to more frequent diplomatic contacts between the two countries, starting two years ago with a first visit to Tehran by Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, and followed last December by the return visit to Paris of Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, his Iranian opposite number. The French government has shown itself anxious to settle the big financial dispute, over nuclear co-operation contracts, left hanging in the wake of the fall of the Shah's regime, and now appears ready to make significant concessions to finalise the matter. Indeed, the French Foreign Ministry appears determined to override the negotiating reservations of the Finance Ministry, according to reports here. French anxiety for reconciliation with Iran is largely attributed here to eagerness to secure access for French companies to the lucrative Iranian market.</p>

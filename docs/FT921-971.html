			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / King Kohl comes off his throne to kiss a princess: The chancellor has been called in to shore up his party's electoral chances in Baden-Wurttemberg IT IS St Matthew's Market festival in Schriesheim, the fun fair is packed, and the Big Man is coming. There is an air of expectancy in the marquee, stoked-up by the thumping rhythm of a police brass band and copious quantities of local white wine. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, himself a south-westerner, is on the campaign trail. With time running short ahead of the April 5 election in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, the German leader is throwing his own bulk and personal reputation on the party line. Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is fighting to defend its absolute majority in the last 'old' West German state where it still governs. The party should be cruising home to a crushing victory. This is the wealthiest state in the west, which makes it just about the wealthiest region of western Europe. It is the high-tech capital of Germany and its leading exporter. Throw in the Unity Chancellor, the man who brought the nation back together, and the CDU should be home and dry. But it is losing ground. The polls suggest that, for the first time in 20 years, it will be forced to share power with a rival. That would be a damaging loss of face for the ruling party, and a sad loss of influence. Which is why Mr Kohl has come to kiss the Wine Princess and rally the faithful. It was a classic performance, nicely geared to the mood of his audience, the League of Self-Employed, bedrock of Germany's economic might. First, he appealed to their sense of nation: unification was an historic achievement, and they should not despair at the cost, for recovery was just around the corner. Then he appealed to their internationalism: a united Germany must be locked into a united Europe, but the D-Mark would never be abandoned for a weaker currency. And, finally, he appealed to their prejudice: the CDU was the only party with a solution to the flood of asylum seekers pouring into Germany at more than 30,000 a month. The last was the theme that really mattered, no matter how obliquely it was put. 'I am quite against doing away with the right to political asylum,' he declared. 'But these people are coming here on economic grounds. We cannot be expected to solve their problems here in our country.' There was a storm of applause. The Chancellor's rivals - the Social Democrats (SPD), the Free Democrats (FDP), with whom the CDU has to share power back in Bonn, and the Greens - all insist he is playing with fire. 'Asylum was not a spontaneous theme,' says Mr Roland Kohn, state chairman of the FDP. 'It has very deliberately been made into one by the CDU.' The theme might well represent the chicken-and-egg syndrome, but there is little doubt that it is now campaign theme Number One. Mr Erwin Teufel, premier of Baden-Wurttemberg and master of the local CDU machine, says that, between June and October last year, the issue soared from being a concern for 30 per cent of voters to no less than 70 per cent. He is playing it for all he is worth. The reason is not hard to find. The election in Baden-Wurttemberg in general and the ruling party in particular are haunted by two ghosts which Mr Teufel, for all his name (it means 'devil'), is struggling to exorcise. One is that of his predecessor, the hugely popular and successful Mr Lothar Spath, hounded out of office last year on suspicion of corrupt dealings with a local businessman. The worry remains that it was not corruption, but Mr Kohl, who really forced out Mr Spath. The ordinary electors certainly appear to mourn his passing. 'He's accused of travelling the world at other people's expense,' according to a rival politician. 'People here say good luck to him: at least he didn't travel at the taxpayers' expense.' The other ghost is that of the extreme right-wing, which will either be exorcised, or invigorated, by the theme of asylum. 'Other parties,' as the extremist right is euphemistically called in the polls, enjoy the support of about 8 per cent of voters. Split into three groups, the strongest, the so-called Republicans, could even gain the magic 5 per cent needed to win seats in the state parliament. Mr Dieter Spori, leader of the SPD, is in no doubt about the danger, or the cause. 'If Mr Teufel gets his way, and the asylum debate is whipped to fever pitch, the one certain result is that the right-wing extremists will get seats in the parliament,' he says. The SPD wants to fight the election on the economy and the cost of unification, but these themes are being forced into the background. The trouble for the SPD is that, in spite of the economic warning signs, the streets of Stuttgart are still literally bulging with accumulated prosperity. In theory, the far-right also ought not to be too serious a threat to the CDU. The movement is leaderless and fractious, immigration is its only real issue, and, even here, it possesses little content or coherence. 'The time is right,' posters proclaim. 'The boat is full.' Mr Teufel sees the extreme-right as no more than the result of a periodic protest vote, not a trend, but somehow cannot quite exorcise it on his own. So he has called in Mr Kohl to back him up. That is why the election will be seen as a vote of confidence in the Big Man himself. German prices continued to rise this month, with the state of Baden-Wurrtemberg yesterday reporting an annual inflation rate of 4.6 per cent for the month of March after recording 4.3 per cent in February, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Economists expect west German inflation to peak this month at around this level - other states will report shortly - and then ease towards 3 per cent by the year-end. The Bundesbank, which this week reported that money supply was still expanding well beyond its target, has said it wants to bring inflation down to 2 per cent. However, the central bank does accept that this will not occur in 1992.</p>

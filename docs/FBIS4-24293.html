			<p>BFN     [Text] A rumor gave the impression that some incidents had  occurred at Mbuji-Mayi, claiming three lives and leaving several  people injured. After checking with all the civilian and  military authorities, Tele-Zaire has been able to establish the  facts. Having gone to the area from Kinshasa, Mr. Lambert Mende,  chairman of one of the wings of the Congolese National Movement  [MNC]- Lumumba, began to incite the local population to attack  the interests of so-called pro-government firms and French  interests. Reacting to this call to hatred and violence, Western  Kasai Governor (Bachala Kamtua Milandu) called Mr. Mende to  order, asking him to put an end to all forms of agitation. Mr.  Mende promised not do that any more and said he was simply going  to visit his family at Mwene Ditu. On reaching the area,  however, he started all over again. He was never kidnapped and  should, in principle, have returned to Mbuji-Mayi today.    Also, in a release to the press passed on to us only a few  minutes before we entered the studios, sources close to the  National Intelligence and Security Service say that according to  their information a peaceful atmosphere reigns at Mbuju-Mayi,  chief town of the Western Kasai Region, where Mr. (Mende  Omalanga), an influential Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]  member, freely held a public debate. The said sources say the  man is continuing his tour of the Western Kasai Region smoothly  without harassment. This release categorically denies reports  carried today in certain newspapers in Kinshasa alleging bloody  incidents which, they claim, took place at Mbuji-Mayi between  security forces and USOR fighters.</p>

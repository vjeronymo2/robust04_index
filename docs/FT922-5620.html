			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Confusion over technology moves: FT writers on prepartions for the Earth Summit next week in Rio De Janeiro TECHNOLOGY transfer has been a frequent incantation in the endless preparatory meetings for the Earth Summit. As Mr Mostafa Tolba, director of the UN Environment Programme, told a conference at Chatham House in London: 'If developing countries follow the short-cuts of using obsolete, economically inefficient technologies based on resource and energy gluttony and catastrophic pollution and waste generation, then our destruction is assured.' But the phrase 'technology transfer' and its practical implications are understood quite differently on opposite sides of the north-south divide. 'It is a horribly confused issue,' says Mr Chris Rose, programmes director of the environmental group Greenpeace. 'Some people are talking about money, some are talking about patents and some are talking about equipment.' Politicians in developing countries demand access to what they see as a treasure trove of advanced technology in industrialised countries, which would allow them to combine fast growth with environmental improvement. In the industrialised world, governments, companies and environmentalists agree that scientific knowledge and technical skills need to be transferred on a large scale to developing countries, if practical progress is to be made on any of the specific global problems from climate change to the extinction of wildlife. But they say the Third World is missing the point when it pays so much attention to patented western technology. As a UN preparatory committee for the summit pointed out, 'a large body of useful technological knowledge lies in the public domain and is unaffected by the international patent system. Also, most proprietary technology is available through commercial channels.' The obstacles for developing countries are, first, to find out about appropriate technologies and then, far more difficult, to find funds to introduce them. Any practical steps taken at the Rio conference are likely to focus on the first stage: improving access to environmental technology. UN staff estimate the international community will need to contribute Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m a year to run an expanded world-wide network of technology information exchanges. An example is the International Cleaner Production Information Clearinghouse (ICPIC), which UNEP is using to transfer information about CFC-free manufacturing, as part of the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty to phase out ozone-destroying chemicals. Mr Tolba sees the protocol as a model for environmental technology transfer. The original 1987 Montreal accord was amended in 1990 to set up an interim fund of Dollars 160m - contributed by the industrialised world - which will be used to help developing countries eliminate consumption of CFCs. Technology transfer to combat global warming through more efficient use of energy will be more expensive. Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister, pointed out after a recent visit to China that the average Chinese power station burns 440 grams of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, while a modern German power station consumes 300g of coal per kwh today, and will burn 220-250g in the year 2000. Mr Toufiq Siddiqi, an environmental policy analyst at the East-West Centre in Hawaii, calculates that an investment of Dollars 6bn in improving the energy efficiency of Chinese power stations would save 10m tonnes of coal a year and reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. An even larger contribution could be made by adapting China's 400,000 small industrial boilers to burn coal more efficiently; their efficiency today averages 30 per cent less than that of comparable boilers in industrialised countries. This programme too would cost billions of dollars. The example shows that identifying the technology is the easy part of technology transfer. The difficulty is finding funds to transfer it. Across the range of environmental challenges discussed at Rio - reducing pollution of the air, water and ground, together with issues such as preserving biological diversity - hundreds of billions of dollars will be needed. There appears little prospect that such vast sums will be available.</p>

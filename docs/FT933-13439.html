			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: French bank 'needs to raise FFr8.5bn' COMPTOIR des Entrepreneurs, the French property bank troubled by exposure to bad loans, will need to raise about FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.45bn) in bonds or through other measures this year, according to Mr Francois Lemasson, chairman. Mr Lemasson said that the company was facing an overall financing shortfall of about FFr20bn. He estimated that about FFr11.5bn could be raised through the sale of assets and the arrangement of syndicated loans with the group's banks. The company is also planning to sell its Paris headquarters, but has not yet decided on an outright sale or a sale and leaseback operation. CDE is also in the process of negotiating the terms of an issue of state-guaranteed debt of between FFr1bn and FFr2bn. Mr Lemasson said that the terms should be finalised within the next few days and that he hoped to obtain a preferential interest rate on the issue. The difficulties facing CDE reflect an accumulation of bad loans on commercial property and the downturn in the French property market. Construction industry analysts in Paris estimate that the group has about FFr10bn of risky loans to property companies, on which it has made about FFr2bn of provisions.</p>

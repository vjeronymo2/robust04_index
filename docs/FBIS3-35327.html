[Al-Majali] Happy Ramadan to you and to all our Arab  brothers, especially in fraternal Egypt.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us what you discussed with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe during his recent visit to  Jordan?    [Al-Majali] The visit was very successful. It was meant for  talks to promote bilateral relations, which have always been  good in all areas, especially as far as France's economic  support is concerned. France has always adopted a good and  commendable position toward Jordan. We owe France a lot of  money, and the minister promised that the French Government  would reschedule this debt.    The French minister inquired about the progress in the peace  process and about our expectations in this year. Our views were  identical; we are both optimistic about the peace process, and  we hope that in 1994 the peace moves will intensify and blossom,  if not bear fruit.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Were there any new French proposals or views  concerning the peace process?    [Al-Majali] There was nothing new, in fact. But they  stressed that they support the peace process and expressed  readiness to provide economic aid to the region. They are party  to the multilateral talks, and many meetings have been held in  Paris for this purpose. They also support the bilateral  negotiations. They stressed their desire to play a bigger role.  So far, France's role has been limited. We asked them, as an  European country, to make further efforts to support the peace  process. Relations between our countries and Europe are old and  strong; we have links, and they have experience in this region.  Undoubtedly, they can help in advancing the peace process.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After His Majesty King Husayn's visit to  Washington and Damascus, what are Jordan's next Arab and  international moves?    [Al-Majali] Jordan always believes in common action and  coordination with all Arab brothers. We believe that a  comprehensive peace is [word indistinct] for all concerned  parties. It is essential for the solution to be comprehensive,  not partial. Much pressure has been put on Jordan to go it  alone, but Jordan is firm, and does not agree to work  individually. This position comes not from fanaticism or fear,  but from belief that a general and comprehensive peace, not  separate deals, is in the interest of all states of the region.  Therefore, we always believe in coordination, especially with  the United States, concerning bilateral and peace issues. I  believe the United States clearly understood this.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated that  you believe in inter-Arab coordination and collective Arab  action. What about the reports that say Jordan has actually  reached a peace agreement with Israel that only needs to be made  public?    [Al-Majali] This is untrue, a rumor. Of course, we are  hoping to reach an agreement but so far it has not happened.  Apart from signing an agenda of the talks, nothing has  occurred. However, some issues are being discussed in depth,  including the reopening of Jordanian banks in the West Bank.  This is finished and done with. No peace agreement, in the true  sense of the word, has been reached, although some issues are  clarified and accepted by both sides.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, one last question. According  to some reports, foreign countries are trying to destabilize  Jordan, to undermine its security. What is Jordan's position on  these reports? How true are they?    [Al-Majali] We deeply regret the fact that there are some  extremists who oppose the peace process. We believe in a  constructive opposition but not an opposition that resorts to  violence, assassinations, bombings, and the murder of innocent  people. This is not opposition. These are acts that the Arab  world is disgusted with and cannot accept, particularly as there  is room for dialogue and discussion. Some people believe in  violence but our people's steadfastness can effectively and  manfully face whatever happens. We will not submit to any party  that seeks to intimidate and terrorize us.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, we wish you a good Ramadan.  Thank you very much.    [Al-Majali] A good Ramadan to you in Egypt and to the whole  Arab and Islamic world. We thank the Voice of the Arabs.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / British Gas defends its record on prices and service THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission investigation of the UK gas market requested yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will be the most comprehensive review since British Gas was privatised in 1986. Mr Heseltine made two references to the MMC, one on the gas supply market to household, commercial and industrial customers, and the other on the transport and storage business which British Gas has agreed to run as an arm's-length subsidiary from 1994. The MMC is charged with establishing 'whether a monopoly situation exists, and if so, whether it operates against the public interest, or whether anything done by the monopolist operates against the public interest'. If the MMC reports to Mr Heseltine that that is the case, he will have the power to change the terms of the Gas Act under which British Gas was privatised or to ask Sir James McKinnon, director-general of the regulator Ofgas, to make changes in the running of the industry. British Gas said yesterday that it had agreed to all demands made on it to introduce competition to the gas market, but sometimes conflicting demands from the the Office of Fair Trading, Ofgas, and the Department of Energy had made 'medium and long-term planning extremely difficult'. Mr Cedric Brown, who takes over as British Gas chief executive today, said the group had embraced competition so that 33 per cent of the firm contract market was now handled by independent suppliers. The company had reduced prices by 19 per cent in real terms for domestic customers and 40 per cent for large industrial users. It had also improved its standards of service, as demonstrated by recent surveys which showed high levels of consumer satisfaction. British Gas was angered by the insistence of Ofgas earlier this year that it should submit to a strict formula limiting price rises to household customers to 5 per cent below the rate of inflation. The dispute came soon after BG had agreed to OFT demands to surrender 50 per cent of its industrial supply market by 1995, partly by releasing portions of gas it was already contracted to buy to competitors, and to hive off its transportation business. The final straw was Sir James's refusal this week to allow British Gas to impose prices for using its pipeline business for independent suppliers that gave it an adequate rate of return on its investment, without a referral to the MMC. If such a referral was to be made, BG said, it should cover all aspects of the market. The inquiry will mean nine months of intense scrutiny of all aspects of the household supply business of British Gas, although its other businesses, in exploration and production, and gas supply overseas, will not form part of the investigation. Moreover, it could delay the development of competition in the market. British Gas has pledged to continue its programme of releasing contracting gas to competitors. But Sir James announced yesterday that in view of the MMC referral it would be impossible to implement a fair system of prices for the pipeline business by the original target date of October. He had reluctantly postponed that for a year.</p>

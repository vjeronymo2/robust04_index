			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The president's 14 January decree "on the  restructuring of State Administration for National Security of  the Armenian Republic," whose purpose is to resolve the national  security issues that stand before the Administration in  conditions of independent statehood, has gone into effect. The  radical restructuring of this agency has naturally attracted  attention and interest. The ARMENPRES correspondent queried  David Shahnazaryan, the acting head of the SANS, about the  current activities of the regional divisions of the  Administration. Mr Shahnazaryan stated that the president's  decree terminated the activities of the functional services of  only the central security apparatus and that the regional  subdivisions are still continuing their work.</p>

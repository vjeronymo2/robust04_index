			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Taxpayers 'lost out' in sell-off TAXPAYERS and consumers lost out to investors in the privatisation of the electricity industry in 1990, the all-party Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. Its report said the Pounds 16.7bn assets owned by the 12 regional electricity companies were sold for proceeds of Pounds 7.7bn. That sum consisted of Pounds 4.9bn paid by investors for shares with the remaining Pounds 2.8bn in the form of debt repayable to the government. The committee said the cost of servicing that debt was essentially borne by the electricity consumer through higher electricity bills. The committee attacked the sharp rise in profits reported by electricity companies since privatisation, and the strong growth in dividends. It commented that it would 'not have been unreasonable' for the taxpayer to share in the growth in profits. Manweb results, Page 24</p>

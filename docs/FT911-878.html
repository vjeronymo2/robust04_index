			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Levitt will return to court in July MR ROGER LEVITT, head of the collapsed Levitt financial services group, who faces Pounds 665,000 theft charges, will not have to appear in court again until July 18. On February 15 he was remanded on Pounds 500,000 bail until today. The remand date was changed when his solicitor, Mr Geoffrey Goldkorn, applied successfully for the bail conditions to be altered to enable Mr Levitt's passport to be returned to him so that he could make business trips abroad. Mr Levitt is required to notify the police of any foreign trip and to hand back his passport within 24 hours of returning to the UK.</p>

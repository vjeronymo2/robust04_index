			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / People: The commuter who will regulate the railway - Competition lawyer John Swift tells Charles Batchelor that he is intrigued by the chance to change sides and start setting the rules John Swift's daily train ride from Didcot Parkway, Oxfordshire, to Paddington, London, takes just over 40 minutes, a journey time that has stayed the same for 10 years, despite the investment that has gone into Britain's railway. Swift's journey to work may not have changed, but almost all other aspects of the system are in flux. As the recently-appointed regulator of an industry which is being made ready for privatisation, this QC and competition lawyer will play a starring role in shaping the railway of the future. Swift, who has an engagingly dry sense of humour, is not the only new player in the rail game. Robert Horton, combative head of Railtrack, which owns the rail infrastructure, and Roger Salmon, the more reflective merchant banker- turned-franchising-director, will also help forge the new network. But they and others will require Swift's approval for any deals they put together. At present, Swift and his team are attempting to impose order on the mass of agreements which are being drawn up between the 50 or so organisations that have replaced the monolith that was British Rail. It is Swift's job to act as arbiter between the parties - to ensure fair play, for example, between Railtrack, say, with its monopoly of the 10,000-mile network, and a company such as Gatwick Express, which is hoping to win a franchise over a mere 27 miles of track. Swift has already given notice of his intention to intervene vigorously. The consultation process he initiated last July suggested that Railtrack would have its work cut out justifying the returns the Treasury expects it to make on its assets. Swift chooses words carefully, but his intentions are clear. He says: 'If I were to form the view that Railtrack's charges were such as to give it a disproportionate return against the risks it is running, or its costs, then you come close to an abuse of a dominant position in European law.' Although Railtrack will have a dominant position by virtue of its size and sole ownership of the track, Swift says he is not there to pillory a particular company but to strike a balance. 'The train operators must be treated fairly if the consumer is to get a fair deal, but I am not here just to defend the little guy. Railtrack must have confidence that it can come to us and justify a charge without feeling that we are in one camp.' He wants to be a positive force in the industry rather than a threat to its stability. 'Very formidable powers have been conferred on me by parliament, but I do not want to create regulatory uncertainty,' - thereby creating additional risk for investors. Nor can he take such a purist view that he imposes impossible obligations on the franchising director. 'I cannot burden the franchising director with a set of agreements he cannot sell in the market place.' Swift is there not only to hold the ring between the commercial players; he must also take into account the government's role. The wording of his consultation document showed clearly that in some areas he was questioning the government's calculations in preparing the railways for privatisation. For example, he queried both the rate of return of 5.6 per cent, rising to 8 per cent over four years, which the Treasury has insisted on for Railtrack, and also the Pounds 6.5bn valuation put on its assets. Both might need to be much lower, he suggests. 'I have to approach this in the most fundamental manner. If it appears that the asset value is questionable or that the rate of return requires revision, this is an entirely appropriate matter for the regulator to consider. 'Anything else would be to rubber-stamp the proposals of the dominant shareholder (the government).' Much of his time in the past few months has been spent putting together a team - at present about 50-strong - to deal with the mass of detail involved in establishing a new rail structure. He is now 54, and was headhunted to lead the Office of Rail Regulator after 25 years at the Bar. He spent much of the 1980s representing large corporations, including IBM, in UK and European investigations into competition issues. He was also an adviser in some of the big takeover battles of the period, including the bid by GEC and Siemens for Plessey, and of Guinness for Distillers. Having defended many clients against charges of anti-competitive behaviour, Swift was intrigued by the chance to change sides and start setting the rules. He became special adviser to the government on rail privatisation before taking on the post of regulator last April. There was little in Swift's background to suggest a legal career. The family company of Thomas Swift &amp; Co was a firm of Liverpool stevedores founded in the 1860s. Swift seemed set to continue in the family tradition, but won an open exhibition to University College, Oxford, where he read classics and philosophy before switching to law. While he was away at university, the family firm was sold and Swift went on to pursue postgraduate international studies at the Johns Hopkins University in Bologna, Italy. After lecturing in law at his old college, he qualified as a barrister and entered commercial practice. Like many outsiders who have become involved in the industry, Swift is an enthusiast for rail's potential and foresees a 'virtuous circle of better and more frequent services' attracting more passengers. More personally, an efficient railway allows him to live in rural Oxfordshire where he can pursue his enthusiasm for gardening and exotic shrubs while commuting daily to central London. Swift is acutely aware of the challenges his group faces. 'We are going to be an extremely high-profile organisation in contentious areas of politics and industry.' One of the arcane skills he learned while training to be a stevedore was how to splice wire rope. Tying together the disparate strands of the railway industry will be no less demanding.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to stronger Dollar FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European currencies yesterday, one fact stood out like a beacon. The sterling-dollar rate is now at Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2. Sterling is thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago. For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings, a stronger dollar cuts three ways. It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a switchback dollar adds to their trading risks. An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and government cuts in military spending. Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, said yesterday that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and sell in dollars,' a Rolls-Royce official said. Rolls-Royce said earlier this month that the weak dollar had reduced its first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar also benefited Rolls-Royce's principal US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British Aerospace and components manufacturers such as Smiths Industries, TI-Dowty and Lucas. Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the Atlantic. A firmer dollar resulted in improved US traffic while a stronger pound boosted UK travel across the Atlantic. The US currently accounts for about 30 per cent of BA's passengers. Another beneficiary is the UK's oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's point of view,' said Mr John Walmesley, the finance dirctor of Enterprise Oil, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed sector.' The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12, widely regarded among North Sea operators as a 'comfort' threshold. In the UK motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the US to the UK and continental Europe still play only a minor role in the European market. Against that, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the two UK luxury carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as Britain's main car exporters to the US. North America accounted for 44 per cent of Jaguar's worldwide turnover last year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year. For Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering group Vickers, North America accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide turnover. Jaguar and Rolls-Royce have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK and US. In North America, however, fierce competition has meant that there has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar. Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in North America against their main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and BMW of Germany. Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on dollar-denominated raw materials. A good example is UK Corrugated, one of the country's largest producers of cardboard boxes. The company's chief executive, Mr Pat Barrett, said yesterday, 'Nobody can make any sensible decisions for the next 10 days. I am going to play golf all day tomorrow.' Mr Barrett's dilemma is that UK Corrugated imports 30 per cent of its raw materials from the US. Earlier this year the company was paying Dollars 540 a tonne for kraftliner - its basic raw material - or Pounds 308 at the exchange rate then prevailing. The supplier's price then went up by Dollars 40. But because of the rise in sterling, the company could absorb the rise without trying to pass it on to customers. Now, after sterling's fall, UK Corrugated is likely to pay about Pounds 331 a tonne, a 7.5 per cent rise. Mr Barrett said yesterday: 'The government's policy of maintaining the pound in the ERM to control inflation was absolutely right for my industry. The strong pound controlled the cost of imported raw materials. For us, the cost of making cardboard boxes has gone up 2 1/2 per cent since Tuesday.' The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and despatches craftsman-built rocking horse kits to the US.' The company's owner, Mr Tony Dew, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' Mr Dew said miscalculating exchange rates over the period between orders and despatch for products averaging between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150 could have a marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds 250,000. The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from Germany, so that won't help.'</p>

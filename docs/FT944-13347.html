			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Haiti election delay likely Elections of more than 2,000 state and local officials originally planned for December will probably be delayed until January, Mr Louis Dejoie, Haitian Commerce Minister, said yesterday. Mr Dejoie, head of the centrist PAIN party, said there would be no time to organise and plan the balloting for mayoralties, local councils, all 83 members of the Chamber of Deputies and nine of the 27 members of the Senate. 'I doubt they can be held in December,' Mr Dejoie said after talks with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and other political leaders. 'They don't have the time put things together.' Mr Dejoie and heads of 16 other political parties met the president at the National Palace yesterday. A further meeting is scheduled for November 3.</p>

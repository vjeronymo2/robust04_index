			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Corona first-quarter earnings depressed LOWER gold output and lower prices, combined with higher taxes, weakened first-quarter results of Canada's International Corona which is planning a merger with Homestake Mining, the US gold producer. Corona's earnings were CDollars 1.4m (USDollars 1.1m), or 2 cents a share, down from CDollars 6m, or 6 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 64m, against CDollars 75m. Production was 169,000 oz, a fall of 10,000 oz because of the closure of two small Canadian operations. Average cash cost was USDollars 210 per oz, against USDollars 202, while the average price received was USDollars 370, compared with USDollars 385. SEC approval for the merger has been delayed, reportedly because of accounting and valuation differences between Canada and the US. The two companies would have annual gold production of about 1.4m oz and annual revenues of more than USDollars 500m. Homestake's experience in autoclave production would be applied to Corona's Canadian operations. Homestake would gain control of the Eskay Creek gold property in north-western British Columbia and Corona's interests in the Williams and David Bell gold mines in northern Ontario.</p>

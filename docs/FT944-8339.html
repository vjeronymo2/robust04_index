			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Blunkett backs school exam tables Mr David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, yesterday risked provoking a clash between Labour and the main teaching unions by saying that his party would continue to implement school league tables if elected to power. As the government prepared to publish the third annual set of school league tables tomorrow Mr Blunkett said Labour would seek to improve the system of categorising schools' performance, increasing the range of information that the tables contain. Amid indications that Labour is willing to back some aspects of the government's education reforms he made clear that his party would modify the tables to add better measures of effectiveness. He told BBC Television: 'I am in favour of information and I don't think you can hide that information from parents.' He said the publication of the tables must 'mean something in terms of rewarding, backing, supporting schools that are really doing a first-rate job'. His comments were greeted as an 'enormous U-turn' in Labour policy by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary. She said the opposition party had finally 'seen sense' on the issue. Mr Blunkett continued to take a particularly hostile stance towards tax perks for independent schools, in spite of recent indications that Labour politicians were seeking a less confrontational approach on the issue. In particular, he said his party would abolish tax relief and charitable status for non-state schools. The NASUWT teachers' union said yesterday that the league tables were divisive and too often 'simply a device with which to whip teachers'. Offering different sorts of league tables was 'simply asking teachers which sort of whip they would like to be beaten with'. The NUT, the biggest teachers' union, was more cautious, simply stressing its opposition to tables in their present form. Mrs Shephard reiterated that she would no longer be working towards setting targets for the number of schools opting out of local authority control. She said that she would be working towards creating 'a great number' but added 'I'm not working to targets.' The table makers, Page 18</p>

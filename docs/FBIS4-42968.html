			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas today clarified  the Turkish Cypriot side's positions on the confidence-building  measures, as they were expressed on 6 May. Denktas made the  clarification in a meeting this afternoon with Gustave Feissel,  the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in  Cyprus, in the occupied areas.    In a statement at the Ledra Palace Hotel roadblock, Feissel  said the clarifications basically concerned the issue of access  to Famagusta. He said there are some positive developments in  comparison to the positions expressed by Denktas on 6 May, but  added that it is uncertain if these developments will lead to  the desired outcome. The UN envoy said he will brief the UN  secretary general by tomorrow, who will then inform the Security  Council.</p>

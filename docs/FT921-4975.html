			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Philippine telecom group improves 48% PHILIPPINE Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), the country's leading communications group whose shares are traded in Manila and New York, has announced 1991 net profits of 4.72bn pesos (Dollars 187m), an increase of 48 per cent over the previous year. However, the profits growth rate was somewhat slower than last year's 55 per cent. Attributable profits, after deducting dividends due to preferred shareholders, grew by 52 per cent to 4.5bn pesos. Earnings per share amounted to 98.90 pesos, up from 64.56 pesos. Operating revenues rose 29 per cent to 16.6bn pesos due mainly to 'the installation of more telephones, higher volume of long-distance calls, and various improvements in the company's service capabilities'. The company reinvested 95 per cent of its 1991 net profits, effectively increasing stockholders' equity to 17.47bn pesos.</p>

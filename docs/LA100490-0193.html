			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. HEAT GM OPPOSES MOVING TEAM TO O.C.  </P> <P> The appointment of veteran public relations expert Dick White as general  manager of the Los Angeles Heat may signal that the American Professional  Soccer League team will remain in the South Bay and not move to Orange County  as previously announced.  </P> <P> White, a former sports editor at the Torrance Daily Breeze who has held several  professional sports management jobs over the past 25 years, was appointed  Tuesday to replace Jill Fracisco, who was fired Sept. 24.  </P> <P> A graduate of El Camino College and a current board member of the school's  fund-raising foundation, White, 50, opposes moving the team to Orange County  for the 1991 season, a decision announced in August by club President John  Ajemian. Ajemian's announcement has met with resistance from dissident South  Bay owners and some league officials.  </P> <P> "We are not going to Orange County," White said.  </P> <P> Ajemian said in recent weeks it became clear that the Heat would have trouble  finding a suitable stadium near Mission Viejo, his top choice. In addition,  there is speculation that the San Diego Nomads, who did poorly at the gate  after moving to Southwestern College in Chula Vista, are investigating a move  into South Orange County.

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: REPORTED SIGHTINGS: ART CHRONICLES, 1957-1987 BY JOHN  ASHBERY EDITED BY DAVID BERGMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 417 PP.)  </P> <P> Poet John Ashbery, whose "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" won the Pulitzer  Prize for Poetry in 1975, is perhaps less well known for his art criticism. The  best of these essays, written over the course of 30 years and ranging over such  topics as Dada and Surrealism, the expatriate American art community in Paris,  the careers of Jackson Pollock, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Michaux, architecture  and wallpaper, are collected in this volume.  </P> <P> Ashbery writes as a keen, informed, but disinterested observer. Analyses of  painterly qualities and habits recombine with personal responses or musings. "A  painter like (Jackson) Pollock . . . was gambling everything on the fact that  he was the greatest painter in America, for if he wasn't, he was nothing, and  the drips would turn out to be random splashes from the brush of a careless  housepainter."  </P> <P> In his essay about expatriate American artists in Paris ("American Sanctuary in  Paris") Ashbery writes of "the advantages of isolation" to the creative  process, and the importance of breaking from tradition to claim an individual  style. "It is as though (these artists) had given up all efforts at trying to  please a public, whether French or American, and had gone back to pleasing  themselves." But it is in his essay on the painter Esteban Vicente that Ashbery  is at his most original and enlightening. The artist, Ashbery reports, has  tried "to get rid of brushstrokes, which had begun to seem to him as something  false . . . (and often) made to substitute for genuine passion and  inventiveness in painterly abstract painting." Ashbery elucidates this  sentiment with a recollection of a Mutt and Jeff strip, "in which Jeff went  into business selling honey with a dead bee in each jar as proof of genuineness  . . . frantic brushwork is often the dead bee in Abstract Expressionist  painting."

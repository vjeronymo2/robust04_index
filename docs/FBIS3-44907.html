Yeltsin has formally invited Kravchuk to participate in his  talks with Clinton, the press service said, adding that this has  been made possible after the three countries reached an  understanding on some major issues, including nuclear  disarmament in Ukraine.    However, the Ukrainian president's foreign policy adviser  Anton Butekyo said earlier on Monday that Kravchuk had not  decided whether to attend the Moscow summit.    Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with some  1,600 of nuclear war-heads inherited from the former Soviet  Union.    Russia and the United States have been concerned over the  safety of the nuclear arsenal on the Ukrainian territory.    Two days before the trilateral Moscow summit, chairman of  the  Belarus Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich will come for a  one-on- one meeting with Yeltsin. The talk will focus on the  nuclear weapons in Belarus, INTERFAX reported.    Nuclear issue will also be high on the agenda when President  Clinton makes a stop-over in Minsk on January 15-16 after the  NATO summit and his visit to Moscow.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 IN OPPOSITION HELD IN WAKE OF MONGOLIA PROTESTS  </P> <P> Ten Mongolian opposition party members were arrested after a series of illegal  protest rallies against the government, residents said Saturday.  </P> <P> The apprehensions were the first known arrests of opposition party members  since the birth of the pro-democracy movement last December.  </P> <P> At least one of those arrested was sentenced to 25 days' detention.  </P> <P> All 10 are members of the largest opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic  Assn., which held rallies Friday in the northern province of Hovsogol and in  the capital, Ulan Bator, residents said.  </P> <P> They said Friday's rally in central Ulan Bator attracted 10,000 people. Unarmed  troops were called in for the first time since December, but the demonstration  passed peacefully.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the arrests showed that the Communists, in power since 1921, are  tightening their grip in Mongolia, where mass protests forced the governing  party to renounce its monopoly on power in March and call the country's first  free general elections.  </P></p>

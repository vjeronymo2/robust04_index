			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Downwards drift Norwich Union has not chosen a propitious time to announce a shift of its investment strategy back towards equities. Though the FT-SE just held above the 2,800 level on Wednesday, it still shed 48 points on the week. The strongly negative reaction of companies like Wellcome, Fisons and BAT to specific bad news suggests that individual valuations are stretched. All things are relative, however, and Norwich Union's decision may say as much about its fears for the gilts as about its hopes for the equity market. Certainly the news that house prices are rising puts a faint whiff of inflation back in the air. That will not help the long end of the gilt market, especially in view of the government's heavy funding programme. It may make the government even more reluctant to cut interest rates again, despite the rise in sterling. That would leave the equity market without justification for a further assault on the 3,000 level. While recovery does seem to be taking hold, it is not strong enough to make much difference to expectations for corporate earnings. For now the equity market still seems interest-rate driven. Paradoxically, it may therefore react better to bad economic news than to good. Sterling's trade-weighted index is already back up to 80, where it stood when interest rates were cut in January. The currency will become stronger still if the government stays reluctant to cut rates once the Bundesbank really starts to relax. That would hit equities on another front: the export-related earnings growth factored in after the devaluation would disappear into thin air.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today  rejected the idea of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali mediating the issue of Israel's kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani, the official in charge of the Believers  Resistance. Buwayz said the UN secretary general's role is to  obtain the release of the Lebanese citizen.    Our correspondent in Beirut, Antoine Constantine,  interviewed  'Ali al-Husayni, one of the senior officials in the Believers  Resistance in Lebanon, and asked him about his opinion  concerning the Lebanese Government's stand on al-Dirani's  kidnapping and the possibility of exchanging him for Israeli  pilot Ron Arad.    [Begin al-Husayni recording] This is positive talk. We  support what the Lebanese Government has said [words indistinct]  brother Abu-'Ali al-Dirani, the UN secretary general, who is  entrusted with an international organization which takes care of  the entire world, should not compare and should not equate  between the victim and the aggressor. I believe that just  saying that we should carry out negotiations on al-Dirani and  Ron Arad greatly harms the United Nations because Ron Arad  bombed the people here, and was arrested on Lebanese soil, while  Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was defending his land.    Another thing is that Abu-'Ali al-Dirani has no information  about Ron Arad. Butrus Ghali knows this. He previously carried  out mediation and directly and indirectly contacted the  Believers Resistance, and others, concerning the Ron Arad issue.  At the time, he was informed [word indistinct] one of the UN  envoys that we have nothing to do with this and we do not have  him.    Had Ron Arad been with the Believers Resistance, we -- I  regret to use this expression -- but a man who struggles against  Israel, for us, is worth all the Israelis. There is no doubt  that we would have exchanged him because to us the individual is  more important than anything else. The talk by the UN secretary  general that he is ready to carry out a mediation shows he has  colluded with the Israelis in the kidnapping operation. [end  recording]</p>

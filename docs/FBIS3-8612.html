On Saturday night [12 March], he issued invitations  to Marian Krzaklewski (Solidarity), Ewa Spychalska (All-Polish  Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]), Marian Jurczyk (Solidarity '80),  and Jan Kisielinski (Polish Miners' Trade Union).    Yesterday, members of the National Protest Headquarters met  in Katowice in order to make a decision on what Solidarity's  action should consist of and to take a stand on the prime  minister's proposal.    Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said after  Saturday's meeting of the Council of Minister's Economic  Committee and the Council of Minister's Social and Political  Committee: "We were pondering the phenomenon of the situation  where both the government and Solidarity are declaring their  willingness to conduct talks, but still, such talks are not  taking place. And that is why we came to the conclusion that it  would be a useful thing if a representative of the government,  who would be of a high rank appropriate for that or even of the  highest rank, could talk to a representative of the Solidarity  trade union, who would have been given sufficient powers, and  the purpose of the meeting would be to determine what kind of  procedural obstacles are preventing a meeting from taking  place." When asked about whether the government intends to  conduct separate negotiations with Solidarity, Cimoszewicz  replied: "Substantive negotiations aimed at arriving at  mutually agreed conclusions must be taking place with all trade  unions, just the way Solidarity wanted it to be when it  initiated the idea of establishing a Trilateral Commission."    Addressing an accusation by the General Administration of  State Railroads that the railroad strike was illegal, the prime  minister admitted that "procedures required by the law make it  practically impossible to organize a legal strike."    Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski says that the prime  minister's proposal is a "kind of opening up, but it also has  flaws." According to the chairman, because it is Solidarity  that is involved in collective bargaining with the government,  the trade union should sign an agreement on its own behalf.    Solidarity's National Protest Headquarters, which held a  session on Sunday [13 March], accepted an invitation to talks  issued by Prime Minister Pawlak, but the trade union does not  regard the talks as a formal initiation of negotiations.  Because the government has so far failed to reply to the trade  union's demands, which were submitted in mid-February, the trade  union's protest action will continue: Protests in Wroclaw,  Opole, and Walbrzych have been announced for Monday, strikes in  several plants of the Bydgoszcz Region have been announced for  Tuesday, and, beginning Thursday (in connection with the  initiation of proceedings regarding a new law on popiwek [tax on  excessive salary increases] ), picketing in front of the Sejm  building will begin. But, for the moment, Solidarity has given  up a combination of the protests and a "major blow," which had  been planned before.    Krzaklewski did not reveal the amount of financial resources  collected for a strike fund because that information is secret.  He announced that Solidarity will initiate more collective  bargaining, dealing with the government's failure to implement  the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises" over the past year.    According to OPZZ Deputy Chairman Waclaw Martyniuk, given  the  "current tension and the general situation," the prime  minister's meeting with trade unions' chiefs is a logical thing.  In his view, the talks will concern the "establishment of the  Trilateral Commission." Marian Jurczyk will respond to the  prime minister's invitation. For the chairman of "Solidarity  '80," "economic revival is a fundamental issue. Jan Kisielinski  would first of all like to discuss problems faced by the mining  industry (including his alternative proposal to the program of  restructuring the mining industry), and also issues associated  with the Silesia region.</p>

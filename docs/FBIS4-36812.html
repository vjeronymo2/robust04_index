			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that the forces of  the ruling military regime in Sanaa continued today their  desperate attacking attempts on all the battlefronts. They  launched random rocket and artillery attacks on residential  quarters and peaceful villages in expression of the regime's  hysterical state and inability to achieve any progress on all  the battlefronts.    In a statement to the ADEN NEWS AGENCY, the source pointed  out that the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  faced with legendary courage these desperate attempted  offensives. They inflicted crushing blows on the invading  forces resulting in heavy losses. The source pointed out that  eight hostile tanks, three armored cars and two Katyusha rocket  vehicles were destroyed. The northern troops also suffered  hundreds of dead and wounded. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Rules on property receivers urged The last remaining area of insolvency that is entirely unregulated could be subject to tough restrictions under proposals being drawn up by the profession. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is leading a campaign to introduce examinations, training and licensing for law of property act (LPA) receivers. LPA receivers are appointed by lenders to recover the maximum value from a debtor from any property or other assets on which they have a fixed charge to secure their loan. No existing legal and professional requirements cover LPA receivers, and so anyone - regardless of any criminal record or lack of experience - is able to take on the role. Nobody knows how many LPA receivers are practising, and there are no official publications or procedures through which they could be publicly identified. Rumours circulating within the insolvency profession suggest that a nightclub bouncer may have been appointed as LPA receiver to a nightclub, and a matron as receiver to a nursing home. Mr David Lowe of Grimley J R Eve, chairman of the insolvency skills panel of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'There is no regulation at all and we honestly don't know how many LPA receivers there are.' He said he did not want to see a repeat of the dishonesty and financial scandals triggered by some insolvency practitioners, which had led to the introduction of licensing for the profession in the 1986 Insolvency Act. Initial approaches from the institution to the insolvency profession and the Department of Trade and Industry were rebuffed on the grounds that if it took over exclusive licensing rights for LPA receivers, it would be accused of creating a cartel. However, representatives of a number of the leading professional bodies, firms and government agencies are due to meet to discuss the issue at the end of next month. The organisations to be represented will include the DTI; the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers; the Insolvency Practitioners' Association; the British Bankers' Association and several professional firms.</p>

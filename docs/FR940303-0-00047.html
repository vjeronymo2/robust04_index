			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In section 158 of DEFRA, Congress added section 6601(e)(2)(B) to the Code, which requires taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return (including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. Thus, &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(vi) is amended to clarify that no interest is allowed on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain additions to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to the tax relates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Prior Regulations Obsolete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations are effective for credits made on or after August 25, 1992. It should be noted that, since the enactment of section 6622 of the Code in TEFRA, the IRS has treated &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(v) of the prior regulations as obsolete. Likewise, the Service has treated &sect;301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(vi) of the prior regulations as obsolete with respect to certain additions to the tax since the enactment of section 6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA. Thus, the IRS has computed and is currently computing interest in a fashion consistent with these amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on Other Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1984, the IRS published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (49 FR 39566 [LR&hyph;280&hyph;82, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 860]) proposed amendments to &sect;301.6611&hyph;1 and &sect;301.6601&hyph;1 on Procedure and Administration. The proposed amendments revised &sect;301.6611&hyph;1 to reflect section 346 of TEFRA and section 714(n) of DEFRA, eliminated certain deadwood provisions, and reorganized &sect;301.6611&hyph;1. The proposed amendments did not, however, include revisions to take into account section 344 of TEFRA or section 158 of DEFRA because those sections were beyond the scope of that regulation project. The proposed amendments have not been adopted as final regulations. If the proposed amendments are adopted as final regulations, their rules (and, to the extent necessary, their effective dates) will be modified to be consistent with these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Forest Boone of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax &amp; Accounting).

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OWNERS, DEVELOPERS OF CAR CARE CENTERS FORM TRADE ASSOCIATION  </P> <P> There's a trade association for Realtors. One for builders. And another for  developers. There's even an association for trade associations. So why not one  for people who develop and own car care centers, thought Taylor B. Grant.  </P> <P> Car care centers -- for the uninitiated -- are strip shopping centers that  cater to motorists with repair shops, auto parts stores and the like.  </P> <P> Grant, a Newport Beach developer, is sometimes credited with developing the  first such center in the early 1980s in Huntington Beach. That one started as  an ordinary industrial development, but so many automotive companies wanted in  that Grant says he hit upon the idea of developing centers from scratch. Now  the centers are all the rage with some developers, who have put them up all  over the Southwest.  </P> <P> So Grant started the Council of Car Care Centers, which he first ran out of his  office but has now turned over to a retired tire store executive in Arizona who  acts as part-time executive director.  </P> <P> Matters that the association deals with aren't exactly burning issues, Grant  admits. They tend to center on things like educating members about local  regulations on the storage of used oil and other nuts-and-bolts issues.  </P> <P> "Most of it's pretty basic stuff," says Grant.  </P> <P> The association already has enlisted 25 members, Grant says, about half  developers and the other half tenants.  </P> <P> Credit car-crazy Southern California as the mother of this invention, a place  where motorists can get their cars lubed and tuned up, buy new tires or a pair  of fuzzy dice for the rear-view mirror and -- in some of the newer centers --  also get fast food, rent a video or buy a quart of milk while they're waiting  for their cars.  </P> <P> Grant, 39, whose American Commerce Centers has developed 10 of the little  centers, likes to add other types of retailers in order to broaden his market  for tenants and add to the allure of the centers.  </P> <P> What's behind the rapid growth of these centers, which by some estimates could  number as many as 500 nationwide? Several factors, it turns out.  </P> <P> Cars are becoming so sophisticated that they're rapidly making the neighborhood  gas station mechanic obsolete, and that makes specialized repair services more  appealing. At the same time, the neighborhood mechanic is becoming an  endangered species as the corner station leans more and more toward  self-service.  </P> <P> For the consumer, having all those services and products in one location simply  makes things more convenient, too.  </P> <P> Most of the best corners have already been monopolized by McDonald's, gas  stations and convenience stores, so it's often tough for even big companies  like Firestone to find a good place to locate its tire stores.  </P> <P> And finally, some cities are insisting that these kinds of businesses band  together in architecturally appealing buildings.  </P> <P> "We don't get to build willy-nilly anywhere we want anymore," said Grant. "With  communities getting more sensitive about architecture, a lot of cities don't  want free-standing automotive stores anymore. The car care centers are a  benefit to automotive companies because, in some cases, they're the only way  they can get a facility in some cities anymore."  </P> <P> That is the case with car care centers Grant is developing in two cities,  Upland and Mission Viejo, the developer says.  </P> <P> While the centers are primarily a Sunbelt phenomena, they are starting to  spread to the Midwest and the Northeast, Grant rays.  </P> <P> Grant is the first president of the Council of Car Care Centers, and is trying  to recruit into the group owners of centers, real estate lawyers, tenants,  lenders and consultants.  </P> <P> The cost: $475 a year for a big nationwide retailer or a developer, $200 for a  regional retailer with fewer than five stores and other small businesses.  </P> <P> "Most of the big chains (of tune-up places, muffler shops and the like) are  looking hard for places to put stores," said Grant. "These centers give them  another good choice."  </P></p>

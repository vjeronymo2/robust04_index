			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Power shift in Malawi OPPOSITION leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the appointment of a three-man presidential council to take executive authority. The appointment appears to mark the effective end of the rule of President Hastings Banda, who is in South Africa recovering from a brain operation carried out 10 days ago. Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, appointed secretary-general of the ruling Malawi Congress party only last week, heads the council, whose other two members are Mr John Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa, both cabinet ministers. Spokesmen for opposition parties represented on a National Consultative Council (NCC), negotiating an election timetable and procedure with the government, have supported the decision to form a presidential council as a necessary interim measure. But they claim that the NCC has an agreement with the government according to which the presidential council will reconvene parliament within seven days, and amend the constitution to allow a neutral, caretaker president, with limited powers, to hold office until elections in May. Hospital reports say Dr Banda's progress is satisfactory.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A DIRTY JOB, BUT RECRUITS SEEM TO LOVE IT;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTING: THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS PROMISES FIREFIGHTER TRAINEES  LOW PAY, AWFUL HOURS, BACKBREAKING WORK AND LOTS OF SATISFACTION.  </P> <P> "Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions . . . and more!"  </P> <P> To Placentia residents Paul Hathaway and Christian Kirk, it sounded too good to  pass up. Last month, the pair joined a new program offered by the California  Conservation Corps to train young firefighters, the first of its kind in the  county.  </P> <P> It is not a job for the timid.  </P> <P> "First and foremost, the CCC is a work-ethic program. It's not a summer camp or  vacation," reads the work agreement that all recruits must sign. "You'll do  dirty, backbreaking work, and have few people to thank you for it."  </P> <P> Now for minimum wage, Hathaway and Kirk work grueling, 10-hour days beginning  at 6 a.m. Still, they said, it beats any other job.  </P> <P> "Some people would rather work at Mervyn's all day, but I'd rather be out doing  something physical," Hathaway, 20, said. "I've always been interested in  conservation, and when I found out the job was fighting fires, I thought that  was pretty exciting."  </P> <P> The Conservation Corps opened its first Orange County office in Yorba Linda on  Aug. 1 and began recruiting. The County Fire Department loaned the office space  and equipment, and it also helps to train the fire crews. In return, the corps  provides manpower to fight blazes and help in other emergencies, said Scot  Schmier, the corps' coordinator.  </P> <P> "It's a win-win situation. The county benefits. The corps benefits" and the  trainees gain real firefighting experience, he said.  </P> <P> Fifteen men are now training for front-line firefighting. A second group of 10  will soon begin training as a support crew.  </P> <P> Their days typically begin before sunrise. At a remote Silverado Canyon site  called Hangman's Tree, Fire Department instructor Bob Feldtz recently took nine  trainees on a mountain hike in 90-degree heat to acclimate them to the terrain  and weather they will face.  </P> <P> On their first afternoon wearing full gear -- heavy yellow coats and pants,  hiking boots, helmets and goggles -- the crew warmed up with a brisk climb up a  rocky hill. Then they cut access trails, called "scratch lines," through the  brush with shovels and axes. After only 10 minutes, they had cleared a path 125  feet long and 2 feet wide, and sweat had darkened the outermost layers of their  protective clothing.  </P> <P> "It's about 150 degrees inside this, and it's not even a hot day. This ain't  nothing to what a fire's going to be," Kirk said.  </P> <P> David Seminario of Fullerton, who at 18 is the youngest member of the crew,  said, "It's like being in a microwave oven in here."  </P> <P> Schmier suggested that they get used to it.  </P> <P> "You guys are doing good -- only 11 hours and 45 minutes more until you're  done," Schmier called out. His message was serious: They must be prepared for  work on a real fire.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Feldtz called out, "Air drop, hit the deck!" to practice reacting to  a water drop on a nearby blaze. The crew dove spread-eagled onto the trail as  they would during such a drop to avoid being knocked down by the torrent.  </P> <P> Founded in 1976, the Conservation Corps has employed more than 45,000 young  adults. Firefighting is only part of the corps' work. Its members also build  roads, clean parks and help restore wildlife areas. In the future, Schmier  said, the corps will also be working with cities as well as the county.  </P> <P> Corps' spokeswoman Susanne Levitsky said the new program's chief advantage is  that it uses local residents and lets them work close to home.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of pride when you're working in your area or city," she said.  </P> <P> The county Fire Department also uses state and county inmates from juvenile and  adult institutions to fight fires, said Chip Prather, assistant chief of  operations for the department, but is a separate operation.  </P> <P> The Conservation Corps program can train 25 men and women ages 18 to 23.  Although women make up 20% of the 1,800 corps members statewide and are  encouraged to join the firefighting program, none has done so, Schmier said.  </P> <P> Feldtz said the crew's determination shows.  </P> <P> "I've only had them for four days, but they're really motivated. They really  want to be firefighters. Anyone can work at McDonald's for $5 an hour. But you  ain't going to get up at 5 in the morning to work at McDonald's. This shows  they're really motivated to help California," he said.  </P> <P> Kirk, 21, agreed.  </P> <P> "The pay doesn't mean anything to me. All my relatives think it's just great.  It makes me happy to know I'm doing something to make them proud," he said.  </P></p>

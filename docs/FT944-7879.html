			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo Seimitsu - Contracts &amp; Ventures Tokyo Seimitsu, the maker of semiconductor manufacturing systems, has tied up with Carl-Zeiss, the German optical instruments manufacturer, to supply and market precision measuring instruments. The two companies will co-operate in the supply of parts and open their marketing channels to each other. Tokyo Seimitsu will concentrate on developing instruments for measuring cylinders and Carl-Zeiss will focus on three-dimensional measuring instruments. The tie-up will provide Tokyo Seimitsu with a marketing route in Europe, where it has very little experience, and allow Carl-Zeiss to penetrate the Japanese market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fabiola Vechionacce from the "180 Minutes of News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Finance Ministry adviser Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon  has said that revenues generated by an increase in the price of  petroleum will be used to pay the country's foreign debt and for  social programs. He described as positive the talks with an IMF  mission but refused to give details on any possible agreements.    Moreno said that progress was achieved with the World Bank,  which disbursed $2 billion to cover the first stage of a program  to modernize the Finance Ministry's tax system. He also  commented on adjustments that must be made to the 1995 budget.  Here are his remarks on reducing fiscal expenses:    [Begin Moreno recording] As for a reduction of expenses, we  already made an important adjustment that represents about 7 to  8 percent of what was planned in the budget and about 200  billion [currency not specified] from special requests.  [sentence as heard] I think that in next year's budget we need  not only an adjustment but an in-depth reorientation of expenses.    At the ministry we are already working on regulations that  will be presented to the minister for discussion by the Council  of Ministers. I think that the government should begin to  implement its program in next year's budget, because this year  we had to adjust to the situation that confronted us. Next year,  however, we must begin to implement the letter of intent  presented by the president to the Venezuelan people by  reorganizing the 1995 budget. [end recording]    The Finance Ministry adviser added that revenues obtained  from gasoline price increases will be revealed before year end.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by PT (Sao Paulo) Federal Deputy Jose Genoino: </F> "The Next Administration's Agenda"]    [Text] Now that the candidates for the presidency have been  pretty well determined, some questions that will be hard to  address are already arising with respect to possible election  results scenarios. Some of them grow out of the succession  context itself, which makes a concise exposition of this picture  a useful exercise. The most obvious aspect that strikes us is  the fragmentation and divisiveness in the parties, from Centrist  Left to far Right, vis-a-vis the candidates who have announced.  If an alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] and PFL [Liberal Front Party] is confirmed, it is certain  that the tucanos will not march hand-in-hand behind  the Fernando Henrique candidacy. The dissidence within the PSDB  will benefit Lula, who will also be able to count on support  from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], even with Brizola as PDT  candidate. The PFL, in turn, will be unable to maintain unity in  support of FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso]; liberal factions  will back Quercia or Sarney or perhaps even a candidate from the  PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. As for the PMDB, it is very  likely that dissidence will develop and the disaffected will  favor Fernando Henrique. Now that Maluf has withdrawn, part of  the PPR will look for a more centrist candidate. Party  fragmentation is even greater in the compositions for the  governorship races.    Some conclusions can be drawn from looking at this  situation.  First, there are no consolidated political parties, except on  the Left. Second, some of the Right, stung by the impeachment  [preceding word in English] and the corruption scandals and  having no chance of election success, is opting for a candidate  that historically has allied with the Left. Third, the Centrist  Left, notably the PSDB and the so-called ethical wing of the  PMDB, has run aground in terms of a platform. The PSDB, in order  to become electorally viable, wrecked the social democratic  ideology when it sought an alliance with the PFL. This party,  with the exception of a few respected politicians, is  characterized by conservatism and the politics of self-interest.  It so happens that the PSDB, although providing the top man on  the slate, comes to the coalition as a minority partner since  the PFL has, and will probably maintain, a larger representation  in Congress. This means that a potential Fernando Henrique  administration is likely to have to look more to the Right,  rather than to the Left as some analysts assume, to form  coalitions.    The ethical wing of the PMDB, in turn, will not easily be  able to free itself from Quercia or Sarney, The most it could do  would be to back FHC. Part of the Centrist Left is now working  with groups further to the right than those with which it had  recently planned to break. From the standpoint of alliances,  whether under a Fernando Henrique or a PMDB government, the  profile would not be much different than Sarney's Democratic  Alliance government. Instead of a program-oriented  administration as was assumed would develop, we would have a  government formed from an alliance of the Left with the Centrist  Left: once again, a condominium government.    The fourth conclusion pertains to Lula's probable victory.  Even if we anticipate significant growth in the legislative  delegations from the party forces that support Lula, it is  unlikely they will achieve a majority. In that case, Lula would  have to look more towards the center for support. This support  will be easier to garner if he wins the first round, or if his  opponent in the runoff is not FHC. Otherwise, the contest could  open rifts that would be very hard to close. Then only the  political skills of the government could cultivate coalitions  over time. This implies that we in the PT must get ready for a  relatively difficult start to our administration in terms of  political support.    All this only serves to confirm the theory that the party  and  electoral system ought to favor political and electoral  alliances so as to produce majorities that are able to govern.  Our party and electoral system has shown itself unable to foster  the formation of political majorities. Neither the Constituent  Assembly nor the constitutional revision have found a solution  for this impasse that is at the root of the persistent  political/institutional crisis. Consequently, we are seeing  reproduced the precarious conditions for the implementation of  government programs and for administrative effectiveness, and we  find that the electorate is rapidly becoming disillusioned with  those who were anointed at the ballot box. Nothing would  indicate that this situation will change radically during the  next administration.    Besides the difficulties inherent in the institutional  system, the next administration will have to deal with three  crucial items on the government agenda if it is to prevent  possible crises. The first relates to the fact that the rules by  which democratic institutions operate have become terribly  outdated. This problem affects issues such as the duties and  relationships between the three branches of government; the  imbalances in our federalism, where we find disproportionate  responsibilities and tax resources in the relationship between  the federal government and the state and municipal governments;  the party and electoral system, etc.    The second point pertains to governability and the  government  program. The next government must have enough political power to  deal with the economic and social agenda. It must be able to  promote growth and distribution in income; it must be able to  promote the democratization of property ownership and combat  social disenfranchisement.    Lastly, the third point on the agenda refers to negotiation  of the foreign debt and the insertion of Brazil into the world  market as something other than a junior participant. There are  two prerequisites if Brazil is to take a more favorable position  on this issue: a favorable international context and a  government that is politically strong from the domestic  standpoint. Only the conjunction of these conditions can enable  the next government the ability to stanch the hemorrhage of  resources caused by the commitments of a foreign debt that is  not always legitimate. As we can see, both the presidential  succession picture and the agenda that awaits the next  administration feature complex problems that are difficult to  solve. If it is true that elections represent an opportunity for  renewal of promises and hopes, a time of passions, neither the  politicians nor the voters can lack the sense of moderation that  responsibility and realism demand of us.</p>

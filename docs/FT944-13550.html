			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The hunt for a classic - This year's UK Advertising Effectiveness Awards A new advertising campaign is launched and, as a result, sales surge. Rarely is life that simple, as this year's winning entries for the UK's Advertising Effectiveness Awards, unveiled on Tuesday, demonstrate. The awards, unlike the thousands of other trophies the advertising industry loves to bestow on itself each year, are not for creative excellence, artistic merit, brilliance of execution or originality of concept. Instead, the biennial awards, organised by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, are given for case histories, often laden with dry statistics, which succeed in demonstrating how an advertising campaign has contributed to a product or service's commercial success. This year's overall winner - Tim Broadbent at WCRS, for his study of the agency's advertising for BMW over the last 15 years - illustrates the complexity of evaluating effectiveness when there is no 'big bang' of a new campaign. As Broadbent points out: 'New advertising can give a sudden twitch to the needles of research dials, which makes it easier to demonstrate how changes in consumer attitudes coincide with changes in sales.' By contrast, his job was to convince the judges that consistency of message over time was the essence of the agency's success in its advertising for BMW. When BMW (GB) was established in 1979 to take over from the previous distributor, it set objectives of maintaining high profit margins while trebling sales by 1990 from 13,000 new cars a year to 40,000. These objectives have been achieved and BMW in Britain has outperformed the market, thanks partly, argues Broadbent, to WCRS's 'ultimate driving machine' campaign which has run throughout the whole period. By using comparisons with BMW's performance in other European markets, he picks off factors such as price, distribution and product improvements which could have accounted for BMW's outstanding sales growth in Britain. Broadbent's calculation is that advertising expenditure of Pounds 91m since 1979 has helped to generate approximately Pounds 3bn in extra sales during that time. 'The value of BMW's brand-building campaign seems beyond question,' he concludes. The essence of the advertising has been a consistent tone of voice, with the car as the master of each ad. Says the case study: 'There are few humans or signs of humans, because humanity can suggest fallibility, whereas BMWs are shown as precise, cold, technical icons with jewel-like perfection.' There are no contrivances 'to add superficial glamour, such as stately homes, sunsets or glamorous blondes'. It is difficult to imagine anything further from the BMW world than Boddingtons, the beer billed as the 'cream of Manchester'. The case study of Boddingtons' advertising, by Guy Murphy at agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, won the category for products or services which are new, or have no significant history of advertising. When Whitbread bought the Boddingtons brewery in Manchester in 1989 it was faced with the task of transforming the bitter into a national brand without alienating its existing regional drinkers. Exploiting its attribute of being creamy-looking when poured, BBH focused on the product, rather than the user  -a more common tactic in the advertising of bitter brands. The agency also avoided the traps of regional stereotyping. The campaign that was developed strongly linked product appearance to product delivery - the creamy appearance to smooth taste. The agency rejected television advertising to launch the campaign, deciding, instead, on targeted press advertising which would reach 'premium' beer drinkers. The outside back covers of magazines, in particular, were used to build up awareness. It was only after two years that TV advertising was added, as Whitbread gradually built up its advertising spending on Boddingtons from Pounds 1.8m in 1991 to Pounds 4.5m last year. The brand, which includes Canned Boddingtons, as well as Boddingtons Bitter, has grown three-fold since its acquisition and is now the UK's fourth largest bitter brand. Like the BMW case history, the Boddingtons study works through the factors which have had an effect on the brand's growth and attempts to single out and value advertising's contribution. This value emerges as 6.1 per cent of total sales, which Whitbread confirms more than clears the cost of the campaign in the short term, while laying the foundations for the long-term success of the brand. Chris Baker, planning director of agency Bainsfair Sharkey Trott, who was convenor of the judges, says the BMW and Boddingtons campaigns were 'major marketing successes in which the decisive role of advertising has been clearly demonstrated' and both were characterised by a high degree of originality in strategy and execution. BMW won the day because of its 'sustained success and consistent implementation' over 15 years, said Baker. The cream of Manchester will have to wait until the end of the millennium to see if it has achieved classic advertising status. A pull-out with all the award winning case studies was published with yesterday's FT.</p>

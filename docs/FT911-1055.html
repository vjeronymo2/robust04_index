			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: ITT chief bullish on profits MR RAND Araskog, whose compensation as chairman of ITT has been sharply criticised because of the group's flat earnings, yesterday forecast that the company would have stronger operating profits this year. Mr Araskog, speaking in Leominster, Massachusetts, where the hotels-to-insurance conglomerate held its annual meeting, did not elaborate. In 1990, the group had operating profits of Dollars 1.11bn, excluding its investment in the telecommunications equipment company Alcatel. The largest public pension fund in the US, the California Public Employees Retirement System, voted against re-election of the company's directors at the meeting in protest against Mr Araskog's 1990 compensation. However, the directors were overwhelmingly re-elected. In a year when ITT's earnings rose 3.9 per cent, to Dollars 958m, and its share price sank 18 per cent, Mr Araskog's cash compensation rose by about 50 per cent to Dollars 5.5m. Mr Araskog's compensation has become a lightning rod for mounting US shareholder concern over apparent disparities between generous executive pay and poor corporate performance. According to a recent survey by Business Week magazine, the average chief executive's salary and bonus rose by 3.5 per cent last year, to Dollars 1.21m despite a 7 per cent drop in profits. The Californian pension fund, which is taking a lead among institutional investors on pay issues, said Mr Araskog did not deserve his pay rise because the company's performance had been 'mediocre'. It calculated that his pay over the past four years had been more than double the going rate for chief executives of companies of a comparable size and performance. But ITT replied that the board's compensation committee, which used outside compensation consultants, felt the chairman's pay was entirely appropriate in the light of his performance and accomplishments. Mr Araskog said yesterday that the sum fairly reflected long-term performance.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Rail Anyone waiting for the cancelled 7.25 to Waterloo will agree that British Rail needs to be exposed to commercial pressure. But devising an acceptable system has proved much more difficult than in other privatisations. In part, that reflects the unprofitability of the railways - British Gas runs at a profit, British Rail does not. But there are many similarities between the two. British Gas started as a monopoly competing in a wider energy market; British Rail runs all of the railways but competes with other transport systems. Both too have a basic infrastructure which can be divorced from services offered - gas marketing can be split from the pipes, trains can be split from track. It may be that the poor state of British Rail's capital stock, its high fixed costs, and need for continuing public subsidy rule out selling the operation as a whole. But that solution offers some advantages. It would expose all of the railways - including the track - to direct market pressure. Other privatisations have shown that many unlikely assets are saleable if they are priced correctly. And efficiency and service improvements combined with premium prices on some routes might justify the capital investment needed. The benefits of an integrated network would be maintained, while management would be motivated to work for the change. Ideally, internal competition within the railways would provide benefits, but that can be approached in a phased way - as it has been in the gas industry. By opting for a track authority and franchised services, the government has made rail commercialisation complex, when simpler alternatives might have solved the problem.</p>

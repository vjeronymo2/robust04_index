			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to address backbench concerns LABOUR backbenchers are taking steps to counteract the possibility that Mr John Smith might develop a 'bunker mentality' after he is elected leader of the opposition at the end of next week, Ivo Dawnay writes. After years of behind-the-scenes griping that Mr Neil Kinnock's staff overprotected the leader from his troops, several MPs are planning to ensure clearer lines of communication are kept open to the new leadership. Yesterday, Mr Graham Allen, the Nottingham North MP, won unopposed support from the parliamentary Labour party for a general review of the organisation and workings of the PLP, aimed at involving backbench MPs more closely in decision-making. Mr Allen said yesterday: 'In the past, in order to get a helpful suggestion considered you had to create a campaign or a row. There should be a mechanism whereby good ideas as well as discontent can be expressed.' Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip re-elected last week, also made representing backbench interests an important element in his campaign. Aware of the mood within the party, Mr Smith had already promised such a review when he made his leadership campaign presentation to the party last month. His supporters say he will conduct his leadership in a more collegiate style, provoking less of the 'insiders and outsiders' divisions complained of by the left.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Australian payments deficit up Australia's run of good economic news was reversed yesterday with the publication of December balance of payments figures showing a seasonally-adjusted current account deficit of ADollars 1.765bn (Pounds 830m), above market expectations, which had ranged around the ADollars 1.3bn mark, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. It also represented a sharp deterioration from the revised November deficit figure of ADollars 1.194bn. The news, which initially sent the Australian dollar plunging, came less than 24 hours after Mr Ralph Willis, federal treasurer, released some sharply upgraded forecasts, saying economic prospects were 'the best for 30 years'. But by the end of the day, the currency and bond markets had recouped most of their losses. On Tuesday, Mr Willis revised the current account deficit estimate for 1993/4 downwards from ADollars 18bn to ADollars 17bn. Some economists fear faster growth in Australia will bring balance of payments problems next year. The December data showed the balance of trade moved from a surplus of ADollars 169m in November to a deficit of ADollars 505m last month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Merchandise exports fell by 7 per cent, while imports rose by 6 per cent.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Arrest warrants issued for leading Italian businessmen Italian police yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of the chairman of Falck, Italy's biggest private steelmaker, and the managing director of La Rinascente, one of the country's leading retail chains, as Milan magistrates deepened their investigation into bribes allegedly paid by big business to anti-fraud police. More than 40 arrests were ordered yesterday, the day after the Italian government approved a controversial decree to limit the use of arrests in the investigative process. Magistrates joined a chorus of protests from left-wing opposition parties yesterday against the government move. As well as Mr Alberto Falck, who has headed the steel company since 1982, and Mr Giuseppe Tramontana of La Rinascente, orders for arrest were also issued for the president of the Italian accountants' federation, and executives from sectors as diverse as construction, pharmaceuticals and funeral direction. Neither Falck nor La Rinascente commented on the developments. The Milan magistrates' inquiry - latest in the two-year effort to uncover corruption - centres on Italy's Guardia di Finanza. Officers co-operating with magistrates have alleged that large Italian companies systematically bribed a unit assigned to investigate potential tax fraud by businesses with turnover of more than L5bn (Pounds 2m) a year. Police supposedly ignored accounting abuses and tax fraud after receiving kickbacks. Italian companies caught up in corruption investigations since 1992 have always claimed they were obliged to pay bribes to political parties because it was the only way to do business under the corrupt old regime. If upheld, the new charges will cast serious doubt on the claim that they were reluctant parties to fraud. Eight Guardia di Finanza officers are already under arrest, and warrants for the arrest of six more were issued yesterday. Within the past week, two others have committed suicide, including a general in Trieste, who shot himself on Wednesday, even though he was apparently not yet on the investigation list. The Guardia di Finanza is still one of the main tools used by magistrates to pursue investigations, and has an important role in tracking down drug trafficking and money laundering. Yesterday's arrests were carried out by specially selected members of the unit, and magistrates and members of the government have made a point of expressing their confidence in the Guardia to avoid a further decline in morale. Meanwhile, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left yesterday called for an urgent Senate debate of the measures unveiled by Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, late on Wednesday night. According to Mr Biondi, the government is trying to stop abuse of preventive arrests by strictly limiting the occasions on which this measure can be applied to those suspected of having committed a crime. Magistrates have made extensive use of arrest and imprisonment to ensure evidence is not tampered with and to prevent those under investigation from fleeing the country. However, there has been public concern that these powers have been distorted to force confessions. Often people appeared to have been detained in prison only for as long as they had not confessed. It was also used as a form of public humiliation. The new legislation - in the form of a decree with immediate effect - means that imprisonment would be reserved for more serious crimes like drugs-trafficking and membership of a criminal organisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Shuzheng (1728 2579 2398): "Good </F> Example for Entrepreneurs--Notes on Deeds of Chen Wensong,  Director of Dalian Shipyard"]    [Text] On 1 October 1992, Chen Wensong, the famous  49-year-old shipbuilding expert and Dalian Shipyard director,  passed away, leaving behind his utter devotion to the  motherland's shipbuilding industry and the workers and staffers  who had worked together with him day and night. As a communist,  he realized his faith through his actions. Just as he wrote in  a "self-appraisal": "The fact that I am appointed director of a  shipyard with 10,000 workers and staffers proves the party's  trust in me and only by working hard, heart and soul, will it be  possible for me to live up to the party's expectations."  <H6>  I. </H6>   In the summer of 1985, Chen Wensong was promoted from deputy  chief engineer to deputy director in charge of operations and  soon after that he was appointed deputy director in charge of  routine affairs. At that time, the enterprise had contracted  debts of over 100 million yuan because of a foreign  businessman's bankruptcy which caused him to cancel an order for  a vessel the yard was building and there were few domestic  orders for vessels for civilian. With production tasks inside  the shipyard basically canceled the enterprise had landed in an  operations "trough."    At a meeting of the shipyard's decisionmaking team, Chen  Wensong stated: "We should compete in the world market!"  Unfortunately, the wave of shipowners going bankrupt affected  half the shipyards in the world, and Dalian Shipyard had no  scope to exercise its ability in opening the world market.  Nevertheless, a strange phenomenon surfaced: Many foreign  shipowners visited Dalian Shipyard making inquiries about prices  and placing orders for vessels; in 1986 alone, the management  received some 230 foreign visitors in that category. Some  people in the shipyard could no longer maintain their calm and  were in favor of accepting the shipbuilding orders.    At a meeting of the shipyard leading body, Chen Wensong  soberly analyzed the prices offered by those foreign shipowners  as well as shipbuilding trends and cost, then flatly said: "No!  We cannot accept these orders! This strange phenomenon is  actually a trick being played by some speculators to take  advantage of the recession in the world shipbuilding industry by  suppressing prices to speculate in vessels. Should we accept a  large number of shipbuilding orders, that would be like drinking  poison to quench a thirst." Chen Wensong's proposal was  accepted. The shipyard decided: Shipbuilding activities should  be temporarily axed and ship repair services and nonshipbuilding  activities expanded, while waiting for opportunities to accept  shipbuilding orders.    Through two years of hard struggles the shipyard's output  value for ship repair services soared, ranking top in the trade  across China; its diversified operations entered the large  equipment arena in the petrol chemical, metallurgical, and  energy resource industries, with such pillar products as large  steel structural parts such as boilers and steel-making  converters taking shape. In 1985, the most difficult year for  the enterprise, Dalian Shipyard still made a profit of 780,000  yuan and, in 1986, the profit was 14 million yuan.    In 1988, there was a turn for the better in the world vessel  market; for many shipyards it was like enjoying a great rainfall  after a long drought, while accepting shipbuilding orders for  export in batches. Through a detailed and meticulous market  survey, Chen Wensong believed that the trend for vessel prices  to go up would continue; prices for equipment and raw materials  would continue to climb; and the time for accepting shipbuilding  orders in batches was just not mature.    Soon, vessel prices on the world vessel market rose by a  wide  margin. At this point, Chen Wensong made a suggestion to the  shipyard leading body: "Seize the opportunity, accept  shipbuilding orders as quickly as possible and go all out to  expand the proportion of shipbuilding." Soon, the shipyard  signed contracts to build two vessels for export, one with a  tonnage of 75,000 and the other 45,000, with an export  transaction volume of $118 million.    In 1991, when the Gulf war came to an end, the prospects for  the world ocean shipping business industry remained hazy and  many shipyards were wavering and waiting to see. By that time,  Chen Wensong had already been promoted to shipyard director; he  had long been sending men to find out about the market  conditions and came to the conclusion that a thriving situation  in the world ocean shipping business was at hand. He took the  lead in signing a contract to build a 60,000-ton oil tanker for  the domestic market, creating a record in vessel prices on the  home market; he was commended by the All-China Shipbuilding  Industry General Company for the good beginning he had achieved  for shipbuilding at home. After that, Director Chen seized the  opportunity of the further rise in prices on the shipbuilding  market and accepted a series of shipbuilding contracts for seven  vessels with a total tonnage of 340,000, thus the shipyard's  order books were full until 1994.    The success of Chen Wensong and leading members of other  factories in the shipyard in their decisionmaking brought  vitality to the enterprise.    Chen Wensong believed that to have a place in the world  shipbuilding market, it was imperative to accelerate the process  of the enterprise entering the world advanced ranks in  shipbuilding. This 1965 straight-A graduate from Shanghai  Jiaotong University, specializing in shipbuilding electrical  engineering, had a solid theoretical foundation and a very high  managerial level. He had command of three foreign languages and  paid attention to studying science, technology, advanced  managerial experiences of capitalist countries; had mastery of  vessel design, manufacturing, and the financial affairs of a  large shipyard and also the knowledge and skill to conduct talks  about commerce and trade; and had gradually become an expert in  shipbuilding electrical engineering, vessel design as well as a  fine entrepreneur running a modern shipyard, who was renowned at  home and abroad.    Today, the international shipbuilding industry is rapidly  advancing toward the large and high-grade direction. Chen  Wensong led the enterprise in keeping track of modern  shipbuilding technology, making proposals and participating in  the implementation of some important technological  transformation projects. In the past, the No.3 dock in the old  area could only manufacture vessel up to a tonnage of 30,000;  through transforming the dock, production, and installing cranes  weighing 1,600 tons, it was able to turn out large vessels with  tonnages of up to 80,000. Chen Wensong's efforts can be seen in  the completion and perfection of the production capability of  the shipyard's new area with the building of a dock with a  tonnage capacity of 100,000; with the importation and  installation of a crane with a capacity of 580 tonnes, the  largest of its kind in China and with the building of another  shipbuilding dock with a tonnage capacity of 200,000 still under  construction.    Chen Wensong worked hard in arduous exploration to shorten  the shipbuilding period. When building the No. 3 vessel with a  tonnage of 35,000, he persisted in keeping track of the  production department's monthly plan and the workshop schedules,  promptly harmonizing and resolving problems surfacing in  production. As a result, the production period was 214 days  shorter than that of the No. 2 vessel of the same type; the  period of being anchored at the dock's berth was 103 days  shorter than No.2 vessel; the date of delivering the vessel was  5 months and 21 days ahead of the contracted date; and five  vessels in the same batch were all delivered ahead of schedule,  with the realization of the operational goal of turning out two  additional vessels within a year.  <H6>  II. </H6>   In the summer of 1990, the relevant state department decided  that Dalian Shipyard should be split into two, with the  establishment of a new enterprise--Dalian New shipyard. When  the old shipyard was split, a number of technological backbone  and important equipment was also transferred along with some  workshops and land. The enterprise faced great difficulties in  production and sentiments of fearing difficulties surfaced among  workers and staffers in the old shipyard.    It was true that the pressure on Director Chen's shoulder  was  greater than on anybody else. However, he had a staunch party  spirit, a concept of the overall situation, and felt quite at  ease. At an assembly for cadres of the whole shipyard, he  mobilized them, saying: "In viewing a matter, we must proceed  from the overall situation of the country. Cadres who are party  members should pay attention to party spirit and show  consideration for the overall situation. What we should do  today is to create conditions and formulate measures to do a  better job of building the old shipyard. At the same time, we  should support the new shipyard in carrying out large-scale  production as soon as possible.    Soon, the old shipyard set out the production strategy of  "renting land outside the shipyard, while tapping the potential  inside the shipyard." In addition, it formulated the blueprint  for construction characterized by "a three-step process to  revitalize the old shipyard." They transferred 60 percent of  movable fittings to enterprises in townships and towns for  production, thus resolving the shortage of workshops and space  in the shipyard. With the founding of the new application  workshop, electronic computer center, and shipbuilding research  center, solutions were found, in turn, to the shortages of  equipment, technological forces, and scientific research  organizations.    In the wake of the split, Chen Wensong paid special  attention  to the matter of style to do a good job of handling relations  with fraternal shipyards. In July 1991, a crack appeared in the  outer casing of a diesel engine on a vessel for export; the  diesel engine manufacturing plant sought help from the shipyard  to repair it. Chen Wensong immediately ordered the relevant  leading members to send the shipyard's best welders to take  charge of it without setting out any condition. In addition,  the overtime differentials and bonuses for the welders in  question were all taken care of by the shipyard itself. After  20 days of hard work, the shipyard workers fulfilled the task  and the engine was repaired; consequently the good reputation of  China shipbuilding products was maintained.    Dalian Shipyard has always possessed the fine tradition of  party-government solidarity. After Chen Wensong took over the  director's office, he placed very strict requirements on himself  in every aspect and at all times. In a 1992 Director's Work  Summary, he wrote: "The solidarity between the leading members  of the party committee, the administration, and the workers'  trades unions is the prerequisite for the healthy development of  the shipyard's situation, with its work continuously improving.  In our shipyard, the chief responsible persons of the party  committee and the committee, administration, and workers' trades  unions are able to unite as one." At the routine meeting for  the shipyard directors, over which Chen Wensong presided, he  always invited the participation of the leading members of the  party committee and the workers' trades unions to jointly  discuss the shipyard's major affairs.    Chen Wensong had been chief architect, chief supervisor in  manufacturing, team leader for vessel delivery, and chief  overseer on site, with many of the vessels being awarded  national gold or silver prizes. Some of his theses on building  modern berths and dockyards, as well as new shipbuilding  technology, attracted the attention of ocean shipping and  academic circles as well as top-echelon state leadership. Time  and again he provided opportunities for others to be assessed  for senior professional titles. However, the title of  "national-level middle-aged and young expert with conspicuous  contributions" was specially approved for him by the relevant  state department, on the report submitted by the shipyard and  city leadership without his knowledge when he was on his death  bed.    Chen Wensong's home was very simple, displaying no  high-grade  furniture or electric home appliances. Aside from a color TV  set, there was no camera, recorder, audio or video recorder.    Nevertheless, he left a very precious spiritual wealth.    Chen Wensong was a famous "Three-Seven cadre"; he started  work at 0700, called it a day at 1900 and, for many years, he  would accept only a monthly seven-yuan bonus.    With the exception of occasions involving foreign affairs,  Chen Wensong was always in his overalls and safety hat, placing  himself among the workers. He persisted in the shipyard's  system of cadres participating in manual labor; when he was a  workshop cadre, his record of manual labor exceeded 100 days  each year; when he became an office cadre, his record of manual  labor exceeded 25 days a year; and when he become a cadre at  factory-level, his record of manual labor was not less than 20  days.    All the waiters at the Beijing China Shipbuilding Industry  General Company guest house knew that Director Chen was the  "most important guest" with the least requirements; he would  never pick a better room so long as there was a bed for him to  sleep on. Once, Chen Wensong went to Guangzhou for talks and  the shipowner made arrangements for him to stay at the White  Swan Hotel; however, he would not stay there but was bent on  booking into a small hotel and "a room for three" at that. With  tears in his eyes, Wang Anguo, the shipyard operational  department head, recalled: "On that occasion, the shipyard  accepted an order worth 100 million yuan but Director Chen would  not think of the expense of a hotel single room!"    In recent years, the shipyard authorities built a number of  residential buildings for staffers and workers, while providing  a thousand or so households with gas tanks. Wang Xuejin, an  electrical workshop worker said: "I have two children, one big  boy and one big girl, and our living quarters seemed a bit  crowded; somehow Director Chen heard about our situation and  allotted me a large three-bedroom unit. Only recently I found  out that Director Chen had a big boy and a big girl, too, in  addition to his two old parents; however, his housing conditions  were poorer than mine, a common worker."  <H6>  III. </H6>   An extraordinarily big storm attacked the Liaodong  Peninsula.    At around 2000 on 1 September 1992, Chen Wensong had just  completed his report to the relevant leading member of the  Ministry of Personnel and returned home. He got a telephone  call from the shipyard saying that water had flooded No. 207  warehouse in the Xianglujiao new area.    Director Chen waded in the flooded warehouse, carrying sand  bags to block the water while directing people and trucks to  hurriedly move equipment and raw materials away. At this  particular moment, he felt pains in his chest and trembled all  over; beads of sweat ran down his brow and face.    At dawn, the rush to deal with the emergency was over.  Director Chen drove his car straight from the No. 207 warehouse  to the shipyard area to inspect every berth, warehouse, and  workshop along the waterfront that stretched 10 li. In the  storm he strove, together with the workers and staffers  accompanying him, giving orders while pushing a "great crane"  that had been swept away by the waves to a safe zone. When the  sun rose, he went to the office and began a new day's work    Back in early April 1992, Chen Wensong felt a dull pain in  the left side of his abdomen. He went to the hospital for a  checkup and it was found that there was a lump, 2 by 2.8 mm,  between his liver and stomach. The doctor suggested an  operation for further examination. At that time, Luo Yumin,  deputy director and concurrently the shipyard's chief engineer  was hospitalized for emergency treatment of metastasis cancer;  on the eve of "1 May," a vessel was to be launched and another  was to be delivered so Director Chen was really too busy! Thus,  the checkup was put off.    By July, he often felt dizzy, thus he asked a doctor from  the  factory hospital to give him an infusion [shu ye 6551 3210]. He  persisted in his work.    It was a holiday on 15 July. Engineer Liu Shande, the  shipyard technology section chief was looking for Director Chen  for a chat. He could not find him anywhere around his residence  and, in the end, he went to the director's office and found the  director reading documents while having his infusion.    By 3 September, his case had actually grown very serious but  Chen Wensong had already been working almost continuously for 48  hours. This tough guy eventually collapsed.    The related state department, and the provincial as well as  city leadership gave instructions to do everything possible to  save Chen Wensong's life. However, the experts and professors  who made the diagnosis report on Director Chen's case were  shocked: The lump which had not been properly defined in the  past had now developed into a rare case of choriocarcinoma and  had expanded to such internal organs as the stomach, liver, and  lungs.    On his deathbed, Chen Wensong expressed a communist's  sentiments to the party organization: "My thanks to the party  and government leadership at various levels for their concern  for me during this period. Should the treatment fail, I will  have no complaints whatsoever. I will leave everything to do  with my family to the organization's arrangements; I personally  require nothing. I hope that everyone will do a good job from  now on; the leading body should unite as one to do a good job of  the shipyard. I have not done enough work at the shipyard, and  I want very much to go on working...."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "hjs": "Kinkel: Conciliation Among </F> Differing Views"]    [Text] Bonn, 8-9 Jan -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of  the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], has said that,  regarding the issue of easing arms export legislation, "things  should not be forced." Kinkel conceded that the matter  consisted of many components. The industry's anxiousness to  produce and export arms contrasted with the political will to  prevent the FRG from becoming "world champion for armament  exports." It is necessary to achieve conciliation between "the  two poles."    With this statement, the federal foreign minister intervened  in the ongoing discussion on easing German export restrictions  for arms. For months, a Federal Government working group has  been thinking of how changes in Germany's arms export practice  could be achieved in the course of liberalization within the  framework of the European Union [EU]. The members of this  working group, which is headed by Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt, share the view that the other EU members will not,  under any circumstances, be willing to adopt Germany's very  restrictive arms export regulations. Experts within the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU]/[CSU]  Bundestag group have also discussed the liberalization of arms  exports for some time.    The Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce  [DIHT] was meanwhile also intervened in the debate. In a  statement, the DIHT emphasized that, regarding the necessary  easing of German export restrictions, one should not start with  armament products, because it would mean taking the second step  before the first in this sensitive area. In the DIHT's view,  one should start with the so-called dual-use goods, that is to  say products that can be used for both military and civilian  purposes. Many more jobs are dependent on the export of these  products than on armament exports. Moreover, in the sphere of  dual-use goods there is a danger of the German economy being  uncoupled from the international market. Therefore, the DIHT  requests that restrictions be first eased for these goods.    Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  accused the government of having a new armament policy in mind.  Considerations within the CDU are proof of it, it was said. SPD  Bundestag deputy Klaus Kuebler said that the objective of  harmonizing arms exports within the EU member states was  misleading. In this connection, Kuebler said that it was  politically and morally irresponsible for the Federal Government  to intend to supply war ships to Indonesia. Thus, Bonn  "brazenly" was ignoring the resolutions of the Western European  Union [WEU], which were also supported by the Federal Government.</p>

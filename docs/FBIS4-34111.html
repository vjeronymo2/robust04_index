			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan Carlos Alfonso] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina today defended his country's right to  present its viewpoints and opinions within the pluralist  context, which should distinguish the discussions among the  Ibero-American leaders.    During a news conference with Cuban reporters, the minister  said the island has its own opinion on issues such as democracy  and human rights, saying: "If these issues are to be discussed,  my country has plenty to say."    Robaina said "the important thing is the possibility of  having opinions and points of view on issues that can lead to  discussions; in this way we would be taking advantage of the  Colombian Government's suggestion to turn the working sessions  into true debates, not just be limited to previously prepared  statements brought from outside."    Robaina affirmed the Cuban delegation has received dozens of  messages congratulating it for the way the chief of the Cuban  revolution "took the bull by the horns" in his speech late  yesterday. In his address, Fidel Castro thanked Brazilian  President Itamar Franco for broaching the issue of the U.S.  blockade against the island.    The chief of Cuba's diplomacy said "Cuba did not come to  Cartagena to hear a unanimous acceptance of our opinions but,  rather, to have them included in the process of analysis as  well. We have the right and the experience to express our  opinion."    The monotony of the meetings was broken when Cuban President  Fidel Castro cited the issue of the U.S. blockade against his  country, which the United Nations has condemned.    The Cuban leader's participation created great expectation,  as it is expected this issue, and several others the island's  delegation presented, will be discussed during the last portion  of the presidents' session, which continues behind closed doors.</p>

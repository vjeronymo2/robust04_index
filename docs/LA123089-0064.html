			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP MANIFESTO LEADS THE LIST OF '80S SINGLES  </P> <P> Who imagined seven years ago that a New York rap record that failed even to  crack the national Top 40 would stand as the most noteworthy single of the  decade?  </P> <P> Hailed by pop critics but little-known initially outside the emerging East  Coast rap scene, "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five was  a hugely influential record in the development of rap, the most persuasive new  pop sound of the '80s.  </P> <P> The dramatic chronicle of the tension and despair of ghetto life also outlined  a series of social issues, from homelessness to gang crime, that would continue  to be addressed by rap and other pop artists through the decade.  </P> <P> The first challenge of pop is to be appealing musically, but the most  compelling records also convey a strong point of view. That doesn't always mean  social commentary, but at least a passionate and convincing tone that combines  imagination, craft and heart.  </P> <P> The best singles of the '80s:  </P> <P> 1. Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five's "The Message" (Sugar Hill, 1982)  -- This blueprint was studied by such varied and acclaimed rap forces as  Run-DMC, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A and De La Soul. Sample  line:  </P> <P>  'Cause it's all about money  </P> <P>  Ain't a damned thing funny  </P> <P>  You have to have a con  </P> <P>  In this land of milk and honey.  </P> <P>  2. U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" (Island, 1987) -- Typical  of the cautious idealism of the '80s, this majestic single by the Irish rock  group carried a humble, almost wary edge that was shaped by the  disillusionments of the '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> 3. Prince's "Controversy" (Warner Bros., 1981) -- To underscore Prince's  position as the premier hit-maker of the '80s, two of his singles are included  on today's list. This one, a mocking slap at rigid pop and social attitudes,  introduced his provocative sex 'n' salvation vision.  </P> <P> 4. Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" (Epic, 1983) -- Sparked by a captivating  vocal and one of the most striking rhythm tracks ever in pop, this bizarre  riddle about temptation and guilt was a masterpiece of pop dynamics.  </P> <P> 5. Prince's "When Doves Cry" (Warner Bros., 1984) -- Or, to underscore Prince's  productivity, perhaps "Little Red Corvette," "1999," "Purple Rain," "Kiss,"  "Mountains" or "U Got the Look."  </P> <P> 6. Bruce Springsteen's "Brilliant Disguise" (Columbia, 1987) -- "Born in the  U.S.A." was the more powerful anthem, but this bittersweet track from "Tunnel  of Love" was perhaps the most darkly confessional song about commitment and  doubt ever to make the national Top 10.  </P> <P> 7. Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine" (Geffen, 1988) -- An amazingly tender  and affecting reflection on love and innocence from the so-called bad-boys of  '80s hard rock.  </P> <P> 8. Run-DMC's "Walk This Way" (Profile, 1986) -- A spirited remake of the old  Aerosmith hit that was a major break in the Cold War between rap and rock.  </P> <P> 9. R.E.M.'s "Radio Free Europe" (I.R.S., 1983) -- First released independently  in 1981, "Radio Free Europe" helped ignite the alternative/college music scene  that produced much of the decade's freshest music, much of it patterned after  the wonderfully appealing, almost dreamlike instrumental textures of this  single.  </P> <P> 10. Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" (Geffen, 1989) -- Just as he  co-wrote (with Glenn Frey) "The Long Run," the Eagles song that was a graceful  farewell to the '70s, Henley co-wrote (with Bruce Hornsby) the song that serves  as a benediction of sorts for the '80s.  </P> <P> Colleague Dennis Hunt picks Jackson's "Billie Jean" as the No. 1 single of the  '80s, followed in order by Prince's "1999," Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing,"  Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative," Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis Eyes," Tone Loc's  "Wild Thing," the Police's "Every Breath You Take," Manhattan Transfer's  "Birdland," Billy Ocean's "Caribbean Queen" and Club Nouveau's "Lean on Me."  His choice for single of 1989: Tone Loc's "Funky Cold Medina."  </P></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Observer in Lebanon: Price of peace And no one wants to see the 30,000 strong Lebanese army, nor indeed the remaining 30,000 or so Syrian troops, idle. Sheikh Naim Kassem, a founder of Hizbollah, which still has an estimated 3,500 fighters dotted around Lebanon, as well as MPs, ominously says: 'The price of peace will be greater than that of war.' Another Beiruti suggests: 'The Syrians are still here to protect Hizbollah, who would otherwise be wiped out by the Lebanese army.' Meanwhile, Hizbollah contents itself by trading shots with Israel in the south. A lasting peace? Don't count any chickens.</p>

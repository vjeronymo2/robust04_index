			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / US opposes Serb move to divide Sarajevo US OFFICIALS were yesterday trying to apply pressure on the United Nations to oppose attempts by Serb irregulars to divide the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, along ethnic lines. Concerns are growing that the Serbs are seeking to link this move with negotiations with UN representatives on re-opening the capital's airport. Officials said heavily armed Serb irregulars were consolidating their positions in the north and west of the city, and near the airport, by the day. Serb units have blockaded Sarajevo for the past 77 days to prevent any food and humanitarian supplies from reaching its 300,000 inhabitants. 'You can see exactly what is happening,' a western diplomat said. 'The Serbs are taking advantage of any ceasefire to re-group, and also give the impression they are acting in good faith. This is nonsense. It must be stopped,' he added. Bosnian officials yesterday said 7,000 people had died in the fighting in Sarajevo and other parts of the former Yugoslav republic since early April. A UN official said the world body had neither the mandate nor the means to stop Sarajevo from being divided. 'Our mandate is to negotiate an agreement which will allow us to re-open the airport and start the airlift of food into the city,' he explained. Another UN official said the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, promised to start withdrawing from Sarajevo airport today to allow relief flights into the city. The agreement was made as the city came under renewed shelling and heavy bombardment from the surrounding hills held by Serb irregulars. The Serb forces have agreed to withdraw their heavy artillery batteries 6km from the airport, while an earlier arrangement, backed by the Bosnian presidency, wanted a 20km demilitarised zone. Western diplomats said this would still allow the Serb forces to keep large supplies of weapons close to Sarajevo. 'This means they can bombard the city, and consolidate their green line any time,' a diplomat said. 'No wonder the Territorial Defence (consisting of Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb, and Croat communities) are angry with this agreement.' The Bosnian presidency, led by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, has repeatedly called for international military intervention to prevent the city from being divided. Meanwhile Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, said he was 'concerned that all-out war would spread to Bosnia.' A Bosnian official asked yesterday: 'What does he think has been taking place here for the past three months?'</p>

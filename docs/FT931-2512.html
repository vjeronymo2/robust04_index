			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Housing market activity increases: Homebuyers show more confidence REPORTS from estate agents of increasing activity in the housing market emerged in building societies' lending figures yesterday, with a 40 per cent rise in the value of new commitments to mortgages during February. Although the value of new commitments to mortgages was only just above the figure for February last year, the figure rose to Pounds 2.72bn compared to Pounds 1.55bn in January. 'The figures support the reports of an increase in activity reported by housebuilders and estate agents since the turn of the year,' said Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association. Mr Boleat said that housebuyers' confidence was still fragile, but had strengthened over recent months. He said the doubling of the stamp duty threshold from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 in the Budget would give a further 'modest boost'. The fact that housebuying activity has accelerated only recently was underlined by gross mortgage advances at Pounds 1.92bn for February - just above the Pounds 1.79bn for January and below December's Pounds 2.14bn. The association said the government's Pounds 750m scheme announced in November to revive the housing market by giving housing associations funds to buy empty homes accounted for only Pounds 200m of the Pounds 2.72bn new commitments figure. The net inflow of retail funds to societies fell to Pounds 208m in February from Pounds 363m in January. The association emphasised that this was the third consecutive monthly inflow after a poor 1992, when the yearly inflow was only Pounds 295m. Net retail receipts were up from Pounds 145m in February last year. Societies' funds were badly affected last year by five months of net outflows. Those dampened retail funding from a Pounds 5.8bn inflow in 1991 and a Pounds 6.56bn inflow in 1990. The fall in base rates since last October has increased funding pressure on societies. Mr Boleat said societies had added to their range of savings products in response to competition from National Savings and unit trusts.</p>

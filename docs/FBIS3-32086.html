Niehaus, who is also working to replace Brazilian Joao  Clemente Baena Soares at the head of the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that  Colombia's intense efforts at the inauguration ceremony of new  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina were their "last  attempts" in this direction. Central American support for  Niehaus was, he asserted, "absolute and total." "I feel that  this (the efforts made in Honduras) was the decisive point and  that the Colombian foreign minister (Noemi Sanin) will recommend  that the president desist from running as an official candidate,  because he has no possibility of winning the race," Niehaus  added.    Alfredo Cristiani, president of El Salvador, Ramiro de Leon,  of Guatemala, and the new Honduran chief of state publicly  expressed support of Niehaus for the OAS post. Nicaraguan  President Violeta Chamorro, who also attended Reina's  inauguration, termed "perfect" Gaviria's desire and, showing a  change of position, did not say who she would support alleging  that "the vote is secret."    Niehaus told ACAN-EFE that Nicaragua has reiterated its  support and that the Nicaraguan president's expressions appear  to be "diplomatic words" in view of Gaviria's presence in  Tegucigalpa. The Colombian chief of state was the only non  Central American president who attended the Honduran  inauguration and took advantage of his visit to make a stopover  in Panama and to visit El Salvador today. Panamanian President  Guillermo Endara, who did not go to Honduras, reiterated last  week that Panama will vote for Niehaus. He said so during the  visit by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to sound out possible  support for Gaviria to the OAS post.    The Costa Rican foreign minister said that he has 23 votes  guaranteed for the 27 March election while only 18 are needed to  win.    Former Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, a  third candidate to the post, told ACAN-EFE that the figures  cited by Niehaus "are inflated."    For his part, the Costa Rican foreign minister insisted  today  he has the support of the six Central American countries, the 13  countries of the Caribbean, who are committed to him in a letter  of the regional economic cooperation organization, Caricom  [Caribbean Common Market], and also the support of the Dominican  Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. Niehaus insisted that  it is a "just" desire based on the principle of rotation, that  Central America and the Caribbean occupy, for the first time in  history, the OAS secretariat.    Burelli said that to try to "subregionalize" the  organization  and impose a numeric force of small countries on the democratic  importance and economic support of the large countries could do  away with the OAS or promote a "small security council" with  UN-style veto power.    Niehaus, however, rejected the power that the large  countries  have had in OAS executive posts and recalled that the  organization is based on the equality of states, regardless of  their size and population. Although he considered it acceptable  that Burelli vie for the post since Venezuela has never held it,  he stated it would be "unacceptable" to give it to Colombia "for  the third time."    Regarding the possibility of Gaviria as a candidate,  something that has not been made official, he agreed with  Burelli that there would be an anomaly to elect him secretary in  March for him to take office in June when he is not scheduled to  leave his post until August.    Niehaus said that he hopes to leave the Foreign Ministry on  8  May, when the new Costa Rican Government that is elected 6  February takes office. "We must give an opportunity to other  countries and other subregions, and not only South America,"  Niehaus said, expressing his intention not to go up for  reelection after the first five years in the secretariat in  order to give a chance to other nations. "After Central  America, a Caribbean country should be next to occupy the  secretariat, then a South American one," he said.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Personal View: Tender loving care for better workers - The company of the future will put more emphasis on looking after human assets What will be the shape of tomorrow's companies? Almost certainly they will look and feel very different from today. If they do not Britain's competitiveness will surely sink. The 1993 world competitiveness survey by the World Economic Forum put Britain 16th out of 22 countries, with particularly low scores for innovation, science and technology, management and people - precisely the assets needed in a constantly changing world and when applied intelligence is the main source of future wealth. For one thing, companies will be much smaller: ' 1/2 x 2 x 3' is becoming the essential formula for those who want to remain competitive in an interconnected world - half as many people, paid twice as well (because they keep the best), producing three times as much added value. Then repeat the exercise; it is possible - an estimated 65 per cent of most company's activities do not add value. No longer are so many people needed to make things happen. Those left become crucial human capital. It will not, however, be easy to define or describe many companies. They will be a web of alliances, joint projects, arrangements and pacts. More risks will be shared. Companies will have centres but rather than head offices they will be small centres designed on the principle of 'reverse delegation' with the centre only doing what the parts on their own cannot do and which they, therefore, delegate to the centre. Companies will be federations of bits and pieces, joined together in different ways for different purposes. As a result, it will be increasingly difficult for shareholders to know what they are buying into, or to what sort of risks they are exposed. It will be all the more difficult because the real assets of the business, the intellectual assets, will still be largely unquantifiable, unless accountancy groups come up with new measures. In the best businesses today the market value of the business is three or four times the tangible assets and, in a good manufacturing company, labour costs should not be more than 10 per cent of the product price. That leaves lots of unmeasured space. Shareholders will be more careful about long-term money and more likely to want some money today rather than possibly more money later. Contrary, therefore, to most prescriptions for better corporate governance, we may see companies edging further away from shareholders in an attempt to give more emphasis to the long-term future of the business. Directors may see themselves as mainly accountable to their own people who have a real incentive to build a better future. To put it another way, when human capital becomes more important than financial capital, it will be the human capital which calls the tunes. This may be a gradual change but it will be profound. In the end, the driving motive for most senior managers is to build a sustainable enterprise. To achieve this and to recognise their new accountability to human capital, companies will look for ways to turn key people into quasi-partners. Some will hope to do that by more consultation. But ultimately partnership means money, not talk. That is likely to entail not share option schemes, which are a form of risk-free betting, but genuine share ownership, perhaps with double voting rights as in some continental companies, and with substantial shares in each year's added value. This will not be primarily an incentive for employees, rather will it be an expression of their membership rights. Some companies may decide to venture further down this membership route, limiting voting rights to large investors (owning more than 1 per cent, perhaps) or to their own people. It will always be a cautious experiment, however, for fear of alienating the wider market which will not want to see its rights eroded too far. The formal aim of the company would still be as it has always been: 'to add value'. But value would no longer be determined solely by the price of the shares, but by other measures of the long-term health of the business - measures which would be more relevant to the membership than to temporary, smaller investors. To continue to add ever more value, companies will have to be 'inclusive', building long-term relationships with customers, suppliers and the community. But all the main constituents would then pull in one direction - the sustainable future of the business. Tomorrow's companies will do all this because they will need to - not because of some ideological pressure. If they do not treat central people as partners and members, those people - whose talents provide the intellectual assets of the business - will be free to treat the company as a stepping-stone. Without the bonds of membership, companies will have to make do with 'actor career' characters hired for projects or on short-term contracts and moving on to other companies when the projects or contracts end. The modern American executive is said to change jobs 10 times in a career. Modern Britain may not be far behind. A world of such connections bodes ill for wealth creation. Joseph Schumpeter predicted that capitalism would fail when it ceased to draw on any sense of 'moral allegiance'. Britain faces that danger now. 'Actors' careers' and individualist tracks also put the onus on the individual to manage his or her life. If they choose to rent themselves to a company, the company will milk them. If the individuals do not like the milking they can always leave - or ask for more money to stay. That way the ' 1/2 x 2 x 3' formula translates as half as many people paid twice as well to work three times as long. '24-7's' (24 hours a day, seven days a week) they call them in Los Angeles. More accurately, they are cramming the 100,000 hours of a normal working life into 25 years instead of 50, which makes for 75-hour weeks and burn-out at 45. Milking assets to that extent makes only short-term sense. Work can become addictive, until we lose ourselves in our busy-ness. But boring people are wasting assets and addicted people lose perspective. A membership ethos would encourage a company to take more care to cosset its assets, to invest in them as well as to work them, to encourage such things as educational terms and sabbaticals, maternity/paternity breaks, to allow people to organise chunks of their lives in different ways, and to respect part-time wisdom and expertise as much as full-time energy. If they do not, companies may find that they are squeezing out most of their women, as well as some of their men, who want a more balanced life. The idea of membership is not the same as the life-time employment of Japan, for the contract can be ended by either party, but it is edging that way. The idea of a more restricted role for the temporary investor is not the full continental European model, but it has the same vibrations. Meanwhile the Japanese and continental Europeans are gradually loosening their models of the company and of the capital market, becoming more like Anglo-American examples. In an increasingly interconnected world, evolutionary theory suggests different species tend to converge, while retaining distinctive plumages. Given where the UK is starting from, it would do us no harm to give evolution a push. The author is visiting professor at London Business School.

			<p>BFN     [Text] "I intend to create a strong center in the  newly-elected parliament in order to oppose both the right-and  left-oriented forces," President of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUIE) and Ukraine's ex-premier  Leonid Kuchma announced at a press conference on 6 March in Lvov.    During the first round of voting to the Ukrainian parliament  Communists gained a substantial success in Eastern Ukraine and  National Democrats and National Radicals -- in Western Ukraine.    The second voting in elections to the parliament will be  held  9-10 April.    In Kuchma's opinion, Ukraine "has already crossed the  threshhold beyond which is mass industrial recession." He  placed the responsibility for this on the government and  National Bank.    As Kuchma said, he will insist "on the need for a single  economic space without which the republics of the former USSR  cannot survive."</p>

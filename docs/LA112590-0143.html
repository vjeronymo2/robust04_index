			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHULA VISTA ROLLS PAST MIRA MESA, 35-6  </P> <P> The wicked temptation is to assume the Chula Vista football team was the loser  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Host Chula Vista stomped Mira Mesa, 35-6, in a 3-A quarterfinal playoff game to  earn a date with top-ranked Morse next Friday in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Some fun.  </P> <P> "Well, I know we're going to be outmanned," Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen  said. "We'd have to play a perfect game to beat those guys. But if we have to  go out, we'll go out against the No. 1 team."  </P> <P> The Spartans sent Mira Mesa (9-3) out with relative ease Saturday. Using a  powerful running game sparked by running backs Steve Gomez and Neviett  Richardson, Chula Vista (10-2) scored on three of its first four possessions to  take control.  </P> <P> Gomez finished with 160 yards in 20 carries and four touchdowns. Richardson  added 120 yards in 18 carries. Throughout the game, Gomez ran through wide gaps  in the line and then trampled over anybody who got in his way. He made up his  mind early on to avenge Chula Vista's 6-0 loss to Mira Mesa during the regular  season.  </P> <P> "I knew at the beginning of the game they weren't going to bring me down," he  said. "I was fired up."  </P> <P> And Mira Mesa's fire was extinguished in the first quarter when its top  offensive threat, running back Wayne Pittman, left the game with an ankle  sprain. Pittman was the county's third leading rusher during the regular season  with 1,604 yards. He played three downs Saturday.  </P> <P> "Everybody kind of lost their spirit when I got hurt," he said. "I don't know  why, because the game shouldn't revolve around one person."  </P> <P> Chula Vista took a 15-0 halftime lead on a 41-yard Gomez touchdown run, a  22-yard field goal by Rod Rodriguez and an eight-yard Gomez touchdown run after  a 40-yard drive. Gomez had 107 of his game-high rushing totals by halftime.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa made a brief bid to get back into the game on their first possession  of the third quarter, driving to Chula Vista's 32 before quarterback Mike  Bovee's pass was intercepted at the 25 by linebacker Donnie Edwards and  returned to the Mira Mesa 17. Gomez covered all 17 yards on a run up the middle  for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead. From then on, the Spartans coasted.  </P></p>

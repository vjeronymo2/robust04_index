			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-COUNSELOR PLEADS GUILTY IN SEX ATTACK  </P> <P> A former Foothill Rehabilitation Center counselor pleaded guilty Tuesday in San  Fernando Municipal Court to sodomizing a psychiatric patient in his care.  </P> <P> Under a plea bargain with prosecutors, Roger Branson, 43, of Valencia will be  sentenced to no more than one year in County Jail, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Kenneth L. Barshop.  </P> <P> Branson was originally charged with one count of sodomizing a mentally disabled  person and one count of forcible oral copulation. If he had been convicted of  both charges he could have received a maximum sentence of 16 years in state  prison, Barshop said.  </P> <P> However, there were "problems with proof," Barshop said.  </P> <P> Deputy Sheriff Pam Schrick, who investigated the case, said the victim was  committed to the psychiatric hospital involuntarily and prosecutors feared he  would have trouble testifying at a trial. Barshop said Branson had no prior  criminal record.  </P> <P> The incident occurred on Aug. 26, 1988, Schrick said. Branson took the victim  out of the hospital, saying he wanted to treat him to a birthday dinner.  Instead, Branson took the patient to his home, where he sexually assaulted him,  Schrick said.  </P> <P> The victim reported the incident after Branson returned him to the hospital.  Branson was fired shortly after and was arrested Sept. 19.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, he was teaching at Saugus High School as a permanent  substitute, Schrick said.  </P></p>

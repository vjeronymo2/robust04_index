			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Japanese chip makers plan to boost capacity Japan's six leading electronics companies plan to increase investment in semiconductor making capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined Y461bn (Pounds 2.93bn) in the year to next March. The increase, the first since the economic slowdown began nearly three years ago for some groups, is in response to a surge in demand for personal computers in the US and Japan. This is one of the few Japanese sectors to show growth at a time when industrial production continues to bump along the bottom. Industrial output declined 1.4 per cent between March and April, according to preliminary figures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday. Most of the new electrical industry investment, outlined in the companies' recent annual results, is for production of 16-megabit dynamic random access memories (Drams). Demand is driven by the fast growth in Windows and other advanced software, which need more memory than older programs able to run on 4-megabit Drams. The personal computer market grew by 16 per cent in the US and 10.6 per cent in Japan last year, according to Dataquest. NEC, the leading producer of 16-megabit Drams, plans to triple monthly capacity from 1m units now to 3m next March, with investment of Y90bn this year. Most of that will be at its Roseville, California plant, whose output at present levels of several tens of thousands per month is booked for the year ahead, said an NEC spokesman. Hitachi is planning to challenge NEC's leadership by boosting its capacity to 3m units per month by next March. Fujitsu has earmarked more than Y100bn for investment in memory chips, while Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric, plan the first increase in chip investment in three years. The decline in industrial output announced yesterday represents a rebound from the 4.6 per cent increase between February and March. Manufacturing output will fall again this month but recover in June, forecast Miti officials. Despite the production decline, stocks of unsold goods shrank by 0.7 per cent, the third monthly decline running, evidence the decline might be near the bottom, said Miti. Month on month, production has been fluctuating, showing alternate months of rise and fall since last August, a reflection of the disparate fortunes of different industrial sectors. This was highlighted yesterday by the latest figures from Japan's car producers, still burdened with overcapacity. Exports of all vehicles fell by 12.6 per cent last month, from April 1993, the 13th monthly fall running, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.</p>

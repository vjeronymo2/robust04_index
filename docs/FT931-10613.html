			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (10): Objectives prove elusive - Agriculture IRAN was self-sufficient in food in the 1950s but a number of factors, including the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's land reform programme, meant that by the time of the revolution in 1979, Iran was a net importer of food. The Islamic government aimed to make Iran self-sufficient by 1992 and to halt rural to urban migration but it has fallen far short of these objectives. There have been some successes but poor planning and changes of policy towards ownership of land, have impeded the efficient use of available resources. Only in the most recent (1989/90-1993/94) five-year plan has agriculture been given priority over industry. Iran's cultivated areas have expanded minimally since the revolution. In 1978, the area of land cultivation was 17.8m hectares and the figure only increased fractionally to 18.5m ha in 1987. An Agriculture Ministry official, while reporting that Kerman province topped those producing non-oil exports with its exports of pistachios, dates and citrus fruits last year, bemoaned the fact that 400,000 hectares of fertile land had become desert and 55 per cent of the 120,000m cu m of water reserves was wasted due to negligence. Iran imports between 30 and 50 per cent of its food requirements. The government expects food imports to double by the year 2006 if the birth rate continues its present rate of growth. Food imports cost the country about Dollars 3bn a year. The government has not been able to stem the tide of migrants into the cities. Out of a total population of 58m, 43 per cent live in the countryside. Migration to the cities has accelerated consistently . Last month, the government said that if the trend continued, the countryside would lose its productive strength. The number of people employed in agricultural activities gradually dropped from 38 per cent to 29 per cent of the rural population in the 30 years to 1986, while rural unemployment continues to grow at a faster rate than in the cities. The Jihad-e-Sazandeghi (Construction Crusade), set up after the revolution to send young men into the countryside to build roads and spread education, said in its annual report published last year: 'The migration of villagers to urban areas is to a large extent due to lack of even the basic essentials necessary for their livelihood, such as educational, medical and recreational facilities.' Last year, Mr Issa Kalantari, agriculture minister, outlined some of the challenges facing the agricultural sector. 'Lack of agricultural specialists was one of the main problems as was a shortage of resources. As the national five-year development plan was being compiled we did not think of the bureaucracy of provisioning, that is, we did not meet its complexities,' he said. The plan called for farmlands to be consolidated at the rate of 150,000ha in 1989 and 1990, and 200,000ha in 1991. But because machinery was not delivered, the consolidation in the first year was nil, in the second year it was 79,000ha and in the third year 100,000 hectares, said Mr Kalantari. He said that farmers had only been provided with 14,000 of the 105,000 tractors assumed in the plan while only 12,000 of the projected 61,000 tillers had been provided. Shortfalls in funding have also been a problem. The government has focused on the intensification of agriculture by trying to improve yields. Some 60 per cent of the area under cultivation for important farming crops is allocated to wheat. Farmers are encouraged by government buying at fixed prices. In 1990, the government increased the support price of wheat and provided agricultural equipment at the official exchange rate of Dollars 1 to IR70 rather than the floating exchange rate of about IR1,400. It also granted banking facilities at the preferential rate. Other measures include a new law on direct taxation, brought in a year ago, under which all revenues from agriculture were made exempt from tax for an unspecified period. Wheat production has risen substantially to 10.4m tonnes this year, up from 8.75m tonnes in 1990-91 and 5.8m tonnes in 1989. The government hopes to be self-sufficient in wheat by March 1994. However, lack of storage is a problem and projects are under way for the construction of more silos. In the year to March 1993, there were rises, too, in production of barley, sugar-beet and pulses but declines in maize and cotton. The guaranteed prices to farmers combined with food subsidies have proved an expensive burden on the state's resources. Last year, President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said: 'We are paying a heavy price for subsidies. Our people receive bread practically free of charge. We buy wheat at IR150 a kilo, convert it into flour and pass it on to the people at IR10 a kilo.' The other notable agricultural success has been the work of the Jihad, particularly in the early years of the revolution, in taking electricity and water to the villages and extending the road network throughout the countryside. In the 10 years to 1992, the Jihad built 46,000km of roads and 1,000m of bridges. It expects 70 per cent of rural population to be linked by road by the end of the five-year plan. The number of villages supplied with electricity has fallen back since 1985. In its annual report for 1992, the Jihad said: 'The declining curve from 1364 (1985) onwards has been caused by the shortage in construction material resulting from foreign exchange problems.' The Jihad's frustration in dealing with the system are apparent in its comments on shortcomings in the agricultural sector. In its report it said: 'Measures taken by the government have failed to meet the basic needs of the rural population properly, for various reasons such as lack of clear planning and strategy for development and concentration of all facilities in urban areas (especially Tehran).' Until Iran can deal with the bottlenecks in the agricultural sector, it is unlikely that it can meet its objectives of food self-sufficiency and rural growth in the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Phana Chanwirot and Surachai Chupaka] </F>   [Text] Hawaii -- Thailand is to permit five new foreign  bank branches by 1997 according to its latest offer to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), Finance Minister  Tharin Nimmanhemin said here yesterday.    The proposal, which also includes the country's agreement to  treat ATM machines operated by foreign bank branches on equal  terns with local banks, has been passed on to Lloyd Bentsen, the  US treasury secretary.    "Secretary Bentsen welcomes our proposal," Tharin said  yesterday. He is leading a delegation of Thai officials to the  meeting of finance ministers of 17 member countries of  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec), which will start the  official meeting on Saturday.    The US government has been pushing for financial  liberalization and market access under the new Gatt round. The  new Gatt round due to be signed in the middle of April, hinges  on the US demand that financial market access should be tied to  the Gatt signing.    The US is understood to be angry with other countries'  refusal to meet financial market access demands on the ground  that the Americans have the most liberalized market in the  world. It is not clear yet what the US would do if the financial  liberalization is not resolved by the middle of next month.    Tharin said Thailand will be doing more than other Asean  countries in opening up the financial market. He said five  licencees of Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF)  will be upgraded to full branches by 1997. Thailand also told  Bentsen that it is separating finance and securities companies  which would allow foreign financial institutions to hold a 49  per cent stake in a securities company and up to 25 per cent in  a finance company. Currently, foreigners can only hold up to 25  per cent of a finance and securities company. But Thai  authorities have yet to define the ATM status of foreign banks;  whether one machine will be counted as a branch or allowed to be  classified in general terms under the national ATM pool system.  "I don't mind either one or the other," Tharin said.    Meanwhile, the US is threatening to pass a law to withdraw  the most favoured nation status from countries which do not  yield to its market access demand. But such action would  contradict Gatt rules.    At the same time, Tharin said Asean will have to hasten the  implementation of Asean Free Trade Area (Afta)'s tariff cut  programme from 15 years to 10-12 years. This is because the  Gatt refuses to extend the 15-year tax cut process. The offer  was part of a package proposal improved on the old version  submitted to Gatt last December.</p>

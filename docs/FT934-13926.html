			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (5): Reason to feel cheerful - Patrick Harverson finds international business has sustained earnings growth for the banking sector IN BERMUDA, you do not have to look far for evidence that the island's banks are optimistic about their future. In Hamilton, the capital, the Bank of Butterfield is building 30,000 square feet of office space adjacent to its Front Street headquarters. A few streets away, the Bank of Bermuda is constructing a 75,000 square-foot office complex on Bermudiana Road, and round the corner on Church Street Bermuda Commercial Bank's home is receiving an expensive internal remodelling and facelift. The banks have good reason to feel confident. Although Bermuda's economy has been in recession for the past three years, the banks have not suffered unduly because their profitability has never been tied to the domestic business cycle. Instead they have been able to draw on their burgeoning international business to sustain earnings growth. Global forces are also working in their favour - as international political and economic barriers come down, and corporate and individual tax rates in the industrialised world go up, demand for the kind of offshore financial services Bermuda's banks offer is growing substantially. The two largest and oldest banks have posted steadily improving earnings in recent years. For the recent fiscal year, which ended on June 30, the Bank of Bermuda reported a 26 per cent increase in profits to Dollars 35.8m, although the results would have been even better but for an Dollars 8.7m provision the bank took to cover possible losses on its domestic loan book. Meanwhile the Bank of Butterfield reported a 12 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 30.1m. Although the the island's third bank, the relative newcomer Bermuda Commercial Bank (BCB), has struggled in recent years, its future looks brighter now that the UK banking group Barclays has sold its controlling stake to John Deuss, a Dutch oil trader and long-time Bermuda resident who plans to transform BCB into a niche bank that provides specialised services. Bermuda is unique among offshore financial domiciles in having a home-grown banking industry. Foreign banks are not allowed to operate on the island, and in their absence Bermuda's banks have mostly thrived. Yet domestic business represents only a fraction of their earnings. Instead, the banks earn their money from their international businesses  - institutional and individual trust and fund administration, global custody, foreign exchange and treasury, offshore advisory work for corporations and wealthy individuals, private banking for offshore clients - which are run either from Bermuda, or from overseas locations such as London, Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. While banks have seen most of their international businesses prosper, one important area - the offshore trust business - is giving them cause for concern, not because of weakening demand, but because of growing competition within Bermuda from foreign trust companies. Since the government - keen to promote the development of the island's financial services industry - pledged to end the banks' monopoly in the offshore trust business, the Bermuda Monetary Authority has granted trust licences to four foreign companies: Coutts and Schroders of the UK; Lombard Odier of Switzerland and Royal Trust of Canada. The move brought fierce opposition from the banks, which lobbied vigorously against opening up the trust business - going so far as to place full-page advertisements in the local paper outlining their case against deregulation. Yet the BMA was determined to push ahead. 'We saw it as a means of diversifying the country's income,' says Malcolm Williams, general manager of the BMA. Donald Lines, chief executive of the Bank of Bermuda, says they were worried that the newcomers would take existing business away from the banks: 'Our big concern was that they would divide, rather than add. Naturally, we were concerned. After all, it is our business. It's taken 50 years to build it.' The banks' concerns, however, fell on deaf ears. 'We asked the banks whether they would like 100 per cent of this table, or 15 per cent of this room,' says David Saul, Bermuda's combative minister of finance. The banks do, if somewhat sheepishly, admit that they have benefited from deregulation. 'The ones that are here are doing business with us, and we'll do business with them,' says Stephen Kempe, head of international and corporate banking at the Bank of Butterfield. The banks, however, have another concern about deregulation - that newcomers to the trust business could harm Bermuda's reputation by attracting the wrong kind of business to the island. 'The last thing we want to read in the newspaper is that some gambling organisation out of Las Vegas has formed a trust company in Bermuda,' says William Thomson, the Bank of Bermuda's executive vice president. 'That would not do us any good, because the kind of people we deal with don't like to associate with that kind of environment.' The BMA insists that it will continue to scrutinise carefully every trust company that applies to set up shop on the island. 'We don't exactly ask what size of socks the top executives are wearing, but we do ask for absolute details of the type of business that is coming in,' says Mr Williams. The opening up of the trust business still has some way to go, although Mr Williams says growth will be well managed. 'We have opened the door, but not allowed everybody to come through. Bermuda, being so small, has to be conscious of the effect that any development will have on the infrastructure. We haven't had them piling in. So far so good. Whether we will have to put a lid on, remains to be seen.' The second major development in the banking sector this year was the sale of the Bermuda Commercial Bank. BCB plays a special role on the island because when it was founded in 1969 it was Bermuda's only black-owned bank, and an important symbol of the island's racial mix. Ownership of the bank, however, has changed hands several times since then, while BCB struggled to find its way. Until this year, the controlling stake was owned by Barclays, which also supplied management under contract. The Barclays years, however, were not a great success - the perception on the island was that the UK bank was never really committed to BCB. So when Barclays decided in 1990 to put its stake up for sale, hopes rose that BCB might be revived under new ownership. It took until May this year, however, before a buyer was found. During that time the bank languished. 'It was difficult to market a bank that was for sale,' says Audette Exel, the general manager of BCB's international operations. Although the bank, with a poor-performing domestic retail business and an unsure international image, was not an easy sell, a field of potential purchasers, including several big North American banks, eventually emerged for the BMA and the government to consider. 'There were seven serious overtures for the bank,' says finance minister Mr Saul. The final choice of First Curacao International Bank, a tiny operation based in the Dutch Antilles, with only six employees, surprised Bermudians at first. The government, however, was confident that First Curacao and its owner, Mr Deuss, represented the best choice. Mr Saul explains: 'When we looked at it, and at what was best for Bermuda, in the end the right decision was made. John Deuss will make this into an endemic Bermuda Bank.' His point is echoed by Ms Exel, who worked closely on the acquisition with Mr Deuss. 'He is a brilliant purchaser. First, because he's got enormous resources. Second, because his experience in offshore finance is unparalleled. And third, because he's so committed to Bermuda - he's been here for 20 years.' When Mr Deuss outlined his ambitious plans for BCB, the decision quickly earned approval from the local community which began buying the bank's stock in anticipation of a turnround in BCB's fortunes. The 32 per cent controlling stake was sold to Mr Deuss for Dollars 6.91 a share in a deal valued at Dollars 3m, and the stock reached a high this summer of Dollars 14.50. The new owner's plans are relatively simple. BCB, which has already withdrawn from the unprofitable domestic retail banking business, will work on building a franchise as a niche international bank. It will offer specialised offshore financial services to institutional and individual clients, focusing initially upon fund and trust administration, and on the needs of foreign Bermuda-based companies. It will not be easy, given the substantial head start enjoyed by Bank of Bermuda and Bank of Butterfield in promoting their expertise in offshore finance, but the new-look BCB believes there is enough room on the island for three globally-minded banks. 'We're smaller and leaner and more internationally focused than the other two, and we're going to be presenting a much more niche image,' says Ms Exel. 'We're happy to compete with them. There's plenty of business to go round.'</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'REGRESSIVE POLITICS IN A PROGRESSIVE CITY' -- IRVINE'S JUST RESPONDING TO ITS  CITIZENS  </P> <P> I must respond to Irvine council member Barry Hammond's remarks regarding  prayer at Irvine City Council meetings ("Measures Fail After Debate on  Religion," Sept. 13): "The issue is not whether we can offend anybody. It's  what's the policy for the city that will offend the least number of people."  </P> <P> What I cannot understand is why Hammond would even consider, much less vote  for, a policy regarding prayer that would offend even one resident!  </P> <P> MARILYN VASSOS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

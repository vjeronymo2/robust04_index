			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Greenspan sees benefits of economy-wide restructuring MR Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday delivered a series of upbeat economic forecasts to Congress, in prepared testimony to support his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report. He predicted that the US economy would grow modestly this year. Unemployment would soon begin declining and the inflation outlook was the best for a generation. The report sets unchanged targets for the main monetary aggregates - a sign that the Fed is happy with the thrust of monetary policy. Answering questions from Congressmen, Mr Greenspan sought to clarify the reasons for Tuesday's announcement of reduced reserve requirements for commercial banks. He said the Fed was cutting required reserves from 12 per cent to 10 per cent of current account deposits in order to improve bank profitability and stimulate new lending. He said the requirement that banks hold non-interest bearing reserves with the Fed amounted to a tax on banks. The move was part of the Fed's continuing efforts to ease the 'credit crunch'. Mr Greenspan based his forecasts of economic recovery in part on evidence that restructuring of balance sheets by households and companies was well advanced. As a result of lower interest rates, household debt service as a percentage of disposable income had fallen in the past year, from about 19.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent. With corporate bond rates close to their lowest levels in more than a decade, many companies had retired a large volume of high-cost debt. A flood of bond and equity issues had also reduced dependence on short-term debt instruments. The condition of financial institutions had also markedly improved. Wider interest margins had boosted bank profits. Mr Greenspan, however, noted that the balance sheet adjustments in train were without parallel in the post-war period. It was thus 'extraordinarily difficult' to judge how much of the necessary adjustment had been completed. Mr Greenspan drew attention to the 'especially favourable' outlook for inflation. The consumer price index was likely to rise by 3-3.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of last year and the last quarter of 1992, compared with a 3 per cent rise in 1991. But this understated the improvement because consumer prices were held down last year by sharp declines in energy prices. 'Our outlook envisages a significant improvement in the so-called core rate of inflation.' Mr Greenspan confirmed targets for monetary aggregates set tentatively last July. The target for M2, the main measure of broad money, is for growth of 2.5-6.5 per cent, unchanged from last year. Mr Greenspan said the new targets had been chosen 'against the backdrop of anomalous monetary behaviour during the last two years.' M2 grew by 3.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent in 1990 and 1991, in each case well below the centre of the target range. Mr Greenspan said the shortfalls partly reflected restructuring, which had led to reduced reliance on bank credit. He believed this year's monetary targets were appropriate but warned of 'sizeable uncertainties' that could force a reassessment. Mr Greenspan said the Fed had recently focused mainly on the short-run outlook. However, 'as we move forward, we cannot lose sight of the crucial importance of the longer-run performance of the economy.' In a veiled warning that interest rate increases would eventually be necessary, he said the Fed's main contribution to growth would come through promoting 'progress toward price stability'.  ---------------------------------------------------- RANGES FOR GROWTH OF MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES  ----------------------------------------------------                 1990      1991            1992  ---------------------------------------------------- Percentage change, fourth quarter to fourth quarter M2               3-7   2 1/2-6 1/2   2 1/2-6 1/2 M3               1-5       1-5           1-5 Debt             5-9   4 1/2-8 1/2   4 1/2-8 1/2  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Federal Reserve  ----------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS FOR 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Measure                      1991       Federal Reserve        Admin                             Actual   Range         Central                                                    tendency  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage change, fourth quarter to fourth quarter Nominal GDP                  3.2      4-6        4 1/2-5 3/4   5.4 Real GDP                     0.2  1 1/2-2 3/4    1 3/4-2 1/2   2.2 Consumer price index         2.9  2 1/2-3 1/2       3-3 1/2    3.1 Average level in the fourth quarter, per cent Unemployment rate            6.9  6 3/4-7 1/4       6 3/4-7    6.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federal Reserve  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

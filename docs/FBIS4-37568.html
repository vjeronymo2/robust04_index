			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, today visited one of the camps of our Armed  Forces. He was received by the brother commander of the camp and  the officers.    During his visit, the brother president saw the progress of  training and qualification programs at the camp and inspected  the situation of the troops and NCO's. The troops expressed  their happiness over the visit of the brother commander  president, asserting their willingness to make sacrifices for  the sake of the homeland and duty under all circumstances in  defense of the will of the people to maintain unity and bolster  their march and promote progress under democracy, which they  chose as a way of life. They noted that there is nothing more  precious than the homeland and its unity and that nothing  deserves more precious sacrifices than maintaining unity.    The brother leader president spoke to the brother officers,  NCO's, and soldiers, praising the enthusiasm, high morale,  sincere national feelings, and overwhelming feelings of love for  the homeland and loyalty to it, which are demonstrated by the  brother members of the camp and all other sons of our Armed  Forces.    He said this high national and moral spirit on the part of  each individual in our valiant Armed Forces is a true embodiment  of our just cause and of the noble principles and goals in which  the sons of our Armed Forces believe and to which they are  faithful. He noted that they do not fear death and do not  neglect their duty under all circumstances. It was by this  courageous national spirit that the heroes of our Armed Forces  have championed the will of their people and foiled all schemes  and plots against the homeland and its unity. They are today  valiantly opposing the gang of apostasy and secession and  defeating it all over Yemen. They are thus recording a new  chapter of glory, heroism, and sacrifice for our people and our  Armed Forces, which have always been faithful to the people and  the homeland and have represented a bulwark that wards off all  dangers and challenges.    The brother president noted the challenges imposed by the  traitorous agents on the homeland and the seditions and sabotage  they sought to ignite. He said the history of that criminal  gang is replete with destruction and sabotage and that its  conduct is marked by treason and plotting. Without this, this  gang cannot live or have any existence. Our people have  received nothing from this gang save death and destruction.    He added that the collusion, treason, and spite of this gang  against the people and homeland have been exposed. This gang  has a black history of oppression, suppression, and massacres by  suppressing the people's freedoms and displacing qualified  personnel of the sons of the homeland. Our people are today  rising against this clique and are opposing its spite and  trickery to maintain their unity, freedom, and democracy. They  also seek to build their new society on the basis of justice,  comprehensive development, and advanced local government that is  founded on administrative and financial decentralization,  respect for human rights, dignity, and property.    The brother leader president added that the heroic and  great role which our Armed Force are playing in defending unity  and constitutional legitimacy and in confronting those who have  departed from that unity, legitimacy, and the free will our  people demonstrated during the elections of the 27 April 1993,  express our people's strong belief in and determination to  safeguard the achievements and gains they made, thanks to their  struggle, sacrifices, and efforts throughout the course of the  Yemeni revolutions on 26 September and 14 October.    The brother president referred to the current criminal acts  the rebel secessionist gang is committing against the people and  homeland by targeting economic installations and civilian  establishments and continuing its hostile, destructive policy,  including firing Scud missiles against peaceful civilians,  attacking the Aden refinery pipeline and the power generating  station, and destroying electricity and water projects in the  Lahij and Abyan governorates, the latest of which was the  treacherous aggression against civilians and the power  generating station in the airport.    This gang is also cracking down on and torturing innocent  citizens in the brave city of Aden, where the supporters of that  gang are forcing children, the elderly, and women to carry arms,  plunging them into the furnace of death without fear of God and  undeterred by conscience, ethics, or humanism. He also stressed  that this criminal gang will not escape justice because it has  committed acts of crime against the people and homeland,  referring to the many opportunities the leadership has offered  to those who were misled to join the ranks of unity and  legitimacy and not to obey orders issued to them by that gang.    He then explained that those who were misled could still  benefit from the general amnesty law and join the ranks of unity  and legitimacy in order to end the shedding of Yemeni blood.  Therefore, he said, they should take advantage of that before  it is too late and before they regret what they have done  against their people and homeland, stressing that our people and  the Armed Forces, which have managed to overcome many challenges  and backed the will of revolution, liberation, and independence,  will not relinquish unity and will face that new challenge that  is imposed on the homeland's unity and future. Victory will  come, God willing, for our faithful, patient, and militant  people and for the brave Armed Forces.    In his speech, the brother president praised the large-scale  national rallying by the masses of our people, chief among which  are political parties and groups, popular and professional  organizations, and all political and social forces, which have  faced up to their national responsibility and which have  demonstrated a patriotic stand.    He also said that the challenge imposed by the gang of  apostasy and secession on the homeland and its unity represents  a real test to responsible positions and the principled  commitment to the national constants. The brother president  praised the great role Yemeni women played in supporting the  defense of unity and legitimacy. He said that the generous  donations, including food and money, which were offered by every  mother and sister in the Yemeni family, represented a strong  moral support for the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, which  are waging the military operations against the rebels who have  abandoned legitimacy. He also hailed our people's genuineness,  their love for their homeland, and their adherence to unity as a  great goal that cannot be relinquished, adding and that the  homeland and its unity are worthy of all sacrifices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Kang Bing from the "Opinion" </F> page: "Dear Leaders: `We Have To Stop Meeting This Way'"]    [Text] "I'd like to talk with you, but I'm sorry, I have  meetings all day today." This is the answer we reporters often  receive when trying to arrange interviews.    Even if we manage to see the VIPs, they tend to glance  continually at their watches. Some even cut the interviews  short because of the ubiquitous meeting.    There are reports about a governor who was so tied-up with  meetings that he was unable to go to his office for a month.  Some work institutions even select leaders whose responsibility  is simply to attend various meetings.    The government has made persevering efforts to decrease the  number of meetings. Still, meetings go on in profusion, all  claiming to have good reasons for their existence.    A round-the-year meeting calendar goes like this: A meeting  must be held at the beginning of the year to discuss and set  down work plans. A year-end meeting is naturally convened for  summarizing the plans. In between the kick-off and close, there  are the inevitable meetings to exchange experiences, read  documents and award prizes. And many others.    Ironically, an important part of the year-end meeting is to  report on the number of meetings that have been held over the  year.    To maintain good relations with various departments, work  institutions have to give a nod to meeting invitations from  almost all sources, including their superior organizations,  friendly counterparts and the local public service bodies.    To pass up an invitation is considered an insult. If the  local traffic control office is unhappy, all your vehicles may  be accused of being in poor condition and be ordered off the  road; if the local neighbourhood committee is displeased, you  might be fined for "failing to keep the environment clean  enough." Reject an invitation -- and you will be rejected.    Of course, many people are only too pleased to be invited to  meetings and harvest all the freebies--free trips, big feasts  and souvenirs.    Though I have been to too many meetings--quite often  reluctantly--I am not totally against them. What I hate are the  meaningless and long ones.    The Chinese Communists have been known for their talent in  mobilizing people to rise up against practices left over from  the old feudal society. Such mobilizations were often done  through meetings in which revolutionary principles were  explained and problems concerning the interests of the  participants were discussed. People were enthusiastic about  going to such meetings.    But since the establishment of the People's Republic, this  once-effective weapon has been excessively used. As a result,  it has lost its power. Most meetings are met with a  "never-again" attitude. Few are interested in what's discussed  in the meetings. Moreover, I doubt if the attendants are really  able to carry out what's assigned to them at the meetings.    The number of meetings held around the country is not  available, but I believe the figure could run in the millions.    As far as I know, most government organizations and  enterprises still have Wednesday afternoons off for so-called  "political study" meetings.    I believe most people are bored with such routine meetings,  in which newspaper articles are read by a responsible leader  while the participants busily engage in chatting, dozing or  knitting.    Having such weekly meetings might be a decades-old practice  and there might be some argument to keep them going, but I would  advise meeting organizers to cancel them if they want to improve  the unit's efficiency and productivity.    It is a waste of time and money to hold these meetings if  they achieve nothing.    Billions of yuan must be needed to organize these millions  of  meetings. I am no expert on this affair, but friends tell me  that, in organizing a meeting, the budget ranges from a few  thousand yuan to half a million. It's time that we dampened the  meeting fever of both organizers and participants.    They should be reminded that, if a meeting has to be held,  something concrete should be discussed, and decisions should be  made. Empty talk has no value.    Now that the management mechanism is being reformed in  enterprises, managers should be accountable for their own  actions. They should decide things for themselves and not  involve half the factory. If they do, it only shows their sense  of insecurity and lack of business confidence.    Traditionally, in appraising an organization's performance,  the number of meetings it held was regarded as a standard of its  achievements. But the new concept should be: The fewer  meetings held, the better.    The best and most efficient way to cut down on the number of  meetings, it seems to me, is to slash the meeting budget  drastically. Who would attend if there were no banquets or  carrier bags full of goodies? Who would organize if they had to  reach into their own pockets? The money saved could be put to  good use in an infinite number of ways--such as paying the  teachers who have been given IOUs instead of their salaries.    It requires great determination and a new way of thinking to  bid farewell to meetings.    The Hebei provincial government has set a good example. It  decided to have no meetings in the entire month of April. The  leaders, liberated from meeting engagements, could head to all  corners of the province during that month for on-the-spot  investigations, which helped their decision making far more than  meetings ever would.    When this directive was issued in March, many people were  skeptical that, without meetings, things in the province would  fall apart into a real mess.    Now the month has passed, and we can see that the sky did  not  fall.    I hope other provinces and organizations will follow the  Hebei example, and I also hope Hebei's no-meeting period will be  prolonged from the present one month to two months -- or longer.</p>

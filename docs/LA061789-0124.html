			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE, BUDDHIST MONK GO EYE-TO-EYE  </P> <P> Nine years ago, the Venerable Thich Phap-Chau left Vietnam for the greater  religious freedom in the United States. Now, as leader of one of the largest  Vietnamese Buddhist congregations in Orange County, the monk has become  embroiled in a dispute with Garden Grove city officials that may land him in  jail.  </P> <P> The ongoing conflict concerns Chua Viet Nam, a monastery/temple that Phap-Chau  opened six years ago in a run-down two-bedroom home surrounded by weeds on a  one-acre lot at 12292 Magnolia Ave. in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints From Neighbors  </P> <P> While several other churches operate along the busy thoroughfare, neighbors  have complained to city officials about dust and noise resulting from people  who park on the dirt areas of Phap-Chau's lot on Sundays, according to Janet  Solow, Garden Grove's code enforcement supervisor.  </P> <P> One neighbor, Eileen Schwarzenberger, said she felt she had no right to  complain because she lives on a busy, public street. But she added that  Phap-Chau's "lot is not as big as his following," and many cars that do not fit  on the lot or on Magnolia Avenue spill onto side streets. Phap-Chau said 30 to  40 people usually attend Sunday afternoon services.  </P> <P> Solow said city officials had "numerous contacts" in person and in writing,  explaining to the monk that his home was classified for residential use and  could not be used for large gatherings of people who regularly attend services.  Moreover, an inspection uncovered numerous building and fire code deficiencies  including unpermitted bedrooms, bathrooms, a patio and improper electrical  wiring," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Posts Signs, Notice  </P> <P> Partly complying, the monk installed a fire extinguisher, exit signs and a  notice on the patio door -- which reads, "This door must remain unlocked during  business hours" -- next to the candle-lit altar with golden statues haloed in  neon.  </P> <P> But Phap-Chau, whose English is limited, continued to operate the temple, which  he said serves 2,000 families. "I cannot stop them come here," he explained.  </P> <P> The monk, who said he is raising funds to build a proper temple on the lot,  contends that he doesn't have the funds to comply with the city's requirements.  Moreover, moving to a temporary location would be like abandoning holy ground,  he said.  </P> <P> Sandaled and smiling, Phap-Chau tried to explain the situation in an interview  in his office, which is next to the worship center where pictures of members'  relatives hang on the wall above offerings of fruit and flowers.  </P> <P> Also on the walls are photos of First Lady Barbara Bush and Gov. George  Deukmejian standing with Phap-Chau, who is president of the Vietnamese American  Buddhist Assn. of Orange County, and is known by acquaintances as being "very  nice" and "very religious."  </P> <P> He showed a letter from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) congratulating  him on Buddha's 2,533rd birthday this month.  </P> <P> Phap-Chau pulled out maps and drawings of a $1-million temple he plans to build  in a year or so at the rear of the one-acre lot. He said he has raised $200,000  toward the new temple, which presumably would be the largest Vietnamese  Buddhist temple in Orange County. Members have pledged $100,000, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Will Build'  </P> <P> Because he intends to build a new temple, Phap-Chau said he thinks city  officials should be patient with him. "I do not lie. I am a Buddhist monk. I  will build."  </P> <P> While city officials believe Phap-Chau understands the laws, the monk said he  was confused. "This year, they talk one way. Next year, they talk another way,"  he said. "They make it difficult for me."  </P> <P> In February, on the first Sunday after the Vietnamese New Year, a city official  gave Phap-Chau a misdemeanor citation after one particularly holy service.  Phap-Chau said congregation members were surprised to see the citation given,  and some were angry and felt it was a bad omen for the entire year.  </P> <P> But Solow said the citation, which was not the first issued to the monk, was  issued during regular weekend rounds and that the code enforcement officer  waited until the religious service was over.  </P> <P> In two citations, the city has charged the monk with improper land use and city  code violations, misdemeanors that carry a maximum sentence of $500 or six  months in jail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trial Set for July 12  </P> <P> Phap-Chau has pleaded not guilty and the case, continued three times, is  scheduled for trial July 12.  </P> <P> "If he'd make the improvements, it would all go away. It's purely a safety  issue as far as we're concerned," said J. Dan Lilley, deputy city attorney. "We  won't give up until the corrections are made."  </P> <P> Garden Grove city planners have approved Phap-Chau's site plan, but won't issue  a building permit until Phap-Chau improves or tears down the house, or moves.  </P> <P> Phap-Chau explained that moving the temple even temporarily would disturb the  holy nature of the temple, where ancestors are worshipped.  </P> <P> Others say the bottom line is money.  </P> <P> "It's a Catch-22," said his attorney, Tim Ryan of Huntington Beach, who has  taken on the case at no charge. "To fix the house would take money away from  building the temple.  </P> <P> "What he doesn't want to do is lose parishioners. If he had to move the temple,  he might lose parishioners and he might lose money." Congregation members give  contributions when the monk prays for dead spirits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Gathering Area'  </P> <P> Once built, the new temple will be a "real central gathering area for a lot of  Vietnamese Buddhists in area. I think he'll be a great leader for them." In the  meantime, Ryan is urging Phap-Chau to comply with the city's orders.  </P> <P> "I gave him strict directions: He has to get out and vacate the premises. The  city will not issue the permit to build the temple until the improvements are  made."  </P> <P> According to Ryan, who communicates with the monk through interpreters,  Phap-Chau simply has not understood that the city means business. Each time the  case has been continued, "He thinks he's gotten a major victory."  </P> <P> If the monk is served with a temporary restraining order, a notice to vacate,  or other official documents, something the attorney said is likely before the  trial date, Ryan predicted that the monk will "realize they mean business."  </P> <P> Ryan, who said he thought he had persuaded Phap-Chau to comply, expressed  surprise to hear that the monk was still resisting.  </P> <P> "I can predict with 100% certainty the city will take much more aggressive  action over this whole matter," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Times staff member Thuha Tran contributed to this story.  </P></p>

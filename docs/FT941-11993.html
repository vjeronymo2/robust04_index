			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Molson income static at CDollars 25.4m Molson, the international brewing and retailing group, said third-quarter profits held up well and most sectors turned in better performances. Net income was flat at CDollars 25.4m (USDollars 19.2m), or 43 cents a share, against CDollars 25.3m, or 42 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 748m, against CDollars 770m. Nine-month earnings were CDollars 99.3m, or CDollars 1.68, against CDollars 100.1m, or CDollars 1.68, on revenues of CDollars 1.83bn against CDollars 1.85bn. A 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, a subsidiary, was sold to Miller of the US last April. This saw Molson's share of the brewing results fall to 40 per cent from 50 per cent. Its share of brewing profits in the nine months dipped 25 per cent to CDollars 102m. Beer exports to the US were up 22 per cent, mainly due to successful new products. New beers were introduced in Canada, the UK and Australia, although domestic market share slipped slightly. Diversey, the special chemicals unit, improved sales and operating profit in North America, Europe, Japan and Latin America, but suffered from currency fluctuations. Profitability still lags in the US cleaning business. The Malsham hardware retailing unit forged ahead in Canada with volume up 16 per cent and higher operating profit. Sports and entertainment improved profits sharply, mainly because of special factors.</p>

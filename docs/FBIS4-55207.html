			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Shpetim Roqi from Budapest] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] At the invitation of Romanian  President Ion Iliescu, President Sali Berisha and the delegation  accompanying him left today for an official and friendly visit  to the Republic of Romania. At Rinas airport, Berisha was seen  off by Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, deputies,  representatives of political parties, etc. On his way to  Romania, President Berisha stopped over in Budapest. For more,  let us listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Shpetim  Roqi:    [Roqi] President Berisha arrived at Budapest's Ferihegy  Airport at 1400. From there the delegation headed toward the  governmental residence in Andrassy. Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz welcomed Berisha there, and invited him for lunch. During  the luncheon, they discussed possibilities for further  development between our two countries, countries that are  related not only through a past history, but that should be  related by a future history as well.    President Berisha made an expose of the democratic reform in  Albania and considered Albania to be a country that accepted the  shock reform as a painful, but the only, reform to revive the  country.    Hungarian President Arpad Goncz said that he was informed  about the reform and was amazed by the achievements of this  reform, which really surprises one when thinks about what  unfavorable geo- political circumstances Albania is in at  present. He wanted to know about the problems that worry  Albania today, such as relations with southern neighbors, the  problem of Kosova, and the Albanian question in general.    President Berisha considered Hungary to be an example for  the  peaceful way of passing into a new system. We will report more  later.</p>

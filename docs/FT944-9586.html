			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / TRW finds partner for Dollars 2bn global telecoms venture The race to establish the first global satellite system for mobile phones intensified yesterday as TRW, the large US-based aerospace manufacturer, announced an equity partner for its Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) Odyssey project. It said that Teleglobe, a Canadian provider of intercontinental telecommunications services, had agreed to take part in a joint venture designed to put the satellite system in orbit for the start of operations in 1998. The aim is to build a network of communications satellites able to provide personal voice, fax and paging services to subscribers anywhere in the world. Customers will use a pocket telephone similar to existing cellular phones. The service is likely to find its greatest use in remote areas with little telecoms infrastructure. The Odyssey project, planned for four years, will compete with several similar ventures. These include Iridium, in which the main partner is Motorola, the US electronics company; Globalstar, which is being developed by Loral, the US defence group; and a system planned by an affiliate of Inmarsat, which provides mobile communications services to maritime and aeronautical markets. Iridium is expected to cost Dollars 3.4bn, while Globalstar will require an investment of Dollars 1.8bn. To meet the estimated Dollars 2bn cost of Odyssey, Dollars 1bn is expected to be raised through debt. Of the rest, TRW, which had revenues of Dollars 7.9bn last year, is providing Dollars 100m and Teleglobe, with 1993 revenues of CDollars 1.4bn, Dollars 50m. The balance is expected to be found from equity partners both strategic - such as telecoms operators - and financial. Mr Charles Sirois, chairman and chief executive of Teleglobe, said yesterday that Odyssey would essentially operate as a wholesaler of personal telecoms capacity.</p>

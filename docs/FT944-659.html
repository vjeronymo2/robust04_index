			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ahead as holiday mood takes hold Wall Street US blue-chip stocks posted solid gains yesterday as investors and traders celebrated the last trading day before Christmas by sustaining the market's increasingly impressive December rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.51 at 3,833.43. Secondary indices were in mixed form. The more broad based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 0.15 at 459.83, the American Stock Exchange up 1.26 at 428.78 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.85 at 742.19. Trading volume was 199m shares. As expected, trading was thin yesterday, with many participants taking the day off or leaving early. Prices benefited from the lack of activity, with modest buying - notably of blue-chips - having an exaggerated effect on indices. Dow stocks were in particular favour, which is quite normal for December as institutional investors seek to pack their portfolios with quality issues and stocks that have fared the best this year (the Dow outperformed all other leading indices in 1994). This 'window-dressing' contributed to the sharp early gains. At one stage the Dow was up more than 30 points, before slipping back later in the day. Bond prices, meanwhile, were slightly firmer, which also helped buoy shares. A modest early rally among Mexican ADRs, following the heavy selling midweek related to the country's financial crisis, supported the market, although the stocks fell back before the close. Telmex initially rallied, but ended Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 40 1/2 , and Grupo Financiero closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 8 3/4 . But Grupo Tribasa added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 19 3/4 and Grupo Televisa jumped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Among Dow stocks, the most popular were General Motors, up Dollars 2 at Dollars 41 1/8 , International Paper, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76 5/8 , and Disney, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 46 3/8 . Bank stocks, hit earlier by concerns about earnings and the slump in Latin American markets, rebounded. JP Morgan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56, Citicorp added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 1/2 and Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 . Genentech tumbled Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 after the Swiss group Roche declined to add to its 65 per cent stake in the company. Canada Toronto was afflicted by pre-Christmas sluggishness, with the TSE-300 Composite index closing up 10.48 at 4193.20 in volume of just 30.41m shares. The market re-opens on Wednesday, though analysts expect little activity next week.</p>

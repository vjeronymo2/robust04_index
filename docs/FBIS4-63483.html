			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 21 May -- The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has  described as "nothing but rumors" the reports in the Russian  media on the concentration of Ukrainian troops near Sevastopol  and Simferopol.    "This blatant lie is being circulated with references to  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, which is surprising, to  say the least," said the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press  service today. "It remains to be guessed whether this is another  political ploy of the Russian defense minister or merely his  habitual trust in dubious sources of information."    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service is authorized  to declare that "the interference of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry in the affairs of the united Black Sea Fleet  which, under the Yalta agreement, is subordinated directly to  the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, stands in the way of a  civilized solution to the fleet division issue and creates a  dangerous tension in the situation in the Crimea."</p>

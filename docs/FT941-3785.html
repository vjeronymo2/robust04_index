			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Further spending rise is expected The recovery in consumer spending is set to continue despite further declines in consumer confidence ahead of next month's tax rises, says a survey published today. In its latest quarterly survey, PA Cambridge Economic Consultants reports that consumer confidence is at its lowest level since March 1991, when the survey began. A record number of households expects their finances to deteriorate because of modest wages growth and next month's tax rises. Despite this, planned spending on everyday items such as food and clothing remains strong and is at its highest March level to date. The evidence for durable goods is more mixed, although furniture and car purchase intentions remain buoyant. Mr Nick Mansley, senior consultant at PACEC, said: 'Evidence suggests that people will want to carry on spending despite the tax rises being a major concern, and most of this growth in consumption will come from a falling savings ratio.' The survey reports that house purchase intentions have increased slightly but are still subdued. Confidence in the government is at a record low. Of the 1000 respondents, 52 per cent said they had little or no confidence 'in the government's ability to solve the pressing problems facing the country'. The survey was conducted between February 26 and March 6.</p>

I. </F> Tevyashov, candidate of technical sciences; UDC 536.3:384.326]    [Abstract] Experimental materials are given on the  appearance of anomalous temperature contrasts of the ground  surface over leaks from petroleum product pipelines. A gas surge  under high pressure in the area of an underground leak, as a  result of its expansion, cools the ambient soil volume and due  to heat transfer at the surface forms a spot having a negative  temperature contrast relative to the background. Measurements  were made using an AGA-780 thermal imager-radiometer from aboard  a helicopter hovering at an altitude 50-60 m. The results of  specific observations are given. The factors governing the  linear resolution of the instrument on the ground and the  registered thermal contrast are discussed. Due to the great  thermal inertia of the soil layer a considerable time elapses  between the break and the appearance of a temperature contrast  at the surface. The influence of ambient meteorological  conditions on the degree of contrast is discussed on the basis  of computed data. The factor exerting the greatest influence on  spot contrast is wind speed. The depth of leak occurrence has a  decisive effect on the thermal picture. The influence of time of  day when observations are made (temperature and illumination) is  analyzed pertinent to the middle zone of the country in clear  summer weather. The maximum thermal anomaly over a leak site is  observed from 1800 to 0800 hours when there are no masking  thermal nonuniformities in the soil caused by solar heating.

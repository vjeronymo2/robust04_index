			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 9 June, a top Foreign Ministry official showed a  prudent stance toward a Russian proposal for an early  international conference among the United States, Russia, China,  Japan, the ROK, and the DPRK (North Korea), on North Korea's  alleged nuclear weapons development. He said: "I believe  neither the United States nor the ROK fully supports the idea  right now."    However, the official noted the idea may become worthy of  consideration when the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopts a  resolution on the issue, saying: "It appears some nations would  support an international conference following the UNSC  resolution."</p>

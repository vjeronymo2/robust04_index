			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler, </F> international commissioner Professor Walter Kamba, and official  Pieter Cronje at the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate in  Midrand -- live]    [Text] [Kriegler] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The  question that's being asked is: Where are we now? I'd like to  deal with that and answer questions afterwards from anybody who  wants further clarity. An election consists basically of three  phases: the voting phase, the counting phase, and the  calculation phase. We are now in the counting phase where the  millions of ballots that were cast are being reconciled and  counted. I'm aware of the fact that there is impatience. I  have a great deal of sympathy with that, but I must say that  from the first press interview that I held months ago I have  been at pains to meet precisely this impatience. We have said  in the IEC, from day one, it is going to take time to do the  counting and it is taking time, and we're not worried about  that. It must take time.    Let us get a few things clear. Number one, this is a  people's election like this country has never seen. It involves  the remotest villages in the far reaches of Venda, to the green  hills of Zululand, now KwaZulu, to the mountains and crags of  the Transkei, and for the very self-same reasons that it is  difficult to get the ballots out there, it is difficult to get  them back. It's not unexpected and it's not alarming. It is  simply an inevitable consequence of the election that we are  involved in. That is why we at the IEC have consistently said,  be patient. Now the very transportation and communication and  logistical problems that resulted in our starting late with the  voting, have had a knock-on effect on the counting which is  obvious. You can't start counting till all of the voting has  been done. The very self-same communications problems in  getting the ballots out there, up into the hills, are  encountered in getting them back again, and you can't start  counting until you've got all of them back. That takes time.    Moreover, it's not only a people's election in terms of the  electorate. It was made clear from the outset that this was to  be an election for all South Africans, run by all South  Africans. That means that there are tens of thousands of people  involved in the process who have never been involved in such a  process before. There are tens of thousands out there who have  difficulty in dealing with the painstaking accounting processes  involved in making a return in respect of an election.    That has caused us problems. I tell you that frankly.  ballot boxes have been returned not in a meticulous fashion.  Also in many places, because of the very nature of the election  where we had no voters' roll, the turnout at some voting  stations was very much higher than anybody had anticipated, and  that resulted in the voting process being overloaded. One of  the problems was that the ballot boxes became overfull. Some  presiding officers, using commendable initiative, took emergency  measures at the time, emptied that ballot box into a container  and replaced the ballot box in the voting station to enable the  people to exercise their democratic right to vote.    Now to a meticulous election administrator, opening a ballot  box in the voting station is a surprising step to take. The  presiding officers in those voting stations had a choice. They  either had to turn the voters away, or they had to make a plan,  and they made a plan, and that plan is not such a bad plan in  retrospect. The alternative would have been much worse. The  people were patient, but if there had been further blockages in  the voting process, the consequences could have been grave. But  this means that when you get to the counting stage, you've got a  problem at the outset where you have to do a reconciliation of  ballot papers issued to the presiding officer, ballot papers  returned with votes cast, rejected ballot papers where people  have asked for a new one because they had made a mistake on the  first one, and unused returned ballot papers.    Now where you have not got the ballots in a sealed box, that  return is of relatively little value, and the reconciliation  becomes very, very difficult. I went to Nasrec [National  Exhibition Center] this afternoon, which is a very big counting  station, and I took the opportunity to go to each of the  counting points in that complex and explained to the party  representatives there gathered, and to all of the officials of  the IEC, that what is important is to get the count done. The  reconciliation, which is so complex in these circumstances,  should take a back seat. What is important is that the people  who have voted now want to hear the results.    It means, and I put it bluntly, it means departing from the  prescribed procedure, the prescribed procedure which is a  carefully worked out set of returns that must balance with one  another. But the IEC resolves this afternoon, that the counting  process cannot be held up by these reconciliation procedures.  And I want to explain why we did so, and why we think that it  is the best in the circumstances. Our Electoral Act is a very  strange document and provides for a truly unique election. In  the first instance of course it's unique to us because we've  never had a proportional representational election in the  country at all. Those of us who have been privileged to vote  have known a constituency based election. This is a different  type of election.    In the second place, and more significantly, this is an  election in which nobody was obliged to vote at a particular  voting station. You could vote at the point of your choice. So  there could be no prediction as to how many people could be  anticipated at any one voting station. In the third instance,  nobody really knew what the extent of the electorate was. The  statistics were the subject of a great deal of debate, and on  virtually only one thing the statisticians could agree, and that  nobody could be certain within reasonable tolerances.    The experience of the last few days would indicate that most  of those estimates were substantially too low. I put that  guardedly, advisedly, because that impression may not eventually  prove to have been valid. But the most important unique feature  of this election is that there was no voters' roll. Therefore,  the ordinary kind of return rendered by a presiding officer was  of very, very limited value. If I could use the image of  plotting a point on map, you really need three lines to cross  before you've got a reasonably accurate fixing of that point.  Two lines get you nowhere and one line is totally useless.    Now what we have here is a return by the presiding officer  of  the ballots issued to him, and a return eventually of the  ballots he brings back to the counting station, broken down into  those votes cast, those not used, and those spoilt. And it  gladdens a bureaucrat's heart to see that reconciliation, but  upon analysis it tells you nothing of any consequence. Unless  you have an accurate indication of the people who had voted, you  do not have the third line in order to plot your point. If I  can make it as plain as I can, all that reconciliation tells you  is what the presiding officer received, and what he is giving  back, but it doesn't tell you how many ballots he is giving back  with votes cast by voters. He is giving you a return of the  seats and returns, and nothing else. Unless and until you can  check that against a voters' roll, or possibly a turnstile which  would give you numbers of people that entered, you do not have  real verification.    Each and every ballot cast must have on the back of it the  identifying stamp of that voting station. Without that stamp  that ballot is automatically rejected. That is a safeguard  against someone who does not have access to the stamp stuffing  the ballot box.    But of course there is nothing in the procedure that  prevents a corrupt presiding officer from putting the stamps on  the back of ballots that he fills in to his or her choice. But  that is the process we've got, and that is the process that the  act creates, and that's the one we've got to live with. You are  reliant upon the integrity and the fear of detection of the  presiding officer, the vigilance of the party agents and of the  others in the voting station. Reconciliation in those  circumstances is of minimal value. It is of course so that it is  a safeguard against him removing ballot papers, but then he  could replace them with others at will if he wished to be  dishonest. That is why we said, inasmuch as so many  inexperienced people had rendered defective returns and inasmuch  as the reconciliation rarely served, ultimately, no real  purpose. If you can reconcile, by all means do so, and if you  can't reconcile, note each one of the defects, note the  objections of the parties, if any, if they can't resolve it, and  carry on with the counting, because what is announced is not the  result but the tally and that tally, we at the IEC will have to  evaluate in the light of the nature and extent of the  imperfections and the reconciliation process, the nature and the  extent of the objections, and the degree to which the parties  may have agreed in respect of some of it. That is calculated to  shorten the procedure with minimal risk to the veracity of the  result. If I can put it this way: As far as we are concerned,  the election is about national reconciliation, not ballot  reconciliation. Let's forget about the formalities. Let's get  on with finding out what the people said they want. Thank you.    [Cronje] Thank you, Judge Kriegler. Could I hand over to  Professor Walter Kamba, one of the IEC's international  commissioners, to give you his opinion on this election? Prof.  Kamba.    [Kamba] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I start by  saying this has been a remarkable election -- remarkable in a  number of ways. Firstly, in relation to its magnitude, its  size. Secondly, in relation to the circumstances in which the  election is being held. It has been a mammoth task never seen  before -- organized by a nation. The size of the bureaucracy  that has had to be established in so short a time is absolutely  incredible, and the commission has been mandated with the  responsibility of running such an enormous event within a very  short time, putting up such a large size of civil servants, if  one may call them that, a lot of them with no experience  whatsoever in running an election. The logistical arrangements  that have had to be made have been equally of enormous size and  the sheer logistics of getting polling stations, counting  stations, delivery of various material, has been of enormous  size, and the commission is very much aware that there has been  a lot of imperfections. But if you take into account those  factors that I have indicated, and also the manner in which a  number of issues have been chopped and changed as we proceeded  to the final stage, have added enormous difficulties to the  whole process.    Reports from you of how the actual voting process proceeded  were characterized by the great commitment, the enthusiasm, the  determination of the voters to go to the polls, and their  attitude which they have reflected -- how they regarded this as  a major event in their lives, particularly those who were  first-time voters, but even those who had votes before -- they  had never voted in any election of this kind. This is a  national event to which the nation is committed, and the mandate  of the IEC was really to deliver this election in the most  difficult of circumstances, so when one comes to evaluate the  election one must evaluate it in that context, and those who  have complaints must really channel the complaints along the  procedures that have been indicated, so that those complaints  can be looked into and be added to the factors that have to be  taken into account in coming to a final decision. The  fundamental element in the election is to ensure that the  country, its voters, have expressed their view in an atmosphere  in which there is virtually no violence, virtually no  intimidation, and we have seen, we have witnessed, the  environment in which voters have streamed to the polls. It has  been clear that whatever violence that existed prior to the  actual polling process was almost absent when it came to the  voters expressing their view.    Procedures have been set up to deal with the question of  counting, to deal with how you handle ballot boxes, how they  should be submitted. I think we have set up adequate procedures  to ensure that each vote that is counted can be said to be a  valid vote, and that, I think, to me and to the commission, is  what is of fundamental importance. If at the end of the day we  can say the votes that were cast -- the votes that all parties  who attend the counting centers -- can themselves agree the  valid votes were in fact so, and that this determines the  ultimate result of the elections. [sentence as heard] And I, as  one of the international members who had participated in the  process, I think we have done what we can to reinforce the  impartiality, the independence, of the electoral commission, and  to the extent humanly possible, to ensure that at the end of the  day we can say the votes cast were valid votes, and represent  the choice of the people of South Africa. Thank you.    [Cronje] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will ask you  to identify yourself please. At this stage, to give everyone a  fair chance, limited to one question, no supplementaries please.  Can we start? Karen?    [Correspondent Karen Bruinaard] My question is directed to  Mr. Justice Kriegler. Sir, you took a very bold step, if I am  correct, in deciding to overthrow a very important safety  precaution, when you decided not to take reconciliation into  account in certain circumstances. My question is: Will this  speed up the process? On the other hand, we saw tonight that  more or less one percent of the total vote has been counted so  far. When do you expect a tally, or even a final outcome?  Could it be before Friday? Thank you.    [Kriegler] I take it that both questions were facetious. If  I didn't make it plain, I will do so afterwards. I don't want  to take up time unnecessarily. I will explain precisely why it  is not a valuable safeguard at all. It is no safeguard at all  if you haven't got a voters' roll or a count, an independent  count of voters, but we can debate it afterwards. With regard  to the second, most certainly before Friday.    [Cronje] Pierre?    [Correspondent Pierre Classen] Can I also address the judge  please? Could you tell us, in making this modification to the  procedures, did you get the approval or condoning of the parties  concerned, and do you think that after the result they will  still in a good spirit accept your decision in this matter?    [Kriegler] Did you say the last....    [Classen, interrupting] The political parties, and after the  result, do you think they will still accept your decision in  this matter in good spirit?    [Kriegler] I have no doubt that they will. They, the  politicians, know precisely what the minimal value is of the  process as it is, and I discussed with a committee out at Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center] this afternoon, I discussed it with  some of the major parties. Quite frankly, it's a decision that  the IEC has to take and has to live with, and I am happy that I  can justify it to any political party.    [Cronje] Over here please.    [Correspondent Michael Collins] Kind of the same question.  Before the election there were a number of safeguards that were  apparently deemed necessary -- the printing of special ballots  with counterfoils outside the country, the fact that ballot  boxes would remain sealed, the fact that reconciliation was to  take place. With all of these revised because of the  circumstances of the election, are you confident that there is  no chance for fraud on a significant scale, and do you believe  that the parties, especially the parties that are not the main  two parties, who have already been making allegations of  irregularities, will accept this as a legitimate revision of the  Electoral Act?    [Kriegler] I am indeed satisfied, and the commission is  satisfied, that provided a ballot bears the official mark of the  particular voting station, the prospect of there being  significant fraud is very small indeed.    [Cronje] Anton Fisher?    [Correspondent Anton Fisher] Judge, I wanted to ask you --  the sort of shifting reconciliation to the back seat and the  modifications that have been mentioned -- how do you think this  is going to impact on the credibility of the election and the  announcement of a free and fair election?    [Kriegler] That's precisely why I'm here -- to answer each  and every question about it, because we are satisfied that it  does not affect the credibility, and we wish to take the people  with us in that belief. It is not a decision we took lightly.  We think we took it correctly. We are happy to debate that  decision and to establish to the satisfaction of anybody that it  is a responsible decision.    [Cronje] Annette?    [Correspondent Annette Joubert] My question centers around  the question: What happened to the [Orange] Free State's  results? Apparently they have finished already at 1030 this  morning. We have heard nothing. What happened in the Northern  Cape? There are only approximately 500,000 voters. Where are  the results? And then, what is happening to the special  ballots....    [Kriegler, interrupting] Would you mind not having a go at  me  with a shotgun? I'll come back to you, by all means. I simply  can't remember so many questions at once.    [Joubert] Do you not know what's happened to the results in  the Free State, because we've had reports since this morning  that the results have been available since 1030, and...?    [Kriegler, interrupting] No, no results from any voting  station has been available. I don't want to be clever. Tallies  have come in, and we do not wish to put out tallies, even  tallies from the head office, until we have checked them  ourselves. Those figures can go out for public information.  We're happy with that. But we're verifying them as tallies  first.    [Joubert] Just the last part of the question. What is  happening to the overseas ballot papers at this stage?    [Kriegler] I really can't tell you. They should all have  arrived by now, but I'm not sure.    [Cronje] Linda?    [Correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] We've been on air for  quite some time with the results, but it's rather going slow.  To pick up on Karen's question, do you think it will go faster  now? Will we have results rolling in by tomorrow, sort of  creating more excitement than it is now?    [Kriegler] I'm glad you asked the question. I owe you an  apology. I was sharp with you the other day, and I shouldn't  have been. I'm sorry. The process is certainly coming on  stream. Quite apart from the ruling we made, the counting  process is in any event calculated to speed up very rapidly as  all of the counting stations get their preliminary work in  order. You can expect a good deal more rapid returns coming on.    [Van Tilburgh] Can I just ask: from tonight, or from  tomorrow? Because it will affect us staying on air tonight or  not.    [Kriegler] Most of the counting stations are working through  the night.    [Cronje] Over here, please?    [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, first, why if the  reconciliation process is so inconsequential, why was it put in  the electoral law in the first place? And second, I mean, it's  the latest of a series of creative interpretations of the  electoral law. Don't you feel that maybe while you solve  logistical problems and you speed up the process, you are in  fact creating a political problem because -- never mind whether  you are sure that it can't be tampered with -- people who won't  like the election results might jump on this loophole to declare  dissatisfaction with the election?    [Kriegler] With regard to your first question, why is the  procedure in the electoral act if it has such minimal value --  it's a question I've asked myself, and I've come up with an  answer: that the absence of a third coordinate and the  significance thereof was not appreciated. Not one of the senior  political representatives with whom we have debated the issue  disagree with us on that. With regard to the second point, of  course it is possible that particularly a loser will take this  opportunity. It is possible. That is a risk we've got to run.  I believe that the steps, in the circumstances, are so  self-evidently correct that, A, there will be little temptation  to resort to it as a peg on which to hang a declinature to  proceed with the democratic process, and B, would be manifestly  an unjustified resort to that particular step. I may say I  sincerely trust that to some extent the integrity and  impartiality of the commission will satisfy the broad body of  the public out there that this was not done to benefit anybody  or to prejudice anybody. Moreover, upon reflection, what we are  postulating in order to be significant in a proportional  representation system, is an undetected fraud of a massive scale  committed by or in collusion with IEC officials. I think the  prospects of that are pretty remote.    [Cronje] The gentleman right at the back.    [Correspondent Skwezi Skosana] Justice Kriegler, if I may  ask: Are you satisfied about the manner in which the results are  being flashed on the SABC screen and on the radio? The fact  that the results -- they come in percentages -- is that not  going to create a problem, especially to a fairly large majority  of people out there who may not be able to interpret percentages  without giving reference. For example, Western Cape results --  they came in as a percentage without giving reference whether  they are from 10 counting stations, one counting station, or  five.    [Kriegler] I share your view. I agree with you, and I have  already asked that the data be presented in a different form. I  will take it up again tonight when I get back to the office.    [Cronje] Radio (Populare).    [Correspondent Paolo Barnard] Judge Kriegler, one of your  duties will be to declare these elections free and fair, and one  may wonder how free you are to declare these elections free and  fair. Surely, there must be a lot of pressure from the two main  political parties here in this country and international  community. I'm not implying for one second that your judgment  will be conditioned by these pressures. I'm only asking you if  you ever felt these pressures on you, especially from the  international community.    [Kriegler] I am human and of course I'm subject to  pressures.  I don't take the decision alone, thank heavens, but I can assure  you that the pressure of the situation is infinitely more than  any political party could bring to bear. The realization is  stark that if the election cannot be certified we are in a worse  position than we were before the negotiation process started,  and I would not be honest if I did not say that that realization  falls very, very heavily on me. But I've got to live with  myself after this election, and I will not certify if I am not  satisfied that it was a substantially free and fair election as  the statute obliges me to do, and I would like to add that I am  not an auditor who has been called in with a green pen, green  ink pen, to check on technical correctness. If that were my  duty, I would have reported to the state president on Wednesday  morning, that because of the logistical problems we had struck  we would have to take measures which would be technically less  than we would have required, and we shouldn't carry on. We  decided that it was in the national interest to do the emergency  printing and distribution that we did because we believed that  that was the preferable cause to take, once we were staring at  the possibility, on the one hand, of a possibly free and fair  election, and on the other hand, possibly conflagration. We  took the decision in the knowledge that there were risks. The  risks on the other side were much greater and much more likely.    [Cronje] The gentleman over here please.    [Correspondent Themba Khumalo] Judge Kriegler, we have been  told a few hours ago at an earlier briefing, that eight stations  in Durban are not operating because of reconciliation problems.  We have been told also that there are problems at Nasrec.  Obviously people in Natal and in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions are anxious to know which  party wins and which party will lose. Are you not perhaps  fearing that the delay of the announcement of results in certain  regions might cause some problems in terms of people becoming  angry?    [Kriegler] I wouldn't say that I fear it, but I am aware of  the risk. That is precisely one of the reasons we have said:  Speed up the process. We can't reconcile in many cases. Don't  try the impossible. Get on with the count. Note the  objections. We will deal with them. The people are entitled to  know what the tallies are. I agree with you in that respect.    [Cronje] The gentleman over there, then Tim.    [Correspondent Tan Moyane] Good evening, Judge. I just want  to take you back slightly ...    [Kriegler, interrupting] Can't you ask something of my  colleague Walter, for a moment? [laughter]    [Moyane] In terms of the tallies that are coming in. Some of  us are sitting here at Gallagher Estate and watching you on  Channel IEC, information, and at the same time watching  television. We have just seen a discrepancy. There is more  coming out on TV than what we are seeing here, and from what you  have said just now, are we going to see a speeded up process in  which we get the results from all over? I mean for 90 minutes,  from seven to half past eight, all we saw was Western Cape  national ballot results, and when I came here, Mr. Pieter Cronje  was giving us results about other regions, and we haven't seen  them on the screen here.    [Kriegler] I am confident that the through-put of tallies  from counting stations will materially pick up, yes, and I share  your frustration, I may add.    [Cronje] Tim?    [Tim du Plessis] Mr. Kriegler, we have had a number of  international organizations up here this afternoon, making all  sorts of pronouncements on the elections -- some saying it's  free and fair, some saying it's only free, but they were making  pronouncements on the freeness and the fairness of the election.  We've also had political organizations here saying those  pronouncements were premature. What are your views on this?    [Kriegler] I did not see them. This I will say without fear  of contradiction: The balloting phase of the election was free  and it was fair. The counting phase is at the moment in  progress. There is no reason to think that it won't be  likewise. As far as the arithmetical calculation is concerned,  the same applies.    [Cronje] The gentleman over there with the check shirt.    [Correspondent] Judge, any indication yet of the total  number  of people who have been to the polls?    [Kriegler] Pardon.    [Correspondent] Any indication yet of the total number of  people that have been to the polls?    [Kriegler] No. No. Obviously one can't do that until you've  got the final tallies in. That's one of the snags of not having  a voter's roll.</p>

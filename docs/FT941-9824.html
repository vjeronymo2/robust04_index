			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Action against predatory pricing essential Sir, Your leader, 'Anti-dumping' (February 10), dealing with European Union policies on dumping really cannot be allowed to pass without comment. Anti-dumping action is a legitimate and necessary defence, limited in nature and circumscribed by internationally agreed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules, against predatory pricing. More often than not, dumping comes from countries which themselves prohibit, or tightly restrict, imports. Remove these barriers, and the problem of dumping would sharply diminish. Why on earth should the European Union, with 17m unemployed, remain supine in the face of serious threats to European industry? The EU has not only consistently respected Gatt rules on dumping, but has also incorporated in its legislation additional constraints on its freedom of action. The legislation is applied, in our experience, in an objective way by the Commission, and your sideswipe at European public servants, implying loose management standards, is both unjustified and - since their status precludes them from answering back - unfair. Your proposals would - deliberately? - add such complexity to anti-dumping investigations that action would become impossible. They will, rightly, be rejected by the large majority of member states as simply another expression of Anglo-Saxon eccentricity about this issue. C M Purvis, director-general, International Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Committee, Ave E Van Nieuwenhuyse, 4, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium</p>

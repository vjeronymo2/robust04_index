			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEIL SIMON'S 'WOMEN' IS AN ODD UNCOUPLING  </P> <P> "You wanna get laughs or you wanna get better?" asks one of several women in  "Jake's Women," Neil Simon's latest play, which opened Thursday at the Old  Globe. "If I get laughs," replies Jake, "I'll get better."  </P> <P> That is exactly how "Jake's Women" feels -- like someone working at getting  laughs while working at getting better.  </P> <P> Not funny, McGee.  </P> <P> Here is Jake (Peter Coyote), a successful writer, living in a super-fashionable  apartment in New York's SoHo (a terrific set by Tony Straiges, brightly lit by  Tharon Musser).  </P> <P> He's the father of a happy daughter Mollie (played at 13 by Sarah Michelle  Gellar and at 21 by the engaging Amelia Campbell). True, Jake's first wife  Julie (Felicity Huffman) died young in an auto accident, but Jake has  remarried, and his new wife Maggie (Stockard Channing), an advertising  executive, loves him and -- to make this a more perfect union -- dearly loves  his daughter Mollie.  </P> <P> So why is this man unhappy?  </P> <P> Why can't he let go of the past? Why can't he enjoy the present? Why does he  play around? Why does he lie to his wife while insisting that she, who has made  one inadvertent slip, level with him?  </P> <P> Because, as you may have begun to suspect, Jake is very neurotic and Jake is  not a nice man.  </P> <P> Being alone a lot, and hopelessly self-absorbed (for which he endlessly,  tediously rebukes himself), Jake airs his Angst by conjuring up the women in  his life and talking to their imaginary presences.  </P> <P> "Blithe Spirit" this is not. The device is perilous, smacking too much of  convenience, not enough of engagement. It is also insufficiently explored. When  Jake tries to throttle the "imaginary" Maggie at one point, it feels as if some  unseen boundary had been crossed. We know he sees these women, but can he touch  them too?  </P> <P> Jake suspects Maggie's about to leave him. Incapable of discussing it with her,  he discusses it with his "materialized" nagging sister Karen (Candice Azzara)  and his "materialized" therapist Edith (Joyce Van Patten), a ditz who must be  related to the female therapist in Chris Durang's "Beyond Therapy."  </P> <P> Would that we were beyond therapy. "Jake's Women" feels too much like therapy  gone awry. Even Jake's reconstituted first wife gets into this act.  </P> <P> When Jake finally gets up the gumption to talk to the real-life Maggie about  their problems, they separate. Jake tries to date. A scene among Jake, his live  date-of-the-moment Sheila (Talia Balsam) and the "materialized" Maggie (who  moved out six months before), has true comic possibilities. But they remain  either desperately forced or merely unrealized.  </P> <P> What have we got here? "Chapter Three." A cross between Simon's "I Ought to Be  in Pictures," "Chapter Two" and more recent events in his life -- or more  semi-psychoautobiography from the Simon files.  </P> <P> Which would be fine, of course, if any of it were funny. But "Jake's Women"  feels like a protracted "poor me" whine that Peter Coyote's charmless Jake  seems powerless to rescue. Even Channing's considerable comic gifts are  confronted with insuperable odds. Balsam can't make Sheila flesh and blood.  Campbell has the requisite sweetness as Mollie in a role that demands little  else, but even such pros as Van Patten and Azzara are fighting an uphill  battle.  </P> <P> The show is as flat as the Mojave Desert and, surprising for Simon, devoid of  even enough workable one-liners to keep the audience interest from flagging.  Thursday's crowd was the stillest Simon audience in memory, as if the people  were politely waiting for the real play to begin. It never did.  </P> <P> This partly explains why director Ron Link was fired over the weekend and  replaced by the Globe's artistic director, Jack O'Brien. But neither man should  be held accountable. It is the writer who must look to his script.  </P> <P> Just like its protagonist, "Jake's Women" as a play sends out a mixed and  troubling message. "We need to be cautious and yet courageous," Jake says to  Sheila. "We need to hold back and not let anything stop us." That's the word we  get, subliminally. It's as if Simon decided to write about himself but got cold  feet. Like Jake, he's holding out on us -- and worse, on himself.  </P> <P> What's next? For all concerned, let's hope not Broadway. "Jake's Women" needs  to descend peacefully into a drawer for serious reconsideration -- or not -- at  a much later date.  </P> <P> At the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays  through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m.; also  Sundays, March 28, 29 and April 10 at 7 p.m. Ends April 15. Tickets:  $20-$27.50; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / A better balance of rich and poor: Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, talks to FT writers about Spain's hopes for Europe Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's socialist prime minister for nearly nine years, was on sparkling form when he came to breakfast with FT editors and writers yesterday. In a forthright exchange, Mr Gonzalez took a colourful swipe at Britain's inability to influence Gibraltar over the joint use of its airport and remembered some useful advice Mrs Margaret Thatcher once gave him in the basement of the British embassy in Moscow. On the last day of his first official visit to Britain, Mr Gonzalez said it was necessary that the two intergovernmental conferences planning the economic and monetary and political union of the European Community, be agreed at the same time, even though some EC members, including Britain, are less than enthusiastic about some of the proposals for political union. Spain would fight hard for the creation of a new tier of poorer EC members entitled to a greater share of EC funds, suggesting that some richer countries were extracting more from the EC coffers than they paid in. Emerging eastern European democracies, he suggested, could not expect the west to foot the bill for 40 years of communism. Following is part of the discussion. Q: What is your timetable for the intergovernmental conferences and what are your priorities for them? A: The calendar agreed requires us to finish work on the intergovernmental conferences at the end of this year and, theoretically at least, these should be ratified by national parliaments before the end of next year. I think the conference on economic and monetary union, in spite of being technically more complicated, could achieve results more easily than the one on political union, but I don't think there is the slightest possibility that they would approve one of the conferences and not the other. There would be several countries that would be against it but this could lead to the planned end to both conferences being prolonged a little. Spain is committed to the concept of economic and monetary union but expects or hopes for a significant increase in Community resources to be transferred to the less wealthy members. How much of an increase? We are not talking about the amount right now and it's difficult to introduce a budget into a treaty. What we are talking about are some criteria concerned with the construction of what we call European Union. In Emu, we believe that, alongside economic convergence, there should be a parallel effort towards cohesion between member states. At this point we reach an imbalance in the allocations of different countries if you take into account their relative wealth. We are allocating slightly more than we get from the Community. We have just under 80 per cent of average EC per capita income so it's obvious that someone is getting paid more than they pay in although they have a higher per capita income than we do (mainly) through restitutions from farm exports. The Community budget is in crisis this year because of the failure to control the Common Agricultural Policy. More money will go to the surplus producers if something is not done to stop this, and Spain is not one of them? The situation is much better in relative terms to what we faced in 1987. Frankly, we want a budget debate this year but it will not really happen until the end of 1992. I remember (Italian prime minister) Andreotti in a difficult meeting in which we were deciding on a pluriannual budget and the Community's financial imbalances turning to Jaques Delors, who was highly irritated that we had not resolved the problem and said to him: 'Mr Delors, surely you don't want us to pay for all our sins in one fell swoop?' Do you believe the political union being discussed in the IGC should have competence in defence or not? This is inevitable. If you really want a common foreign policy it is difficult to conceive that it would not be accompanied by security and defence policies. The Community cannot limit its foreign policy to problems of trade or finance with its trading partners. The Gulf crisis was a graphic illustration of what could happen to a common foreign policy without a common defence policy. When the peace was being negotiated Europe did not exist. The US and the Soviet Union would be at the table. But Israel and other countries in the region do 70 per cent of their trade with the EC. How do you see Nato being organised, being structured in the future? I think it's best left alone for the time being. Obviously the relationship between Nato and the Warsaw Pact cannot be maintained as it has in the past. The thing is how to maintain Nato and create a common foreign and security policy for the Community. Douglas Hurd has made a proposal. He says let us concern ourselves with conflicts out of (Nato) area as a trial. But it's difficult to say then that, look, this is our common foreign and defence policy - to say that operations within the zone have nothing to do with common policy. Do you see the outcome of the IGCs as strengthening the Council of Ministers vis-a-vis the Commission and the European parliament? The problem of achieving balance between the institutions is the second greatest problem facing the political IGC. The Community is being constructed by virtue of intergovernmental decisions. So it is an expression of intergovernmentality. I am talking about important decisions. On day to day decisions you cannot compete with the Commission. The parliament has a bad reputation with government. A decision was taken, badly timed perhaps, to elect a body by universal suffrage and the parliament now wants the right to control an executive. We have to give the parliament some content. Commission appointments might be confirmed by the parliament. And it will have powers of co-decision with the Council of Ministers. If Spain has been helped by membership of the EC how could you deny membership to countries in eastern Europe? That's unfair. Spain went through a very deep economic crisis between 1975 and 1985. We got a great deal of moral support, but we never received a single peseta in assistance. We should not pull the wool over our own eyes. I don't think (Lech) Walesa realises that western Europe is not going to foot the bill for 40 years of communism. Just like it didn't pay for 40 years of Franquismo. No one feels obliged to pay this bill. And I don't know of a single western European public sector not in deficit, no matter how rich the country. Therefore the funds will have to come from the private sector and the private sector is not going to invest until they see things more clearly (in eastern Europe). At one of the funerals in Moscow I met Mrs Thatcher in the basement of the British embassy. We had been talking for seven years about getting into the EC. With little time for a detailed briefing, I reminded her of the story about the crippled man in a wheelchair rolling himself on a pilgrimage. The chair left the road and he hurt himself but prayed to the Virgin Fatima that 'please don't let anything worse happen to me. I want to be as I was before. Don't make me lose my arms as well as my legs.' Mrs Thatcher's reply was intelligent. Entry into the EC, she said, consisted of two parts. One, agreeing to a whole lot of things to get in and then, once in, trying to undo all the amazing things you agreed to do in the first place. You called upon Britain to show imagination in regard to Gibraltar. Could you explain? Without much effort of imagination we could begin joint use of the airport at Gibraltar. I need an airport in the area. It seems to me to be absolutely irrational that while we are building a Community I am obliged to build an airport 20km away from one that already exists. I do not see any reason why an agreement that has been signed between great Britain and Spain has not been implemented. We don't need any imagination here, we just need a decision. If we look at how the winds of history are blowing it is clear that things are going to change. Right now we are in a silly impasse. We can agree to use Heathrow or Barajas jointly but not the airport at Gibraltar. For the British, Gibraltar is a visit to the dentist once a year when we meet to talk about it. For us, it is a stone in the shoe all day long.</p>

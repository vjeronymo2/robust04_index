			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses incline lower as profit-taking takes hold WITH the Bundesbank's interest rate action already discounted, and almost pre-digested, bourses waited for the US June jobs data and were duly depressed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was an apparent exception, the 8.82 fall in the DAX to 1,697.81 over the official session leaving it a fraction higher on the week and only a shade lower than it ended in the post-bourse on Thursday. This was considered quite reasonable, given scope for profit-taking after recent gains in equities, and the fall in the bond market where the Bundesbank's average bond yield rose by 4 basis points to 6.53 per cent. Turnover eased from DM6.6bn to DM6.2bn, but Mr Patrick Bettscheider, equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that the bank  - which has the DAX on a 1993 p/e of 16.8 - saw strong US demand for scrip, and that foreign demand for German equities had been a feature of its business over the past six weeks. Cyclicals continued to lose ground with the automotive and industrial group, Daimler-Benz, down DM8.80, or 1.4 per cent to DM606.50. But Continental, the tyremaker, rose 50 pfg to DM212.50 after saying that it had made a profit in the first five months of the current year, in spite of a 10 per cent drop in sales. PARIS had already discounted the 25 basis point cut in the intervention rate and the CAC-40 index drifted lower on pre-weekend profit-taking. It closed down 19.00 at 1,941.15, off 1 per cent on the week. Peugeot managed a rise of FFr6 to FFr585, having announced a 5 per cent fall in June sales. The weaker oil price depressed Total, off FFr5.50 at FFr274.00 while Elf, ex a FFr13 dividend, finished down a net FFr3.30 at FFr390.20. Rhone-Poulenc, which is raising FFr4bn by issuing securities to reduce short-term debt, put on FFr9 to FFr585. MILAN remained extremely active in telecommunications stocks ahead of privatisation, while Olivetti joined the list of positively performing stocks, rising L110 to L1,595. Strength in these sectors offset continued weakness in Fiat, following a bad earnings forecast this week, down Ll20 at L6,140, a fall of 2.5 per cent over the week. The group yesterday announced plans to raise L2,000bn from a syndicated loan. The Comit index finished up 3.28 at 538.06, up 0.7 per cent on the week. The market's attention was also directed to progress in the wage talks, with the government setting a deadline of today for agreement. Some analysts believe that a further cut in domestic interest rates remains conditional on a deal being achieved. Among the telecoms stocks, Stet gained L30 to L3,650 and Sip L38 to L2,689. AMSTERDAM moved modestly lower, with the CBS Tendency index down 0.2 at 112.5, a week's gain of 0.9 per cent. Polygram moved to a year's high, up Fl 1.10 at Fl 53.90, while Philips lost 20 cents to Fl 30.10. BRUSSELS fell on profit-taking although the BFr20 drop to BFr1,264 in the retailer, Delhaize, reflected disappointing half-year results from its US unit, Food Lion. The Bel-20 index ended 10.10 lower at 1,282.26, up 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr1.3bn. VIENNA dropped 1.5 per cent after Thursday's smaller than expected, quarter-point cut in Austrian interest rates, the ATX index ending 12.58 lower at 840.00. ISTANBUL gained 5.8 per cent on expectations that the new cabinet would win approval. Activity was concentrated in state-run companies which are privatisation candidates. The index gained 649 to 11,794.7.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 2                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1208.12   1207.87   1205.97   1204.61 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1265.79   1264.52   1265.15   1262.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1203.91   1203.67   1202.18   1201.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1262.27   1263.05   1260.60   1259.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 1     Jun 30    Jun 29    Jun 28    Jun 25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1213.21   1208.99   1207.97   1210.15   1202.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1270.98   1266.14   1263.58   1265.02   1254.67  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1208.66 ; 200 -  1266.45 Low/day: 100 -  1200.43  200 -  1257.34 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

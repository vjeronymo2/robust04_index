			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Rome courts change - Tennis On and off the court, there is a new look about this year's Italian Open. That old Romanian rascal Ion Tiriac has bought the commercial rights from the Italian Federation, replacing International Management Group in that role. 'I must have been mad to guarantee them such a sum,' he says. 'Please don't ask me how much it is. Every time I think about it I faint.' To protect his health, Tiriac has shrewdly lured away IMG's Cino Marchese, to help with the promotion of the tournament. Together they have invited some blue chip companies to the party: title sponsor Mercedes Benz, Nokia, Rado and IBM among them. Doubtless they are paying handsomely for the privilege of prominence, but it seems to work. Players and VIPs are whisked to and fro between the Hilton and the Foro Italico in the sponsor's gleaming limousines. Everyone who is anyone carries a portable telephone; many actually use them. Rome's beautiful people, who by tradition have always flocked to the elegant surrounding of the commercial village for lunch, are there again in large numbers - principally to be seen. Some have even been watching the tennis where the theme of change persists. Two women who have been causing havoc are the 18-year-old Italian qualifier, Adriana Serra-Zanetti, a pocket Hercules of a girl who smites the ball two-fisted on both wings a-la-Seles, and Irina Spirlea, a willowy Romanian who admits to being on 'Hi]' terms with Tiriac. Serra-Zanetti, a former Italian national champion in all age groups from 12 up, has beaten Anke Huber, the world number 11, as well as Brenda Schultz, the 10th seed. These successes alone will earn her more ranking points than the combined total of 97 she has amassed from 15 tournament appearances since joining the professional tour last year. Her present ranking of 197 will improve to around 100. The spindly Spirlea reminds me of another fine Romanian, Virginia Ruzici - especially the long legs - which, my wife says, I am not supposed to notice. They propel the 20-year-old Spirlea around the court with great efficiency as she thumps the ball into the corners. She thumped too many for the four-time former champion and third seed Gabriela Sabatini on Wednesday. How sad it was to witness the further disintegration of a fine athlete whose world ranking has slipped to seven. A catastrophic lack of confidence is at the heart of her present problems. It was here in Rome two years ago that the Argentine last won a tournament. But you would never have guessed it the way she nervously frittered away the points. As her coach, Carlos Kirmayr, said to me wistfully: 'If only she could play her matches as well as she practises]' Ah yes, 'twas ever thus. Some things never change. One of them is Martina Navratilova. Even at 37 this remarkable athlete retains an enthusiasm for the game that is infectious. 'Sure, there are still things about my game I can improve,' she insists. She had to improve on Thursday when she faced again Ines Gorrochategui, the 20-year-old Argentine right-hander who had won their first meeting one month ago on clay at Hilton Head. The score then had been 4-6 7-5 7-5 and Martina had been furious with herself for letting slip a winning chance in the second set. In Rome it seemed for a moment that history might repeat itself. After winning the opening set easily on a cold and windy afternoon, Mart-ina's length on return of serve deteriorated. Her opponent took her chances well and hit many blazing winners from mid-court to sweep through the second set. Order was restored in the decider as Martina's depth of placement improved. At 5-3, though, she was broken and she was fortunate that her younger opponent did not know how to sustain the pressure. Keeping the ball in play when it most mattered, Martina broke to 15 for victory. Navratilova may not win this title. It would be surprising if she did because in all her 20 years as a professional she has never won a title on Italian soil. Furthermore, she came here at the last moment as a wild card to fill the vacancy left by the withdrawal of Steffi Graf. 'I probably would have played anyway,' she reflected. 'After two first rounds (at Houston and Hilton Head) and a semi (Amelia Island) I need the match play.' The tournament's need for her presence was even more serious. With Monica Seles understandably postponing her return while her father is being treated for cancer, and the date of Jennifer Capriati's return still uncertain, the women's game is over-dependent on the presence of Graf, Navratilova and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. With this state of uncertainty and no new stars on the horizon it seems unlikely that the Women's Tennis Council will find a sponsor to replace Kraft General Foods which withdrew at the end of 1993.</p>

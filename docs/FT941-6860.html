			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Business Traveller: Close shave for women - A look at the unsuitable toiletries some airlines provide After a month flying around Australia in economy class, being upgraded to business class for the Qantas flight home to London from Sydney was a treat. I settled back in my big, comfortable seat and opened the airline's complimentary bag of toiletries. Eyeshades and socks - both useful for a long flight. A fine-tooth comb - not much good for my long hair, but I had my own in my handbag. Also a toothbrush, toothpaste and earplugs - and a razor, Gucci Nobile shaving cream and Gucci Nobile moisturiser for men. Had there been a mistake? I was not the only woman in business class, yet nothing in the bag was specifically for women. 'No, it wasn't a mistake,' said Qantas. 'We are reviewing the contents of our kits, but at the moment we don't do a separate kit for women.' This may be the age of equal opportunities, but female travellers will find it's still a man's world on many carriers. United Airlines of the US said that, until recently, its business-class passengers had received a bag containing Paco Rabanne aftershave, a razor and shaving cream. However, it is now attempting to cater for women - or less specifically for men. From this month United is introducing what it calls a 'neutral' kit, which includes an own-brand, unscented face cream, a lip salve, eyeshades, socks, a toothbrush and toothpaste, with items such as razor and shaving cream on request. Air New Zealand is also going down the unisex route. 'We used to do bum-bags,' said the airline, conceding that the contents were geared towards men. Its new kit aims to include products suitable for both sexes. Passengers now get a bag that includes a wooden toothbrush and razor, un-bleached calico eyeshades, cotton socks and rehydration gel. One reason carriers give for not providing kits for female passengers is that few women travel business class. One large airline estimates that, even on routes with the highest number of female travellers, they comprise no more than 20 per cent of business-class passengers. That number drops significantly on some routes. Some say that in the present economic climate it is simply too expensive to design complimentary products for women, hence the recent move by some to more neutral kits. But others do cater for women. British Airways introduced separate kits two years ago: both include aromatherapy sprays and gels to combat dehydration, but men also receive a razor and shaving cream. The move, it said, was in response to a sharp rise in female business passengers - 25 per cent of its business-class travellers are now women. Cathay Pacific, based in Hong Kong, provides cleanser and lip balm for women in place of a razor and Boss shaving cream. Other airlines claim, however, that the logistics of loading separate kits for men and women make the exercise too difficult. Women travelling first class do get separate kits - this is easier for airlines to organise because of the smaller numbers involved. But in business class, it seems most women will still have to put up with razors and shaving cream.</p>

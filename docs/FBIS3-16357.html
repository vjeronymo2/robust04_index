Specifically, it is proposed  to transfer the FCS Counterintelligence Operations Directorate  to the Ministry of Justice, transforming it into a Federal  Bureau of Investigations. The Economic Counterintelligence  Directorate and the Directorate for Guaranteeing Security at  Strategically Important Industrial Facilities would be rendered  subordinate to the Ministry of the Economy, while military  counterintelligence would be placed under the wings of the  General Staff as an autonomous directorate. The fight against  terrorism will switch to the competence of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs. The author of the plan for eliminating the  FCS is a member of the Security Council.    Our correspondent met with new FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin  and  asked him to explain his future plans at this post. The FCS  chief reported that very soon he will hold a meeting with the  Russian president. He did not deny reports that Boris Yeltsin  has been in receipt of suggestions for reorganizing this  service, including transferring its powers to other departments.  "If these suggestions are implemented, the security organs will  be dealt a major blow. I am categorically against this, and I  am against anybody who puts such suggestions forward. It is  necessary to ponder why they are doing this. I am deeply  convinced that Russia and the president need strong secret  services. And it is this stance which I will be defending at  the meeting with Yelstin," Stepashin declared.</p>

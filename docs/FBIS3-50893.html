			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jan (EFE) -- Members of the rebel  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) warned today they will  soon begin staging attacks in the Mexican capital, but they  denied their participation in the toppling of two high-tension  electricity pylons in Michoacan and Puebla, and in an explosion  at the Federal Palace in Acapulco.    According to the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA, it received a  telephone call on 8 January from an alleged EZLN member who said  the rebel group was not involved in the terrorist attacks in  Michoacan, Puebla, and Acapulco.    Nevertheless, the caller said it is very probable that the  rebel movement, which began the armed uprising in Chiapas on 1  January, "will detonate explosive devices in the Mexican  capital."    The alleged EZLN member said that the civilian population of  Mexico City need not be alarmed, "because we will warn the  police 30 minutes in advance before the explosions."    Many newspaper reports attributed the attack in Acapulco and  in the Plaza Universidad Shopping Center in Mexico City on 8  January to the extremist Revolutionary Workers Clandestine  People's Union Party-Poor People's Party (Procup-PDLP).  According to these reports, members of the extremist party  claimed responsibility for the attacks in several telephone  calls in which they said the actions were "to demand that the  government stop the repression against the EZLN members" and in  support of the insurrectional movement.    LA JORNADA also published a secret report composed by the  Chiapas government, in which it is said that there are 42  communities in the state in the conflict zone that are described  as "high risk" and 13 others in which a special vigilance must  be established, "because they are highly belligerent."    The document stated that Chiapas is experiencing "the most  dramatic situation of poverty in its history, because the large  government investments have not been sufficient in comparison to  the region's needs." According to LA JORNADA, the document  described one by one the main problems faced by the people of  Chiapas, such as poverty, illiteracy, a lack of loans, drug  trafficking, low wages, and others, which make "the region  fertile ground for the growth of discontent, on which the armed  group has capitalized."    The document also proposed 10 points to resolve the crisis,  including forgiving the coffee growers and cattle growers' debt,  having officials respect human dignity, creating subregional  attention centers, and better definition of agrarian policies.    After recounting that the first signs of guerrillas were  detected in Chiapas 30 years ago, the document read that "the  emergence of the armed group should not surprise us, because  since 1973 the existence of centers for guerrilla military  training and for the recovery of Guatemalan guerrilla wounded  was already known."</p>

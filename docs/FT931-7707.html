			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Gold shares Gold bullion may still look a pretty dull investment but, curiously, shares in gold mining stocks have glittered in recent months. The FT Gold Mines Index has climbed by 46 per cent since the start of the year, largely reflecting a 28 per cent appreciation in the South African stock exchange's gold sector. South African shares have been buoyed by overseas buying, particularly from the US and, latterly, Europe. Worries about South Africa's political instability have eased while ethical restrictions on investment have loosened. The South African gold sector was looking distinctly oversold and the yields of good quality stocks attractive. Even now, many stocks still yield in excess of 10 per cent, compared with the 1-3 per cent available from comparable US companies. Foreign investors also benefit from buying shares with restricted financial rands but receiving dividends in commonly-traded commercial rands. The discount between the two, which effectively acts as a barometer of foreigners' perceptions of investment risk, has recently narrowed to 30 per cent. But it still strongly accentuates investment returns. Gold stocks may run ahead for a while yet as yields continue to entice investors. But for the rise to be sustained much longer will either require a rise in gold bullion prices or increased buying from South African institutions. The trouble is that several countries' central banks are running down their gold reserves. South African investors may also try to exploit the spike in gold shares by reducing overweight holdings.</p>

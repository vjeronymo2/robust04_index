			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Official US index lifts recovery hopes THE official index of leading indicators rose for the fourth consecutive month in April, providing further evidence that the US economic recovery is likely to be sustained through the summer, the Commerce Department said yesterday. However, optimism was tempered by weaker than expected figures for new homes sales. The index of leading indicators rose 0.4 per cent in April. Revised figures for March showed an increase of 0.4 per cent, rather than 0.2 per cent as first reported. The indicators are designed to provide advance warning of changes in the pace of economic activity. A separate index of coincident indicators - measuring the economy's current state - was unchanged in April, confirming a temporary loss of momentum in late spring. The rise in the leading index was led by increases in commodity prices, reduced claims for state unemployment insurance, stronger orders for consumer goods and a rise in consumer confidence. However, five of the components of the index, including the real money supply, provided negative contributions in April. Sales of new single-family homes rose 1.3 per cent in the month, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 530,000. Financial markets, however, were expecting an increase of more than 5 per cent. Figures for March were revised down to show a drop of 15.9 per cent relative to February, rather than a drop of 14.8 per cent as initially reported. The weak home sales figures follow other evidence that the housing sector has cooled after contributing strongly to growth in the first quarter.</p>

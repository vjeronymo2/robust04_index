			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Foods unit flotation will give Adsteam ADollars 411m THE Adelaide Steamship group, formerly run by Mr John Spalvins, will receive ADollars 411m (USDollars 321m) from the flotation of National Foods, a new company formed to acquire the food business of Industrial Equity. The prospectus for the flotation, filed with the Australian Securities Commission, shows that National Foods will raise ADollars 235m through a share issue, and fund the rest through debt. The funds will be distributed by Industrial Equity to its joint owners, Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, all part of the loose-knit Adsteam group. The return to Adsteam is around the level indicated by the group as part of a proposed restructuring focused on its David Jones and Woolworths retailing arms. The restructuring was abandoned last week after the failure of the group's main companies to achieve agreement with their banks to reschedule more than ADollars 6bn in debt. The companies are now seeking individual agreements which are expected to lead to a series of flotations, led by David Jones, an up-market chain store, and Woolworths, a successful supermarket chain owned by Industrial Equity. National Foods will be one of Australia's largest dairy marketing companies. with a portfolio of well-known brand names. Mr Spalvins, who transformed Adsteam from a small shipping company into one of Australia's largest corporations, was fired as chief executive in March after the group reported a consolidated net loss of ADollars 1.2bn for the six months to December.</p>

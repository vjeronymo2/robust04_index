			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Armenian Deputy Defense  Minister A. Petrosyan said that a peace agreement could be  signed this week on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the war  in the enclave may end this year.    Petrosyan told a press conference in Ereven on Saturday [14  May] that the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and  the military leader of Nagorno-Karabakh were going to meet under  the Russian defense minister's mediation in Moscow on Monday.    Petrosyan expressed his belief that a peace agreement would  be signed after three days of the meeting.    The military leaders attending the meeting are to discuss a  time table for sending peace-keeping forces to the  Nagorno-Karabakh region and sites of their deployment.    Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region technically within  Azerbaijan, is populated largely by Armenians.    A separatist movement began in 1988, leading to the  declaration of an independent republic in the region in  September 1991.    A senior Azerbaijani official disclosed last Saturday that  during the four years of conflict an estimated 20,000  Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed.</p>

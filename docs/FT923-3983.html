			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cost controls help Bletchley rise 49% Tight cost control and a strong performance from contract hire activities enabled Bletchley Motor Group to raise interim profits by 49 per cent. Mr David Dunn, chairman, said the pre-tax outcome for the six months to June 30 - up from Pounds 406,000 to Pounds 604,000 - was achieved despite 'continuing economic recession, high interest rates and intense pressure on margins'. Turnover amounted to Pounds 35m (Pounds 30.3m). Mr Dunn said new vehicle sales were still 'very disappointing' but sales to the corporate sector had improved. The interim dividend goes up to 4.4p (4.1p), payable from earnings of 11.4p (8.1p).</p>

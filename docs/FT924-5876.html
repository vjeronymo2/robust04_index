			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Profits at Nippon Shinpan rise 9% NIPPON Shinpan, the Japanese consumer credit company, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y7.7bn (Dollars 62.1m) for the first half to end-September, in spite of the continuing rise in personal bankruptcies that has hurt other credit companies. Operating revenues rose 3.4 per cent to Y181.5bn, reflecting the recent downturn in department store sales and the reluctance of consumers to purchase big ticket items such as cars and domestic appliances. After-tax profits fell 37 per cent to Y2.2bn, following a Y1.8bn appraisal loss on securities holdings. However, pre-tax profits were pushed up by lower interest rates, which reduced the group's repayment burden. A telling sign of weak consumer demand was a 7 per cent fall to Y2,842.9bn in total contracts on credit cards, shopping loans and other items, ending a run of continuous increases since the company was listed in 1961. For the full year, Nippon Shinpan expects pre-tax profits to rise 26 per cent to Y15bn, and operating revenues to advance to Y368bn from Y352bn last year. Minolta Camera, the Japanese camera and business machine manufacturer, is to sell 18,942 square metres of land to Matsushita Electric Works for Y5.68bn in order to repay loans built up when it paid Y13bn to Honeywell in 1991-92 for infringing patents, Reuter reports from Tokyo.</p>

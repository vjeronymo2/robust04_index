			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Apr--Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim  stressed that losses suffered by the Central Bank in foreign  currency trading are not sufficient to negate the bank's  performance.    The deputy prime minister said that the Central Bank now has  assets of more than 100 billion ringgit and that its  international reserves have risen to 90 billion ringgit.    According to Anwar, this is the first time in the history of  the Central Bank that assets and international reserves have  reached such a strong position. He said the international  reserves can cover the country's imports for eight months.    Anwar, who is also minister of finance, defended the Central  Bank's reputation before the House of Representatives in  response to criticism by opposition chief Lim Kit Siang, who had  submitted an emergency motion concerning the 5.7-billion-ringgit  loss sustained by the Central Bank in foreign currency  transactions last year.    In 1992, the Central Bank also lost 9.3 billion ringgit in  foreign exchange transactions.    House of Representatives Speaker Tan Sri Zahir Ismail  permitted Kit Siang's motion to be discussed for one hour  beginning at 1730 hours. The DAP [Democratic Action Party]  leader was permitted to speak for 30 minutes, and Anwar, as  representative of the government, was also allocated 30 minutes  for discussion.    "Seeing that this motion concerns a specific subject, is in  the public interest, requires haste, and falls under Standing  Orders 18(3), I permit this motion to be discussed," Zahir said,  which was received with desk slapping by the other opposition  members.    In presenting the motion, Lim said the minister of finance  needs to explain this matter (the losses), seeing that the  minister last year gave a guarantee to Parliament that he  himself would examine the Central Bank's foreign exchange  transactions.    In discussing the motion, Anwar said that are only five  central banks in the developing countries that can compete with  the performance of the Malaysian Central Bank. The International  Monetary Fund (IMF) also acknowledges the strong position of the  Central Bank.    "Our international reserves are almost twice as large as the  foreign debt," he said.    In fact, Anwar said, the Central's Bank's performance is  much  better than when it was under previous finance ministers, such  as in the days of Tun Tan Siew Sin and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.    "In 1967, when Tan was minister of finance, all of the  Central Bank's international reserves disappeared in a moment  when the British Government revalued the pound sterling.    "When Tengku Razaleigh managed the country's finances  between  1981 and 1984, the Central Bank suffered a loss of 9.5 billion  ringgit in supporting the value of the ringgit 'to protect its  image.'    "No commotion was made over those losses, however," Anwar  said.    The deputy prime minister said that compared with Central  Bank management in the past, the present Central Bank management  is more honest and responsible.    "I could describe all the faults that the Honorable Lim Kit  Siang sees in me," Anwar said, to which government supporters  responded by slapping their desks.    Although the Central Bank is a part of the government, he  said, the principle of the independence of the Central Bank is  unshakable.    "The government and the minister of finance set a framework  of policy, but daily management for achieving those policy  objectives is the authority of the Central Bank," he explained.    Anwar guaranteed that the Malaysian Central Bank will no  longer be involved in any foreign currency exchange transactions.    He said he had directed that such transactions be stopped as  soon as it was learned in the middle of last year that losses  had been suffered in those transactions.    "Since then, the Central Bank has gradually terminated all  forward positions it took in transactions in 1992 and early 1993.    "Since then, there have been no futures market currency  transactions by the Central Bank," he said.    The losses caused Central Bank Governor Tan Sri Jaffar  Hussein to resign his post and take early retirement. Jaffar  resigned on 31 March and acknowledged that the losses were his  fault.    Anwar said that although he was willing to accept criticism  in connection with Central Bank losses and Jaffar's resignation,  such criticism must be fair. All parties must acknowledge the  strength of the bank's financial position.    "I do not intend to defend existing weaknesses, but to  reject  and denigrate the Central Bank is absolutely unfair," he said.    As for Jaffar's situation, Anwar said he was a successful  Central Bank governor and was respected in the region and  throughout the world.    "His services and contributions were great and significant,  but he steadfastly agreed with the principle of responsibility.    "In fact, he had asked to resign when the  9.3-billion-ringgit  losses were announced last year, but I rejected it because I  felt Jaffar needed to resolve the problem first.    "If he had resigned at that time, the new governor would  have  been forced to make a new report on the losses, and that would  clearly have complicated the matter," he said.</p>

Li Peng gave the interview in his Zhongnanhai office. He  outlined the trend in China's economic development for 1994 in  two sentences: "Reform will push ahead with major steps. The  economy will develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner."    He said: Specifically, the major reform steps will come in  establishing the modern enterprise system and a restructuring of  the finance, tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade  fields. All these will be oriented to building a socialist  market economy.    The State Council has proposed setting this year's economic  growth rate at 9 percent, lower than that of last year, he said.    With two successive years of high growth, some sectors of  the  economy are considerably burdened, with such "bottlenecks" as  energy and communications presenting greater restrictions on  economic growth. A relatively relaxed environment is necessary  for sustained economic growth, he said.    As compared with the economic growth rates in other  countries  in the world, 9 percent still represents a rather high growth  rate. There may be many interpretations of "healthy development"  but, for the present, it should primarily be defined as  improvement of industrial structure and enhancement of economic  efficiency, he said.    During the nearly 90-minute interview, Li went to great  lengths to expound the policy of price reform, saying that this  will be in coordination with reforms in other fields, with the  goal of keeping the price system in line with the rules of the  market. Price reform must be carried out in a positive and  prudent way, he said.    In the past decade and more, China has taken major steps to  reform the price system and has freed the prices of most  commodities as planned, accumulating a wealth of experience. So  far, 90 percent of commodities are regulated by the market, with  only the prices of a small number of commodities which have a  direct bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood,  still under state control.    The small number of commodities is mostly from the basic  industries. The unreasonably low prices of these commodities  have encouraged consumption and prevented the relevant  industries from being developed. Readjusting these prices will  involve greater difficulties, Li said. For example, the oil  industry could not possibly be developed without readjustment of  oil prices but the readjustment of oil prices would certainly  affect the prices of oil products. So, we must readjust the  prices step by step and in a very prudent manner.    As China's markets are not yet fully fledged, a spontaneous  and blind tendency tends to develop in the market. It is  necessary for the state to practice macroeconomic control at the  right time to protect the interests of the general public, he  said.    With every major reform measure we will take into account  the  capacity to bear of the country, enterprises, and people and  adhere to the principle of step by step. If we take too drastic  measures, they will certainly affect enterprise production costs  and the people's livelihood.    Li referred to the recent price fluctuation of grain in  certain regions, which he said arose from a variety of reasons.    As the government has sufficient grain reserves and  state-owned grain sales departments function as the main  channel, the fluctuation has gradually calmed down, he said.    While this shows the strength of state macroeconomic  control,  the fluctuation should serve as lesson: That is, even with a  good economic situation, we can never afford to lower our guard  on the issue of prices and the governments at all levels must  not wash their hands of the business, he said.    Asked whether reform of the fiscal and tax systems, which  might affect the interests of some localities and enterprises,  will be carried out smoothly, Li Peng pointed out: In carrying  out the fiscal and tax system reform, we mainly follow the  principles of unifying tax laws and fairness of tax burden and  change the fiscal contractual responsibility system into a  tax-sharing system. The reform represents a restructuring of  the interests mix and will not levy more tax or increase burdens  on enterprises in general, so the reform will be in the  interests of various quarters.    The chief purpose of the reform of the fiscal and tax  systems  is to build up a reasonable tax system that will be in keeping  with international practices and the demands of the socialist  market economy. The tax-sharing system is a fiscal management  system widely introduced by other countries practicing the  market economy.    With the introduction of the tax-sharing system, the  government will certainly strengthen its capacity for  macroeconomic control but most of the central government's  increased revenues will return to localities in different ways,  he said.    Taking the ability to bear of localities and enterprises  into  account, and to ensure that the old and new systems dovetail, a  transition period has been arranged during which the current  pattern of interests distribution will remain unchanged. Even  after that, the central government will only gradually raise its  ratio of revenues from the increased portion of taxes, he  explained.    Concerning the relationship between the reform of the fiscal  structure and the reform of the investment structure and that  between the reform of the foreign exchange structure and the  reform of the foreign trade structure, Li Peng said: The reform  of the fiscal structure will promote the reform of the  investment structure. The current practice in a society under  the market economy shows that investment is regulated by the  financial market, that the number of projects is determined by  the amount of money available, and that the investment plan is  determined by the industrial policies.    On unification of the rates for yuan and the establishment  of  a single, controlled, and floating foreign exchange based on  market supply and demand, the premier said this will be  conducive to China's opening up and the development of its  foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign countries.    This will also produce a positive impact on the process of  gradually converging China's economy with the world economy, he  said.</p>

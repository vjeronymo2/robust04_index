			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, multilateral  consultations devoted to the magnitude and direction of  assistance to Ukraine in dismantling its nuclear weapons began  today, with the participation of representatives of 14 leading  countries of the world. At the opening ceremony, Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov delivered an introductory speech.    Western countries and international organizations are to  examine a whole range of programs and projects in areas vital  for Ukraine. Special attention has been paid to projects for  converting defense industry enterprises, transforming their  production into civil purposes, resolving social problems, and  building housing for servicemen released from duty.    The multifarious consultations are aimed at establishing  specific cooperation between Ukraine and leading countries of  the world in resolving one of the most painful issues facing  Ukraine -- the safe elimination of nuclear weapons inherited  from the former Soviet Union.</p>

Earnings per share were 0.41p, against losses of 0.35p; the group is returning to the dividend list with an interim of 0.25p - the last distribution to shareholders was for the 1989 year. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 353,000 to operating profits of Pounds 754,000, which compared with a Pounds 82,000 operating loss in the 1993 first half.

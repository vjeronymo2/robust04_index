			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARING CONCLUDES FOR STEIN;  </P> <P> JUDGE TO RULE ON TRAINER'S APPEAL WITHIN 30 DAYS  </P> <P> The California Horse Racing Board hearing of Santa Anita trainer Roger Stein  ended after 12 hours Tuesday nightwith an administrative law judge deciding  that she will make her recommendation within 30 days.  </P> <P> The board, which is expected to take action at its regular meeting March 29,  can either accept or reject the decision of judge Amanda Behe, who presided  over the hearing in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Tuesday's hearing was the second in the appeal of Stein, who was suspended for  six months and fined $2,000 by Santa Anita stewards shorty after his horse,  Emperor's Turn, tested positive for cocaine after finishing second in a race at  Santa Anita last October.  </P> <P> Stein is one of six Southern California trainers whose horses have tested  positive for cocaine recently. The others include Laz Barrera and Wayne Lukas,  two of racing's biggest names.  </P> <P> Stein's attorneys, who attempted to prove that cocaine was introduced into  Emperor's Turn system shortly after he ran, also accused the state testing  laboratory of operating in bad faith. The attorneys charged that the entire  post-race blood sample from the horse was used before they could send part of  the specimen to another laboratory for analysis.  </P> <P> Stein's attorneys also introduced Jay Williams, a forensic toxicologist, who  said that his examination of the horse's urine sample indicated that the animal  was given the cocaine between 5 and 10 minutes before the sample was taken, or  about 45 minutes after the race.  </P> <P> The state, however, contends that Stein would still be guilty because of  racing's absolute-insurer rule, which states that the trainer has the ultimate  responsibility for the horse's condition.  </P> <P> One of Stein's attorneys, Ken Lewis, said that despite an informal agreement  with Len Foote, the executive secretary of the racing board, part of the  horse's blood sample was not saved for analysis by an independent laboratory.  </P> <P> "If they wanted samples, they should have made the request," Foote said.  "Normally we have enough blood for that request."  </P> <P> Truesdail Laboratories, the Tustin facility contracted to perform testing for  the racing board, was shown to be in error again. Last month, it was reported  that Truesdail, through a computer foul-up, lost much of the data pertaining to  a blood test.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Foote testified that Truesdail lost about 4% of 16,000 frozen urine  samples because a shelf broke and the bottles shattered. The positives against  four of the trainers, including Lukas and Barrera, have resulted from the  testing of frozen samples.  </P> <P> Foote also said that as the result of suggestions from UC Davis, whose  veterinary school monitors racing board activities, a state investigator has  been overseeing Truesdail activities this year. The investigator has found that  labels on jars of urine samples have been loose and steps have been made to use  more secure labels, Foote said.  </P> <P> Foote also testified that the samples of two horses that tested positive for  cocaine last year were disqualified by a Truesdail chemist because the chemist  thought they had been contaminated.  </P> <P> "In our view, the one area when a horse's sample can be contaminated is during  the time when the urine is taken from the horse," Foote said. "And that's a  real concern."  </P> <P> Stein said that in the investigation after the positive for Emperor's Turn, he  fired a groom because the groom refused to submit to a urine test. Three other  employees in Stein's barn consented to urine tests.  </P> <P> Stein contends that he is being discriminated against after it was announced  Sunday that Lukas and Barrera will be allowed to continue racing during their  investigations.  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / EU satellite liberalisation The European Commission has used special powers to force through a directive on liberalisation of satellite equipment and services throughout the EU. The directive liberalises both establishment and operation of satellite networks, as well as associated satellite dishes, across the EU. The commission said the move would help businesses in retailing distribution and the financial sector along with similar potential users who have pan-European reqirements but limited means of exercising them. 'Due to liberalisation, a 10-fold increase in the volume of satellite communications before the year 2000 can be expected,' said the commission. The situation in Europe contrasts sharply with the US, where an 'Open Skies' policy in the early 1980s led to rapid stimulation of the satellite market.</p>

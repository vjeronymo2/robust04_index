			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of easing in trading rules JAPANESE equities followed the futures market higher, lifted by hopes of an easing in share trading rules and a cut in the discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 339.22 ahead at 21,364.77. It fell to the day's low of 20,940.07 shortly after the opening, and reached the session's high of 21,376.69 just before the close on arbitrage-related buying and bargain hunting by individuals and dealers. Volume picked up to 200m shares from 160m. Rises led falls by 727 to 231, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 16.04 at 1,552.01, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.59 up at 1,184.10. Hopes that the Finance Ministry would relax trading restrictions such as the '30 per cent' rule, which prevents a single broker from trading more than 30 per cent of one stock, and the '15-minute' rule, which restricts brokers from trading on their own accounts 15 minutes before the market's close, buoyed equities. Rumours that the Finance Ministry had asked insurance companies to support the market also encouraged investors. Strength in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone bolstered other shares. NTT rose Y25,000 to Y733,000 on prospects of a possible stock split. Financial authorities have suggested that greater liquidity in the stock would encourage more trading. Reports that NTT will co-operate with KDD, the overseas telecom company, to operate internationally, also sparked interest. NTT denied the reports. Individuals were seen buying pharmaceuticals on renewed interest in Aids-related issues. Mochida Pharmaceutical surged Y400 to Y2,630 on speculation that it was developing a new Aids drug. Meiji Milk Products jumped Y49 to Y941. Electric power companies rose on hopes that lower interest rates would boost profits. Chubu Electric Power appreciated Y90 to Y2,890. Most electronics issues were unaffected by downward earnings revisions by Matsushita Electric Industrial, Hitachi and Oki Electric Industry. Traders said investors felt the sector was oversold. Hitachi lost just Y3 to Y845 and Matsushita held at Y1,340. Brokerages were among the few losers of the day, as investors were discouraged by the recent disputes regarding window dressing for clients' investment losses. Nomura Securities shed Y10 to Y1,490 and Daiwa fell Y19 to Y951. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 252.85 to 22,834.75 in volume of 79.5m shares. Popularity of drug and chemical issues spread to Ono Pharmaceutical, the most active issue of the day, which rose Y270 to Y5,980. Roundup HONG KONG stood out firmly in a generally weak session on the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG climbed to a record high, encouraged by the US senate's failure on Tuesday to approve restrictions on China's Most Favoured Nation status. The Hang Seng index put on 34.51 to 4,794.71 in turnover of HKDollars 2.82bn, after HKDollars 1.89bn. Buying, however, was tempered by caution ahead of Hong Kong's 1992 Budget, due on March 4, and the release of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's 1991 results on March 10. Utilities were higher, Hong Kong and China Gas adding 60 cents at HKDollars 13.90. AUSTRALIA was little changed ahead of the government's economic statement. The All Ordinaries index eased 1.8 to 1,638.1. News Corp dropped 62 cents to ADollars 16.90 following news this week that Mr Barry Diller had resigned as chairman and chief executive of Fox, the group's television and film subsidiary. SEOUL retreated for the third straight day as a decline in cash deposits with securities firms, and political uncertainty before the general election, sapped the market's energy. Goldstar, the nation's second largest electronics maker, tumbled to its bottom limit for the second day in a row to end Won600 lower at Won13,500, following worse than expected 1991 results. The composite index fell 10.65 to 621.42 in turnover of Won206.67bn. SINGAPORE closed weaker after light trading while KUALA LUMPUR turned firmer. Both markets were still digesting Tuesday's news of a Dollars 3bn lawsuit filed in California against Malaysia's government-owned Bank Bumiputra. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 8.85 to 1,484.42 while the KLSE composite index improved 0.87 to 603.16. TAIWAN continued to decline on fears that the government might tighten the money supply further. The textile sector led the day's losses and the construction sector was the only gainer. The weighted index receded 36.23 to 4,951.50 in TDollars 36.8bn turnover. MANILA was disappointed that Philippine Long Distance Telephone's 15 per cent stock dividend will not be paid until June 15. The composite index fell 21.67 to 1,193.48. BOMBAY rose to a record high, boosted by Tuesday's railway budget which spared industry by proposing lower than expected increases in freight rates. The BSE index forged ahead 126.25 to 2,617.52.</p>

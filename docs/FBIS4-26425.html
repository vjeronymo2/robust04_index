			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen has been given two years to strengthen  border defences and boost popular support for the military in  the lead-up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, according to  an official report. Beijing is believed to share fears in the  territory that a flood of mainlanders will flock towards Hong  Kong after the handover.    Growing friction between people and soldiers in Shenzhen are  also a source of unease in Beijing. The government fears that  this friction will be repeated in Hong Kong because the same  units are to be deployed in the territory.    China's Defence Ministry has authorised a huge outlay in  cash  and loans to expand military bases in the special economic zone  and the adjacent Bao'an district. The executive vice-mayor,  Wang Zhongfu, revealed the plans in remarks made on Tuesday,  according to extracts of the speech carried in the Shenzhen  Special Zone Daily.    "Our aim should be to consolidate national defences and  foster a stable social and economic environment," he said. Over  the next two years, border defences would be strengthened "to  take into account Shenzhen's special location and historical  mission".    In the past three years, more than 78 million renminbi  (HK$69.3m [Hong Kong dollars] ) in funding and 190,000 square  metres in additional land have gone into strengthening military  bases in Shenzhen.    An additional Rmb20m [renminbi] would be lent this year by  the city for new military training centres, one of them at the  Pinghu district base.    In a sign that Beijing may be planning to increase the  number  of troops stationed in Shenzhen, Wang said finding jobs for  families accompanying new soldiers would be a big task. A total  of 598 spouses of soldiers had been given jobs in city  departments over the past three years, and 380 children of  soldiers placed in schools.    Citizens drafted into military service would be given a  "complimentary salary" of Rmb2,000 per year, 16 per cent more  than draftees were paid in 1991. Wang's speech was made after  Beijing declared Shenzhen a "double support model city" on June  3.    "Double support" refers to attempts by Beijing since the  Tiananmen Square massacre to blunt popular dislike of the  military through a series of activities which espouse mutual  support between civilians and bureaucrats on the one side and  soldiers on the other.    "With the handover of Hong Kong coming closer, carrying out  'double support' work well...will be beneficial for the  convergence of Shenzhen and Hong Kong," Wang said. He said  clashes between soldiers and civilians in Shenzhen, most of  which occurred outside military bases, must be "cut off at the  bud".    "Our work still leaves a certain amount to be desired," he  said. "We cannot be satisfied with the present situation and  just sit on our haunches."    To improve living conditions for soldiers, food allowances  will be boosted by Rmb30 a month.</p>

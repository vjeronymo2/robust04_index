			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya, </F> correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA: "The Exercises Have Been  Completed. Training Is Continuing"]    [Text] As reported  earlier, Ukrainian Air Force command staff exercises were  conducted from 29 to 31 March. After these were completed, Col.  Gen. Ivan Bizhan conducted a detailed analysis of the exercises  and summed up their results at the Main Headquarters of the Air  Force, which is located in Vinnytsya.    In his speech to the Air Force leadership, he noted, first  and foremost, that although the global threat of war breaking  out in the world no longer exists, there is an increased threat  of local regional conflicts flaring up. To prevent this, it is  necessary not only to have Armed Forces, but also to maintain  them in a combat ready state. This is why it is essential to  conduct a wide variety of exercises and training.    The main goal of the unilateral two-stage command staff  exercises that were conducted on the base of the Directorate of  the Air Force of Ukraine, the air army, and the groups of  long-distance and transport aviation was to hone the  professional skills of commanders at all levels, as well as to  improve coordination of action among the organs of the  directorate and with the Anti-Aircraft Defense Forces [PPO] and  the aviation [component] of the Naval Forces.    Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan made a point of stressing that no  neighboring state was imagined in the role of the enemy during  the exercises. The enemy forces were called "Western" and  "Southwestern." These were imaginary states and their armed  forces. Standing against them were the "Eastern" forces -- i.e.,  Ukraine and her Armed Forces.    The "legend" or condition underlying the command staff  exercise was one possible variant of the eruption of an armed  conflict and the launching of military actions against our  state. The exercise anticipated military action on a rather wide  front, up to five massive air strikes, amphibious landings, etc.    The "Eastern" forces developed plans for committing the Air  Force to action and conducting a defensive air operation in  three phases.    How well did they succeed? In his speech, the deputy  minister  of defense noted that, on the whole, the exercise had been  performed according to the established guidelines. The plan for  the conduct of the military actions, which had been presented to  the chief of training, General of the Army Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy, by the commander of the Air Force, Lt. Gen.  Volodymyr Antonets, generally met the standards of the task that  had been set. The solutions implemented by the commanders of the  air armies and aviation groups were also well-considered and  appropriate to the simulated war conditions. However, a number  of shortcomings were noted in the performance of the command  structures.    The higher the command or staff, the more clearly defined  and  coordinated must be their activities. This was not always the  case, noted Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan. He pointed out the  shortcomings in the performance of specific officers. At the  same time, he named the officers who perform their military  duties conscientiously. Col. Leonid Podnosov, chief of  intelligence of the 14th Air Army, exhibited a particularly high  standard of professionalism and the ability to organize activity  during the exercise in a timely and productive manner.    These exercises demonstrated that problems can crop up where  there should be no problems whatsoever -- in the system of  relaying commands, battle plan instructions, and orders. These  were sometimes late in reaching those who had to execute them.    It was also noted that in planning such exercises, it is  necessary to take into account the real state of affairs in the  forces and the possible options for action in the event of a  military threat. This will force commanders to prepare their  subordinates with greater clarity of purpose in their everyday  military training. And to create military structures in  peacetime that in the face of a military threat will require the  least number of structural changes, basing redeployment, and  changes in stationing locations. It is necessary to create  universal air bases at military airfields to service all types  of aircraft, both in peacetime and in wartime.    Other conclusions were also drawn on the basis of these  exercises. The most important of these for future work, as the  deputy defense minister noted, is that the training of staff  officers must be significantly improved. This requires  implementing the principle whereby a superior trains his  subordinates.    In conclusion, Col. Gen. Bizhan stated that he was confident  that the military aviators would succeed in overcoming all the  difficulties of this transitional period now that Lt. Gen.  Volodymyr Antonets had assumed command over them, because their  new commander has a great deal of experience, energy, ability,  and all the other qualities necessary for working selflessly and  productively.</p>

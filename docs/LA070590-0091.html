			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON EUROPE;  </P> <P> AN SOS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION;  </P> <P> LONG-SUPPRESSED INTERNAL ANTAGONISMS THREATEN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE EAST.  BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION AT HAND.  </P> <P> Debate about the future of Germany and the Soviet Union has obscured the  principal threat to peace on the Continent: the reemergence of nationalism and  unresolved ethnic and religious struggles in Eastern Europe. For every other  security problem in Europe, there is an apparent solution. Lacking so far is  some means to head off trouble and resolve strife in the volatile center of  Europe that was the seedbed of two world wars.  </P> <P> In the West, wise leadership after the World War II helped ameliorate  long-standing conflict between the western part of a divided Germany and its  neighbors, especially France. Democratic institutions, the European Community,  U.S. leadership and a generation of prosperity did their work, so much so that  German unity has provoked far less concern than would have greeted this step  even a decade ago.  </P> <P> Not so in the East, where Soviet power and communist regimes merely suppressed  nationalism and age-old antagonisms. With the events of 1989, frozen  relationships in Eastern Europe simply thawed out. Not surprisingly, national  self-awareness allied itself with anti-communism, fostering political attitudes  more akin to 19th-Century practice than to Western Europe's 21st-Century  merging of sovereignties.  </P> <P> A congeries of rivalries and suppressed hatreds has reemerged, from  antisemitism to border disputes to the status of ethnic and religious  minorities. Struggles long forgotten by the outside world have reappeared, with  names out of pre-war days -- Transylvania, Ruthenia, Carpathia, Kosovo,  Slovenia. Turks in Bulgaria are repressed; Yugoslavia totters on the edge of  dissolution; the country that is home to Czechs and Slovaks has twice changed  its name in search of a mutually acceptable formula.  </P> <P> Balkanization has return to the Balkans. But there is a critical difference  from 1914, when the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand ignited a world war.  Then, the great powers either wished to exploit regional, ethnic, and religious  strife or were unable to disentangle themselves from its consequences. Today,  instability is the major powers' common enemy, and all would welcome a means of  containing if not resolving local problems until democracy and economic  prosperity can help change underlying attitudes.  </P> <P> Obviously, none of the major powers is prepared to cede to others a unilateral  right of action. Last December, Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested  that failure of the Romanian revolution might justify the introduction of  Soviet troops. He quickly qualified his statement, in the process illustrating  both the nature of shared U.S.-Soviet interests and the unacceptability of  unilateral action. The same no doubt would hold true for U.S. intervention,  say, to prevent civil war among Yugoslav republics.  </P> <P> Two developments point to a desirable course of action. During the past three  years, the Soviet Union has significantly modified its attitude toward the  United Nations, moving it in the direction envisioned when its charter was  signed in 1945. The U.N. role in peacemaking and peacekeeping thus has a  promising future. At the same time, the search for a new European security  framework has highlighted the role of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe. This 35-nation group, including the Vatican and San  Marino as well as the United States and the Soviet Union, is clearly not able  to provide a sure basis for security, but it has already gained stature as a  rallying point for political arrangements spanning the Continent. Its  significance is certain to grow.  </P> <P> CSCE would therefore be an ideal locus for efforts to resolve conflicts in  Eastern Europe, to promote peacemaking, and -- should engaged parties agree --  even to undertake peacekeeping with troops from several European states,  patterned on U.N. peacekeepers.  </P> <P> To undertake these duties, CSCE would need to become a permanent institution,  with a headquarters and a bureaucracy. To avoid the requirement of unanimous  action, which currently keeps it from being a serious framework for European  security, CSCE would need to have a flexible membership for tasks like conflict  resolution, as is already being done at the 23-nation Vienna talks on reducing  conventional forces. Conflict resolution also requires a set of principles for  acting: Among other things, there must be a basis for compromise between  rigidly forestalling change in Eastern Europe and permitting each minority to  constitute itself as an independent country.  </P> <P> Assigning these tasks to CSCE has one further benefit. At issue today is  whether there can be a framework for security embracing the entire Continent.  </P> <P> One school argues that only NATO or a viable substitute can keep the peace;  another argues that common goals of peace and prosperity can be the basis for  building a new collective security. The proposal advanced here can be a test of  the latter proposition. If peacemaking and peacekeeping work in Eastern Europe,  there will be reason to take seriously radical departures from approaches to  European security that have dominated the past four decades.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Moscow to vet UN orders to its peacekeepers Russian troops under United Nations command in the former Yugoslavia have been told not to obey orders from their UN superiors until they are cleared by Moscow, according to officials in President Boris Yeltsin's administration. This emerged as Mr Yeltsin raised strong objections yesterday to the threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs in his first public comments on last week's Nato ultimatum. Presidential officials said at least one UN order to Russian troops had already been countermanded. This was when Russian troops in eastern Croatia refused an order to move nearer to Sarajevo. Moscow's attitude was underlined by Russian deputy foreign minister Vitaly Churkin. On his way back from a visit to Bosnia, he said it was unthinkable that Russian troops should reinforce peacekeepers in Sarajevo while Moscow was not part of the decision-making process in Bosnia. Speaking after talks in Moscow with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr Yeltsin warned Nato it would not succeed in ending the conflict without full Russian agreement. But Mr Yeltsin held back from outright rejection of the Nato ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo by midnight on Sunday or face air strikes. The Russian president, who appeared angry at the precedent set by the west in issuing a unilateral military warning, told journalists at the Kremlin: 'Some people are trying to resolve the issue on Bosnia without the agreement of Russia. This will not succeed.' But he did not explicitly demand that the UN Security Council pass another resolution before launching military action. He also threw Russia's weight behind efforts to lift the siege of Sarajevo. He did, however, distinguish between air strikes in defence of UN forces - which he approved - and the wider re-mit of the Nato decision. He warned the west against trying to impose a solution to a conflict that could only be ended at a negotiating table. 'Russia will take part actively in talks to bring a peaceful solution. . . I am glad Mr Major supports our view on that,' he said. Mr Major, the first Nato leader to meet Mr Yeltsin since the ultimatum was issued, was anxious to reassure his host. He told journalists: 'Before air strikes proceed on this very limited front there would need to be a reference back, under previously agreed Security Council resolutions, to the secretary-general.' Reinforcing his assurances after a dinner with Mr Yeltsin, he said he had told the Russian leader the Nato ultimatum was not about generalised air strikes nor was it a proposal to change the character of UN involvement. London and Moscow had no difference on their objective in Bosnia, he added. The aim was to get a negotiated settlement.</p>

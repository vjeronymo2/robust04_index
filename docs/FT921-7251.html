			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Shopping complex in Cardiff Joint developers BICC Developments and London &amp; Edinburgh Trust have awarded TILBURY DOUGLAS CONSTRUCTION a Pounds 19m contract for the construction of the Queen's Arcade shopping complex in Cardiff. The 140,000 sq ft scheme will provide a total of 42 unit shops and two larger stores on two levels. It is being built in the centre of the city with frontages on both Queen Street and Working Street, two of Cardiff's busiest shopping areas, The development will form a natural link between them and the St David's Centre. The first task will be excavation work for new basements together with the virtual demolition of a building in Queen Street; its listed facade will be retained and incorporated into the new development. Extensive piling works will be a particular feature of the construction phase. The 104-week project is due for completion in time for the Arcade to begin trading by Easter 1994.</p>

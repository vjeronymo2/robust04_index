			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Heinz Heck report: "A Case for Tax Cuts"] </F>   [Text] In the international competition for investments  and jobs, it is necessary to reduce the tax burden on German  enterprises to the same level that prevails in major competitor  countries despite the eruption of expenditures caused by German  unification, Winfried Fuest, tax expert at the Institute of  German Industry, told DIE WELT, with reference to the next  parliamentary term of office.    He said Germany's major competitor countries have reduced  their taxes to a greater extent than Germany over the past few  years. "Despite the reduction in tax rates laid down in the law  on industrial location guarantees, the relative gap between us  and our competitors will begin to widen from 1995 onwards," said  Fuest. Before the aforementioned law was passed, the total tax  burden on a German capital company, consisting of corporate,  industrial, and property tax, amounted to 66.2 percent. With  the reduction of corporate tax from 50 to 45 percent, this tax  burden has fallen to 62.3 percent.    As a result of the 7.5 percent mutual increase in the  corporate tax burden in 1995, the total tax burden on companies  will again rise to 64.9 percent. All known surveys state that  the effective rate of tax is very high in Germany. "Germany was  and remains a high-tax country," said Fuest.    On the other hand, in the former high-tax country of Sweden,  enterprises are burdened with a mere 30-percent tax. In 1988,  they were still burdened with 58 percent. The situation is  similar in other countries.    Bonn must reconsider more than just property tax, which  leads  to double taxation for enterprises and shareholders. The same  applies to the equally earnings-unrelated industrial capital  tax, from which the new laender have been exempted until 1995.  A change in the method of financing local communities should  lie at the center of reform efforts. There are patterns for a  possible compromise in this sphere, which take into  consideration the interests of industry and those of the  communities. The abolition of earnings-unrelated taxes is of  particular importance for risky investments.    However, a reform of the taxation of enterprises is not  expedient unless the general level of tax on the whole of  industry is reduced. This can only succeed if the growth in  expenditures is consistently kept lower than GNP growth.  However, this rule must apply to laender and communities  equally. In fact, west German communities have strongly  increased their spending since unification. The Institute of  German Industry reckons that between 1983 and 1989, the average  annual increase in taxation (excluding social security  contributions) was only 3.6 percent, but from 1989 to 1992 it  was 8.6 percent.</p>

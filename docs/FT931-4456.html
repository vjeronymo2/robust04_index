			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Nigeria to step up oil sell-off NIGERIA'S petroleum and mineral resources secretary, Mr Philip Asiodu, said yesterday the government wants to open up the country's oil sector to further private participation, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'The government is going to open up many sectors of downstream activities to if necessary 100 per cent private ownership,' Mr Asiodu said in radio broadcast. 'We are going to allow people to export and use the proceeds to pay for the equipment they must import,' he told senior staff of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) in Lagos. Mr Asiodu said the government plans to make it easier for private investors to participate in the oil industry. 'We are going to look at any other administrative procedures which impede decisions of well meaning investors,' he said. Nigeria's downstream oil sector is at present dominated by major western oil companies operating as minority joint venture partners of the NNPC.</p>

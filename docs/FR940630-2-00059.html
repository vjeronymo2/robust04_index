			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Upon consideration of Sprint's application, we find that a grant of its application will serve the public interest subject to the conditions set forth below. Sprint's application is consistent with the Executive Branch's general guidelines set forth in the Department of State's letter. Sprint states that it will initiate service within one year, and expects to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. Sprint's proposed use of INTELSAT facilities and appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities satisfies the requirements that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. With respect to Sprint's proposed 50/50 split of a $5.50 per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet data traffic between the United States and Cuba, the Department of State in a follow-up letter dated May 23, 1994, stated it has no objection to our approval so long as we determine that this proposed rate does not exceed the 50/50 split of the $1.20 accounting rate required under the guidelines. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  We find that the proposed accounting rate is within the Department of State's guidelines because both the approximately 27.5&cent; per minute accounting rate for a typical dial packet data transmission, and the approximately 46&cent; per minute accounting rate for a typical dedicated packet data transmission <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  is well below the $1.20 per minute accounting rate approved for voice services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter dated May 23, 1994, from Richard C.

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Brussels promises 'full commitment' of aid THE European Commission yesterday promised 'a full commitment' of aid to the Palestine peace process, but stopped short of pledging concrete sums of money, after meeting Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister. After the meeting, Mr Peres hinted that mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation could be imminent. Mr Peres met Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, and Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external affairs commissioner, seeking a substantial EC aid pledge for the emerging peace settlement, closer EC-Israeli ties, and support for regional development. Mr Delors said the EC would move quickly with technical assistance to help set up the future Palestinian authority in Gaza-Jericho. Commission officials said it was a priority to establish the local apparatus through which to channel larger amounts of aid and investment in the future. 'As a first step, we need a relatively small amount of money for technical assistance to help them start up their institutions,' Mr Delors said, mentioning a substantial contribution to a multilateral Early Empowerment Fund worth about Dollars 300m (Pounds 199m). He said the next priorities would be funneling of funds towards health, education, and the creation of small to medium-sized enterprises. 'The amount of public money may be relatively small: we need private investment with the support of financial institutions,' such as the European Investment Bank, he added. The EC is the largest supplier of public aid to the occupied territories, providing some Ecu700m (Pounds 534m) in all, including Ecu60m last year. But the demands of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and other crises worldwide have exhausted the Brussels aid budget. At the Lisbon summit in June last year, EC leaders promised to play 'a major role' in supporting financially a Palestinian peace agreement, and officials said it was now up to member states to decide whether to do this through the Community or bilaterally. 'If the member states want the Commission to do more, they have to provide the means,' an EC aid official said. Mr Delors said 'the Commission will seek a full commitment' from the 12 member countries. Mr Delors also mentioned the longer-term prospect of establishing a Middle Eastern organisation analogous to the EC's original Coal and Steel Community, to exploit in common scarce resources such as water. 'There are a number of areas where there is scope for regional integration and that is where the Community thinks it should concentrate its efforts,' an aide said.</p>

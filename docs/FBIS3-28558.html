In discussing ways to organize funds for state  infrastructure  projects, the Finance, Trade, Industry, and Energy, and  Transportation Ministries agreed with the Economic Planning  Board (EPB) on approving foreign investment to some extent by  revising the foreign capital inducement act.    Putting up funds for infrastructure ventures would not mean  that foreigners could exercise management rights, a senior EPB  official said, adding that their participation would be limited  to joining a local consortium or buying small stakes.    In addition, when launching a joint venture with private  companies, public corporations can supply no more than 50  percent of financing and are deprived of voting rights so as to  fully guarantee private management.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG DRUNKEN DRIVERS MAY BE VISITING MORGUE  </P> <P> Visits to the morgue can be part of the punishment for young drunken drivers  under a law signed by Gov. James R. Thompson.  </P> <P> Thompson on Wednesday approved legislation that allows judges to decide whether  drunken drivers under age 21 should be forced to visit morgues and hospitals to  see the bodies of people killed in alcohol-related accidents.  </P> <P> "It will leave a lasting impression on young offenders and holds the promise of  reducing drinking and driving," the governor said in a statement.  </P></p>

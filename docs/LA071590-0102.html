			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRIA'S ASSAD VISITING EGYPT AFTER ICY DECADE;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: HE HOPES TO FORGE A NEW ARAB AXIS FOR NEGOTIATING REGIONAL PEACE. IT'S  HIS FIRST TRIP TO CAIRO SINCE 1977.  </P> <P> Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived Saturday for his first visit to Egypt  since the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, launching talks aimed at establishing  Syria as an active negotiating partner to the Middle East conflict for the  first time in more than a decade.  </P> <P> Arab diplomats said Assad's summit with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would  focus on repairing Syria's bitter rift with Iraq and the Palestine Liberation  Organization and in forging a new, united Arab axis for negotiating peace in  Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied territories.  </P> <P> Assad, a recluse who rarely travels outside Damascus, had not visited Egypt  since former President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977.  Flying directly to Alexandria from Damascus -- and bypassing Cairo, home of  Israel's only embassy in the Arab world -- Assad embraced Mubarak to the sounds  of a marching band and a 21-gun salute and also extended a warm handshake to  the Iraqi and PLO ambassadors.  </P> <P> The summit was the fourth between Mubarak and Assad since Syria in December  became the last Arab country to restore diplomatic relations with Egypt after  the chilly years that followed implementation of the 1978 Camp David accords.  </P> <P> The two presidents met behind closed doors for more than three hours and  emerged without fully briefing their Cabinet ministers, who had assembled for  separate talks, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat Sharif said.  </P> <P> But Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said the talks, if successful, could pave  the way for bringing in the historically hard-line Syrian government as an  active partner in the Middle East peace process and coalescing the feuding  Syrian and Iraqi governments behind a permanent resolution to Lebanon's  15-year-old civil war.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia has also become involved in a behind-the-scenes effort to  reconcile Syria and Iraq before the next Arab League summit meeting in Cairo in  November, Egyptian sources said.  </P> <P> "The idea is if we mobilize enough force behind it, maybe it will work out,"  said one official.  </P> <P> The summit comes at a critical juncture in the Middle East, where peace efforts  have been stymied by a new hard-line government in Israel, on the one hand, and  the suspension of a dialogue between the United States and the PLO on the  other. With the peace process at a standstill, Arab leaders are re-evaluating  old rivalries in an attempt to forge a new, unified front against conflicts  that have bedeviled the region for decades, several Western and Arab diplomats  said.  </P> <P> "The change of heart in Israel toward extremism is pushing everybody to  reconsider the situation," said one Egyptian official.  </P> <P> Few were expecting immediate and dramatic movement from Syria, which has long  scoffed at efforts to negotiate peace with Israel. Egyptians diplomats said  they expected Assad would point to Israel's recent slowdown in efforts to set  up a dialogue with Palestinians as an example of why the current peace process  is doomed to fail.  </P> <P> "Our argument will be that we better form a unified Arab stand if we're going  to get anywhere," an Egyptian official countered.  </P> <P> There also were some indications that Syria may be re-evaluating its relations  with Iraq, governed by a rival wing of the Arab Baath Socialist Party, which  were stormy for years and finally collapsed when Syria supported Iran in its  eight-year-long war with Iraq.  </P> <P> "The day will come when matters will be straightened out and a reconciliation  achieved between the two sister states (Syria and Iraq), but I can't predict  when," Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh said in an interview with Egypt's  state-owned Middle East News Agency. "It is natural that the two leaders will  discuss ways of improving the Arab situation by deeds, not words . . . and of  remedying the negative and developing the positive."  </P> <P> Likewise, there have been some signs of thawing relations between Syria and the  PLO, which have been frozen since 1983, when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was  expelled from Syria.  </P> <P> "Why not?" the PLO's ambassador to Cairo, Said Kamel, said Saturday after  shaking hands with Assad. "We are all looking for that, and we are struggling  for that, because we are struggling for our national rights. We are calling  always to have reconciliation with everybody."  </P> <P> Assad has already said he would welcome Arafat in Damascus, but the PLO leader  has so far demonstrated only lukewarm interest. An unidentified PLO official  told the British news agency Reuters that Arafat might be amenable to a  reconciliation but only if Assad agrees to free thousands of Palestinian  prisoners held in Syrian jails and to release confiscated PLO funds and  weapons.  </P> <P> Egyptian officials and other Arab diplomats say Mubarak is hoping that, even if  total reconciliation is impossible, enough ground can be covered to allow the  Iraqi and Syrian leaders to meet productively at the upcoming Arab League  summit meeting.  </P> <P> Ultimately, they said, bringing Syria, Iraq and the PLO into the peace process  as partners is the only way to permanently resolve Mideast conflicts. Syria and  Iraq are the main power brokers in Lebanon, for example, with Syria backing the  government of Elias Hrawi against Iraqi support for the rival Christian Forces  leader Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun.  </P> <P> Any permanent resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, they said, will have to  determine the future of the Golan Heights as well, which Israel captured from  Syria in 1967.  </P> <P> One Egyptian official said the new push to reconcile Syria and Iraq follows  indications that Aoun, entrenched against the Hrawi government in  Christian-dominated East Beirut, may be willing at last to negotiate a  settlement with Hrawi -- an opportunity that cannot be fully capitalized on  unless Iraq and Syria are willing to act as partners to the process.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the Egyptians would like to see Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo and the PLO  working as partners to resolve conflicts throughout the region, one source  said.  </P></p>

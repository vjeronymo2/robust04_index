			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also is adopting amendments that would clarify and update the standards set forth in the expedited approval procedures in paragraphs (h), (l), (o), (p), and (q) of Regulation 1.41. Paragraph (h) establishes an expedited review procedure for changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock selection of a stock index in which a contract market is designated to trade futures contracts, or options on such futures contracts. Currently, such changes are deemed approved upon adoption by the contract market if: (i) The index is compiled for commercial purposes by an independent third party; (ii) the change is consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved by the Commission for this purpose which specifically defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition of the stock index upon which the designated futures contracts are authorized to trade; (iii) the contract market provides the Commission with written notice of the change within five days after the change is adopted by the contract market; and (iv) the contract market labels the written notice as being submitted under Regulation 1.41(h). This expedited procedure was established because routine changes to an index to maintain its continuity were not expected to require detailed review by the Commission under paragraph (b) of Regulation 1.41.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on approximately 10 years of experience in administering the provisions of Regulation 1.41(h), the Commission has determined that the submission to the Commission on a routine basis of changes which relate to maintaining the continuity of a stock index is not necessary. Further, deleting this requirement would reduce the paperwork burden on the exchanges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the amendment to Regulation 1.41(h) would delete items (iii) and (iv) above, so that a contract market no longer would be required to submit routinely to the Commission a written notice of a change in the composition, computation, or method of stock selection that is made to maintain the continuity of a stock index in which that contract market is designated to trade futures or futures option contracts. In order for such a change to be deemed approved by the Commission pursuant to Regulation 1.41(h) as amended, the index must continue to be compiled for commercial purposes by an independent third party, and the change must be consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved by the Commission for this purpose which defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition of the stock index. Under the amended regulation, however, such changes would not routinely be required to be submitted to the Commission following adoption by the exchange. As currently provided, contract markets would continue to be required to submit to the Commission for review and approval under Regulation 1.41(b) all changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock selection that are for purposes other than the continuity of the index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, under amended Regulation 1.41(h), contract markets would be required to provide to the Commission, upon special call to the contract market, information regarding the composition, computation, or method of stock selection of the index, including any change or changes related to the continuity of the index, or any other issues relating to the index, as instructed, and within the time, and for the period, specified in the call. Such a special call would provide the Commission with information, as requested, to assure that the contract market continued to meet its regulatory obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (l) of Regulation 1.41 establishes an expedited procedure for changes in trading months. Such changes are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (l) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals to delist contract months without open interest as well as to exchange proposals to list new months. In that regard, the division directors or their delegees routinely process requests to delist contact months under Regulation 1.41(l), as long as the months to be delisted have no open interest. The amendment simply clarifies the division directors' delegated authority in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

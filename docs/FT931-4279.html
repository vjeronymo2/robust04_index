			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (6): User-friendly system - Small company application / Juste Communications IT IS becoming a common experience to find the phone answered not by a central switchboard, but by someone in a specific department, writes Claire Gooding. Such 'key' systems are becoming more popular, and Juste Communications, based in Hatfield, is a telecommunications company specialising in installing them. It installs GPT (GEC Plessey Telecommunications) digital telephone systems, as well as holding a Mercury dealership. It has only eight staff, who nevertheless generated a Pounds 437,000 turnover in 1992, with profits of Pounds 37,000. According to Aaron Lubrani, financial director, his customers dislike dealing with a large operation such as BT - 'they have to make multiple contacts to do with the installation of one service. We undertake the entire responsibility for that, including the liaisons, and that's a major selling point for us.' For Juste, each installation is a separate project, requiring the co-ordination of numerous resources. As a small company, it was looking for software that could handle tasks on its Macintosh network of eight SE30s, LCs, and Mac IIx computers. Juste looked at a couple of options, including an extension to the existing Omnis database, and the acquisition of a sales and marketing system that would track times and activities. Instead, Aaron Lubrani discovered (by reading reviews in the Macintosh trade press), a piece of software called CAT - Contacts Activities Times. Although CAT does not use the traditional 'what if' analysis and Gantt time-charts, it does overlap some of the functions of traditional project management, and adds in facilities such as word processing for producing time-stamped documents. These documents double as diary reminders: at time of creation they can be scheduled to appear on the screen in a week's time, a month, or whenever the next activity has to be triggered. CATS also has facilities for scheduling activities and co-ordinating resources. Originally, it was bought as a stop-gap. But CAT quickly won in-house approval as it enabled Juste's two full-time project managers to co-ordinate all their activities. It also took care of complex paper requests to various suppliers - 'the major benefit is that we cannot print or send a document without a timeprint. We know what has happened when - and one thing we need in our job is definitive proof that we have requested certain services on a certain date. 'Once we had CAT installed, we realised how user-friendly it was: we didn't want to be constantly training people. But there's also an amazing degree of sophistication, in that it has grown with us.' One of the main benefits, adds Mr Lubrani, is that the information built up on each client during a project has been turned in to a client database which is likely to have a secondary role in sales and marketing. ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS CAT Contacts Activities Times, CAT, is currently in release 3, version 1.2.

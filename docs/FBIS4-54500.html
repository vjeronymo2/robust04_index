			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Trade Deficit for January and February; </F> Czech Republic Is Slovakia's Largest Trading Partner"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Republic's foreign trade  turnover in the first two months of the year reached a sum of  60.5 billion korunas [Sk] (in trade parity) and was 39.6 percent  higher than in the same period a year ago. The Slovak Republic  imported in this period Sk32.2 billion worth of raw materials  and products, 52.8 percent more than in the same period a year  ago. The value of Slovak exports--Sk28.2 billion--went up 27.1  percent, compared with the first two months of 1993. The Slovak  Republic's foreign trade balance for this period thus shows a  deficit of Sk3.9 billion. This transpires from an analysis of  the development of the Slovak Republic's foreign trade carried  out by the Slovak Statistical Office.    Slovakia's key trading partner was, also at the beginning of  this year, the Czech Republic, which absorbed 37.6 percent of  Slovak exports and accounted for 30.4 percent of Slovak imports.  The second-most-important partner was the FRG, with which  Slovakia realized 18.7 percent of its exports and 11.2 percent  of imports, followed by the Russian Federation, Hungary, and  Ukraine. In the first two months of the year, the Slovak  Republic achieved a surplus of Sk1.9 billion in its trade with  the countries of the European Union.</p>

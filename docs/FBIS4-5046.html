			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  pledged Thursday [7 April] to immediately begin covering trade  insurance for Kazakhstan. International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai made the pledge during his meeting with  Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan's deputy premier in charge of  economic affairs, who is accompanying President Nursultan  Nazarbayev on a four-day visit to Japan since Wednesday.    Kazakhstan will become the first country among the five  former Soviet republics in Central Asia to receive Japan's trade  insurance coverage. As a first step, Japan will apply the  insurance to two facility expansion projects for the Karaganda  steel mill in line with a credit line of 300 million dollars  established last year, a MITI official told a press conference.    Kumagai also told Abishev that Japan is prepared to accept  trade insurance for Kazakhstan's new oil pipeline project if  certain conditions on loan repayments are met, the official said.    Japan also decided to give technological assistance to  Kazakhstan, including cooperation in a copper exploration  project, while it will assist restructuring efforts at the  Karaganda steel mill, the MITI official said.    Abishev asked Japanese companies to redouble their  investments in Kazakhstan, noting that only three Japanese firms  are now involved in joint ventures with Kazakh companies.    Kumagai said Japanese firms will probably respond favorably  if investment conditions in the country improve.</p>

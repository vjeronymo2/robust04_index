			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / 720 jobs go in freight failure Elan International, the express freight and parcels delivery company, has collapsed, putting 720 people out of work and leaving debts of Pounds 5.9m. The company, one of the leading 20 in a competitive market, called in Mr David Wilton, a partner in Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, as liquidator on Wednesday afternoon after it had run out of funds with which to carry on trading. Mr Wilton began laying off staff on Wednesday evening, as workers came on shift to be told of the company's failure. Elan had an annual turnover of Pounds 28m but had been making losses for what Mr Wilton called 'a period of time', although he was not able yesterday to quantify them. Mr Wilton attributed the losses to 'the lower levels of freight being carried because of the recession', and the fact that 'this market is very cut-throat'. The collapse of the company comes as the parcels delivery market, often seen as an economic barometer, is stabilising after recession. The express delivery sector accounts for about 10 per cent of the market, which is valued at more than Pounds 1.2bn a year. Mr Wilton, who has received inquiries about the purchase of Elan, is trying to establish exactly what the company owns. It has been operating from its Birmingham headquarters and 18 depots across the UK, using about 300 vehicles. A meeting of creditors has been provisionally set for February 15.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS LOSE BID TO BLOCK PORTER  DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday rejected a homeowner group's attempt to block the  massive Porter Ranch development on the slopes above Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled against a lawsuit by Porter Ranch Is  Developed Enough (PRIDE) that challenged the Los Angeles City Council's  approval of the project.  </P> <P> PRIDE accused the council of failing to adequately review and describe the  environmental impacts of the the 1,300-acre, $2-billion project, which is to  include 3,395 residential units and six million square feet of commercial  development. PRIDE contended that the project is inconsistent with the city's  General Plan, which it said never envisioned a commercial core -- with office  towers and a regional shopping center -- in the Porter Ranch area, but rather  in Chatsworth.  </P></p>

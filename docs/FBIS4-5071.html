			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, U.S. papers have recently came  out publicly with bellicose assertions opposing our country.    According to reports by the Voice of America on 4 April, THE  NEW YORK TIMES ran amok in an editorial that the United States  should at once bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities. U.S.  TODAY has said this and that on the inevitability of unleashing  a war on the Korean peninsula.    A U.S. defense magazine, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY,  on 5 April reported that the United States has worked out a plan  to deploy ultramodern ground equipment to South Korea so as to  directly analyze information sent by a spy satellite.    In an interview with National Broadcasting Company [NBC]  Television Network on 3 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who  has carelessly set out war outbursts [pokon] and disguisedly  revealed a warmonger's true color, again brought up North  Korea's fictitious nuclear development. He said that even at  the cost of triggering a war on the Korean peninsula, the United  States will suspend the development of nuclear arms. Raving  that the United States will not rely on diplomatic means but  take the road of pressuring North Korea, including imposing  sanctions, he let loose outbursts that the United States will  not exclude the possibility of a preemptive military strike on  North Korea.    Timed to coincide with the U.S. military heads' war  outbursts, the U.S. papers' bellicose assertions opposing us,  which are being revealed more nakedly, provoke just vigilance.</p>

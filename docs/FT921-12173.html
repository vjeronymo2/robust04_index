			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Coventry plant closure plan attacked UNIONS have expressed concern about the planned closure of a factory in Coventry owned by Matrix Churchill, the machine tool manufacturer bought from Iraqi ownership last February. Automation Investments, the Midlands-based group which also owns Birmingham-based BSA Tools, said earlier this month that it was closing the Matrix plant at Fletchamstead Highway, Coventry, with the loss of 100 jobs. Production of Matrix Churchill's lathes and grinding machines will be transferred to BSA. A second Matrix plant at Baginton in Coventry will stay open. The closure is the latest evidence of the pressures on the UK machine tool industry. With little sign of an upturn in orders in the domestic market, companies are going ahead with job cuts and closures they fought to avoid last year. Coventry district officers of the AEU engineering union and the TGWU general union said that since the takeover of Matrix Churchill there had been no investment or action to secure the long-term future of the company in Coventry. Automation Investments, they said, had acquired a lathe product that was technically five to 10 years in advance of its own, while the significant movement of plant and machinery would not be reflected in the number of Matrix employees offered jobs at BSA. They suggested that the Coventry site was more likely to be used for a supermarket than to create engineering jobs. Mr Keith Bailey, AI's chairman and chief executive, said the union comments were 'ill-informed'. Matrix had been rescued from a 'horrific situation' in late 1990, caused by the Iraqi involvement. The alternative to purchase by AI had been bankruptcy. He conceded that AI had not invested in manufacturing at Matrix, but the machine tool maker would announce its Omega range of high-tech lathes at the Mach 92 exhibition in Birmingham in May.</p>

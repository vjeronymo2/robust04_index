			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / NY Democrats urged to elect dead candidate NEW YORK Democratic party leaders appealed to voters to elect a dead man in yesterday's primary race, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Mr Ted Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat who was among the most liberal members of the House of Representatives, died on the eve of the party's primary, which he was expected to win overwhelmingly. The eight-term congressional veteran, who was a critic of the US pharmaceuticals industry and a campaigner for better Aids research, was to have stood virtually unopposed in the election, facing only a fringe candidate. New York's electoral law would allow the Democrats to select a successor to stand in the November election if the late Mr Weiss wins the primary. And a win in his constituency - which includes the heart of Manhattan's Upper West Side liberal enclave - means certain victory in the November election. Thus New York's Democrats urged the electorate to cast their vote for the dead congressman. Meanwhile, voters were also choosing a Democratic challenger to incumbent New York Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato from a field led by former Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro and Mr Robert Abrams, New York State attorney-general.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Myanmar [Burma] dissidents  in Japan staged a rally in Tokyo on Tuesday [4 January],  claiming that the people of Myanmar are not actually free or  independent. They said independence day ceremonies being held  in Yangon [Rangon] by the military junta are an empty display.    The rally against the junta, called the State Law and Order  Restoration Council (SLORC), was organized by the International  Network for Burma Relief, the Burma Youth Volunteer Association  (BYVA) and the Burmese Relief Center-Japan, organizers said.    Not being allowed to pass directly in front of the Myanmar  Embassy, human rights activists from various countries and  Myanmar dissidents wound their way slowly through nearby  streets. They marched in silence to symbolize Myanmar's lack of  freedom of speech, said BYVA Chairman Khin Maung Zaw.    In a letter to Myanmar dissidents worldwide, Sein Win, prime  minister of the National Coalition Government of the Union of  Burma (NCGUB), said "on a sad note, I see Burma today not as an  independent nation, but as a nation enslaved by the military."  The NCGUB is made up of lawmakers elected in the 1990 elections  who were forced to flee military persecution to the Thai border.    In a joint press release, the three groups requested that  the  United Nations and the international community, including the  Japanese Government, use their influence to ask SLORC to  transfer power to the democratically elected government.    They also asked for the release of Nobel peace prize winner  Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners immediately  and unconditionally.</p>

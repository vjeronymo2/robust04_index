			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Nurses' concern on review body DIFFERENCES emerged yesterday between the Royal College of Nursing and the government over how National Health Service trusts should interpret recommendations from the independent nurses' pay review body, Lisa Wood writes. Mr Phil Gray, RCN director of labour relations, told reporters at the annual congress in Blackpool that trusts should use nationally recommended pay levels as a baseline on which they could improve. The Department of Health believes trusts should use national rates as a 'benchmark', or rough guide, with trusts able to offer lower rates at the local level.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / US carries on waving military stick at Iraq THE US continues to emphasise the threat of military action against Iraq in an effort to force it to comply with the UN demand for elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, reports George Graham from Washington. The Defence Department is reported to have prepared a list of options for President George Bush, including a 'graduated bombing campaign.' Officials are seeking to reinforce the impression that the US is ready to use military force in the very near future if Iraq does not back down in a confrontation with the UN inspection teams seeking to destroy missiles and nuclear production facilities. A UN team is in Iraq this week after the Security Council delivered a stern warning to Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, at an angry meeting in New York last week. However, the US has blown hot and cold over its readiness to use force. Mr Bush said he would not rule out any options, but Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, and Mr Edward Djerejian, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, this week sought to play down the likelihood of military action. Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Negotiations between the UN and Iraq over the proposed sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 920m) worth of Iraqi oil, in part to pay for food and medicines, will re-open in Vienna next Thursday. Baghdad's agreement to resume the talks, broken off last month, was one of the positive results of last week's Security Council meeting. The Council resolution authorising easing of sanctions for limited oil sales expired on Wednesday. Its renewal depends on the outcome of next week's talks.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average closes below 18,000 level A FALL in the futures index prompted heavy arbitrage selling, and the Nikkei average lost 1.2 per cent, closing below the 18,000 level for the first time since March 16, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed down 225.13 at the day's low of 17,941.19, having risen to a high of 18,337.73 in the afternoon on reports that the finance ministry was planning to securitise bank loans and create a secondary market. The Nikkei has fallen 3 per cent over the week. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 11.73 to 1,539.59, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index 0.79 to 1238.04. Volume was 260m shares with losers exceeding gainers by 712 to 251, and 183 issues unchanged. Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that trading patterns were becoming increasingly similar to that of summer last year when the market tumbled to a six year low: 'Poor sentiment, technical selling, and the lack of positive noises from financial authorities is just not helping'. Reports that the ministry of finance planned to create a market for securitised bank loans failed to help bank stocks: Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y10 to Y2,270 and Fuji Bank lost Y30 to Y2,250. Foreign investors sold high-technology issues as Fujitsu lost Y23 to Y796, NEC fell Y19 to Y895 and Matsushita Electric Industrial declined Y20 to Y1,420. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 143.21 to 20,199.74 in volume of 28.6m shares. Roundup THE region's markets charted different courses yesterday. HONG KONG once again saw a fairly turbulent session, although the Hang Seng index picked up towards the close, finishing down 71.49 at 9,263.94. Over the week the market has lost 4.5 per cent. Turnover was down to HKDollars 6.6bn from Thursday's HKDollars 8.1bn. Following Morgan Stanley's midweek downgrade of the market, Nomura's global equities team yesterday came out with a contrary recommendation. Explaining that recent weakness was a good opportunity to buy, Nomura's strategists raised their weighting to the maximum - from 6 to 8 per cent, against a benchmark of 3 per cent: 'The combination of growth, re-rating and weight of money make this an unstoppable bull market which has scarcely begun'. SEOUL continued its bull run with the composite index adding 17.73 to 840.36, for a week's rise of 6 per cent. Turnover was steady at Won1,240bn. TAIWAN saw a heavy round of profit-taking in the electronics sector drive the market lower. The weighted index fell 89.89 to 4,226.32, off 1 per cent on the week. Turnover swelled to TDollars 51.1bn, its highest level since April. United Microelectronics fell by 7 per cent, closing limit down at TDollars 52.00, and helping to drive the sector index down by 4.3 per cent. KUALA LUMPUR advanced 3 per cent in late trading on a strong rally in Tenaga, the power utility. The composite index rose 28.35 to 984.92, for a week's gain of 1.2 per cent. Tenaga advanced MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 15.20 on news that it was to be included in Morgan Stanley's global index from December 2. AUSTRALIA took a dip downwards on widespread profit-taking and the All Ordinaries index lost 24.8 to 2,083.2, barely changed over the week. The banking sector took some of the heaviest losses with Westpac off 19 cents at ADollars 4.41, ANZ 14 cents at ADollars 4.74, and NAB 12 cents at ADollars 12.76. NEW ZEALAND ended a difficult week 4.4 per cent higher, although the NZSE-40 capital index closed down 17.21 at 2,097.22. KARACHI rose on active buying of chemical and pharmaceutical stocks which left the KSE index up 12.84 at 1,771.72.</p>

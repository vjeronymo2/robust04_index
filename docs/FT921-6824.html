			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks at record Pounds 13m THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company defied recession in 1991 with pre-tax profits ahead 22 per cent, from Pounds 10.8m to a record Pounds 13.2m. Turnover advanced 27 per cent to Pounds 69.5m. The company, which operates the Port of Liverpool, won new business to push cargo volume up 7 per cent to a new high of nearly 25m tonnes. Earnings per share fell to 16.98p (17.92p), but only because the company had to make provision for tax for the first time after using up allowances from 13 years of losses up to 1984. Earnings would otherwise have been 22p. A proposed final dividend of 4p lifts the year's total by 1p to 6p. The company, which returned to the dividend list two years ago after the government had written off more than Pounds 100m of debts incurred in restructuring, has increased profits by more than 50 per cent since 1989. Mr Bill Slater, chairman, said that Liverpool was now able to exploit both its position as Britain's last large west coast port and the improved infrastructure of northern England and the Midlands when compared with the overcrowded south-east. This made it cheaper to use Liverpool for many cargoes because of lower land haulage costs and easier access. He predicted that competitive pressures would force closure of 'a major port' in an arc running from East Anglia to the Solent during the next five years. He forecast Liverpool's position would improve further as it developed as a hub for grouped container traffic. The company had also developed property in its disused docklands on both the Liverpool and Birkenhead sides of the Mersey, involving a business park and conversion of old warehouses into luxury apartments that had sold well. Property assets were revalued on December 31 at Pounds 119.7m, giving rise to revaluation surplus of Pounds 69m over their previous 1981 book value. Mr Slater said the government had still not indicated when it might fulfil its declared intent to sell its 20 per cent stake.</p>

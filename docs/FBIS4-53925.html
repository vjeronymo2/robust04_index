			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Science and Technology  Minister Kim Si-chung doubts whether North Korea's Science and  Technology are so developed as to be used for making nuclear  bombs and other weapons. In an interview with a science journal,  Kim said, "If we are to extract plutonium, care should be taken  to treat (spent nuclear fuel) in such a safe way that allows no  difference in mass after having it reprocessed."    "Reprocessing is possible, but we would require enormous  time  and technology in the process of manufacturing nuclear weapons,"  he said in the May edition of "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY."    Saying that he was simply talking of his personal opinion,  Kim noted that there is no evidence that North Korea has  conducted underground nuclear experiments. "If the North had  done it, we would have detected it by seismograph," he said.    "It is presumed North Korea began extracting plutonium from  1985, but I doubt whether they have the technology to  manufacture (nuclear) weapons," Kim said.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'COURAGE MOUNTAIN' OFFERS FEW PEAKS  </P> <P> The uneven, curiously titled "Courage Mountain" (citywide) would have been  better off called what it is: "The Further Adventures of Heidi."  </P> <P> Although the often-filmed Swiss children's novel "Heidi," which was based on  its writer Johanna Spyri's experiences living with her grandfather in the Alps,  was published in 1880, "Courage Mountain" writers Weaver Webb and Fred and Mark  Brogger have moved the time up to the outbreak of World War I.  </P> <P> Heidi (lovely, talented Juliette Caton, who was the tempting angel in "The Last  Temptation of Christ") is now a beautiful teen-ager eager to be old enough to  be the beau of her 18-year-old neighbor, Peter (Charlie Sheen). Meanwhile, her  grandfather (Jan Rubes) sends her off to an exclusive finishing school in  Northern Italy run by the elegant and emphatic Miss Hillary (Leslie Caron).  </P> <P> Heidi barely has time to adjust to her richer and more sophisticated classmates  when the army commandeers the school, and Heidi and three of her classmates end  up in the local orphanage. It's run by a dastardly couple, the Bonellis (Yorgo  Voyagis, Laura Betti), who turn their charges into slaves, laboring in their  soap factory. When Heidi becomes determined that she and her friends must  escape, the film's adventures begin in earnest.  </P> <P> Or rather they should. Unfortunately, director Christopher Leitch has not been  able to sustain the panache and momentum with which he gets the film under way,  and its final portion slackens just when it should be its most taut. (Not  helping matters is Sylvester Levay's trite, sappy and downright intrusive  score.) The story owes a clear debt to Dickens, "Oliver Twist" especially, yet  its mild PG rating should be taken very seriously: It is far too harrowing for  small children, particularly in its orphanage sequences.  </P> <P> On the plus side are the film's gorgeous natural locales and period settings,  all of which have been stunningly photographed by Jacques Steyn (who also shot  the current "Kill Me Again"). The acting honors go to Leslie Caron and Laura  Betti. Caron is so strongly associated with several classic MGM musicals that  many may not realize that in the European cinema she has emerged in more recent  years as a stylish, witty character actress.  </P> <P> Her Miss Hillary, born in France but raised in Britain, is a crisp, doughty,  loving charmer, so well-bred that for all her character and courage she is not  prepared to deal with the crude evil and corruption of the Bonellis. Both  Voyagis, who is Greek, and Betti, a plump, golden-haired stalwart of the  Italian cinema, play their villains with a delightful touch of tongue-in-cheek.  It's admirable of Sheen to accept small roles in small films, but here his  presence is jarring because he makes no attempt whatsoever at an accent.  </P> <P> Two final nagging questions: Why would Heidi's grandfather send her off to  Northern Italy when he seems to be aware of the gathering war clouds, and why  to such a fancy establishment in the first place?  </P></p>

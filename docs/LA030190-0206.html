			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARRIER TO MALIBU CITYHOOD VOTE LIFTED  </P> <P> In a victory for Malibu cityhood supporters, a judge on Wednesday knocked down  a legal barrier erected last week by Los Angeles County supervisors and ordered  county officials to set a June incorporation election.  </P> <P> At the request of Malibu residents who want to see their seaside community  become a city, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs lifted a stay put in place  when the supervisors filed a court appeal last week.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the county immediately questioned whether Janavs had the authority  to take the action, which, left unchallenged, clears the way for a Malibu  election to be held June 12. County officials indicated that they would seek to  have the stay reimposed by a state appellate court.  </P> <P> The judge ordered the supervisors -- who are to meet today -- to "fully and  promptly" comply with an earlier order she issued last month, which had given  them until Tuesday to stop stalling and set the election.  </P> <P> On Monday, county officials disclosed that they had appealed the order,  resulting in an automatic stay and making it likely that the state Court of  Appeal would have to decide whether the long-sought election is to be delayed  further.  </P> <P> However, Janavs cited the "important right" of Malibu residents to vote on  cityhood in invoking her authority under state law to lift the stay, thereby  placing the burden on the county to persuade the appellate court to act if the  election is to be delayed.  </P> <P> A majority of supervisors have resisted Malibu incorporation for years,  insisting that an extensive sewer system be approved before a cityhood election  takes place.  </P> <P> Although the supervisors began an incorporation hearing last Oct. 19, they  voted 4 to 1 in November to indefinitely postpone a decision on the matter --  thus postponing the hearing's conclusion -- until construction permits for the  sewer system are issued. The hearing, required by state law so that both sides  can express their views, is the last step before an election can be set.  </P> <P> Cityhood backers, many of whom regard the county's sewer plans as a prelude to  widespread development of the Malibu coast, filed a lawsuit against the  supervisors in December. They accused the county officials of violating a state  law that sets a 60-day limit on the duration of a hearing before an election  date is set.  </P> <P> In siding with cityhood proponents in January, Janavs rejected the county's  argument that state law sets guidelines recommending -- but not necessarily  mandating -- the 60-day limit on concluding the hearing.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, jubilant cityhood backers expressed confidence that the judge's  decision will clear the way for a June election.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful, just wonderful," said Carolyn Van Horn, co-chairwoman of the  Malibu Committee for Incorporation. "The supervisors have denied us our  constitutional right to vote for too long, and it's gratifying when a judge  recognizes that."  </P> <P> For an election to be held in June, the supervisors would have to conclude the  hearing and set the election date by March 9.  </P> <P> Graham Ritchie, an attorney for the incorporation group, said that unless the  supervisors act promptly, he will seek a contempt citation against them.  </P> <P> "Absent any other orders from any other court, if they don't act promptly we  will seek a writ holding the board in contempt and ask that they be jailed  until they comply," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if the judge's action means the supervisors will likely now set the  election, Assistant County Counsel Bill Pellman was noncommittal.  </P> <P> "As to what we recommend, it depends on whether we feel the order is a valid  order," he said. "We're going to have to assess that."  </P></p>

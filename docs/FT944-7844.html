			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Import data relaunched in CSO shake-up Data showing the level of import penetration in different sectors of the economy are to be published today for the first time for more than seven years. The publication of the figures comes as the Central Statistical Office (CSO) embarks on radical changes in the way economic statistics are presented and marketed to business. The CSO and Taylor Nelson AG, the market research group, will launch the new business series in London today. The data will include a range of new import, export and manufacturing figures in almost 5,000 categories ranging from steel to sawdust and truffles. Although information on most industrial sectors will be published on an annual basis, figures will be provided on a quarterly basis for industries which have been requesting this, such as the chemicals sector and the pump-making industry. The publication of official import penetration figures marks a significant improvement in the statistical base. The Department of Trade and Industry used to publish data showing approximate levels of import penetration. This was stopped in 1987 under the government of Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher. Many observers suspect this decision reflected official unease with the growth in the trade deficit. Government officials insist in public, however, that the decision was made to save resources and cut red tape. The new publication was yesterday welcomed by industry groups. The Chemicals Industry Association, which earlier this year criticised official data for being too limited, said yesterday that it had been collaborating with the CSO and Taylor Nelson to produce the series. Mr Nick Sturgeon, economist at the association, said: 'We welcome this, particularly because the UK statistical base had gone through a period of erosion. This information is the lifeblood for companies who are trying to market their production and plan for the future.' Some groups yesterday expressed unease that the development might add to the statistical load on companies. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This is a good initiative. Our main worry is that it is going to be an additional burden on business.' The pricing policy for the new series may also generate controversy. The total purchase cost for all the information for a year is expected to be almost Pounds 5,000. The separate sectoral annual reports will average slightly less than Pounds 100. This will be significantly more than the previous, more limited, business publications printed by Her Majesty's Stationery Office and subsidised by the government. The initiative to upgrade the business publications follows the decision earlier this year by the CSO to award the contract for the marketing of this data to Taylor Nelson. This was the first contract for handling statistics to be awarded to the private sector and comes as the CSO embarks on a controversial market testing programme and seeks to establish a greater business focus and stronger commercial footing. Although the initiative has been broadly welcomed in the City, it has stirred controversy in the CSO itself, with some officials saying that selling statutory data may contravene principles of freedom of information. According to Taylor Nelson the contract for the new business series will be worth up to Pounds 3m a year. The series will be based on the statutory business data collected under the European Community directive known as Prodcom. This requires all member states to collect data on a harmonised basis which can be easily compared to official trade statistics. Although Britain expressed reluctance over the directive, it has become the first EU country to publish the data. The data will cover some information that has been published by the HMSO in the Business Monitor series. But the number of sectors covered in the new series will be raised from 3,500 products to almost 5,000, and by harmonising the product classification with EU trade figures the data will allow detailed import penetration figures to be published for the first time.</p>

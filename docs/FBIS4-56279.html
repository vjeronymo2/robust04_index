			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] expanded  secretariat meeting is being held with the participation of the  general secretaries of the unions and the provincial CTC  branches. The meeting is discussing aspects of the issues to be  analyzed by the National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP] session, the current situation of the harvest, and May  Day activities.    The reports read in the meeting make evident the willingness  of the workers to again pick up the analysis of the problems  brought up at the workers assemblies and continue to monitor  closely indexes such as profitability, costs, and use of  resources. Likewise, it was announced that a process of  assemblies for economic efficiency will begin on 15 May.  Positive results can already be seen in this regard if we keep  in mind that there is a significant drop in absenteeism and  issuance of medical certificates. This means -- a participant  stressed -- that our workers have internalized the issue.    There was a special briefing by Sugar Industry Minister  Nelson Torres who said that the sugarcane harvest has been  significantly affected by the rains and that this requires a  greater effort by the manual cutting brigades, as well as the  combines teams. Torres added that earnest mobilized workers, who  are now tackling sugarcane weeding and planting efforts, are  joining in this struggle.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] held  a preliminary debate today on the motion to hold a general  debate on the Cyprus issue submitted by deputies from the  Motherland Party [ANAP], the Prosperity Party, and the Great  Unity Party.    Addressing the TGNA session held under Vefa Tanir, Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will never support a  solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He  recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the first  confidence-building measures [CBM's] package in principle, but  that the package was later changed to suit the demands of the  Greek Cypriots. Cetin explained that the talks were suspended  because the changes involved political elements. He said: The  duty of the United Nations now is to restore the balance in the  CBM's, because their balance has been upset.    [Begin Cetin recording] The Greek Cypriot side and Greece  did not accept the CBM's and did not support them. That is the  source of the problem. The tactics and policies pursued by the  Greek Cypriot side with a view to advancing its application to  join the European Union will only serve to exacerbate the  confidence crisis in Cyprus. [end recording]    The foreign minister charged that in principle, the Greek  Cypriots want a solution that will bring back the pre-1974  situation. Turkey cannot allow the reestablishment of the Greek  Cypriot Republic, which was eliminated in 1963, he said, adding  that a post-1974 solution must be sought in light of the present  realities. Cetin said that there is no need for pressure in  Cyprus, because there has not been any bloodshed on the island  since 1974.    The foreign minister pointed out that to solve the Cyprus  problem, the political equality of the two communities, which  have different languages, religion, and cultures, must be  accepted. He stressed that Turkey's guarantees are also a  condition for the solution. Cetin added that Turkey will  continue to defend and support the just cause of the Turkish  Cypriot people.    [Begin Cetin recording] Turkey will not support a solution  unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. If we must choose  between an unviable and unrealistic solution and the reaction of  certain circles, we will be ready and determined to face this  unfair reaction. [end recording]    After Cetin's speech, ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz expressed the  views of his party. Yilmaz charged that the Assembly is not  being briefed on the foreign contacts being held regarding the  Cyprus problem. We are trying to follow the developments  through bits of information leaked to certain newspaper  columnists, he said, adding that these rumors are causing  concern. He called on the prime minister to reveal the historic  opportunity she says must not be missed. I am concerned for  the future of the Turkish Cypriot people, Yilmaz said.    [Begin Yilmaz recording] I want to say to the prime minister  the following: You are the prime minister of the Turkish  Republican State. On behalf of my deputies and, if they allow  me, on behalf of all the deputies, I promise you: If you assume  your responsibilities with the faith the nation expects of you;  if you fulfill your duties; if you, with sincere determination,  protect our rights and interests regarding the Cyprus problem,  which is not only the national issue of the Turkish Cypriot  people but of Turkey as well; if you stop making the grave  mistake of believing and of trying to make the Turkish public  believe that the traps and the salami tactics are good  opportunities, then we will support you as a nation, even if the  entire world challenges you. [end recording]    Yilmaz concluded by saying that a general debate will be  beneficial because the truths will be revealed. [passage  omitted]    After the speeches, the TGNA voted against the motion to  hold  a general debate on the Cyprus issue.</p>

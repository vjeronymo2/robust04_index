			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Privatisation scheme will be viable, says Poland POLISH officials said yesterday that, despite some opposition, enough state sector enterprises would participate in the country's mass privatisation plan to make the scheme viable. Mr Ron Freeman, the acting president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has meanwhile confirmed that the bank will 'ensure that the companies (being privatised) will have full access to the European Bank's resources'. Despite Mr Freeman's encouragement that companies seriously consider joining the privatisation programme, 30 companies have refused to participate. The Privatisation Ministry is conducting talks with scores more to persuade them to join. Under the plan, more than 600 state sector enterprises are to be handed over to western managed investment funds. Shares will be distributed at a nominal charge to Polish applicants. Many companies hesitant about the scheme are planning management or employee buy-outs or are considering joint ventures with western partners. About 200 companies are already 100 per cent state-owned joint stock companies which have been earmarked for the scheme and will be participating. Another 440 companies have the choice of opting out by the end of this month and the ministry has accepted decisions by 30 to do so. Meanwhile, 100 companies have confirmed they will be participating, according to Mr Jerzy Thieme, who is responsible for the scheme in the ministry, Implementation of the scheme will leave Poland with around 5,600 enterprises still in state hands. Around 780 have been privatised to date.</p>

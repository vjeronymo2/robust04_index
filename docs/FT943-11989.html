			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK bread-wheat faces continental challenge - Imports have soared as the domestic crop has stagnated UK wheat farmers risk losing market share to French and German rivals if they fail to grow enough quality bread-grain to meet millers' needs, according to leading flour milling and baking group Rank Hovis MacDougall. With the advent of the single market and ever closer European Union intra-trade, the UK flour industry will almost certainly be challenged by continental competitors seeing outlets for their excess mill capacity in the years ahead. At a time when the EU is under notice to cut wheat exports under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade flour is an assured outlet that farmers can ill afford to lose. RHM's plea to farmers is a perennial one, but this year it has taken on a sharper edge. In the past 12 months, UK bread-wheat imports soared 50 per cent to an estimated 1.5m tonnes - double the level of 1991-92 - after the domestic crop failed to supply the normal 80 per cent of millers' needs. Millers' costs rose as quality wheat also ran short in Canada and the US, whose hard wheats are used to raise flour quality. It was a big disappointment for consumers who had been led to believe that wheat prices would drop 29 per cent with reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. The millers acknowledge UK farmers face a dilemma. Bread-wheat needs plenty of sunshine when crops are ripening to create protein and other qualities essential to make bread rise when baked. So the crop carries a risk of failure from fickle weather. Sufficient price premiums are needed to encourage planning of bread-wheat instead of lower-priced but much higher-yielding (and easier to grow) feed-wheat. Plant breeders have been working for years to come up with an optimum mix of quality and yield to maximise farmers' profits; but such compromises do not suit millers' needs. Bread-flour requires a consistent and finely-balanced quality of wheat. 'We need to know exactly what we're getting - varietal integrity, for example, is all important,' points out Mr Peter Baker, managing director of Rank Hovis's milling division. Farmers aiming to grow for the 3.2m-3.4m- tonne UK bread-wheat market have to rely on guidance from their seed suppliers and on the signal from the previous season's breadwheat premiums. Some guesswork is inevitable. Yet getting the right balance between supply and demand is vital - too big a bread-wheat crop can depress the price premium and put farmers off in the following year. One suggestion is for more farmers to grow bread-wheat under fixed contracts with buyers - a system expected to produce several hundred thousand tonnes next year. But contracts can have drawbacks. A miller could find himself locked into fixed costs while his competitors benefitted from a fall in the market value of bread-wheat. Contracts would not prevent farmers growing too much bread-wheat, happened four years ago, causing the premium to collapse. Neither would contracts ensure production as the crop could fail on weather factors. 'None the less, contracts may be a partial answer,' concedes Rank Hovis Wheat director, Mr Peter Jones. RHM, like other UK millers, sources its bread-wheats from many origins to build up quality of the 200 grades of flour it produces. In recent years, thanks to quantum leaps in crop quality and flour milling technology, British flour has been made from up to 88 per cent home-grown grain. In the past year that dropped to only 71 per cent, partly because farmers sowed insufficient quantities of the right (Class I) varieties, partly because the weather affected quality and partly because of missed opportunities. Hundreds of tonnes were drawn in from the Continent where supplies were often more readily available at competitive prices. This year's UK wheat plantings are estimated to have risen by about 1.5 per cent, suggesting, with average yields, a crop close to last year's 12.9m tonnes. A fortnight ago Mr Jones was hoping that the fine weather would yield enough bread-wheat to reduce imports to as little as 1m tones. But weeks of scorching, dry conditions have threatened crop stress and concern for quality is already reflected in slow farmer selling and premiums of up to Pounds 24 a tonne for bread-wheat over feed-wheat. A clear national quality picture will not emerge, however, before the second week of August, when harvesting will be in full swing. The bread-wheat premiums must also be added to higher-than-expected base prices - confounding forecasts that consumers' grain costs would be cut by CAP reform. Although EU support prices have been reduced in European currency unit terms sterling prices have been boosted by two 'green' pound devaluations this month alone. Not that the open market need take much notice of support - it is already trading well above that level, and above that of this time last year, thanks to empty intervention stores, a year of heavier-than-expected exports, and strong demand from the animal feed sector. Having started the new season with a much smaller carry-over, the UK has already sold forward a significant chunk of the coming crop for export. With EU intervention stocks also sharply down and concern being expressed over French and German wheat quality many consumers are bracing themselves for high grain costs over the coming year. 'What we need above all is orderly marketing,' says Mr Jones. 'We want to use more British wheat and we could have used more last year if prices had been competitive when quality fears first emerged. There is always a tendency in this market to respond to short-term price signals; opportunities to sell at a reasonable price can be lost. However, it is vital for farmers in the long term to keep as much of this processing business as they can in the UK.'</p>

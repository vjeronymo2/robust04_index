			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Renishaw down 21% to Pounds 7.14m as foreshadowed RENISHAW, the engineering group which makes specialist measuring equipment, reported a 21 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 as its main markets remained deeply affected by recession. The profits fall, from Pounds 9.09m to Pounds 7.14m, foreshadowed in a warning three months ago, left the shares 5p down at 275p. Earnings per share fell from 13.1p to 10.3p and the recommended final dividend is held at 4p for an unchanged total of 6.5p. Sales grew 10 per cent to Pounds 48m but almost all the increase was due to the effect of currency translation. The group confirmed that had it sold foreign currency when it received it, rather than hedging forward with sales ahead of the devaluation of sterling in September last year, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 1.3m higher. Mr David McMurtry, chief executive, said sales in the first quarter of this year were ahead of last year but trading remained difficult. At the operating level, before net earned interest of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.4m), profits were down from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 4.94m, representing a slide in the operating margin to 10.3 per cent (15.2 per cent).</p>

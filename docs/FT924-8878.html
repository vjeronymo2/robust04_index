			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: Soleil's circus extravaganza Soleil's newest circus extravaganza, Saltimbanco, now playing in Los Angeles at the beginning of a two-year North American tour, is a wonderful evening's entertainment that can be enjoyed as pure spectacle, but contains some subtle and profound messages as well. If only the Canadian troupe didn't try so hard to convince us that Saltimbanco carries some deep, mysterious - and, eventually - non-existent overall meaning. Tying Saltimbanco's individual circus acts together with recurrent characters, music, and even a story line is in theory a good idea, but the performers play it all out with an air of self-importance and exultation that is distracting and often downright silly. Epitomising this is Francine Poitras, the chanteuse whose vocals mark the first use of the human voice in any of Cirque's productions. She wafts and struts around the stage, sweeping her arms in arcs with gossamer sleeves floating along behind, her strong and well-trained voice singing - gibberish. That she is singing nonsense words is never mentioned in the programme; many audience members assumed that she was speaking Quebecois Cirque's native French. The performers of the spectacular circus acts carry off Cirque's trademark attitude of exultation more successfully than the incidental players. Twins Karyne and Sarah Steban gaze into each other's eyes with awe throughout their trapeze act because their dexterity, daring and mutual trust is indeed awesome. Cirque's performers are surely at the forefront of their craft. Cuban Miguel Herrera literally turns juggling upside down, bouncing seven balls off the floor at once. A team of 15 acrobats performs a Chinese pole-climbing act extraordinary not only in the acrobats' balance and strength but also in the beauty of the pictures they create as they hang in the air. As with all of Cirque's spectaculars, Saltimbanco is circus updated to be politically correct - no animal acts nor scantily clad women sawn in half. A rock band, spectacular lighting effects, gusts of dry-ice fog and the inclusion of a child in the production makes Saltimbanco particularly appealing to children. Clown Rene Bazinet provides Saltimbanco's sublimest moments. Bazinet, who looks like Goofy, takes an audience member - the evening I attended, an average-looking thirty-something fellow - and trains him in clown tricks for nearly half an hour. The Cirque band and unobtrusive microphone system help Bazinet provide hilarious sound effects which makes the improvised act seem rehearsed. His simple feat ofmaking an ordinary guy a hero carries a longer-lasting message than all of Cirque's faux serious posturing.</p>

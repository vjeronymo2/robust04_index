			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy </F> Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington March 10 TASS -- The Russian  parliamentary delegation led by parliament speaker Ivan Rybkin  had meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice-President  Albert Gore at the White House on Wednesday [9 March].    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the committee on international  affairs of the State Duma (lower house of the Russian  parliament), told ITAR-TASS about the meetings.    The meeting with the U.S. President was a short one, Lukin  noted. The president welcomed the delegation and promised to do  his best to help develop relations between the U.S. Congress and  the Duma.    The meeting with the vice-president was more detailed, Lukin  continued. Gore praised the first steps by the Duma and its  chairman to create a climate for coordinated legislative work  and for national reconciliation.    The sides discussed a wide range of econonmic relations  between the two countries. "Describing positively the work of  the intergovernment Russian-American commission co-chaired by  Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin, we pointed, at the same time, to  several pressing economic problems," the committee chairman said.    Russian legislators stressed that America would make the  best  contribution to Russian reforms not by counselling but by  opening its markets, at least for several years, for Russian  goods.    "The vice-president agreed, in principle, with our position,  noting that the U.S. Administration is now working on this  issue," Lukin added.    The sides also discussed urgent politial questions. The  vice-president noted that Americans sometimes painfully react to  some events in Russia, regarding them as manifestations of  nationalism and imperial aspirations. According to Gore, the  point in question is some aspects of the Russian policy towards  former Soviet republics.    Lukin said that the Russian lawmakers assured Gore that such  worries are groundless, since Russia is more preoccupied not  with conquering anybody but with ensuring basic human rights for  all people living in those republics.    According to the committee chairman, legislators told the  vice-president that Russia does not intend to be a superpower,  challenging America everywhere in the world, since "we have many  mutual interests".    However, delegation members told Gore that Russia does not  want to be a satellite or a second-rate power and that it has  its own interests. The vice-president agreed with this point,  admitting that, indeed, some people display excessive  nervousness over unimportant issues and that it is necessary to  work calmly, looking for common interests.</p>

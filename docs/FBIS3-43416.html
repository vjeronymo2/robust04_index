An informed source said the seven dressed in military  fatigues were shot while travelling in two jeeps. The  authorities have not identified the attackers referring to them  only as "armed elements".    Earlier a source close to the army said the fighting with  automatic weapons, grenades, and even rockets, had left "several  dead".    Eyadema, whose official residence is inside the military  camp  in Lome, was not there when the attack was launched on Wednesday  evening. He and Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh were at  Eyadema's private residence less than two kilometers (a mile)  from the camp.    Five of the assailants were said to have been killed as they  were driving to the president's private residence. The other  two were shot while trying to flee over the border adjoining the  capital, into Ghana.    Loyal troops and paramilitary gendarmes appeared late  Wednesday to have the situation under control. Shooting and  explosions which started at 6:15 pm had (1815 GMT) almost died  out at 9:30 pm.    In a communique broadcast on television shortly after 2000  hours, the Defence Ministry said the attackers' aim was to  "surround the camp and close in on the people inside". It said  the country's land borders had been sealed and that a curfew had  been imposed until 6:00 AM Thursday.    The camp was the target of a similar attack last March which  the government blamed on exiled political opponents of the  regime.    The new attack comes six months after Eyadema was reelected  in a vote boycotted by the opposition. It also comes two weeks  before Togo's first democratic legislative elections which the  opposition claims are being sabotaged in advance through poor  preparation.    Eighty-one French military observers and another 42 from  Burkina Faso have been arriving since the start of the week to  monitor the election and to ensure the army stays neutral.</p>

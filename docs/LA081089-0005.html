			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WAR AGAINST MOSQUITOES COMES WITH STING OF FEE  </P> <P> The hot, humid dog days of summer have returned to San Diego County, bringing  with them malaria-bearing mosquitoes and a flurry of pesticide-spraying  activity.  </P> <P> The only difference from malaria scares of years past is that this time,  beginning this week, the mosquito-spraying is being provided at the direct  expense of the county's homeowners.  </P> <P> Under the county's new vector control program, approved by the Board of  Supervisors Tuesday, individual property owners will be assessed for vector  control services ranging from surveillance of the rat population to  extermination of disease-carrying insects. The bill, which will be included in  the property owner's annual tax assessment, will range from 38 cents for  time-share condominiums to $19 for shopping centers or apartments with five or  more units, according to Gary Stephany, county director of environmental  health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expanded Service  </P> <P> The new system will save the county about $1.4 million a year -- the amount  spent on vector control from the county's general fund last fiscal year. By  contrast, the assessment system will pull in $3.2 million, directly from the  homeowners' pockets.  </P> <P> The extra millions will provide greatly expanded service, which, according to  Stephany, will make the difference between scrambling to react to crises and  keeping pests under control from the start.  </P> <P> "In the last 30 years, we only increased the program by two staff members,"  Stephany said. "It got to the point where we were only doing crisis response .  . . when it got real bad, we had to go out and spray in the air, then warn  people to stay inside."  </P> <P> The expanded program will provide for 22 more vector control technicians, more  effective prevention services and, for the first time, rodent control. The  county vector control program has focused on insect infestations throughout its  40-year existence, but the need for rodent control became apparent after recent  surveys showed evidence of rats in up to 31% of homes in the county, Stephany  said.  </P> <P> The mosquito problem, he said, has also increased exponentially with the  unprecedented population boom, especially in North County. "Every time you  create a new subdivision, you create more drainage, more surface runoff" from  golf courses and lawns being watered, and cars being washed, Stephany said. New  neighborhoods are also springing up closer than ever to the lagoons, canyons  and drainage areas that are natural mosquito breeding grounds, he said.  </P> <P> The $43-million flood control project under way on the San Luis Rey River in  Oceanside has also contributed to that community's mosquito problems, Stephany  said. The Army Corps of Engineers project, which will create a flood-control  channel, two holding ponds and levies on both sides of the river, will prevent  nearby businesses and homes from having to pay exorbitant flood insurance  rates, according to Oceanside spokesman Larry Bauman. But the construction  work, which has created pools of stagnant water, may last another six months to  two years, Bauman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Joined Reluctantly  </P> <P> All 18 cities within the county have agreed to buy into the new vector control  program, though some joined reluctantly. Stephany, who attended a variety of  city council meetings to urge adoption of the new program, said he heard  frequent complaints about the cost. "The comment I heard most often was, 'We  don't want the county to come back to the cities for more money for any more  programs,' " Stephany said.  </P> <P> The El Cajon City Council, the last to join, granted its final approval Tuesday  night after considering and rejecting the possibility of setting up its own  vector control program. "It's just not cost-effective for a city (to do it  itself)," Stephany said. "Plus, it's a regional problem. If you have an insect  in one city, there's nothing to stop it from going over the city line."  </P> <P> Oceanside was another city that seriously considered establishing its own  program and telling the county to keep its assessments to itself. But a city  staff report concluded that it would cost $300,000 to $400,000 to hire four  vector control specialists, purchase equipment and get the program under way.  By contrast, the county's assessment to Oceanside will total $194,210 a year,  according to a report submitted to the City Council by City Manager Ronald  Bradley.  </P> <P> Citing the city's urgent need for mosquito control, the council voted July 26  to accept the county's terms. "We're not closing off our options," Bauman said.  "It's still possible that in future years we might decide it will be more  cost-effective and more effective in terms of mosquito control to design and  manage our own program."  </P> <P> National City Mayor George Waters also balked at approving the program, voting  in the minority against joining it. According to Stephany, Waters felt the  assessment was nothing more than another tax and noted that the city has  promoted industry specifically to keep the residents' taxes down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat to Public Health  </P> <P> The immediate need for mosquito control and the attendant threat to the public  health was the factor that most influenced the cities that were holding back  their approval. "Certainly, the comments made by people at the public hearing  made it clear that mosquitoes are a big concern," said Oceanside's Bauman.  </P> <P> The danger was vividly illustrated by reports of three documented cases of  malaria within the last week. Two cases were reported Aug. 4 in Rancho  Penasquitos, and another case was discovered Tuesday in Rancho Santa Fe,  according to county health department spokesman Ron Yardley.  </P> <P> In the last week, the county health department has "fogged" for mosquitoes in  Rancho Santa Fe, Rancho Penasquitos, Oceanside and the Tijuana River Valley  near the Mexican border.  </P> <P> Seventy-two malaria cases were reported in 1988; 30 of the victims contracted  the disease in the Del Dios area near Lake Hodges, southwest of Escondido.  Yardley said 33 cases have been reported this year.  </P> <P> "We've had three major outbreaks of malaria in the last four years, and each  year it seems to be getting worse," Stephany said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 2 June, the Ukrainian Navy Odessa Garrison,  instructed by the Ukrainian Navy General Headquarters in  Sevastopol, disconnected the Mars-75 navigation system, which  had been ensuring safe navigation of the Black Sea Fleet vessels  in waters near Odessa.    As Captain First Rank Dmytro Ukrayinets, Odessa senior  maritime commander, explained, this step was taken in response  to the Black Sea Fleet Command's refusal to cooperate with the  Ukrainian Navy on various issues.    Henceforth, Russia will independently resolve problems of  safe navigation in the Odessa zone of the Black Sea.</p>

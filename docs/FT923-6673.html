			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sandvik profits drop 13% in first half SANDVIK, the Swedish spe-ciality steel and carbide group, reported a 13 per cent drop in its first half profits to SKr903m (Dollars 171m), from SKr1.03bn for the same period of 1991. In-voiced sales also fell 3 per cent to SKr8.58bn from SKr8.82bn while the order intake dropped to SKr8.86bn from SKr9.04bn. The company said there was no sign of cyclical recovery in its product area to benefit sales for the rest of the year so the profit for 1992 would be lower than the SKr1.92bn last year. Demand remained slack, said Sandvik, mainly because the global recession was now hitting Germany and Japan while the upturn in the US was 'still hesitant'. Latin America, it added, was showing a 'strong recovery' with a 40 per cent improvement in the company's invoiced sales to that area. Sandvik reported an impressive 47 per cent growth in sales in its saws and tools product division to SKr1.05bn from SKr721m. By contrast its cemented carbide activities suffered a 6 per cent decline in sales to SKr4.37bn from SKr4.68bn over the period and steel a 9 per cent fall to SKr2.60bn from SKr2.87bn. Return on investment over the past year was 11.5 per cent, down from 13.1 per cent for 1991 as a whole. Earnings per share after estimated full tax during the past year dropped by 6 per cent to SKr25.10 from SKr31.20.</p>

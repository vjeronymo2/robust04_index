			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY TIGHT END OPTS TO PLAY FOR COLORADO  </P> <P> Sean Brown, a two-year starter at tight end for Valley College and a former  All-City Section 4-A Division selection at Granada Hills High, has orally  committed to play football next season at Colorado.  </P> <P> Brown was an All-Western State Conference selection in his first season at  Valley but missed six games last season because of a broken ankle.  </P> <P> As a senior at Granada Hills in 1987, Brown caught 56 passes for 605 yards and  11 touchdowns in the Highlanders' City championship season.  </P> <P> After graduating from Granada Hills, Brown received a scholarship offer from  Arizona State, but he failed to score 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude  Test as is required by the NCAA and enrolled at Valley.  </P> <P> Brown, 6-foot-3, 235 pounds, was used primarily as a receiver in high school.  He said playing at Valley helped his development as a run blocker, which will  be important since Colorado's offense revolves around the ground game.  </P> <P> "I had fun learning to block," Brown said. "Playing (at Valley) made me a more  complete player."  </P> <P> Brown said that he turned down offers to take recruiting trips to Miami,  Washington, Pittsburgh and Arizona State. The first day players may sign  national letters of intent is Feb. 14.  </P> <P> Brown said he decided not to play for Arizona State next season because his  priorities have changed.  </P> <P> "Before, I wanted to go to ASU because I wanted to play baseball too," said  Brown, a three-year varsity starter in baseball at Granada Hills. "I want to  concentrate on football now."  </P> <P> Brown will become the fourth skill-position player from the Granada Hills  championship team to play Division I football, joining quarterback Jeremy Leach  (New Mexico), receiver Kyle Jan (Arizona) and running back Jamal Farmer  (Hawaii).  </P></p>

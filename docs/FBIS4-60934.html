The statement signed in presence of representatives of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoys said that a new social  and political situation has emerged in the republic, creating  prerequisites for successful resolution of the crisis.    Both leaders welcomed the mediatory role of CSCE and the  Russian Federation in settling the Dniester conflict.    Snegur and Smirnov stressed the need to determine the status  of the Dniester Republic, establish official relations, delegate  and delineate powers and fix up a transitional period for  gradual implementation of reached agreements in all spheres.    The document also calls for establishing firm guarantees,  including with international participation, ensuring full and  unconditional implementation of these agreements.</p>

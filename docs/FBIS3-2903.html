General Liu said this in a meeting this afternoon with U.S.  Undersecretary of Defence Frank Wisner, who has been in Beijing  since March 11, accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher on an official visit to China.    Extending a warm welcome to Wisner, Liu said that this  current visit is helpful to the enhancement of mutual  understanding and the improvement and development of relations  between the armed forces of the two countries.    General Liu noted that the improvement of Sino-U.S.  relations  is not only associated with the vital interests of the peoples  of the two countries, but also significant to peace and  stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.    Wisner said that the U.S. wants to establish solid and  constructive relations between the two countries and their armed  forces, adding that these relations will not only benefit the  two peoples, but also the peace and stability in the  Asia-Pacific region and the world.    This morning, General Chi Haotian, Chinese state councillor  and minister of national defence, met with Wisner and his party.    Chi said during the meeting that with the development of  Sino-U.S. relations, China is willing to improve the relations  between the armed forces of the two countries on the principled  basis of mutual respect and benefits.    Chi said that China agreed to enhance bilateral exchanges,  contacts and dialogue.    Lieutenant General Xu Huizi, deputy chief of the General  Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, took part in  these meetings. He also held talks with Wisner, and exchanged  views with him on relations between the two armed forces and  other issues of common concern.    Yesterday, Lieutenant General Huai Guomo, vice-minister of  the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National  Defence, met with Wisner and his party.</p>

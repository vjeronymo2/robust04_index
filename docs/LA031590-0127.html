			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TITLE FOE WARNS MORNINGSIDE;  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL: BERKELEY HIGH COACH SAYS THE LADY MONARCHS WILL BE IN FOR A  TOUGH FIGHT IN SATURDAY'S STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.  </P> <P> Berkeley High School girls basketball Coach Gene Nakamura doesn't think it  would be prudent for Morningside to print up those "Back-to-Back State  Champions" T-shirts just yet.  </P> <P> Nakamura's comparatively unsung Yellowjackets (31-1) play the well-publicized  Lady Monarchs (31-3) on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. in the Oakland-Alameda County  Coliseum Arena for the state Division I championship.  </P> <P> "We're not awed by them at all," Nakamura said earlier this week. "We're  confident, OK? They are going to have to come and play a game against us  because we're ready to play. And when we're on our game, we play like guys, not  girls."  </P> <P> Most opponents have double- and triple-teamed 6-foot-5 Morningside center Lisa  Leslie, who has nonetheless scored 27 points per game. But Nakamura said his  team will often play the senior All-American with straight man-to-man defense  Saturday.  </P> <P> Nakamura said that approach is justified because he has the better post player  in 6-0 senior Jualeah Woods, who is averaging 18 points per game. The Lady  Monarchs beat the Yellowjackets early last season, but Berkeley led for much of  the game and eschewed gimmick defenses against Leslie.  </P> <P> "Last year, Woods played (Leslie) head up and outplayed her," Nakamura said.  "We know what we can do, and we know what they can do.  </P> <P> "We've been anxious to play them again, and the approach will be the same."  </P> <P> For his part, Morningside Coach Frank Scott said he is eager for his team to  face a non-doubling defense. But he said he doubts that it will last.  </P> <P> "I hope they do it that way," Scott said. "She's kind of tough to play  one-on-one. If Lisa is effective, I think they'll have to go to the double  team. Woods is a good player, but I don't think she can handle Lisa  one-on-one."  </P> <P> The game will be played just a few minutes down the freeway from the Berkeley  campus, but Nakamura isn't counting on a big home-court advantage.  </P> <P> "This season, we have not received a lot of (fan) support," said Nakamura,  whose team trails only Morningside in the Cal-Hi Sports Weekly Division I  ratings and won the Northern California Regional championship in Oakland last  Saturday. "But the fact that we are playing Morningside is going to draw a lot  of people because they want to see Lisa Leslie.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, when they come to see Lisa Leslie, they're going to see a hell of a  Berkeley team."  </P> <P> Scott, who took the Monarchs to a tournament in Tennessee earlier this season,  said playing in the Bay Area "will help (Berkeley) a little, but it won't hurt  us much. We're used to playing on the road and have played in some pretty  foreign places."  </P> <P> The Yellowjackets have outscored their opponents by an average of 36 points per  game and feature up to six future NCAA Division I players, Nakamura said.  </P> <P> Starting along with Woods will be junior forward Alexandra Kay, who is  averaging 16 points per game. Junior Tanda Rucker (18 points per game) is the  point guard, while sophomore Lynda Robinson (13 points) and senior Vikki Horne  (eight points) are also in Berkeley's three-guard lineup.  </P> <P> Sophomore Janet Davis (10 points per game) and junior Akiba Flanagan (five  points) start at forward for the Lady Monarchs. Morningside juniors Princess  Murray (six points) and Bridgete Williams (nine points) are the usual starting  guards, but junior Tyesha Whiting will start in place of Williams, who injured  ligaments in her leg last week. (Although it was originally thought that  Williams was out for the season, she has a chance to play Saturday, Scott  said.)  </P> <P> Scott saw Berkeley play at this season's Tournament of Champions in Santa  Barbara. The Yellowjackets suffered their only loss of the year there to Los  Angeles Washington, the team Morningside beat, 61-45, for the right to  represent Southern California in Oakland.  </P> <P> "They have a fine team," Scott acknowledged. "They have some good athletes.  </P> <P> "(Woods) is a legitimate 6-footer and very quick. And they have a good guard in  Tanda Rucker."  </P> <P> Scott may be underestimating the Yellowjackets if he thinks they have just one  good guard, according to Nakamura, who said: "I figure I've got three of the  best guards in the state -- two of the best defensive guards and probably the  best point in the state."  </P> <P> And with Williams not starting for Morningside, Nakamura added, his team has "a  back-court advantage" which it will try to exploit at both ends of the court.  </P> <P> "We push the ball up and play pressure defense," he said. "They will have to  make some adjustments to play against our speed, our press and our  organization.  </P> <P> "We make very few fundamental-skill turnovers. We just don't make mistakes, and  we do not beat ourselves."  </P> <P> Williams hasn't played in the last two Morningside games, and Scott admitted  that the Lady Monarchs have been susceptible to turnover problems recently. But  he said he has confidence in his guards.  </P> <P> "We've handled (Williams' absence) pretty well so far," he said. "I think we'll  be OK there."  </P> <P> Whatever happens on the perimeter, the focus of the game for most observers  will remain in the lane -- because that's where Lisa Leslie is. But Nakamura  maintains that they're going to find themselves watching a lot of Jualeah  Woods, too.  </P> <P> "(Leslie) gets a lot of P.R. and so does Janet (Davis)," he said. "Woods is  probably not getting her due. If you ask any of the college coaches on the  coast, they'll tell you that she's an All-American.  </P> <P> "Matter of fact, this summer at an all-star camp in Long Beach, Woods got MVP  over Lisa. The same schools that are after Lisa are after Jualeah."  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Straw seeks fresh line on clause IV A NEW approach by the Labour party to public ownership is urged today in a pamphlet by Mr Jack Straw, a senior shadow cabinet member. Mr Straw's call to revise clause IV of the Labour party's constitution, which deals with 'common ownership', has already re-ignited the controversy between the traditionalists and modernisers in the party, outraging some leftwing MPs. Mr Straw said on London Weekend Television's Walden programme yesterday: 'We may perhaps conclude that the reluctance to bite this particular bullet speaks volumes for our timidity, our lack of confidence in our beliefs.' Party officials said that although Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, had made it clear that he regarded a debate about clause IV as an unnecessary diversion from Labour's main task, he was relaxed about Mr Straw's wish to stimulate discussion on the issue. Mr Straw argued that when clause IV was written about 75 years ago Labour was seeking an alternative to laissez-faire capitalism, and that its economic analysis had to change in the light of the failure of Marxist-based economies. 'At the heart of what Labour stands for is the conviction that the market must be made to work for the people,' Mr Straw said. No Labour manifesto had ever said that the way of increasing prosperity was to nationalise everything.</p>

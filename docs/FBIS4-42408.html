			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poll Shows Stronger Polarisation </F> for Eurovote"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- The Italian vote in the  European elections on June 12 is expected to produce a  substantial swing to Forza Italia and the Democratic Party of  the Left, the two major parties in the conservative and  progressive line-ups, a poll reported here today.    According to the SWG polling institute, Prime Minister  Silvio  Berlusconi's party should register 25 percent, compared to 21  percent in the March 27-28 general elections, and the Left  Democrats 23.2 compared to 20.4 percent.    In the general elections, the vote was held under the new  mixed electoral system with 75 percent of the seats filled by  winner- takes-all voting and the remainder proportionally. For  the Eurovote, there is proportional voting for all the seats.    With a ban on the publication of poll results coming into  force at midnight on Friday [27 May], SWG said that the  ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party would hold their  ground in the centre of the political spectrum with 10.6  percent, down by 0.5 percent.    The questioning of a sample of 6,600 voters on May 19  indicated that, in the conservative ranks, the hard-line  rightists of National Alliance would return an unchanged 13.5  percent while the Northern League would lose 1.6 percent to 6.8  percent. The Pannella Slate, also elected in the right-wing  alliance on March 27-28, should fall to 2.2 percent.    On the left, the smaller parties were all seen as losing  ground. SWG said the Network would drop from 1.9 to 1.1 percent,  the Greens from 2.7 to 2.1 percent, Communist Refoundation from  6 to 5.9 percent, and the partnership between Socialists and  Democratic Alliance from 3.4 to 3.1 percent.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Cassoni: manager who made it on the world business stage - Obituary MR Vittorio Cassoni, former chief executive of Italy's Olivetti computers and office equipment group and one of the most highly respected figures in the world computer industry, died in Milan on Sunday of a brain tumour. Although only 51, Mr Cassoni, who began his career at IBM in Italy, progressed quickly through the industry, becoming in 1986 the head of the computers division at AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant. Mr Cassoni subsequently moved back to Olivetti, where he had formerly been head of US operations, to become chief executive in 1988. His ambitions for the company coincided with one of the most turbulent periods in the information technology industry, when the problems of greater competition and technological progress were soon felt on Olivetti's earnings, and contributed indirectly to his departure from the group earlier this year. There followed a radical restructuring which meant the virtual disappearance of the partly-overlapping divisions for product groups set up in 1989 by Mr Cassoni when he became managing director. Mr Cassoni, who had undergone surgery for cancer in 1991, moved to a new post heading the office equipment activities of Xerox, the US computers and office equipment group, earlier this year. However an unexpected bout of ill health obliged him to leave his new position within a matter of days of arriving. A tough but always fair boss, Mr Cassoni was one of only a handful of top Italian managers to make an impact on the world business stage, a position reinforced by his forthcoming manner and open attitude to the media.</p>

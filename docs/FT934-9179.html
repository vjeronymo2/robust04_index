			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK launches campaign to market quality goat milk A NEW nationwide marketing scheme for goat milk will be launched today to ensure high-quality supply to a Pounds 16m UK market that is growing at the rate of 15-20 per cent a year. The new private company, which includes 12 farmers on its board, is being set up by Mr Jim Barnard, who runs Barnard and Gooding Dairies in Somerset. The Ministry of Agriculture's Food from Britain initiative has provided a Pounds 90,000 grant for the scheme. 'Very few people have any idea of what goat milk is or what it tastes like, and generally it has a pretty bad image,' Mr Barnard said. It is also more expensive to produce than cow's milk and can suffer from quality problems. The new venture will monitor production standards to ensure the milk is of a uniform quality, as well as act as a central marketing agency - goat milk is now carried by all the main supermarket chains. The company will also run a processing arm for goat milk products such as cheese. Mr Barnard said there was no plan to compete with the main cow's milk market, but demand for goat milk was growing from consumers who suffered allergic reactions to other dairy products. Interest in speciality cheeses is also on the upturn, which has led to increasing demand from the gourmet sector of the market. Goat milk accounts for around 1.75 per cent of the dairy products market in France, while in the UK it is less than 0.1 per cent. 'It is a very fragmented and dispirited industry with three-quarters of all goats kept in herds of less than eight - that would be the equivalent of two cows,' Mr Barnard said. He believes UK demand could increase to a level similar to consumption on the continent. But he cautions farmers against rushing into goat milk production, saying that the market expansion must be handled in an orderly manner if the quality of the product is to be maintained.</p>

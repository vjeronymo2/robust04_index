			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Management: Consensus triumphs over greed - Top salaries in Germany are fat but not fanciful Germans regard the fuss about top people's pay as a phenomenon of the free-wheeling Anglo-Saxon business world. In the US and Britain, they argue, attention is paid more to individual than to team effort. Also, in the US and UK there is greater concentration on short-term performance than on long-term consistency. For most German companies, quarterly reports are anathema. Salaries in Germany are certainly high, but they are not outrageous by international standards. However, it is sometimes hard to tell quite how high they are. German companies do not give details of individual executives' pay, providing only a total for all directors, so salary levels can be only estimated. Probably the highest paid executive in Germany is Mark Wossner, the self-assured head of Bertelsmann, the media group. Bertelsmann's annual report for 1990-91 gives a figure of DM24.6m (Pounds 8.40m) for management board pay, an average of around DM2.4m for each director. Taking the rough rule of thumb that the chief executive receives up to 50 per cent more than the others, Wossner would have earned DM3.5m. This would put him well ahead of other German high-earners like Eberhard von Kuenheim of BMW, Edzard Reuter of Daimler-Benz, and Carl Hahn of Volkswagen, all of whom are likely to have comfortably exceeded DM2m. Bertelsmann operates a formula intended to keep managers on their toes and reward them well for entrepreneurial drive. Their pay is divided into three components: one part fixed, one part relating to group performance, and the third depending on profitability of the director's division. Bertelsmann differs from other big German companies in two important ways. It is not quoted and, because it comes under the press and publishing law, its board structure is relatively unrestrictive. Indeed, the make-up of German boards is one reason that excesses are foreign to managers. The non-executive supervisory boards, which set the level of executive pay, usually have an equal number of shareholder and labour representatives. Heinz Evers, a director of Kienbaum, the German management consultancy, reckons this 'acts as a moderating element'. So does the presence of ministers or civil servants in companies where the state has a stake. Below the top companies, he says the usual pay level for a chief executive is DM400,000, about a third of which is performance-related or dividend-linked. 'This is good when compared with, say, a professor or civil servant. They don't expect to be millionaires so they are satisfied.' Executives tend to compare their pay with those of their peers in Germany and the rest of Europe. The high remuneration received, for example, by a Michael Eisner of Walt Disney - exceeding Dollars 10m - would be regarded as provocative. Also, a German executive can mostly expect a position for life: he is not likely to be thrown out if short-term goals are not met. After retirement, pensions tend to be generous. The German attitude towards pay is in line with the corporatist approach in German industry. Executives trying to buck the trend would stand out from the crowd. Tax treatment of executive compensation is also fairly rigid. Hence, unlike the US, stock options are not part of top managers' packages. Not only does the stock market play less of a role in German business life - many top and middle-ranking concerns are not quoted, or only partially - but there is no tax advantage for options.</p>

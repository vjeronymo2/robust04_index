			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier  Zeljko Simic said on Wednesday [15 June] that political talks  and diplomatic methods alone could bring about a peaceful and  lasting settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. Meeting a delegation  of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.E.), Simic said that the deployment  of a C.S.C.E. mission to Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) might be  considered only under precisely defined conditions, with full  respect for the sovereignty of Yugoslavia as an independent  state and consideration of its reincorporation into the  C.S.C.E., of which it was a founding member, the information  ministry said.    Simic explained that the previous C.S.C.E. mission had not  been expelled from Yugoslavia, as alleged by the Western media,  but that its term had expired last summer and that Belgrade had  expressed a readiness to renew it if Yugoslavia were permitted  to take part in the work of the C.S.C.E. as a full and equal  member.    Yugoslavia's membership in the C.S.C.E. was suspended in  July  1992 because of its alleged involvement in civil war in  neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Republic of  Serbia, too, is willing to receive C.S.C.E. observers on its  territory, and the main condition for this is again Yugoslavia's  participation in the forum, because mutual respect is a  precondition for dialogue, Slobodan Jovanovic, chairman of the  Serbian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told the  C.S.C.E. delegation.    The talk brought to light the shared view that the U.N.  Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia have not  produced the desired effect and that this is the time to lift  them, said the Serbian Parliament's press service. The draconic  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions were voted in place on May  30, 1992, because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in the  Bosnian civil war.    In the context of Serbia's southern province of  Kosovo-Metohija, Jovanovic and his colleagues informed the  C.S.C.E. delegation that government had several times offered  dialogue to the ethnic Albanian hardline leaders, who had  rejected it every time, and explained that the biggest problem  in the province was that the minority's political parties were  striving for the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia.    Ethnic Albanians have boycotted the country's all  multi-party  elections and are refusing to recognise the legitimate  authorities of Serbia and Yugoslavia, the Serbian parliamentary  officials said. Kosovo-Metohija has for decades been torn apart  by a strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement, which is  striving for the province's annexation to neighbouring Albania.    Yugoslav Minister of Human and Minority Rights Margit  Savovic  told the C.S.C.E. delegation it was necessary that ethnic  Albanians should be made to realise that the international  community does not support their separatist aspirations. She  explained that the human rights situation in Yugoslavia was no  different from that in other countries. There are no massive  human rights abuses, because each individual such case is dealt  with under the law, the Yugoslav Information Ministry quotes  Savovic as saying.</p>

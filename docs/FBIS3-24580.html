Tverdokhleb; </F> UDC 535.232.65]    [Abstract] Light beam splitters for formation of three-  dimensional interconnection, employing planar lightguides based  on the effect of total internal reflection, and holographic  arrays for the radiation input and output are examined in this  paper. Single-beam arrays for input and output, as well as  multiple-beam arrays are discussed and their characteristics are  compared. It is demonstrated that in such microcircuits the  application of multiple-beam arrays for radiation output is  preferable, because when the light losses in the hologram  materials are taken into account, they provide a significantly  greater efficiency of utilizing the light source power than the  single-beam arrays. When the coefficient of light attenuation is  3dB/cm, splitters with a N=1024 output beams and a laser power  efficiency of 50% can be produced using the multiple beam  arrays.

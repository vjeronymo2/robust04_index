			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA;  </P> <P> JURORS ASK TO SEE PILOTS' BAR TABS  </P> <P> Jurors in the Minneapolis trial of three former Northwest pilots charged with  flying a jetliner while intoxicated asked to review court transcripts and a  copy of the men's bar tab from a tavern they drank at the night before their  early morning flight. Attorneys for the pilots maintain crew members proved  they were not impaired by flying the aircraft "flawlessly" through a freezing  drizzle and heavy cloud cover.  </P> <P> The defendants -- captain Norman Prouse, 51, Conyers, Ga.; co-pilot Robert  Kirchner, 36, Highland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35,  Antioch, Tenn. -- guided a Boeing 727 with 91 passengers aboard on a March 8  flight from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis. In tests, the Northwest Airlines  pilots had blood-alcohol readings of 0.06%, 0.08% and, for the captain, 0.13%.  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / MPs tell board not to hinder milk plan MPs on the Commons agriculture committee yesterday criticised the Milk Marketing Board for its handling of plans to open the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to competition. The committee said the board, established by statute as sole supplier of milk from farms, did not take sufficient account of milk buyers' interests in its original proposals to turn itself into a farmer co-operative called Milk Marque. 'This exercise in brinkmanship has been the principal cause of the current delay and uncertainty which the industry is undergoing,' the committee said. Government objections that the proposals could undermine competition have forced the board to postpone market liberalisation from until November. The committee urged the board to treat seriously the agriculture ministry's continuing 'hesitations' over the plan. 'One rebuff for the MMB might be regarded as a misfortune. A second would be immensely damaging to the industry,' it said. When the board is abolished, farmers will be free to sell their milk either to Milk Marque or to dairy companies. The committee said it recognised the anxiety of the Dairy Trade Federation, which represents distributors and processors, that Milk Marque might sign up 80 per cent of farmers. But it criticised the federation for intransigence in its opposition to the milk board's plans.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Ex-chief of Bestwood took funds MR TONY COLE, former chairman and chief executive of Bestwood, the collapsed finance and property mini-conglomerate, yesterday pleaded guilty to misappropriating company funds. The eight charges include perjury, false accounting, authorising loans contrary to the Companies Act and making a false statement to an auditor. The offences all concern the misuse of more than Pounds 712,000 belonging to Bestwood subsidiaries and one of their pension funds and Mr Cole's attempts to conceal this from the company's auditors. The money was used to finance Mr Cole's personal share dealings before the 1987 stock market crash. Mr Cole had originally pleaded not guilty to all 24 charges brought against him by the Serious Fraud Office and his trial was due to start at the Old Bailey yesterday morning. But he changed his pleas on eight counts, prompting the prosecution to drop the other charges. He will be sentenced today. The money taken by Mr Cole came from three Bestwood subsidiaries - Atlantic Fund Managers, Bestwood Securities and the pension fund of British Drilling and Freezing, Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, prosecuting, said. 'He gave various false information to staff and trustees of the pension funds to account for the disappearance of the money,' Mr Roberts said. Mr Cole continued giving untrue accounts of his use of the money - including perjuring himself in an affidavit to the High Court. He intended to repay the money in due course and was confident he could make enough in the bull market of the mid 1980s to do this, Mr Roberts said. During this period, both Bestwood and Mr Cole enjoyed considerable apparent success. The company grew rapidly as a result of a series of takeovers and Mr Cole enjoyed a conspicuously expensive lifestyle. However, the 1987 stock market crash left him heavily indebted to banks and unable to repay money he had taken from his own companies. The crash also left Bestwood itself over-stretched and in severe financial difficulties. Mr Cole was forced to resign as chairman and chief executive. Behind-the-scenes talks led to him using his compensation to repay some debts, but some Pounds 300,000 remained unpaid. Department of Trade and Industry inspectors were appointed in June 1989 and reported to the SFO in early 1991. Two other men who worked for Mr Cole, Mr Peter Southgate, an accountant, and Mr William Collins, a partner with the now defunct stockbrokers Guy Puckle, both pleaded guilty to single charges of false accounting last year. Mr Southgate received a suspended sentence of 15 months and Mr Collins one of nine months.</p>

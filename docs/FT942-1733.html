			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Keys budget confirms fiscal caution: New South Africa's spending plans Any fears that South Africa's business community might have had that spending on righting the wrongs of apartheid would dent the new government's commitment to fiscal discipline proved unfounded yesterday when the finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, presented the African National Congress-led government's first budget to parliament. Indeed, initial reaction in markets both at home and abroad was favourable, with business welcoming the budget's pro-investment thrust. At the same time, an ANC election promise to abolish VAT on basic foodstuffs and drugs was ditched because the fiscal implications would have been 'significant'. In the words of one economist, 'it comes as a surprise to see an ANC government handing out goodies to the corporate sector but not to the masses'. Mr Keys managed to keep the projected budget deficit close to the 6 per cent of gross domestic product limit agreed with the International Monetary Fund. He is forecasting a deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP for the financial year March 1995 on 3 per cent growth, or 6.4 per cent when the full collection of a temporary income tax levy is taken into account. This compares with 6.9 per cent last year and, with some analysts arguing that the revenue forecasts are conservative, the actual deficit could well be lower. 'The deficit's still a little high, but the emphasis is on investment rather than consumption, which will help sustainable growth,' notes Mr Nick Barnardt, economist at broker Ed Hern Rudolph, Increases in social spending will be focused on the new government's Reconstruction and Development Programme which, as previously announced, will amount to R2.5bn (Pounds 458m) for the current financial year. Expected future allocations come to R37.5bn over five years, although this figure is subject to change. depending on future economic growth and political pressures. Ministers defended the decision not to abolish VAT on basic foods saying that targeted spending programmes such as free health care for infants and a school feeding scheme would do more to achieve poverty reduction than tax cuts. Particularly striking was the size of the costs of the transition at nearly R4bn. This was largely due to greater than expected costs from the election and the incorporation of former guerrillas into the army. To help finance this, revenue will increase 11.2 per cent in the current year, thanks primarily to a R2.6bn transition levy on individuals and companies. Individuals will pay a 5 per cent surcharge on that portion of their income in excess of R50,000 a year. Companies will pay a similar 5 per cent surcharge on their profits. Mr Keys and his deputy Mr Alec Erwin stressed that the transition surcharge would be temporary and that the government would not seek excuses to maintain it into the next financial year as a 'wealth tax'. Mr Keys's also announced the appointment of an independent Tax Commission to restructure the tax system. A cut to 35 per cent from 40 per cent in the corporate tax rate is partly compensated by the increase to 25 per cent from 15 per cent in the so-called secondary tax payable on dividends. The net effect will be an increase of R2bn in direct taxes, partly offset by a R800m reduction in the import surcharge on capital and intermediate goods. Mr Keys will also raise an extra R350m from increased 'sin taxes' on alcohol and tobacco. At 23.6 per cent of GDP, the tax take will be virtually the same as last year, reflecting an anticipated 3 per cent growth in output this year. Government spending at just more than 30 per cent of GDP, is forecast to be slightly lower than last year. After taking account of loan repayments, Pretoria faces a borrowing requirement of R36.5bn (R33bn last year) almost all of which (R34.5bn) is to be funded from domestic borrowing, with R1.8bn raised offshore. Mr Keys said the breakdown between domestic and foreign borrowing would depend on market conditions and the outcome of South Africa's quest for an international credit rating, expected by the end of the year. Social spending will absorb 45 per cent of the budget, up from 44 per cent last year, with education accounting for 22 per cent, health 10.2 and social security 9.3 per cent. Within health, 25 per cent of the budget will now be diverted to primary health care, which has become a focus of President Nelson Mandela's government. Also notable has been the increase in the defence budget which the ANC before the election had repeatedly identified as a sector from which much money could be diverted to development. However, this year's allocation, which has been swollen by transitional costs of incorporating former ANC guerrillas into the army, rose to R12.1bn from R10.6bn. The total share of defence has actually increased to 8.7 per cent of the budget from last year's 8.1 per cent, but remains well down from 13.7 per cent in 1990/91. Mr Keys' announcement that there would be no change to the current exchange control regulations, despite widespread speculation in business circles that some liberalisation was imminent, did not affect the markets and the rand remained steady.</p>

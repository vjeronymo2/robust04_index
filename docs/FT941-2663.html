			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Bosses find it's a snip at the top: FT writers examine the management shake-up transforming western companies A senior British Telecom executive earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year might not appear to have much in common with a deputy store manager at WH Smith earning perhaps a fifth that amount. This week, though, both looked like being swept aside by the same management revolution that is brutally transforming companies in the western world. Job cut announcements have followed a dismally regular pattern over the past few years. Arguably the significance of the latest developments - redundancy for 600 staff at WH Smith and perhaps three dozen big earners at BT - is stark evidence that both ends of the corporate hierarchy are now being squeezed. What BT is doing so noisily is not unheard of at the top of other organisations. Since its demerger last year, ICI has reduced the number of its senior managers below board level from 112 to 90 and expects that figure to be lower by the end of the year; BP now has only 600 managers senior enough to be entitled to share options, against 1,000 three years ago; while BET and BAT were cited this week by one management expert as businesses which have become 'lean and mean at most levels'. This said, the impression remains that in the same way that some boards in the UK have avoided pay restraint by the award of big salary increases, many senior managers have so far been protected from the new realities of the executive employment market. 'When pain is inflicted, it is only natural that the people taking the decisions will leave themselves until last,' observes Rupert Eales-White, principal consultant at Sundridge Park, the Kent-based management training centre. Judging by a Mori poll published recently in the FT, more top managers fear that the day of reckoning may be at hand. Despite the fall in unemployment and signs of economic recovery, 39 per cent of those interviewed said they were 'more anxious' about losing their jobs, against 28 per cent a year ago. The revolution which may catch up with them has been under way for almost a decade, especially in the US, where radical change tends to be resisted less fiercely than in Europe. Its nature is far-reaching - transforming the way organisations do business, the way they are structured, and the relationships between managers and employees - and it is far from over. Throughout the 20th century, large organisations have been structured on the time-hallowed military principle of 'command and control'. So has most management language. Top managers at 'headquarters' set the 'strategy', and tell their senior 'subordinates' how to implement it. Strategy is then translated into 'operations' by senior managers, who tell their 'direct reports' in various specialist departments - or 'functions' - what to do. The cascade process continues down the corporate hierarchy until the message reaches the 'front line': factory workers, shop assistants and other sales staff. The hierarchy's role in the reverse direction has been to pass intelligence back up, level by level, from the bottom and from the outside world. As the management writer Peter Drucker has said, many middle management jobs are really about filtering information. The command and control model has been modified in various ways over the decades, as organisations became too large and complex to manage entirely from the top. But since the early 1980s the system has broken down under a string of pressures. Cost. Management has become unacceptably bloated, not just at head office, but also at every level between it and the front line. In some companies this still means more than 10 tiers. Competition/shorter product cycles. Hierarchies have slowed down companies' speed of response. This did not matter in the 1960s, when growth was sure and predictable, and competition mainly limited to other companies from the same country, or at most the same region. Since the late 1970s, competition in one industry after another has gone rapidly international. Information technology. This has been a crucial influence, rendering many management jobs obsolete especially since the late 1980s. IT has cut the cost of automated information transfer and processing, making it possible for top management to communicate cheaply direct with the front line. It has also improved immeasurably the ability of people at every level and in every specialist department within an organisation to communicate across it, without going through department heads. Horizontal structures. The pressure for faster results has forced companies to cut the amount of vertical communication. Whole tiers of high-level committees have been replaced, usually at much lower level, by task forces and project teams spanning departmental boundaries. This 'cross-functional' drive has been reinforced over the past 18 months by the fashion for 're-engineering' the processes by which organisations do their work - at least in the front line. It has also encouraged 'empowerment', the word consultants and academics use to describe how companies have been trying to give more authority to employees lower down the ladder who are closer to customers and markets. In so doing, of course, they effectively by-pass tiers of middle managers and, increasingly, senior ones as well. Economic recession. All the above pressures have been reinforced by the slowdown which has gripped western economies in the early 1990s. Many of these factors lie behind WH Smith's announcement this week that it is reducing the number of management layers in its shops from four to two (thereby requiring the 600 job cuts). 'Our electronic point of sale technology has meant many functions traditionally performed by staff can now be carried out by a computer system,' explained a Smith spokesman. The market was demanding better customer service from all retailers, while there had been a fundamental change in the workforce. 'People want more responsibility,' he claimed. Long before the WH Smith and BT announcements were even twinkles in their chief executives' eyes, however, America's GE was demonstrating the stark reality of managerial change. Led - some would say frogmarched - by a bombastic new chief executive, Jack Welch, the company tore up its structure, shape and ways of doing business. Between his arrival in 1981 and the end of the decade, GE cut the average number of management layers between Welch and the very front line from nine to four. Its headquarters was slashed from 2,100 people to fewer than 1,000. The number of senior executives across the company was cut, first from 700 to 500, and since 1990 by another 100. The overall workforce has been almost halved, from 404,000 to 220,000. Yet GE's revenues have more than doubled since Welch arrived, from Dollars 27bn to Dollars 60bn. For managers still inside GE, though, the real 'story' is the revolution which has occurred in relationships across and down the organisation. Here, the most important concept is what used to be described - in true military manner - as 'the span of control': the number of people who reported to each manager. When Welch arrived, GE was running at a conventional five or six per manager. By the late 1980s its average had doubled, and is now at about 14 - with some units pushing 25 or more. With that change has come a transformation in the way employees relate to 'their' managers, and in the nature of the management process itself. Since the only way for a single person to 'manage' two dozen people is to allow them more independence, management at GE has changed from being a 'command and control' function to one of mainly 'coaching' people, and - providing their type of task allows it - unleashing their initiative as fully as possible. Several GE factories now have only one level of management, and a few claim to have none at all - just a collection of self-managing work teams which, within prescribed limits, make all their own decisions, from recruitment to purchasing and production levels. The white collar revolution in the UK and the rest of Europe has yet to have such far-reaching consequences in most organisations, notably at the top. But more companies besides BT - Roger Young of the Institute of Management cites British Gas and Unilever - are starting to look at what he calls 'the big numbers'. Cost is often the most visible pressure, and those who run 'command and control' organisations, where middle management culling is almost complete, appear most vulnerable. Over the past five years, for example, BT has shed 95,000 people, in one year alone losing almost 6,000 middle managers. It has reduced the number of levels in the company from 12 to six. Its message is that the old guard, who grew up in the Civil Service jobs-for-life days are no longer wanted. 'Many of them have been in the company for the whole of their career. They are about ready to move on or out,' says Peter Archer, director of employment relations at BT. The effect of this new slimming-down at the top is evident at the outplacement agencies, which help find jobs for the cast-aside managers. 'We are getting a great many more senior executives than two to three years ago,' says Raymond Hudson of Drake Beam Morin. You notice the difference, he says, just by walking through the door: now the DBM offices are filled with senior clients each occupying their own private rooms, whereas a few years ago, middle managers were in the majority, all looking for jobs in a big open-plan space. The ones who can adapt to newly streamlined, process-driven structures may survive; those stuck in the vertical past will almost certainly not. The grim truth for many is that economic recovery - however strong - will not provide a solution. Part-time employment may be growing and many small businesses expanding, but senior executives do not necessarily have the right skills to take advantage of such opportunities. As one redundant senior executive from the electronics industry observed this week: 'The market is going to get much more aggressive. People are no longer just relying on headhunters and the appointments columns of newspapers. They are very deliberately targeting companies and positions where they think their skills can be useful, taking a pro-active approach.'</p>

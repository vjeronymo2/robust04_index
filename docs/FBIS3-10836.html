[Council members] I do.    [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland honor you; if  not, may they hold you accountable.    [Unidentified announcer] Members will now sign the minutes.  [passage omitted]    [Caldera] This will be the organization in charge of  promoting and coordinating the various economic, political,  cultural, ethnic, ecological, and other activities about which  all Venezuelans should be concerned, as well as about the people  who live in these most remote areas of our country. The  National Border Council is not tasked with demarcation. Such  matters are the concern of the Foreign Ministry, under the  direction of the president of the Republic. They are, as I  said, responsible for promoting, coordinating, and directing the  various activities that deal with the human presence along our  country's borders, the people's development in bordering towns.  This is not simply a demographic and statistical effort but  also entails a number of issues regarding the concept of  sustainable development and the need to affirm national  sovereignty all across the fatherland.    I must thank State Minister Pompeyo Marquez for having  accepted this mission, perhaps the most important assignment I  have entrusted upon him as a state minister. I must also thank  the members who will accompany the state ministers as advisers  on border issues. Among these people are Monsignor Ignacio  Velasco, the Bishop of Ayacucho, who has extensive experience in  such areas and who is a proven patriotic spirit; the mayors of  Gran Sabana and Caroni Municipality, who represent the human  presence in the region. They are a symbol of municipal  participation, the basic nucleus of the political community in  this effort that we intend to pursue vigorously.    The Venezuelan border is extensive and varied. Certain  portions are highly populated, such as the border region between  Venezuela's Tachira State and Norte Santander in Colombia; many  other portions have been neglected, and certain portions are  marked by geographical lines, others by the course of rivers and  streams.    More than the limits or our sovereignty, certain areas  frequently become corridors for incursions that are not always  the most convenient for our countries. Many times these  incursions bring disturbances, even crimes. This extensive  border covers very different landscapes. From Piedra del Cocuy,  where our border with Brazil begins, to Santa Elena de Uairen,  the border separates two countries that have lived with their  backs to each other for many years. Now they are seriously  concerned with uniting their initiatives and coordinating their  possibilities, to the benefit of the communities living on  either side of the border.    There are, then, many problems regarding this issue,  including our insular domains, which have often been neglected  by geographers throughout history. The potential here is  enormous, and the possibilities are many for the future economic  and social development of the Venezuelan nation.    Promoting interest among Venezuelans to know, occupy, and  defend their borders is a task that must not be delayed; this is  why we have given this ceremony such special importance. In  recalling the founding of this institution, which we are  reactivating today, I feel obligated to mention a leading  collaborator, an outstanding Venezuelan foreign minister whose  name was Aristides Calvani.    Aristides Calvani, the foreign minister during my first  administration, played a significantly important and admirable  role in matters of state, with a passion for the fatherland and  an overwhelming interest and desire to serve. At this time, as  is just, I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to  such a statesman.    I thank all those present here today for accompanying us. I  hope your presence here is a demonstration of your commitment;  it is, however, a reciprocal commitment. The government's  commitment is to address seriously the problems facing the  National Border Council. The commitment of all sectors and  levels of the civilian and political community is not to look  upon Venezuela's responsibility regarding its border regions  with indifference. Border development problems are not only the  government's responsibility; they are everyone's problem, just  like so many other issues that frequently frustrate and annoy us  so much.    To find a final solution, then, the government needs the  constant help of all Venezuelans. I reaffirm my gratitude for  those accompanying us today. I also reaffirm my conviction  toward this and other essential issues, that are so often looked  upon with little concern or interest, and that will make  Venezuela recognize the need to present itself proud and aware  of its possibilities toward the 21st century.</p>

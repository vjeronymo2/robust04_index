			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / G7 to lay ground for aid to former Soviet republics: US unlikely to win unanimous support for expansionary shift MINISTERS and central bank governors from the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies meet today in Garden City, near New York, to prepare financial assistance for the states of the former Soviet Union and to discuss how to bring stronger growth to the world economy. The issues on the G7 agenda are of great importance but the meeting is more likely to prepare for the next scheduled gathering of the group at the end of April than being a decision-making session in its own right. While there is a general realisation that the world economy is not performing as was hoped at the time of the G7 ministers' last meeting in Bangkok three months ago, the US is unlikely to win unanimous support for a general shift to more expansionary policies. Germany, which last month pushed up its interest rates to levels last seen in the 1930s, may be able to hold out the hope of monetary easing if a satisfactory result is achieved in the current wage round. This is heading for a showdown, with steelworkers expected to vote tomorrow in favour of strike action in support of a double-digit pay claim. Bundesbank officials have indicated that if wage settlements finally turn out at no more than 6 per cent, and German money supply growth slows to safely within the central bank's target range, the way could be open for a cautious lowering of interest rates later this year. Following this week's Washington conference on humanitarian assistance for Russia and the other ex-Soviet republics, it is expected that the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will start discussing the possibility of large-scale financial assistance for the countries of the former Soviet Union. There will be no final decision today on financial support, because there is general agreement that the republics have not yet implemented adequate economic reforms to make such aid effective. The G7, however, will try to reach agreement on how to admit the republics to membership of the International Monetary Fund as quickly as possible. Here too there are problems. The lack of reliable statistical data, the rapid decline of the former Soviet economies, Russia's size and the large volume of trade among the republics could cause difficulties when it comes to fixing their quotas, or membership subscriptions, to the fund. Another problem will be to ensure that Russia and the others are given adequate representation on the IMF's executive board without upsetting any European countries by pushing them down the IMF pecking order. As always with G7 meetings, the ministers will discuss the state of currency markets and recent US-Japanese moves to curb the dollar's rise against the yen. However, it is unclear whether Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new Japanese finance minister, will agree to a statement urging a stronger yen on currency markets.</p>

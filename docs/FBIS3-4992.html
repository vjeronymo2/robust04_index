Pyongyang wants to develop Chongjin port on the East  Sea [Sea of Japan] because of its potential as a link with China  and Russia by land and sea when the North Korean region near the  Tuman River opens up to foreign investment.    North Korea's committee on promotion of external economic  cooperation recently distributed pamphlets on the project to  develop Chongjin port to Western financial institutions and  investors here, explaining how Pyongyang wants to gradually  expand the port's capacity to transfer and handle cargo up to 20  million tons and 10 million tons, respectively, by the early  2000s. In doing so, North Korea will construct a container  terminal for 1 million tons of cargo next year and expand the  present seven quays. It will also dredge a 700,000-square-meter  area in front of the port and build storage facilities covering  560,000 square meters.    Chongjin port currently sits on a 300,000-square-meter site  and the total length of its quay is 2,138 meters. It can  accommodate 105,000 tons of ships, or eight 10,000-ton ships and  five 1,000-ton ships, at a time and 8 million tons of cargo a  year. Pyongyang also plans to lay rails linking  Najin-Sonbong-Chongjin-Hunchun (China)-Khasan (Russia)-Posyet  (Russia) to improve the transportation system.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ORDERS REFORMS BY CITY TREASURER;  </P> <P> PROCEDURES TIGHTENED BUT NO OUTSIDE AUDIT PLANNED  </P> <P> In the wake of dramatic revelations about practices in the city treasurer's  office, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday adopted a series of reforms  to tighten procedures and increase oversight of the office responsible for  investing $2 billion of the taxpayers' money.  </P> <P> The council, after disclosures last month about a treasurer's office attempt to  cover up the circumstances under which a bank that paid Mayor Tom Bradley as an  adviser got $2 million in city deposits, ordered Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg  to establish clear, written procedures.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a special council committee overseeing the city attorney's  investigation into possible conflicts of interest in the mayor's financial  dealings was told it had no authority to hire an outside prosecutor for the  inquiry. Deputy City Atty. Anthony Alperin and Chief Legislative Analyst  William McCarley on Wednesday told the Ad Hoc Committee on Governmental Ethics  that the City Charter bars the council from hiring outside counsel without the  city attorney's permission and puts most disciplinary duties solely with the  mayor.  </P> <P> City Atty. James K. Hahn has said he would not approve hiring a special  counsel. Faced with limited alternatives, the council committee decided to  proceed with a proposal to hire consultants to review Hahn's work when his  investigation is completed next month.  </P> <P> As for the treasurer's office, the council moved quickly to make changes.  </P> <P> Complaining that the treasurer's office has "been making up the rules as they  went along," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the office's practice of having  unwritten policies and not following them "is a formula for corruption." The  council voted to have the city administrative office oversee the treasurer's  office for the next six months. But it stopped short of bringing in a private  auditor as proposed shortly after four days of dramatic hearings revealed  details about a "whited-out" reference to the mayor and rigged "bid sheets" for  the deposits in March that went to Far East National Bank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Reforms  </P> <P> Among the reforms ordered by the council are:  </P> <P> * Detailed procedures for the treasurer for taking competitive bids and  awarding deposits;  </P> <P> * Submission of detailed policies, subject to council approval, for  minority-owned businesses;  </P> <P> * City administrative office review of all investments for at least six months  to ensure that procedures are being strictly followed.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said the city administrative office would act as the "eyes and  ears" of the council during the six-month monitoring period. "We want somebody  who will see that things we are asking you to do get done," Yaroslavsky told  Rittenberg.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effect on Investments  </P> <P> Rittenberg responded that, while he agreed in spirit with the reforms, he  worried that too much oversight and overly strict regulation could diminish the  increasing returns he has been earning on the city's huge investment portfolio.  </P> <P> "I don't know what eyes and ears will do except slow us down," Rittenberg said.  "The performance of the treasurer's office has improved dramatically since  February. . . . The more eyes and ears we have is going to limit that."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky shot back: "It would have been a good idea to have somebody in  there last March 22 to slow you down a bit." That was the date Rittenberg  ordered the $2 million deposited in Far East after getting an inquiry from  Bradley. The treasurer's office then attempted to cover up the fact that no  competitive bids were taken.  </P> <P> 'We wouldn't be sitting here today" if that incident had not occurred,  Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> Bradley was paid $18,000 as an adviser to Far East during all of 1988. He has  said he did not realize during that time that the bank did business with the  city and learned about it only in March of this year, when bank Chairman Henry  Hwang called him. The mayor has said that his March 22 inquiry to Rittenberg  was to determine whether the city had a relationship with the bank and was not  meant to pressure Rittenberg. Bradley returned the advisory fee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recommendations on Hold  </P> <P> Also Wednesday, the city Personnel Department told the council that it will  delay making any recommendations on disciplinary actions for the treasurer's  office staff until the city attorney and the Police Department complete their  investigations into Bradley's possible conflicts of interest in this and other  financial dealings.  </P> <P> In the council hearing last month, it was revealed that someone on the  treasurer's staff attempted to cover up with correction ink a notation on the  deposit in Far East that read "per the mayor."  </P> <P> After a critical report by the city administrative office was released before  the hearings last month, the mayor asked the Personnel Department to recommend  any disciplinary actions it deemed appropriate.  </P> <P> John Driscoll, general manager of the city Personnel Department, said Wednesday  that the outcome of the investigations could "influence dramatically any  recommendation we make" on how to discipline the treasurer's office staff.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores argued that there is already sufficient evidence  of problems in the treasurer's office and in Rittenberg's management to justify  some personnel changes.  </P> <P> But the majority of the council appeared to favor leaving things as they are  for now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call for Outside Audit  </P> <P> Earlier, Councilman Richard Alatorre had recommended hiring a private  accounting firm to oversee the treasurer's office. But council members Nate  Holden and Gloria Molina objected to that as a waste of taxpayer money and an  abdication of the city's responsibility to police its own affairs.  </P> <P> City Administrative Officer Keith B. Comrie said that his office could conduct  the routine auditing but noted that there might be "higher public confidence  in" an outside firm.  </P> <P> After a two-hour debate, the council agreed to leave the matter in the city  administrative officer's hands for now. Only Councilman Ernani Bernardi  dissented in the 11-1 vote on this and other reforms.  </P> <P> The investment guidelines require that all bids be recorded in writing and  time-stamped before deposits are made, that at least three bids be taken, that  equal treatment be given in selecting banks that are invited to bid on city  funds and that the eligibility of banks to receive city funds be reviewed  annually.  </P> <P> Additionally, the council ordered the treasurer to prepare a study on the  benefits and drawbacks of competitive bidding versus negotiated bidding for  deposits and to recommend appropriate changes.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: Future imperfect Whoops. The Bank of England is just about to lose its top economic forecaster. Paul Mortimer-Lee, 41, head of the Bank's economic forecasting division, is off to be chief economist of Paribas Capital Markets in a couple of months' time. Most Bank economists jump ship at a much earlier stage in their careers, and the loss of an official of Mortimer-Lee's seniority could be a bit of a blow for the Bank. The operation of UK monetary policy depends very much on his type of skill. Decisions on whether to raise or lower base rates are based on a judgment of inflation 18 months to two years ahead, and the Bank has sought to set the framework for such decisions through its quarterly inflation reports. Unless the Old Lady moves convincingly to plug the gap, it could find its expertise challenged by the clever clogs at the Treasury and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Leaves learn to make vaccines THE humble cowpea plant is nurturing a potentially far-reaching medical advance which could help prevent Aids and other infectious diseases. The plant, which produces the black-eyed bean, is being used to produce animal and human vaccines. The first experimental vaccines, against foot-and-mouth disease and Aids, are growing in a greenhouse at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. If these experiments are successful, the manufacture of vaccines for a wide range of diseases could be transformed. The drugs industry would make immense savings because growing plants is far cheaper than today's methods which use live animals or cell cultures. Patients would also benefit from cheaper plant-grown vaccines, especially in developing countries, because, being more stable, they could be stored for years without refrigeration. The plant vaccine system has been developed by Agricultural Genetics Company (AGC) of Cambridge in collaboration with Prof Jack Johnson of Purdue University, Indiana, and Dr George Lomonossoff of the John Innes Centre. Details will be announced at a scientific meeting of the Royal Society in London next week. The scientists hope to be able to use it to produce vaccines for other diseases, including hepatitis and the common cold. The first vaccine, for foot-and-mouth disease, is already giving promising results on guinea pigs at the Institute of Animal Health in Surrey. Tests on a second plant-grown vaccine - against HIV - are now under way. The system is based on the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The scientists discovered that its structure is particularly well suited to genetic engineering. They have hooked antibody-stimulating proteins from animal viruses on to exposed 'loops' on the surface of CPMV. In animals, natural CPMV produces the strong immune response that is essential for successful vaccination. But, as a plant virus, CPMV cannot actually infect animals. This should make it safe for use in humans. AGC's production system involves infecting cowpea seedlings with genetically activated CPMV and harvesting the plants after two weeks to extract viral particles, which are then formulated into a vaccine. Each cowpea leaf contains enough material to make 200 doses of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine.</p>

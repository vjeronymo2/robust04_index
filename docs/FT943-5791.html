			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Airline chiefs bemoan Dollars 10m-a-day subsidies - FT Conferences The European Commission is consulting the European airline industry and governments on tightening existing state aid rules for airlines at a time when government subsidies to European national carriers are running at a rate of Dollars 10m a day. But Mr Herman De Croo, chairman of the European Commission's independent 'wise men' committee for air transport, yesterday warned at a Financial Times aerospace conference that there was a risk that carriers seeking subsidies would receive their share of state aid before stricter guidelines came into force. The 'wise men' committee, which was set up by the Commission last year to draw up recommendations on the future of the European airline industry, is also due to meet at the end of this month Mr Marcelino Oreja, the new European Transport Commissioner,to discuss the issue. One of the principal recommendations the committee made in its report in February was the establishment of clear guidelines on airline subsidies. But Mr De Croo noted that in July alone, the Commission approved state aid totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines including TAP Air Portugal, Olympic Airways of Greece and Air France. 'This means that since August 1991, the Commission has approved state aids to European airlines totalling Dollars 10.35bn. That's roughly Dollars 10m a day,' he told the FT conference. 'The tragedy of it all is that when the economy is improving, air transport is on the upswing, and most big airlines are finally making money, a hard core of state-owned majors appear unable to take any medicine at all,' he added. Some European governments under political pressure from their country's labour organisations have in turn placed significant pressure on the Commission to allow state aid to airlines, Mr De Croo said. The Commission's recent approval of state aid to a number of European airlines, especially a FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) package to Air France, also came under heavy attack from senior airline industry executives at the FT conference. Mr Robert Ayling, group managing director of British Airways, said the combined effects of liberalisation and the recession had created a two class airline industry in Europe. The first involved airlines which have had to solve their problems on their own; the second included airlines which continued to defy the laws of economics and had enjoyed a bumper year for subsidies. 'We don't see why Air France should be protected to the detriment of other airlines which are not allowed to dip into their taxpayers pockets,' he said. The issue of state aid was an important test for the Commission. So far, Mr Ayling said Brussels had 'dramatically failed' this test and done 'lasting damage' to its reputation. Mr Jan Stenberg, president of Scandinavian Airlines System, also said the Commission's policy on state aid would slow down the overall European air transport deregulation process. The policy was also attacked by Mr Hans Mirka, head of international operations at American Airlines, one of the two biggest US carriers, who said the recent subsidies to Air France, TAP and Olympic equalled over 40 per cent of the total losses on all western airline scheduled international passenger services in the past four years. He also said several European governments had moved aggressively to restrict the ability of US airlines to fly to and beyond their markets. If other governments failed to match the US commitment to real competition, the US would be unable to continue its pro-competitive policies in international aviation, he said 'the result will inevitably be a return to the protectionism of the past.'</p>

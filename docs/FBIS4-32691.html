			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "pw": "Government on Army, Without Discussion"] </F>   [Text] The government approved a document yesterday  entitled "Fundamental Problems of the Polish Defense System."  Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk will not present the  document to the Sejm until this fall.    As Minister Kolodziejczyk told reporters, the document  contains several options for the development of the Polish Armed  Forces, but their implementation depends on the availability of  funds. According to the minister, there is a "positive approach  among Sejm deputies" on the issue of increasing defense  expenditures. The minister told GAZETA WYBORCZA, however, that  Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko's approach is "not positive."    Kolodziejczyk says that, provided armament expenditures  reach  the level of 3 percent of the GDP over three years, the Polish  Army will reach a level similar to NATO armies by the year 2015.    Of course, we want the size of the Army cut down, and we  want  to have 12-month military service introduced, but an army like  that must have modern equipment and be well trained, so as not  to decrease the state's defense potential, the minister said.    The Defense Ministry also wants to reform civil defense  structures and transfer them to the supervision of the Internal  Affairs Ministry.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (5): Fresh opportunities for expansion - Thai company profile / Christiani &amp; Nielsen (CNT) / The engineering group is intent on extending its operations in the world's fastest-growing economic region Christiani &amp; Nielsen was until recently one of Denmark's most well established construction and engineering groups. Now it is Thai. Late last year, the group's Thai subsidiary made a reverse takeover of its Danish parent. The company, referred to as CNT and listed on the Bangkok stock exchange since 1991, now bills itself as the only Thai-owned international engineering concern. 'The takeover was the natural outcome of what was happening on the ground,' says Mr John Millard, the group's chief executive. 'The parent company was very Euro-focused, yet this part of the world is where the action is . . . we felt frustrated that many opportunities in this region were not being taken up.' While the European parent encountered a series of problems, including large-scale losses in South America due to currency devaluations, business was expanding rapidly in Thailand. Mr Millard says about two thirds of group revenues now come from the Asia region. Turnover has risen from Bt300m in 1988 to a projected Bt6bn this year. CNT now employs about 5,000 people: 4,500 of them are in Thailand. CNT has been active in Thailand for many years. Among other projects, it built the Democracy Monument in Bangkok - one of the nation's political focal points over the years - and it developed the country's main port at Klong Toey near Bangkok. Latest projects include a Bt2.45bn shopping centre near Bangkok and possible involvement in an elevated rail system in the capital. 'If we'd stayed in our original home base, the market would have been limited and the competition intense,' says Mr Millard. 'But with our HQ here we can call on our European technical skills and use them in a more flexible way to search out opportunities around the region. We will probably also start looking at South America again in the near future.' Some analysts are concerned that CNT might try to expand too fast and not complete what is considered to be a much-needed overhaul of its loss-making European businesses. There are also worries about CNT's exposure to the highly volatile property sector in Thailand. But the group is intent on expanding its operations in the world's fastest-growing economic region. Recently it has become involved in a Dollars 200m joint venture project in northern China. Last month, CNT was awarded a MDollars 162m (Dollars 63m) contract to expand the port at Klang, near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVINGS AND LOAN CRISIS AND FREE MARKET FORCES  </P> <P> So now our government technocrats are talking seriously about further  deregulation of the banking system in this country. Just bear in mind that when  the S&amp;Ls were deregulated under Jimmy Carter, our Congress lifted the FDIC  insurance from $40,000 on deposits to $100,000.  </P> <P> We didn't know they had decided to gamble with our money.  </P> <P> They say we must deregulate the banks if they are to remain competitive on an  international level. So, OK, but let the banks buy their own insurance and pass  the cost on to their big depositors. The majority of people in this country  have less than $1,000 on deposit or in savings. Why, then, should we agree to  back the big boys plays.  </P> <P> LAURELLA A. CROSS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

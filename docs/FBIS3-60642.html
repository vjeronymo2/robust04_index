			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 2 December that, in an effort to  solve pending issues such as the nuclear issue, the  establishment of DPRK- U.S. diplomatic relations, and the  North-South dialogue, North Korea has submitted to the United  States a six-point package solution proposal, which includes the  support for North Korea's policy of reunifying the country by  founding a confederal republic of Koryo, and a commitment  guaranteed by documents that nuclear weapons will not be used.    According to a government source, during recent contacts  with  the United States, North Korea presented "a six-point package  proposal." In connection with the nuclear threat, the demands  include: (1) a U.S. guarantee, supported with documents, that it  will not launch a preemptive nuclear attack (NSA) [expansion  unknown]; (2) a U.S. statement on not deploying nuclear weapons  in South Korea; and (3) the permanent suspension of the Team  Spirit exercise. In connection with the abolishment of the U.S.  hostile policy toward North Korea, it asks for: (1) the  replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement;  (2) the withdrawal of the U.S. designation of North Korea as a  terrorist state; and (3) the support for North Korea's policy of  reunification through the founding of a confederal republic of  Koryo.    In a package solution proposal on 11 November, Kang Sok-chu,  first vice foreign minister of North Korea, called on the U.S.  side to take practical actions to abolish its "nuclear threat"  and "hostile policy." However, the details of the package  solution proposal were not revealed then.    Most of these demands are believed to have been proposed by  North Korea in previous contacts. However, it has not been  confirmed whether North Korea presented these demands at the  final U.S.-North Korean contact as a proposal for a package  solution.    North Korea was learned to have left out demands for U.S.  support in the construction of a light-water moderated reactor,  recognition of North Korea as an actual state equivalent to  South Korea, abolition of the export ban against North Korea and  economic assistance, and withdrawal of U.S. troops in this  package solution proposal.    North Korea's exclusion of such demands from the current  proposal is thought to have been prompted by its judgment that  once the nuclear problem is solved in a package deal, the United  States will take appropriate steps for North Korea.    The United States was learned to have conveyed its position  towards this package solution proposal by North Korea on 24  November that a comprehensive [pogwalchok] solution would only  be possible if North Korea accepts inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency and comes to North-South  dialogue. Therefore, North Korea's response, which will attract  a lot of attention, is expected to be revealed soon.    A high-ranking government official stated that "the U.S.  position is that with the exception of the point on supporting  the Koryo confederal system, the remaining five points in North  Korea's package solution proposal are negotiable."    This official said that "since written assurance of not  using  nuclear weapons and a pledge not to deploy them are already  reflected in the existing U.S.-North Korea joint statement, more  specific progress would help. In addition, the United States is  open to considering a temporary suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise." He added that the U.S. position is that "once  transparency in North Korea's nuclear issue is guaranteed, the  prospect for implementation of the denuclearization declaration  will be brighter and accordingly, assistance in North Korea's  construction of a light-water moderated reactor as well as  humanitarian economic assistance will be possible."</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (13): Front line for reformers - Shanghai A NEW and bleak 30-storey hotel extension to the old Jingjiang Hotel in China's former commercial capital of Shanghai is said to epitomise a flashy version of the country's four economic modernisations - it has a steel structure, a multi-storey design, a revolving restaurant, and lifts going up the outside of the building. As China struggles forward with its economic reforms, Shanghai also has two other fashionable modernisations - a proposed yuan 12bn special economic development zone called Pudong, and a new stock exchange. Whether any of them will succeed is open to question. The Jingjiang's revolving restaurant, like those in many of Shanghai's half empty hotels, has scarcely any customers and it jerks between revolving too quickly and not moving at all. External lifts in China tend to break down. The fledgling stock exchange has taken off in a small way since it was officially launched last December, trading on the Chinese love of gambling, but little has happened yet in Pudong. Nevertheless Shanghai, with its population of more than 12m, is the place to watch in the next few years because it has been picked out for special treatment by Peking. The idea is to use the Pudong plan as a catalyst to restore the city to its old position as the financial and business heart of China, and to start a new modernisation drive inland up the Yangtse River. This is backed both by economic reformers, who want to breathe new life into the 1980s opening-up policies, and by older conservatives who support Shanghai's emerging mixture of limited free enterprise in a planned economy. It therefore provides an alternative focus to the highly prosperous free-wheeling southern province of Guangdong, of which Peking traditionalists disapprove - and it might in the distant future even challenge Hong Kong. It has been led since April 1988 by Mr Zhu Rongji, a charismatic and strong-minded 62-year old mayor, who was promoted early this month to Peking to be one of China's five vice premiers. He is a reformist and is expected to continue to be involved in the development of Shanghai, especially Pudong, but will probably be succeeded as mayor by Mr Huang Ju, a vice mayor who has been in charge of financial policy including foreign investment. His support in Peking is assumed to be based on firm backing from Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's veteran leader, supported by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party general secretary who used to be in Shanghai. This has helped him to: shake up the bureaucracy (making marginal inroads into entrenched inertia); begin to tackle creaking infrastructural problems with major projects; encourage foreign loans and investment; pave the way for six new foreign banks; improve the lot of foreign joint ventures; open the stock exchange; and launch Pudong as a symbol of a new future. The main reform now being finalised is for housing. The aim is to tap private savings and create more funds for housebuilding, improve maintenance, and encourage expansion of private housing which now accounts for 20 per cent of the total. People renting or buying accommodation will have to contribute to a central provident fund which they can then draw on later, and rents are being raised. But, despite all this, Mr Zhu has only scratched at the surface of an old industrial city which almost defies modernisation. Economic performance is hit by antiquated over-manned factories, and Peking drains the city of much of its surplus funds. While GNP grew by 3.1 per cent last year (down from 5.3 per cent in 1989), according to government figures, the output from state sector enterprises declined by 0.6 per cent. It was pulled down by municipally owned factories which dropped 1.6 per cent, while those controlled and favoured by Peking grew by 9 per cent. Mr Zhu has not managed to in push through a policy of closing old loss-making factories - there are some 10,000 old run-down enterprises - though a little progress has been made by merging manufacturers of similar products into about 30-40 enterprise groups. But he has begun to change the climate for foreign joint ventures and two of the country's most successful (rated by a government newspaper) are in Shanghai producing Volkswagen cars and Pilkington glass. Foreign managers say that, despite all the problems, Shanghai has definite benefits, including an industrial base for component manufacture. For nearly 40 years after the Communists came to power, Shanghai was used by Peking as a cash cow for Peking's coffers. This was arrested three years ago and a new 50-50 formula for sharing payments with the capital was introduced. But Peking has continued to make extra demands and a total of around yuan 13bn has been handed over in each of the past two years, leaving only about 25 per cent of yuan 16-17bn total revenues for local spending. This is however partly offset by Peking aid for Pudong which, in every way, is Shanghai's main hope for the future.</p>

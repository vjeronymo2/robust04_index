			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Brooke says talks will 'see off terrorists' THOSE taking part in talks next week about the future of Ireland will 'see off the terrorists', Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday. British and Irish ministers met in London yesterday under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before round-table talks involving both governments and the province's political parties start in Belfast on Tuesday. They set July 16 for their next conference under the agreement - leaving 11 weeks for talks, during which the agreement will effectively be suspended. Unionist leaders yesterday insisted that the Republic of Ireland's constitutional claim on the province had to be removed before a 'normal relationship' was possible between the two parts of the island. Mr Brooke expressed qualified optimism about the talks which may forge a new Anglo-Irish pact. He said there was a 'purposefulness' shared by all the participants. Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, was more upbeat. Agreement has still to be reached on the venue for later stages of the talks, when discussions will widen to cover relations between north and south Ireland and between London and Dublin.</p>

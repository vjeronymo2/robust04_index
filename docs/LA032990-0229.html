			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BONO RIDES HERD ON BULLET BIKER  </P> <P> He doesn't wear a badge, but Mayor Sonny Bono figures he has enough moral  authority to chase down speeding motorcyclists.  </P> <P> Straddling his black Harley-Davidson last weekend, his honor spotted another  motorcyclist rocket through an intersection on Palm Canyon Drive, the main  thoroughfare in the desert resort 100 miles east of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I chased him down," Bono said Tuesday. "He said something about not being able  to read my shirt, and I told him, 'You'd better learn to read real fast unless  you want to spend the night in jail.' "  </P> <P> That's when the young rider noticed "Mayor Sonny Bono" printed on Bono's  T-shirt. The mayor, who became famous singing "I Got You Babe" with ex-wife  Cher, got his man.  </P> <P> "We have had hundreds of those bullet bikes come in in the last three years,"  the mayor said. "If they want to behave, fine. But most just go screaming  through here."  </P></p>

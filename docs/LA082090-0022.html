			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLOCKER REACHES OUT, TAKES STARLING'S TITLE  </P> <P> Maurice Blocker, taking advantage of a five-inch height advantage and a 2  1/2-inch margin in reach over Marlon Starling, won the World Boxing Council  welterweight title on a majority decision Sunday at Reno.  </P> <P> "Last time I went in to fight for the belt. This time I came to take the belt,"  Blocker said.  </P> <P> Judges Miguel Donate of Puerto Rico and Lynn Carter of New Jersey scored the  fight 115-113 for Blocker, and Judge Chuck Giampa of Las Vegas saw it even at  114-114. The Associated Press scored it 115-113 for Blocker.  </P> <P> Blocker, at 6-foot-1, towered over the 5-8 Starling, but didn't hesitate to  fight the champion inside.  </P> <P> Blocker's only loss in 32 professional bouts was a 1987 decision to Lloyd  Honeyghan for the WBC version of the title. Starling beat Honeyghan for the  title a year later, stopping him in nine rounds.  </P> <P> An unintentional head butt opened a deep cut under Starling's left eyebrow in  the seventh round. His corner slowed the flow of blood between the remaining  rounds, but the cut bothered him.  </P> <P> After a slow first round, the fighters started mixing it up in the second.  Starling (45-6-1) won the middle rounds on most of the scorecards, but faded in  the last three. There were no knockdowns.  </P> <P> Blocker, of Washington, D.C., was the No. 1 WBC contender going into the fight.  He received $79,000. Starling, of Hartford, Conn., got $164,000.  </P> <P> Third-ranked heavyweight contender Razor Ruddock of Canada overwhelmed Kimmuel  Odum of Gary, Ind., and knocked him out in the third round of a scheduled  10-round bout at Atlantic City, N.J.  </P> <P> Ruddock, 24-1-1 with 18 knockouts, floored Odum with a right uppercut and a  left hook to the head with two seconds remaining in the round.  </P> <P> Odum, 13-4 with 12 knockouts, couldn't handle Ruddock's continual pressure and  scored only with short flurries that had little impact.  </P> <P> Referee Rudy Battle deducted a point from Ruddock's score because he knocked  down Odum with a left hook seconds after the bell ending the second round.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Major General Hasan </F> al-Alfi by 'Amr 'Abd-al-Sami' in Cairo on 9 March]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Reports of the arrest of 25  terrorists involved in recent bombings in Cairo have aroused  general satisfaction in Egypt. Meanwhile the terrorists were  shocked by the reports, which caused them to issue a statement  on Tuesday announcing a halt to their operations for a week.  However, the escape of three terrorists, among them Tal'at  Yasin Hammam (Islamic Group), arouses questions about whether  these fugitive are capable of carrying out new operations. What  is your opinion?    [Al-Alfi] Anything is possible in the situation we are going  to talk about. The terrorists' method is "hit and run." It is a  base method which reflects weakness, not strength. A strong  organization does what it wants whenever it wants and wherever  it wants, regardless of the losses. But we note that the  Terrorists' method does not indicate any sign of strength at  all. For our part, we are constantly directing strikes against  terrorist schemes, the most recent of which was the arrest of  the bombings organization. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Sami'] It is said that terrorism poses a threat to  all Arab and Islamic states. To what extent are Pakistani  authorities cooperating in this connection, and are there any  positive signs in this cooperation under the new government  there?    [Al-Alfi] Contacts with Pakistan are still continuing.    ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has there been any positive development  under the new government headed by Benazir Bhutto, which has no  fundamentalist link, in contrast to the former government of  Nawaz Sharif?    [Al-Alfi] To some extent.    ['Abd-al-Sami'] What do you mean by "to some extent?"    [Al-Alfi] I mean there is a positive development.    ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has that development produced tangible  results?    [Al-Alfi] Yes, it has produced tangible results, but these  matters cannot be discussed in the press. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Sami'] Have you detected any form of Sudanese or  Iranian support for recent terrorist activities in Egypt?    [Al-Alfi] It is known that there is support, and there is  information whose details are being examined. States are  actually involved in these actions. And some states are not  interested in confronting what is happening on their territory  in this connection with decisive measures. However, I tell you  that many cases are under investigation or being heard in the  court. And it is in the interests of the investigation not to  say who is behind these operations or reveal information in this  connection, so that all elements can be completed. [passage  omitted]    ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view Libyan allegations that U.S.  and Israeli intelligence services kidnapped al-Kikhya to give  these states the right to escalate their campaign against Libya  and hit it?    [Al-Alfi] So far none of what has been said has proved to be  true. On that issue, I would like to say that al-Kikhya came to  Egypt with an Algerian passport to attend a conference. He did  not inform us of that. Besides, he is not a political refugee  in Egypt. Any political refugee in Egypt is provided with  protection, surveillance, and security.    Al-Kikhya did not request any security. And he was not one  of those requiring protection, because he was not resident in  Egypt. He came as an ordinary person of foreign nationality,  then left the country. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view the effect of the future  situation in Gaza on security in Egypt, especially as regards  the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating via the Rafah  crossing point if the Palestinian-Israeli disagreement over who  should control this crossing point leads to a formula resulting  in loopholes in control measures?    [Al-Alfi] There are security preparations everywhere,  especially the outlets and borders in Egypt: east, west, north,  and south; on land, at sea, and in the air. I have set up a  special department called the outlets department headed by an  assistant minister in order to supply the outlets with the  latest equipment to detect falsification and forgery, uncover  wanted people and smuggled and banned items, and arrest those  who infiltrate the borders. This is to be coordinated with the  border guard in the Armed Forces.    We have no fears over the possibility of some terrorists'  infiltrating, for two reasons: First, we are in control of our  side of the Rafah crossing point. This side will obviously not  be subjected to any change, regardless of the formula reached  between the Palestinians and the Israelis vis-a-vis control over  the other side in the negotiations concerning the implementation  of the declaration of principles agreement.    Second, both the PLO and Israel are eager to control  security  in Gaza, and it cannot be said that one of them is more  interested in the matter than the other.    There is complete agreement that the peace agreement's  success requires complete vigilance, because any terrorist  schemes through the Rafah crossing point would have a bigger  negative impact on the future of peace between the Palestinians  and Israel than on the situation in Egypt.    ['Abd-al-Sami'] I am asking that question in particular  because there are fears that a relationship might be established  between extremist elements from Hamas, for example, and  terrorists in Egypt.    [Al-Alfi] We are taking account of all that. [passage  omitted]    ['Abd-al-Sami'] Quantities of arms and explosives are seized  whenever terrorist dens are attacked. Where do the extremists  get these quantities of arms and explosives, when there are  tight restrictions imposed on the arms trade and quarries?    [Al-Alfi] A major part of them comes from the remnants of  the past wars in Sinai. To this day we are still seizing dens  in Sinai containing huge quantities of all types of arms,  explosives, and ammunition. This is why a comprehensive survey  of these areas has been launched to destroy this dangerous  source, which is used by terrorists and other criminals.  [passage omitted]</p>

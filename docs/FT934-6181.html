			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Germans expect exports to give economy a boost An increasing number of German businessmen believe the economy has stabilised at its lowest point and expect some export-led improvement in the coming months, according to Ifo, the Munich-based economic institute. An Ifo study, which polls 500 managers, says the business community is less pessimistic than in previous months. The survey lends weight to a statement by the German industry federation, the BDI, that the economy is stabilising. The BDI points out production plans and orders stopped falling at the beginning of summer and capacity utilisation was dropping 'very mildly' compared with the beginning of the year. Ifo notes that companies do not expect a pick-up in domestic demand but that export prospects are 'substantially improving.' Companies in general say orders in October held steady against September. The business community continues to complain that stocks are too high. But they add that prices could fall further as a result. The brighter outlook varies from sector to sector. Manufacturers of semi-finished goods say the situation remains bad but an export-led pick-up is foreseeable over the next six months - a view shared by the chemical industry. But manufacturers of consumer goods, especially cars and electronics, warn that orders will still not match the September level although they are decreasing at a slower pace than earlier. Wholesale and retail traders hit by depressed domestic demand are pessimistic. Over 40 per cent of wholesalers say they expect orders to fall, the worst result polled by the institute since 1982. In eastern Germany, business confidence is up, mostly because of a rise in local demand. Capacity utilisation is stabilising at 72 per cent.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Safeway income steady at Dollars 36m SAFEWAY, one of the largest North American food retailers with more than 1,100 stores in the US and Canada, yesterday unveiled second-quarter net profits of Dollars 36m, or 30 cents a share. For the same period of 1992, Safeway earned Dollars 33.3m, or 28 cents a share. Sales rose to Dollars 3.55bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 3.45bn a year earlier. The results were slightly better than the 30 cents a share that most analysts had expected, and Safeway's shares closed up Dollars  7/8 at a 52-week high of Dollars 16 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday. The company said savings from a labour contract in Alberta, Canada, in the quarter were offset by additional training costs and lower productivity associated with new employees. Mr Steve Burd, chief executive, said: 'We are committed to lowering our cost structure and reinvesting the expense savings in competitive prices and improved service. We believe the moderate decline in operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sale and the gradual improvement in same-store sales are indications that our efforts are beginning to pay off.' The California-based company offered employees in Alberta a buy-out package in March. Severance pay to employees who volunteered for the scheme depleted net income for the first half by Dollars 30.2m, or 25 cents, and by Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents, in the 1993 second quarter. The charge was included in the company's operating and administrative expenses, which rose to Dollars 1.73bn in the first half from Dollars 1.66bn the previous year. A year earlier, Safeway took a one-time charge of Dollars 56.2m, or 47 cents, for accounting changes. Overall, Safeway posted net income of Dollars 34.3m, or 29 cents, in the first six months of 1993 against Dollars 1.3m, or 1 cent, a year ago. Sales rose to Dollars 6.95bn from Dollars 6.85bn.</p>

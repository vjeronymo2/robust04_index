			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Matiba grows from prisoner to opposition leader: Profile of the man who has come a strong second in Kenya's presidential poll THE man who dominated the historic launch of Kenya's opposition coalition to the continued rule of President Daniel arap Moi has earned his spurs the hard way. Mr Kenneth Matiba, who emerged in the elections as the leading popular opposition figure, has one essential African qualification for power: a long spell in jail for his opposition to authoritarian rule. Detention without trial has done for Mr Matiba what it did for former President Jomo Kenyatta, who was incarcerated by the British for his challenge to colonial rule: it has made him a political martyr to Kenya's masses, particularly his powerful and dominant Kikuyu tribe. The 60-year-old former cabinet minister, jailed in 1990 by President Moi for leading the multi-party democracy movement, has established himself as the power broker of Kenya's political future. Yesterday Mr Matiba, leader of the Ford-Asili party, was flanked by the two other members of the coalition, Mr Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party and Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga of Ford-Kenya - once bitter rivals of Mr Matiba but now deferring to him as primus inter pares of the united opposition front. From the start of the campaign for multi-party democracy nearly three years ago, Mr Matiba has displayed an almost messianic belief that this was the leadership role he was destined to play. He has battled Mr Moi since 1988, when he became the first minister to resign from his cabinet over election rigging. Spearheading the nascent multi-party movement, he was detained in July 1990, three days before tens of thousands of people heeded his call to demonstrate for political change. At least 40 people were killed in three days of rioting in Nairobi and Central Province in the wake of arrest. Now he has the opportunity to shape the opposition to Mr Moi and determine whether Kenya's transition to democracy will be peaceful. Interviewed in his campaign office, as it became apparent that he had become a pivotal figure, Mr Matiba gave an early indication of his strategy to lead the opposition and put aside the bitter rivalries which had emerged during the campaign. 'The country does not want Moi any more,' he said. 'The opposition have the majority of votes and we have to stop the violence which is there already. I am the only man who can stop the violence and keep the country together.' Mr Matiba has made an extremely strong showing in three of Kenya's eight provinces and can now claim the mantle of leadership of his Kikuyu tribe. The Kikuyu have been the most militant in pressing for the introduction of multi-party democracy, and observers say many are prepared to take to the streets to remove Mr Moi forcibly if Mr Matiba issues the call. Doubts about their possible return to power, after a 14-year break since Mr Kenyatta's death, remain Mr Matiba's chief Achilles' heel. Mr Matiba was last night firmly in second place behind his one-time jailer, by 1,228,870 votes (26 per cent) to 1,796,233 (37 per cent), in the election for the presidency. His remarkable performance among his Kik-uyu people in the face of stiff competition from his fellow tribesman, Mr Kibaki, stems from his status as the hero of the multi-party movement. A strong family man and enthusiastic mountain climber, Mr Matiba suffered a severe stroke shortly after his release from a 10-month confinement which left the right side of his body seriously paralysed and affected his reading and writing ability. He spent almost a year convalescing in London before returning triumphantly to Nairobi last May. At his country home in Limuru, he shows off the remarkable recovery he attributes to God and stiff exercise. 'Look at this,' he says swishing the air with an imaginary squash racket. 'I couldn't do that not so long ago.' He is light-hearted, even schoolboyish. Many Kenyans remember with affection his career before he entered parliament in 1979, which was built on two of Africa's greatest enthusiasms: beer and football. As a senior executive and later chairman of Kenya Breweries between 1968 and 1979 he was responsible for massive industrial expansion and job creation in one of Kenya biggest state-owned companies. As founder of the Kenya Football League and chairman of the Kenya Football Federation he promoted Kenya's most popular sport across the country. His family and many of his close colleagues opposed his return to the cut-throat world of Kenyan politics, and urged him to retire to the business empire he has built up in hotels and horticulture exports. But Mr Matiba felt he was the only man capable of leading the opposition to Mr Moi and holding the country together - an almost De Gaulle-style arrogance which was to win him many enemies in the opposition. The results of the elections show that if the opposition had held together instead of fragmenting into three main parties, based largely on tribalism and personal greed for power, they would have easily swept Mr Moi aside. Mr Matiba must bear some of the responsibility for this failure to present a united front. He claims his rigid stance has been based on democratic principle, repeatedly stressing that his was the only party to carry out direct elections for the leadership. 'I have been for democracy from the beginning and that was not up for compromise,' he says. But politicians in the other opposition parties, including former close friends like Mr Charles Rubia, who was detained with Mr Matiba in 1990 but subsequently broke with him, say his prickly and volatile nature make it impossible to work collectively with him. An ironic parallel can be drawn, say his critics, between Mr Matiba and his close British friend Dr David Owen, the former leader of the Social Democrats: both men whose personalities led to divisions in the opposition. His policies, too, are close to those of Dr Owen, mixing a commitment to private sector enterprise and privatisation of state-owned companies with a belief in the social welfare role of the modern state, especially in education, and accountability in public affairs. Critical for Kenya is whether Mr Matiba can now rise to the challenge of opposition leadership bestowed on him by the electorate, and play the role of conciliator to unite a fragmented opposition still groping for a path to power.</p>

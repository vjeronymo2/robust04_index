			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Technology: Drivers on the right track - A better sense of direction will soon be widely available with electronic car navigation One of Japan's many mysteries is how to avoid becoming lost in Tokyo. The characterless and poorly sign-posted Tokyo street plan, full of tangled alleys and dead-ends, occasionally punctuated by raised expressways, is a navigational nightmare for both locals and foreigners. Help may be at hand, however. A satellite network launched by the US defence department looks set to produce a consumer product revolution. Electronic car navigation systems promise to help people who find it difficult to read maps not only in the Japanese capital but throughout the world. The network, known as the Global Positioning System (GPS), is based on 25 satellites which cover the globe. They were launched to help military aircraft, ships and vehicles locate their position. A side benefit is that they can be used to locate civilian vehicles. The satellites, equipped with a precise atomic clock, transmit both the time and their orbital position at regular intervals. A receiver in the vehicle calculates its position by measuring the time it takes for the satellites' signals to arrive. An on-board computer needs to receive data from three satellites simultaneously to calculate the vehicle's position to within 30m. A liquid crystal screen then displays a map of the local area and the vehicle's position. The details for the map of Tokyo are taken from a CD-Rom that supplies geographical details of the whole of Japan. As the car moves, so its position is constantly updated. Some systems can show the destination, the direction being taken, and the distance left to travel. The driver can use a remote-control device to make the display zoom from individual streets to a bird's-eye view of entire cities, regions and highway networks. A talking help feature can even indicate when to change direction. The GPS system is not perfect. Jun Ichi Shibata, general manager of the new media division at Pioneer, the Japanese electronics group, admits that in heavily built-up areas tall buildings create reception problems. In the worst cases, says Atsushi Matsuda, general manager of the mobile electronics group at Sony, the receivers can obtain a fix only half of the time. One way of improving accuracy is to use dead reckoning. A combination of geomagnetic sensors or gyros can be used with speed sensors to determine the distance and direction travelled by the vehicle. Another system is to use beacons installed along the road to fix the car's location. Some manufacturers have also developed software that uses the premise that cars only drive on roads, and tries to match the road pattern against the possible location of the car. In spite of these other systems, both Sony and Pioneer, which dominate the sector with more than 90 per cent market share, expect GPS to become the dominant technology, not least because of its relatively low cost. The cheapest retrofit systems can be installed for as little as Y145,000 (Pounds 923) including a 4 in liquid crystal display. Top-end equipment costs as much as Y600,000. Sales growth of car navigation systems has been explosive, though from a low base, says Shibata. Only 9,000 units were installed in 1991, but sales could reach 250,000 this year. His company reckons the market was worth about Y50bn during the 12 months to March 31 last year. Sony and Pioneer control most of the retrofit market, but the original equipment market - supplying navigation systems to vehicle manufacturers - is much more fragmented. Suppliers include Alpine, Kenwood, Clarion, Nippon Denso, Aishin, Mitsubishi Electric, Sumitomo Denko, Toshiba and Matsushita. Although the Japanese Navigation Association has set up two standards, few of the competing systems are compatible. Without economies of scale, the cost of developing software remains high, says Matsuda. This could limit market growth, he warns. Both Pioneer and Sony believe that navigation systems could become extremely significant consumer products if adequate software can be developed. 'In Japan we have high hopes for a large market to develop, given the success of navigational systems already. Adding value to the maps will make all the difference,' says Matsuda. The Japanese government is sponsoring a beacon-based technology, the vehicle information communication system (Vics), which could give the market a big boost. The system, which uses high frequency radio signals, is designed to provide details of accidents, traffic conditions, weather, route recommendations and even parking availability. The idea is that such information could be incorporated on the digital maps. Shibata says Vics will give a huge push to the market, although exactly when the infrastructure will be completed remains unclear. Installation is under way in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, and a nationwide system is being considered. However, implementation is bogged down in discussions between the various ministries involved. An alternative system based on personal communication networks is being sponsored by the Tokyo police. Vehicle navigation systems will soon be available outside Japan. Sony is launching a system with Etak, a US-based group owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which has supplied the digital maps. Pioneer expects that it will launch navigation products in the US and Europe in 1995, although the exact timing depends on the availability of software. Sony says it is looking at how best to protect such expensive hardware from theft. This is not a problem in the Japanese market, but could limit growth in the US and Europe. The prospects for 'gaijin' (foreigners) lost in Tokyo remains bleak, however. Sony and Pioneer say the market for maps of Japan using roman script is simply too small for software manufacturers to justify the investment.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Bulgarians in deal with Efta BULGARIA yesterday became the latest eastern European country to conclude a free trade agreement with the seven members of the European Free Trade Association. The pace, which covers free trade in industrial goods, processed farm goods, fish and other marine products, will be signed this spring and come into effect on July 1 after ratification. The agreement with Bulgaria took just three months to negotiate. Like the accords Efta has already reached with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Hungary, it is 'asymmetric'; the rich Efta members will dismantle their trade barriers faster, leaving Bulgaria until December 2002 to phase out tariffs and other restrictions. The agreement has been accompanied by bilateral deals between Bulgaria and Efta members on liberalising trade in farm goods where there is no common Efta-wide trade regime equivalent to the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy. Bulgaria's exports to Efta countries amounted to Dollars 93m in 1991, while imports totalled over Dollars 220m. Efta is increasingly regarded as a 'half-way house' to EC membership for central and eastern European nations. All Efta's current members except Switzerland will be part of the giant free trade zone known as the European Economic Area which is due to come into force next July. On Thursday Efta and EC negotiators agreed on a compromise financial formula which will clear the way for the EEA, although the revised treaty must still be ratified by 18 national parliaments.</p>

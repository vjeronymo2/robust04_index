			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SHORE PROJECT FOR WILMINGTON GAINS BACKING  </P> <P> Two members of the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners last week said  they will press their colleagues to set aside additional land for waterfront  development in Wilmington -- although both stopped short of saying the  development should include the Heinz Petfood cannery.  </P> <P> Commissioners Floyd Clay and Robert Rados made their remarks after touring the  cannery, which is to close Sept. 1. Wilmington leaders want to convert the  71-year-old cannery building into a restaurant and include it in their plans  for a community-oriented recreational and commercial development along the  waterfront.  </P> <P> Although Rados is against the restaurant proposal and Clay said he is not  convinced that it can work, both commissioners said they believe the port ought  to spare some additional land to make the public-access project work. The  Harbor Department has designated 29 acres for community access, but only a  small portion is along the water.  </P> <P> Rados said he would like the land occupied by the cannery's loading dock, which  fronts the water, included in the development. "If we can get that, I'd be real  happy," he said.  </P></p>

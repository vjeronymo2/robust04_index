			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Gifted recitalist THE AMERICAN mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar has become a familiar figure on the British concert platform - a sterling soloist in front-rank performances of Mahler, the Verdi Requiem and Schoenberg's Gurrelieder. Her operatic side is unknown here except via records. Before Thursday night's concert, so were her gifts as a recitalist. These proved to be prodigious. This event was the fifth in this season's eight-part song series at the Purcell Room (artistic director: Iain Burnside) - an excellent enterprise which seems not to have attracted south of the river the song-recital crowds who have been flocking to the re-opened Wigmore. Yet to stir a small-ish audience in an unsympathetic auditorium (despite the pot-plants) to heights of enthusiasm is strong testimony to a singer's art. Miss Quivar did this, and filled that auditorium with beautiful sound - full, graciously rounded, evenly delivered (no bumps and gear-changes across a wide compass, no striving for big, rich effects), unfailingly sympathetic in the musical personality that it betokened. The programme opened with Purcell, which through lateness I missed (why on earth should the hall's general starting time of 8pm have been brought forward by a half-hour for this series?). It continued with Brahms and Mahler's Wayfaring Lad songs, the latter particularly successful in demonstrating the singer's ability to conjure moods and images through a smoothly shaped singing line, to characterise music with honesty and seriousness, and to sustain a close partnership with the (highly accomplished) pianist, Armen Guzelimian. Miss Quivar's French is a degree or two less malleable than her German; her choice of four Faure songs preceded by the 'Air de lettres' and Prayer from Massenet's Werther was interesting, and warmly executed, but lacking in half-lights. The glory of the recital was its closing group of spirituals. The simple dignity of approach and the sense of unforced conviction concealed a knack of bending words, snapping rhythms and colouring tones that was in its way as finely controlled as that of an expert flamenco cantaor. Miss Quivar exhilarated me and moved me deeply: I hope to repeat the experience as soon as possible.</p>

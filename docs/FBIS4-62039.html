			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] Moscow and Pyongyang have serious discord in what  concerns human rights for North Korean citizens working on  timber-cutting plants in Far East. This was stated by a  high-ranking Russian diplomat specializing in the Korean issues.    He repeated that in accordance with the agreement between  the  former USSR and North Korea several thousand of North Koreans  are working on Russian timber-cutting plants in Far East. The  term of the agreement expired in late 1993. A Russian  delegation has recently left for North Korea in order to discuss  the new agreement on timber-cutting works. The Russian party  specially insists on several provisions of this agreement. "In  particular, we demand that human rights of North Korean citizens  be respected in accordance with the Russian legislation and  international standards," the diplomat pointed out.    He added that the issues on human rights caused "certain  irritation" on the part of North Korea. "Our colleagues from  North Korea state that everything is all right with them in the  sphere of human rights. However, according to non-official  information, North Korean representatives on the timber-cutting  plants sometimes take the passports of North Koreans working  there so that they could not leave for South Korea or for any  other third country. They do not always receive all their  money," the diplomat said.    He emphasized that Russia wanted all North Koreans on its  territory to have passports with them. "I hope we will manage to  settle all contradictions with the North Korean leadership  without violating the international law and the interior  legislation of our countries," the Russian diplomat stated.    South Korean sources announced that the North Korean  leadership was going to send back many of North Korean timber  workers so that they do not go to South Korea. The Russian  diplomat said he was bewildered with such information. "In fact,  this would mean wrecking Russian-North Korean cooperation in the  sphere of timber-cutting works and would make conclusion of a  new agreement more difficult," the diplomat suggested.    However, he underlined that Russia had not undertaken to  repatriate North Koreans unwilling to return to their home  country. "If a person is on Russian territory and the person  committed no illegal actions we have no reasons to hinder their  departure to a third country," the Russian diplomat said.</p>

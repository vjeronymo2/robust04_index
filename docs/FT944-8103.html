			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Mexican union cries foul at paper's tactics: Vendors of the daily Reforma are no respecters of tradition In Mexico City - where a population of 18m buys a mere 500,000 daily newspapers - a peculiar kind of circulation war has erupted. The war is not over price. Nearly all 32 papers in the capital charge the same high price of 60 US cents per copy. Nor is better information the main weapon: competition among reporters at most publications still consists of seeing who can most elegantly transcribe a government press release. The struggle is instead between an aggressive new daily from the north of the country and the politically powerful Union of Newspaper Hawkers, whose 17,000 members claim to hold the exclusive right to sell newspapers in the city. The fight between the Reforma newspaper, which has just celebrated its first birthday, and the union is one example of how the old methods of doing business are breaking down in Mexico. In the latest twist in the campaign, Reforma sent its own vendors out into the street last Sunday - the day Mexicans mark their revolution. It is one of five days in the year when union members do not work and, therefore, newspapers normally do not circulate. Reforma's owners claimed the paper sold 100,000 copies on Sunday, its highest-ever sale. And while their motley salesforce of columnists, politicians, journalism students and housewives have suffered violent attacks and theft from established newsstand owners in recent weeks, Sunday passed off mostly peacefully. Selling on the holiday marking the Mexican Revolution is just one of several things that the union, behind the power of its quasi-monopoly status and violent reputation, refuses to do. Its distribution methods do not allow publications to choose where they want to target their sales. Most newsstand operators do not open until after 8am. When they do open, they are loaded down with stacks of papers that have no market. Many dailies, perhaps half of those in Mexico City, live off flat-fee government advertising rather than sales or circulation-sensitive private advertising and therefore see nothing wrong with a distribution monopoly that allows them to be at least seen in the street, if not purchased. The union has been a favourite of the government, which in the past has used it as a last line of defence against renegade or independent publications. President-elect Ernesto Zedillo's first public campaign appearance was a 5am greeting of union members as they queued up to receive their stock. But for a paper like Reforma, the union is a hindrance. 'We are fighting for our right to free expression and to work when and how we want,' says Reforma publisher, Mr Alejandro Junco, who claims circulation is back now to normal after falling initially by 40 per cent when the new distribution system was introduced at the start of this month. Mr Junco argues that his paper has been designed for an elite audience. He wants to send most of his newspapers to wealthier neighbourhoods where he can reach his target public, something he cannot do through the union. Mr Junco also runs El Norte, Reforma's highly successful sister publication in the industrial capital of Monterrey, which through aggressive marketing and skilful distribution has raised per capita newspaper readership to the highest levels in Mexico. Along the way El Norte effectively destroyed the Union of Newspaper Hawkers in Monterrey. 'This freedom of expression stuff is all just a publicity stunt,' says Mr Nestor de Buen, a lawyer for the union. 'The problem is commercial and what they really want to do is destroy the union.' Reforma seems to agree, placing more hopes on its case before the monopoly-busters at Mexico's recently created Federal Competition Commission, than in negotiations at the Interior Ministry, which regulates the media. 'This isn't about freedom of the press. Quite the contrary,' argues Mr de Buen. 'The union provides a service to many different publications. . . and if Reforma were to kill off the union, other papers in Mexico City who depend on its distribution would suffer a serious adjustment.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks on forming a coalition government in Malawi  after the country's first democratic elections have collapsed.    The talks were held between the victorious Democratic Front,  or UDF, of President Bakili Muluzi and the Alliance for  Democracy, or Aford, led by Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Interviewed  in Blantyre, Aford's second president, Mr. Peter (Kaleso), said  the UDF had failed to meet his party's demands. Mr. (Kaleso)  said Aford had demanded that Mr. Chihana be appointed second  vice president and, in addition, be in charge of either the  foreign or home affairs ministries. Furthermore, Aford wanted  seven ministerial portfolios including Justice, Works and  Supplies, and Agriculture.    Aford, which won all 33 parliamentary seats in Malawi's  northern region during last week's general elections, sought a  coalition with UDF which won 84 of the 177 seats in Parliament.  The Malawi Congress Party of defeated President Kamuzu Banda  won 55 seats, but the UDF said it would not form a coalition  with it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Text] Israeli sources say that any delay in the deployment  of Palestinian policemen will bring about a delay of one or two  weeks in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho. Major General Amnon Shahaq also said as much to  his colleague, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, during the last round of talks  in Cairo. This was reported in a consultation held in Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's Tel Aviv office yesterday.    A member of the Israeli delegation explained that the  deployment of the Palestinian police force will take about one  month and that until it is completed, the IDF will not complete  its withdrawal. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin firmly opposes  unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Sources  in the defense establishment say Israel will not create a power  vacuum which could be filled by Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], even if this means our remaining in the Gaza Strip  for another week or two against our wishes.    The question is: Why are the Palestinians holding up the  entrance of the first Palestinian police officers, who are  slated to arrive in the autonomy areas in two days. A senior  political source said: This does not stem from 'Arafat's  negative attitude; even worse, it is the result of internal  differences of opinion and disarray within the Palestinian  delegation.    Jerusalem hopes that despite the differences of opinion  between the generals and the politicians within the PLO, the  first eight Palestinian police officers will arrive in Gaza and  Jericho next Sunday or Monday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A Boeing-737 airplane from Mainland China's  Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route from Changsha to  Fuzhou this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport at  1042 [0242 GMT]. It was the 11th Communist Chinese airliner  hijacked to Taiwan since 6 April last year.    According to sources, there were 120 passengers and eight  crew members on the Boeing-737 airliner bearing the serial  number B-2599. At 1018, aviation control units from our Air  Force spotted the airliner deviating from its route. The Tainan  Air Base sent two F-5E fighters to guide the airliner to land.  The authorities have instructed through proper channels that  the matter be handled in accordance with the established  principles.    Since the ninth Communist Chinese airliner was hijacked to  Taiwan late last year, the government has lowered the level at  which it will comment on airplane hijackings.</p>

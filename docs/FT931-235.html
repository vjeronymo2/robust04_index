			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Employee groups accept pay limit THE GOVERNMENT'S 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector has won its first acceptance from two groups of public sector employees. The Education Institute of Scotland, representing about 45,000 Scottish teachers, accepted the deal at the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee, and about 10,000 Royal Mail managers have also formally endorsed the offer. Few unions are strongly resisting the public sector pay squeeze but most are also refusing to formally accept it, instead having it imposed on their members. In the case of the Communications Managers Association, which represents Royal Mail managers, the offer was put out to ballot and 68 per cent of the 5,600 members voting favoured accepting the offer. In addition to the basic 1.5 per cent increase some bonus payments were increased by up to 5 per cent. However, CMA officials have strongly objected to a Royal Mail statement that managers are 'over-paid and under-bonused'.</p>

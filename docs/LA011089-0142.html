			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> K MART SLAPPED WITH $60-MILLION JUDGMENT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT  </P> <P> K mart Corp. was hit with a $60-million judgment today when a federal jury  found that the nation's second-largest retailer had breached a contract with a  now-defunct clothing buyer.  </P> <P> Fashion House charged K mart with ignoring a 1983 agreement requiring the  retailer to purchase 85% of its name brand and designer label apparel through  the wholesaler.  </P> <P> K mart canceled the four-year contract in April, 1986, shortly after Fashion  House filed suit against it for unpaid commissions.  </P> <P> K mart lawyer Robert W. Steele told the jury in U.S. District Court here the  contract was canceled not because of the impending lawsuit over commissions but  because Fashion House repeatedly failed to obtain the name brand merchandise  the retailer wanted.  </P> <P> He said the stock K mart received came in broken lots, odd sizes and  unattractive colors, and that the retailer lost $45 million in its Designer  Depot stores, which Fashion House stocked almost exclusively.  </P> <P> Steele could not be reached for comment today.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik said today he expected the Hungarian socialists of  Gyula Horn, who have won the parliamentary elections, to pursue  a pragmatic policy, which could produce a relatively quick  settlement of pending problems between Bratislava and Budapest.  Moravcik met Horn during his visit to Bratislava before the  elections.    Nevertheless Moravcik, who was optimistic about chances of a  Slovak-Hungarian dialogue when he came to power in mid-March,  said he did not expect a basic inter-state treaty to be  concluded before the parliamentary elections which will end his  cabinet's term. Early elections are to be held on September 30  and October 1.    "It cannot be expected that the whole process of  preparation,  conclusion, signing and ratification of the basic treaty of good  neighbourly relations could be managed within such a short time  span. This is technically entirely ruled out, but we can take  important steps to this effect," Moravcik said.    Bratislava hopes the treaty will confirm the existing border  between Slovakia and Hungary, which were set by international  conferences following World War One and which have been  challenged by certain forces in Hungary.    Budapest on the other hand hopes for an extension of the  rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. Some  560,000 ethnic Hungarians live Slovakia, constituting about 11  percent of its total population.    The two countries are also facing other pending problems,  such as the a dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the  Danube, discords over the temporary division of the Danube  waters, non-existence of a readmission agreement and the opening  of new border crossings which Slovakia conditions by the  conclusion of the readmission agreement.</p>

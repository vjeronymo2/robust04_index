			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Jun (EFE) -- The Colombian  Prosecutor General's office announced today it is conducting  investigations of the telephone tapping discovered in the office  of Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper.    This organization received "a microphone for transmitting  conversations and a wiretapping device," which were found on 9  June, from Samper's campaign office. "The Prosecutor General's  Office is conducting the investigations and technical tests  required to establish the criminal action and responsible  parties," Ana Lucia Obregon of the Press and Information Office  announced.    The Colombian "Watergate" gave rise to a serious controversy  on Thursday when Horacio Serpa Uribe, one of the members of  Samper's presidential campaign, accused "the Pastranistas"  (reference to supporters of Conservative Party presidential  candidate Andres Pastrana Arango) of being responsible.    The reaction of Pastrana and members of his electoral  campaign followed. They accused Serpa Uribe of "slander" and of  using the strategy of "lies in view of their fear of the support  received by the Conservative Party candidate" throughout the  country. "They are inventing many things out of fear," a member  of Pastrana's electoral campaign stated.    Fernando Botero Zea, chief of Samper's electoral campaign,  reiterated that "only the Prosecutor General's Office can  determine who the spies are," emphasizing that "we do not have  any evidence." According to Botero Zea, the police released a  report to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, "giving a  detailed account of how the incident took place."    Political circles of the two parties are hoping the results  of the investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office will  conclude before this coming Sunday's elections when Samper and  Pastrana will face one another in the runoff elections for the  Colombian Presidency.    The National Civil Registry Office, charged with organizing  the elections, reported today that it distributed 18 million  voting cards throughout the country and that 72 hours before the  elections, which will take place between 0800 and 1600 (1300 and  2100 GMT), "everything is perfectly controlled."</p>

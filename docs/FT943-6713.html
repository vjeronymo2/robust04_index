			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Herculean labour for the MoD: With Lockheed on bribery charges, Malcolm Rifkind has some tough choices to make Lockheed, the US aerospace company, has been embarrassed by the disclosure that it faces charges of bribery in the US. The US State Department's resulting restriction on the export of its Hercules transport aircraft may make life uncomfortable. The critical issue for the company in the next few months is the impact the affair will have on its chances of selling a large number of its next-generation Hercules to the Royal Air Force. The bribery charges relate to a contract where Lockheed and two of its executives are accused of paying an Egyptian politician Dollars 1m to help secure an order for Hercules five years ago. Lockheed denies the charges. But because the company has been indicted the US State Department has put a stop on licences allowing Lockheed to export its Hercules C-130 and Orion P-3 reconnaissance aircraft. The ban applies to export licences issued after the charges were made on June 22 although the company can ask for exceptions to be made on a case-by-case basis. From a purely legal standpoint Lockheed should still be able to export the next-generation Hercules to Britain. Negotiations with the government to replace the first half of Britain's ageing Hercules transporter fleet have been under way for many months. The UK is still deciding whether to buy the new generation - the C-130J - from Lockheed or to refurbish its Hercules fleet and wait for the new European Future Large Aircraft to become available early in the next decade. Lockheed has offered the Ministry of Defence a fixed-price deal which includes 30 Hercules aircraft at about Pounds 25m each, and a package of training and support bringing the total cost to about Pounds 900m. The company has also obtained the export licences that it would need to sell the aircraft. The licences were granted before the June 22 deadline and are therefore still valid. The company says that even if the licences had not already been granted, it would have argued for waivers and might well have received the go-ahead. But Lockheed still faces an uncomfortable few months. The bribery case will probably not come to trial before next year and the State Department's restrictions will remain in force until then. If the company is cleared the matter will rest there. If it is convicted the State Department can continue an indefinite bar on exports until it is satisfied that the company has reformed its practices. The Ministry of Defence had intended to choose between Hercules and the European aircraft before the end of the year but BAe has argued for more time to present its case, as the feasibility study for the Future Large Aircraft is not yet complete. A cross-departmental Whitehall committee has recently been set up to examine the industrial implications of buying from the US instead of Europe, as well as the military needs of the RAF. That may also slow the decision. In any case the defence ministry may be tempted to go slow while the Lockheed case remains unresolved. Many MPs will object if the order eventually goes to the US, and the case will be harder for Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, to present if an overseas winner is also the subject of a corruption charge. The ministry says it has been aware of the problem for some time and does not feel that the charges will affect the eventual decision. Lockheed says it has done nothing wrong and its case for the RAF buying the Hercules remains unaffected. BAe, perhaps unsurprisingly, is saying nothing at all. Nevertheless, the incident raises the political stakes for ministers. The RAF has long favoured buying new Hercules, partly because some of the fleet is wearing badly and the C-130J will be available much earlier than the European aircraft, and partly because an order for the Hercules now would mean 30 new aircraft while there is still money in the budget to pay for them. But if the defence secretary is tempted to back that view he will have to take on the BAe industrial lobby. He would doubtless feel in a stronger position to do so if Lockheed's name were cleared first.</p>

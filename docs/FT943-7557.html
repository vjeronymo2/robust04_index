			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Dutch coalition sworn in Queen Beatrix yesterday swore in Mr Wim Kok, the Labour party leader, as the new prime minister of the Netherlands. Mr Kok's three-party coalition government of Labour, the right-wing Liberals and the left-leaning D66 party is taking office more than three months after general elections in which the Christian Democrats, led by outgoing prime minister Mr Ruud Lubbers, suffered an historic defeat. The new cabinet's first task will be to put together a 'government declaration' that will be debated in parliament next week. It will also start filling in the details of the 1995 budget, due to be presented in parliament on September 20.</p>

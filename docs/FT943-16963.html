			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Asda Corporate strategies are often a matter of post facto rationalisation. So it has been with Asda. The company's dedication to improving sales from existing space largely reflects the lack of any alternative. With the weakest of the big grocery brands and severe financial restraints in the past, Asda was forced to stop opening new stores some time ago. So it sought another means of salvation. Fortunately, its emphasis on permanently low prices and increased productivity has anticipated the needs of the 1990s perfectly well. Asda is therefore at present registering the strongest like-for-like sales increases in the sector. It is, of course, easier to make such gains from a low base. But one should not dismiss the real progress being made. The harder task will be to devise a new store format that can compete with the best in the business and fuel long-term earnings growth. On that score, Asda still has it all to prove. Asda's impressive trading recovery, though, does not yet translate into a compelling financial case. Those shareholders who backed Asda's cash call 18 months ago will be dismayed that the shares still languish 1p below the rights price. They will also be irritated at Asda's habit of revising the value of its properties. The decision to depreciate ageing stores should have been taken long ago. Clearing the accounting decks twice in two years either reflects a present obsession with cleanliness or - more plausibly - a somewhat careless approach in the past. Asda is not alone.</p>

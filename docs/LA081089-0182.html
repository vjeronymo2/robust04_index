			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bumper Crops Expected: The first reliable estimate of the size of this year's  harvest, to be released today by the Agriculture Department, is expected to  project a bumper corn, soybean and wheat crop. Officials expect a big jump in  output from last year's drought-hit levels because of better weather in key  Midwestern states. The report is expected to project soybean production at 1.90  billion to 2.01 billion bushels, corn at 7.29 billion to 7.76 billion bushels  and wheat no lower than 1.95 billion bushels.  </P></p>

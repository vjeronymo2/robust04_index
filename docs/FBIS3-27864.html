			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Cabinet members agreed with  the Finance Ministry that a law to cut income taxes aimed at  stimulating the economy must also contain a provision calling  for an offsetting rise in the consumption tax, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [1 February].    Fujii told a regular press conference after the morning  cabinet meeting that he asked cabinet members to "reaffirm" that  the two be handled together and that there were "no objections."  The issue has split government and ruling party leaders in  recent days, with many calling for an early tax cut while  leaving for the future the matter of how to pay for it.    Fujii also said he interpreted comments made Monday by  Deputy  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to mean that a joint economic forum  between the government and the coalition has "decided" that the  tax cut and hike will be linked.    After a forum meeting, Hata told reporters that "tax cuts  without future (funding) expectations are dangerous for the  nation," adding that "it is necessary to indicate a set  direction" for handling the consumption tax matter. Hata said  the forum would issue its final decision by Wednesday.    Fujii said the stimulus package, to be announced Thursday,  would be "large-scale," hinting that it will exceed September's  record 13.2 trillion yen package. He said he hopes it will be  the last such package needed to get Japan's sluggish economy on  track for full-fledged recovery in the fiscal year starting in  April and stable growth in the following fiscal year.    Fujii said Japan's economy is not in such dire straits as to  require a stimulus financed by deficit spending that would erode  the nation's fiscal position and later prove to be a "disgrace"  to the financial authorities. Although he does not think the  economy has hit bottom, he noted that Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno reported signs last week that corporate sentiment  is improving.    Fujii repeated that the same tax reform package that cuts  taxes must include the "timing and new rate" of the consumption  tax increase to guarantee repayment of any short-term bonds  issued to finance the cut. To support his concern about deficit  spending, he cited a report by the Paris-based Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which he said proves  the Japanese Government's consolidated fiscal position has  become "the worst among the leading nations."    He said "the world misunderstands" the issue, apparently  referring to a U.S. Government contention that Japan has fiscal  breathing room to cut income taxes without linking the move  directly to a consumption tax hike.    Fujii also said he would carefully watch long-term interest  rates, which have recently begun to edge up, but he played down  concerns that such upward pressure would put a drag on the  economy, saying the government will not issue any bonds that  cannot be "digested" by the market.</p>

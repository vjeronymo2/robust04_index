			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Canada to hold poll on constitution CANADA is to hold a national referendum on a new constitution that aims to settle long-standing tensions between French-speaking Quebec and the country's nine English-speaking provinces, writes Bernard Simon from Toronto. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney yesterday announced that the vote would be held on October 26. The vote will not be binding, but is expected to determine whether or not the Quebec National Assembly and other provincial legislatures proceed with ratification of the national-unity proposals drawn up last month by Mr Mulroney and provincial and aboriginal leaders. A public opinion poll published yesterday indicates that the package enjoys a wide measure of support among voters, with 61 per cent of Canadians outside Quebec and 49 per cent of Quebeckers in favour of the deal.</p>

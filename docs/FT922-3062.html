			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bacardi factions kiss and make up - Canute James finds the company's shareholders burying the hatchet The atmosphere is much lighter these days in the offices of the Bacardi Corporation, the world's biggest rum producer. After five years of a bruising family quarrel about how the company's ownership should be structured, the hatchets are being buried. Minority shareholders have dropped their objections to the Puerto Rican company being taken private and reverting to mainly family ownership; and as a result a new holding company is being created to manage the group's Dollars 3bn of assets. The new holding company, Bacardi, will be based in Bermuda. It will embrace the Bacardi Corporation in Puerto Rico, Bacardi and Company in the Bahamas, Bacardi International in Bermuda, and Bacardi Imports in Miami. The company's Mexican distillery, Bacardi y Compania, will be brought in later this year. 'There are no more fights,' said Adolfo Comas Bacardi, the leader of the dissident shareholders. 'Now everything is hugs and kisses.' The row erupted when one group of shareholders, led by Manuel Luis del Valle, then Bacardi president and now chairman, announced plans to take the company private. The main opposition was led by Mr Comas Bacardi on behalf of shareholders with a combined stake of around 14 per cent. In the ensuing fall-out, Mr Comas Bacardi lost his job along with his brother and two cousins. Mr Comas Bacardi and the objectors filed a petition with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, arguing that the move to privatise the company was illegal because the company had more than 300 shareholders. Puerto Rico is a US possession and has to observe federal regulations which say a private company must have fewer than 300 shareholders. Mr del Valle contended that when Bacardi went public in the 1960s, those who bought shares kept them for long-term investment and that there was little trading of the shares anyway. Fearing a loss of control of the conglomerate, Mr Comas Bacardi's group split some of their shares, putting about Dollars 10m of Bacardi stock into 238 family trusts to ensure that the number of shareholders was more than 300. In supporting the move towards privatisation, Mr del Valle had argued that it was not worth spending Dollars 250,000 to comply with SEC disclosure regulations. Also the board felt shareholders were deriving little benefit from Bacardi's status as a public company. Mr Comas Bacardi contended, however, that the cost of reporting to the SEC was not the reason for the move towards privatisation. Rather, he said, privatisation would remove the need for reporting almost anything, allowing Bacardi to become involved in mergers and acquisitions, and the sale of its subsidiaries, without any real debate. The stalemate was broken last month after meetings between the shareholders and the SEC. The faction which objected to privatisation changed its position and was rewarded by concessions, including two positions on the board of directors, and first call on any new offering of shares. A less bellicose Mr Comas Bacardi has said that the differences which led to the row were 'philosophical' in nature. Company officials said the changes will save the Bacardi conglomerate about Dollars 15m per year in administrative costs, including the costs of reporting to the SEC. The trusts which were created by the dissident shareholders are being voluntarily cancelled and will be deregistered by the SEC. The resolution of the dispute, and the restructuring of the company, is expected to end some anxiety in parts of the Puerto Rican administration. Had the company been damaged by the row, it would have had an adverse effect on the island's finances. Bacardi accounts for almost all of the 20m proof gallons of rum shipped annually from Puerto Rico to the US. The shipments are important not only for Bacardi's earnings. Certain taxes collected on Puerto Rican rum entering the mainland are returned to the island, and the Puerto Rican administration earned just over Dollars 230m from the rebates in 1990. Bacardi Corporation in Puerto Rico recorded sales of over Dollars 660m last year. The company is a major client of the government-owned shipping line and of suppliers of bottles. One economist in Puerto Rico said the restructuring of Bacardi should make the company stronger, and allow it to fight competition for its US market share.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: France confirms privatisation of insurance group Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, yesterday was confirmed as the fifth candidate for sale in France's ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said that the state will sell its majority stake in UAP, which is the biggest single institutional investor in France, after completing the sales of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Banque Hervet. UAP's shares rose by FFr8 to FFr638 on the news. The announcement followed months of political manoeuvring by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, former chairman of UAP who earlier this month moved to the Credit Lyonnais banking group. He was anxious to ensure that UAP was privatised before the other two state-controlled insurers, AGF and GAN. UAP is now recovering after sustaining a sharp fall in profits in 1992. Mr Simon Rudolph, European insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects net profits to rise from FFr1.08bn in 1992 to FFr1.8bn (Dollars 300m) in 1993 and to FFr2.5bn next year.</p>

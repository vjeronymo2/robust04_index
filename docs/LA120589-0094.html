			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: AIRPORT COMPLETION DELAY CONFIRMED  </P> <P> County officials confirmed on Monday that John Wayne Airport's new, $50-million  passenger terminal will not be completed until Sept. 15, five months behind  schedule.  </P> <P> But the airport's top administrator defended the delay, saying that little  could have been done to avoid it.  </P> <P> During a half-hour news conference at the county Hall of Administration in  Santa Ana, Airport Manager George Rebella said he probably wouldn't do anything  differently if he were given a second chance to shepherd the project forward.  </P> <P> "While this is disappointing, it's not a disaster," Rebella said, suggesting  that the construction problems with the terminal were akin to those any  homeowner encounters with contractors during a home-remodeling project.  </P> <P> Work at the airport has been delayed for a variety of reasons, among them  incomplete architectural drawings, late orders for steel delivery and  subcontractor payment disputes.  </P> <P> When word of the delay was reported by local newspapers last week, aides for  some county supervisors suggested that Rebella's job could be in jeopardy.  Asked during Monday's news conference if he had interviewed for a post at the  San Jose International Airport, Rebella declined comment.  </P> <P> Rebella said estimates that the postponement would cost the county $5.6 million  in lost airline revenue were "highly speculative." Even if the predictions  prove true, he said, the airport still would have more than $7.5 million in  reserves.  </P> <P> He said any change in the fees to be paid contractors will be up for discussion  in coming weeks, then will go before the Board of Supervisors for review.

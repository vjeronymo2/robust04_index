			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Lykhoviy: "Middle Eastern Motifs in </F> Ukraine's Banking Policy"]    [Text] The opposition between the National Bank and  the Cabinet of Ministers reminds one somehow of the situation in  the Middle East: People know how it began, but they do not know  how long it will last or how it will end. To continue this  parallel, the stance taken by a certain number of government  people--supported by the agrarian lobby--with regard to the  necessary allocation of more than 50 trillion karbovantsy to the  rural areas for the purpose of carrying out sowing operations  may be compared to the peace initiative of one of the Middle  Eastern sides. They have said something like the following: Come  to an agreement on this large-scale currency emission; let's  smoke a peace pipe, and everything will be just fine. However,  the monetarist course taken by the NBU [National Bank of  Ukraine] does not provide for sowing at such a high price. (In  response to such a demand from the agrarians, one of the  National Bank's highest officials even allowed himself to make  the following bitter joke: "Do you intend, then, to sow  coupons?"). It must be acknowledged that most of the government  authorities have already become aware that the greatest evil is  such hyperinflation, and that it must be combatted. After  emphasizing this thesis once again, Viktor Yushchenko--NBU's  chairman of the board--at a regularly schedule meeting with  journalists elucidated the key positions taken by the National  Bank with regard to conducting monetary policy, the price of  money, and a possible currency emission.    According to Yushchenko, the National Bank has seriously  undertaken the task of putting a stop to soaring hyperinflation.  Because of the latter's great rapidity, this task cannot be  accomplished suddenly or abruptly; and, therefore, we must go  along with it for some time, while seeking to restrain it. That  is to say: If in 1994 Ukraine had a monthly inflation rate  equalling 84 percent, then during the first quarter of this year  it can be knocked down by only 20-30 percent. If in December the  monthly currency emission amounted to 12 trillion, then in  January it must be equal to 8 trillion. To account for this, the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers must designate 4 trillion worth  of savings. According to the National Bank's plan, Ukraine must  gradually make the transition from the 80-percent monthly  inflation jumps which characterized the end of 1993 to  well-harmonized, constantly lowered, and sensible currency  emissions during 1994 by means of what Yushchenko called an  "economizing" system. The NBU has submitted a scheme for such a  system to the Supreme Council for its approval and ratification.  The success of this package can be guaranteed only by a  well-coordinated, finance-budget and economic policy on the part  of the government, the central bank, and the parliament. If with  such an alliance no success is achieved within a brief time  period on account of the NBU's exclusively monetarist powers,  the time bomb which can be perceived even now will explode in a  "cloud of blossoming white smoke."    Another key factor in the National Bank's monetary policy is  a positive, favorable interest rate. The bank has set a nominal  rate equal to 20 percent per month (which amounts to an annual  rate of 240 percent) and does not see the need to adjust it  upward to the level of the monthly inflation rate. We need to  tie inflation in to the price of money rather than the other way  around. If this price is set, for example, at the inflation rate  which prevailed as of November 1993--i.e., 84 percent--no  operating budget or economic plan could endure such torture. A  critical percentage rate must be set, and the state's entire  anti-crisis policy must be keyed to that rate. Talk within the  government to the effect that such a rate would be a  hyperinflationary factor is absurd. Only Ukraine is capable of  discussing such a topic. Academic theory excludes even the  possibility of any kinds of disputes on that score.    Yet another important factor in stabilizing the Ukrainian  monetary unit is currency regulation. Ihor Mityukov, the  National Bank's leading expert on this matter and the NBU's  deputy chairman of the board, has called currency regulation an  important instrument in the matter of regulating exports and  imports and eliminating the deficit in our foreign balance of  payments. Recently, however, because of the universality of VKV  [freely convertible currency] the currency policy has become  confused and is being replaced by a policy of taxation, customs  duties, and export-import fees. The right to twirl foreign  currency around is being taken into the hands of the government,  leaving to the National Bank the role of an observer of a  downward slope and the declining potential to carry out currency  operations to the point where they amount to worthless tokens.  The divergence in the approaches to the organization and  instrumentality of the currency market, as well as the  difference in views on creating exchange rates provide several  more occasions for comparing their dispute with the Middle  Eastern conflict: Yushchenko's National Bank is Yushchenko's  National Bank, whereas Zvyahilskyy's government is Zvyahilskyy's  government, and they will never get together on matters policy  regarding currency or exhange rates. According to Mityukov--whom  we mentioned earlier--currency exchange rates ought to be under  the jurisdiction of the NBU, but the Cabinet of Ministers thinks  "a bit" differently and has called the fixed exchange rate  "12610" the most important element in the policy of state  regulation. A small ray of hope with regard to the possibility  of making the transition to a course of regulations has been  dashed--perhaps even extinguished by the National Bank's deputy  chairman of the board; there is simply no mutually agreed-upon  scheme of regulation. In principle, such an opposition is not  normal; they understand this at the NBU and, therefore, act on  the basis of the following principle: "The sensible man does not  go up the mountain--the sensible man goes around the mountain."  There is already agreement with the machine-builders and miners  concerning the sale of currency on auction-type principles. Nor  has agriculture been forgotten (in order to assist rural  inhabitants in finishing their sowing, the National Bank has  decided to buy up the dollars saved by such inhabitants--at a  price of 30,000 krb. [karbovantsy] for one dollar.    One of the components of the currency market--the NBU's  currency auction--is likewise experiencing some rather unhappy  times: Offers have stabilized at the level of 8-9 million  dollars a month; as a result of already-adoptedemissions  decisions, demand has risen sharply. The fixed rate of exchange  for the karbovanets is depressing exporters, and--therefore--an  increase in the rate of exchange at the auctions will hardly be  able to provide more available freely convertible currency. The  situation is tragic. In order to provide shelter for those many  producers who have not been able to make their way to the tender  committee, the NBU retained the auction but was forced to yield  to administrative restrictions in accepting conditions for  buying currency. The circle of restrictions will thereby become  somewhat wider; moreover, the auction will continue to operate  for some time, ensuring--first and foremost--the purchase of  energy resources, raw materials, and technical needs.    ...Viktor Yushchenko has recently begun to gather  journalists together quite frequently. He does not complain to  them, but merely tells them about his own work. Operating under  the conditions of opposition and misunderstanding is difficult  and often thankless--something like being forced to spit into  the wind, when one feels like spitting in all directions and  going on to something else. It seems that only the National Bank  is bearing in mind the fact that rescuing drowning persons is  largely a matter for the very persons who are drowning. In the  wondrous country of the Swan, the Crab, and the Pike Middle  Eastern motifs have not abated.</p>

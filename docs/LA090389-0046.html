			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: NEW ON CDS: OPERAS FROM GERSHWIN TO VERDI  </P> <P> ROSA PONSELLE. Songs and Arias. BMG Music 7810-2-RG (compact disc). These  recordings, spanning 31 years, show what arguably was the greatest dramatic  soprano of her time in repertory that ranges from the most difficult bel-canto  challenges to simple concert chestnuts.  </P> <P> She was not dubbed a "Caruso in petticoats" for nothing. Her voice was large,  hauntingly dark, and it was the same sound throughout its range from luxuriant  pianissimos to rock-solid fortes without jarring register breaks. Ponselle's  impeccable coloratura technique makes her versions of "Ernani, involami" and  "Casta diva" the preferred ones. A special treat is "O patria mia," an aria  which terrified her because of its top C and caused her to venture very few  performances of "Aida." The note holds no terrors for her here.  </P> <P> Her attention to commitment and detail carries over to the songs, of which  Sodero's "Amuri, amuri" -- accompanied by Ponselle herself at the piano -- is  the most moving. Recorded in 1954, she draws a wrenching miniature drama in  Sicilian dialect that is worth the price of the disc.WALTER PRICE  </P></p>

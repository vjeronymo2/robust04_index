			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WITH ELWAY OUT IN 1978, SHORT-TIMER PASSED TEST;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: SUBSTITUTE WALTER SEYMOUR DELIVERED FOUR CONSECUTIVE  VICTORIES FOR GRANADA HILLS.  </P> <P> "Starting at quarterback in place of John Elway will be Walter Seymour."  </P> <P>  Those words were spewed forth over the public-address system at the Granada  Hills High football field moments before a game in 1978.  </P> <P> The 900 or so fans in attendance that night had to be excused for having a  stunned, deer-in-the-headlights look on their faces when they heard the  announcement.  </P> <P> Elway, the premier prep quarterback in the nation, was being replaced by a guy  named Walter?  </P> <P> And when Seymour trotted onto the field for the first time, the eyes of the  spectators grew even wider and their jaws dropped a bit more. For not only had  the 6-foot-2, cannon-armed Elway been replaced by a guy named Walter, he had  been replaced by a guy who stood just 5-foot-9. In cleats. And weighed about  150 pounds. With his helmet on.  </P> <P> "It was pretty quiet out there that night," Seymour recalled. "Very quiet, now  that I think of it."  </P> <P> Elway, who will lead the Denver Broncos into Sunday's Super Bowl against the  San Francisco 49ers, had sustained a knee injury a week earlier in a game  against San Fernando. Jack Neumeier, then the Granada Hills coach, learned on  that fateful Monday that Elway's high school career -- and, he figured, his own  -- was over.  </P> <P> But he instructed his players to keep it a secret, not wishing to give any  advantage to the next week's opponent, Monroe.  </P> <P> This helped to account for the silence that greeted the news that night that  Seymour, who had not played football in his life until just a year earlier and  whose varsity career at that moment consisted of about five minutes of garbage  time, was replacing the best high school quarterback in the country.  </P> <P> In the face of this pressure, Seymour, one would assume, fell flat on his face.  Threw perhaps a half-dozen interceptions. Maybe lofted a few passes into the  school bus parking lot before Neumeier could find another body with an arm  attached to it and yank Seymour back into the shadows.  </P> <P> That, however, isn't quite what transpired. What did happen was that Seymour  played brilliantly, leading Granada Hills to three consecutive regular-season  victories and earning the team a berth in the City Section playoffs, in which  he came within one completion of sending the Highlanders into the championship  game.  </P> <P> Which wasn't bad at all for a kid who was pulled aside in a 10th-grade gym  class by an assistant football coach and asked whether he might be interested  in learning the game.  </P> <P> "I found him in one of my P. E. classes and noticed what a terrific arm he had  for such a little, skinny kid," said then-assistant and now co-head Coach  Darryl Stroh.  </P> <P> "He played for the junior varsity in 11th grade and then became Elway's backup.  He never got any snaps in practice and played real briefly at the end of two  games. But then John got hurt."  </P> <P> The injury, torn cartilage in Elway's left knee, required surgery. The coaches  and players could not have been more shocked had they learned their starting  center for the past three years was actually a woman on a steroid rampage.  </P> <P> "When John went out, it let a lot of air out of our balloon," Stroh said. "He  was our everything. He was on his way to setting all the national high school  records. And the only guy behind him was Walter Seymour. I recall the general  feeling at that point was something like, 'Oh, gee. Our season is over.' "  </P> <P> Seymour said the first day of practice after Elway's injury didn't exactly  reset the mood on the team.  </P> <P> "I threw five interceptions that first day," he said. "I could hear the coaches  moaning."  </P> <P> Then the games began.  </P> <P> And Seymour was dazzling.  </P> <P> In his first game, he threw for 254 yards and one touchdown and ran for another  in a 34-7 stomping of Monroe. In his second game, he passed for 288 yards and  threw four touchdown passes in a 55-0 win over Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Then, against Mid-Valley League rival Kennedy, in a game that would lock up a  playoff berth for the winner, Seymour threw one touchdown pass and ran for two  more touchdowns in a 21-14 win.  </P> <P> The remarkable story continued the next week as Granada Hills defeated  Palisades, 31-12, in the first round of the 4-A playoffs. Seymour passed for  243 yards and ran for one touchdown, moving Granada Hills into the semifinals  against top-seeded and undefeated Carson. Granada Hills came back from a 12-6  deficit to take a 19-12 lead late in the game, but Carson tied the score and  won in overtime, 20-19, on a tiebreaker system.  </P> <P> The story had ended for Granada Hills and Seymour. But it was one they still  talk about on the Highlanders' campus.  </P> <P> "What we found out that season," Stroh said, "was that we had the two best  quarterbacks in the area on our team. John Elway and Walter Seymour."  </P> <P> Today, that kind of talk makes Seymour, 29, a bit uncomfortable. He knew he  could throw a football, but it took only a few seconds in 1978 for him to  understand that he didn't throw a football like Elway.  </P> <P> "The first time I saw him throw, my eyes got real wide," he said. "The first  time I met John we started playing catch on the sideline with him."  </P> <P> Seymour's reaction?  </P> <P> "My first reaction was, 'Ow,' " he said. "He threw footballs that whistled. He  was unbelievable."  </P> <P> Seymour, who played one season at Moorpark College before his football career  ended, is an X-ray technician. Coincidentally, he works for Dr. Robert  Rosenfeld, the Los Angeles Raiders' team orthopedic physician. And once a year,  Elway comes home to battle the Raiders at the Coliseum and the two friends  meet.  </P> <P> "I see him before the game and we talk for a while," Seymour said. "The last  time, he saw me first and called me over. We were friends, on the field and off  the field, but I try not to be a pain when we meet before a game. I figure he's  got thousands of guys like me coming up to him all the time yelling, 'Hey,  John. Remember me?' I don't want to be like that. That's just not me."  </P> <P> And while the meetings have been brief, they bring Seymour and Elway back a  decade. They talk of their high school days. And sometimes, the meetings make  Seymour wonder.  </P> <P> "When I look back, I have mixed feelings," he said. "Most of the time I think  it was fun, just being on the same team with John. But other times, I think  about what might have happened if I was at a different school and didn't have a  John Elway playing ahead of me. Because of the situation, no one ever noticed  me and I never got a chance to play football at a Division I school or get a  scholarship. And I know that I threw the ball as well as a lot of guys who did  get Division I scholarships.  </P> <P> "But I don't dwell on it. John Elway came to Granada Hills, and that was that."  </P> <P> And on Sunday, as Seymour settles onto a couch like tens of millions of other  people to watch Elway and the 49ers' Joe Montana fling footballs into the  artificial light of the New Orleans Superdome, he will have at least one  thought that no one else will have:  </P> <P> The night of the exploding beans.  </P> <P> "We were at the beach with some beer and a big fire going," Seymour recalled.  "John tossed a can of beans into the fire to heat them up, but then, well, we  were drinking some beer, and we just forgot. About an hour later, boom, the can  just explodes in our faces and John and I are jumping around, covered with  beans and glowing embers from the fire. It was hysterical.  </P> <P> "I can still remember how hard we laughed that night."  </P></p>

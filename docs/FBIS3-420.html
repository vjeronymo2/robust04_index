Levy] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 6 SAPA -- The latest killings in  Bhambayi, north of Durban, were a grim warning that the  intolerance of African National Congress [ANC] and Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] supporters would deprtve people of freely  exercising their democratic right of choice during the  elections, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on Sunday [6  March]. Reacting to the murder of at least eight people in the  squatter settlement, Mr Kriel said continuing violence showed  the ANC and IFP leadership cared only about power and not about  people's lives.    Both organisations had had years to end their power struggle  but their leaders had only used people's lives as pawns in their  power game. "The ANC and IFP pay only lip service to peace and  democracy but have done nothing to control their supporters,"  said Mr Kriel in a statement issued to SAPA.</p>

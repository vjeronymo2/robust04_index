			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway calls for correction of deficiencies in EC regime NORWAY YESTERDAY spelt out a long list of demands on fisheries to the European Community and pointed out deficiencies in the EC's regime that would have to be corrected if it was to become a member. 'The outcome of the membership negotiations in this area will play a decisive role in determining the public attitude on Norwegian accession to the community,' it warned Brussels officials. Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, the anti-EC fisheries minister, reiterated that Norway had no more fish to give away to the community. Norway failed to get the backing for EC membership in a 1972 referendum partly because the community adopted a fisheries policy shortly before it was going to make the decision to join. Key issues in the discussions this time include mutual access to waters, management and conservation, control of quotas and technical regulations, structural matters, market access and market organisation. Norway attached the greatest importance to the continuation of its regime ensuring control and sustainable management of marine resources and aquaculture activities. It said recognition by the EC of the fundamental relationship between Norway's coastal population settlements and fish resources was essential. Norway demanded arrangements to ensure that fishing quotas remained at the disposal of member states to which they had been allocated. It attached particular importance to stringent enforcement of quotas and technical regulations while insisting that it must be allowed to uphold its own first-hand sales system.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / House scheme fails to benefit lenders HOUSES REPOSSESSED by mortgage lenders accounted for only a tenth of the properties bought by housing associations in the first week of the government's Pounds 750m scheme to revive the housing market, it was disclosed yesterday. The poor initial result for building societies came in spite of their having lobbied the government to encourage housing associations to buy repossessed homes rather than unsold ones built by construction and property companies. When the scheme was ann-ounced in the Autumn Statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, he said it would reduce the overhang of empty properties by more than 20,000 over the next few months, and provide 'a helpful stimulus to activity'. The first week's figures cover only 194 of the 16,000 homes to be bought in England by next March. But societies said sales would continue to be restricted by their statutory obligation to seek the highest price and by the poor condition of many repossessed properties. In the first week, the 27 associations selected by the Housing Corporation to make bids applied for approval to buy 19 repossessions, 99 homes completed by builders and developers, and 76 houses owned by individuals. Mr Gregory Lomax, deputy chief executive of the corporation, the government-funded agency which oversees housing associations in England, said it was trying to encourage them to buy repossessed properties and homes owned by individuals rather than relying on builders. He said the corporation had retained 25 per cent of the Pounds 577m provision for England to reward associations buying from sources other than builders. 'We are trying to revive the housing market, not to revive the lenders. They are important, but subsidiary,' he said. Mr Lomax said he expected lenders to sell more houses through the scheme as they responded to associations' requirements. Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association, the association which has spent its allocation in England the fastest, said it found societies 'slow on the uptake' in providing lists of repossessions and responding to offers. The association said it had already allocated all of its initial funding of Pounds 3.7m in principle. About a quarter of the purchases were from builders, a quarter from mortgage lenders and the remaining half from private individuals. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said many repossessed properties were not suitable for associations because they were in bad condition.</p>

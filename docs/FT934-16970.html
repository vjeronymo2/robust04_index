			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / France acts on Sunday trade The French government has paved the way for a relaxation of the country's Sunday trading laws by allowing local authorities in tourist areas to decide whether shops in their region may open on Sundays, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The change follows a review by Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, of the trading ban, which dates back to 1906. However, Mr Giraud and Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister, successfully opposed a call from some MPs to introduce a shorter working week as part of their employment reform package.</p>

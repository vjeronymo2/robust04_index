			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "On the Trail of Very Special </F> Iranian Agents"; spelling of Iranian names as published]    [Text] Close call for the drug-squad inspector. The  Iranian-born policeman and occasional legal translator had  noticed -- being a professional -- that he was being shadowed.  The stalker was identified: Mojlabi Mashady, a peculiar  Iranian -- married to a French woman -- who specializes in  import and export activities, is apparently known in drug  dealing circles and is currently in jail. Above all, he is  allegedly an Iranian intelligence agent in Paris, in charge of  eliminating opponents to the Tehran mullah regime.    Informed of the policeman's adventure, Judge Bruguiere set  the DST [Directorate for Territorial Surveillance] and the  Criminal Brigade on the trail of the "special agent." A proven  technique which had already made it possible to identify the  murderers of Chapour Bakhtiar in Paris, it proved once again  remarkably effective. It revealed that Mojlabi Mashady, with an  accomplice called Hossein Yazdan Seta, had also been  "blacklisting" other Iranian political dissidents living in  Paris, as well as on a family member of the former Shah of Iran.  The small commando apparently intended to act quickly against  one of the "targets," whose life was probably saved by  preventive action by the police.    A systematic inquiry conducted into Mojlabi Mashady's  activities showed that the team had probably done some damage  already. One of Mashady's contacts, incarcerated for  drug-related activities, was questioned in his cell by the  police. He revealed that he had been contacted by Mashady and  taken to Tehran, where he had been offered a respectable amount  of money to kill a dissident living in exile in Paris: Cyrus  Elahi, a doctor and founder of the ODJ (Organization for Iranian  Freedom) and a former lecturer at Tehran's Melli University. The  young man had refused the highly detailed contract. However,  shortly thereafter, on 23 October, Dr. Cyrus Elahi was indeed  assassinated -- shot four times in the head in the entrance hall  of his apartment building, located in Bourdelle street in  Paris's 15th district.    This testimony, confirmed by other evidence, was enough for  Judge Bruguiere to jail Mojlabi Mashady and Hossein Yazdan Seta  on Tuesday [21 December], for "complicity with murder in  relation with terrorist activities."    This is one more bone of contention between France and Iran,  at a time when Judge Bruguiere is about to finalize his  investigation into Chapour Bakhtiar's murder and has referred to  the Assize Court the four persons imprisoned in France in  connection with this affair. Moreover, two suspected murderers  of an Iranian dissident shot in Lausanne have been arrested in  Paris and Switzerland wants them extradited.    So matters are turning more litigious and "sensitive"  between  Paris and Tehran. But can one let the henchmen of a foreign  state "settle accounts" with impunity in France, turning the  capital into one large shooting range against political  opponents?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Three counties in  the Taihangshan Mountain Region of north China's Hebei Province  have launched a campaign to auction the right of use of barren  hills in a bid to effectively implement one of China's  afforestation projects.    Also under auction are barren valleys, wastelands and  uncultivated mountain slopes.    China's land law stipulates that all land, including  mountains and rivers, is state property. Therefore, what has  been auctioned is the right to explore the undeveloped areas.  Underground minerals, however, are excluded.    Hebei provincial sources said that Zhanhuang County has sold  the right of use for some 11,000 ha [hectares] of uncultivated  areas, more than 60 percent of the county's total such areas.  Pingshan and Tangxian Counties have ``auctioned" off another  11,600 ha of such areas.    The Taihangshan Mountain Range, winding through 110  counties,  cities and districts in Hebei, Henan and Shanxi Provinces and  Beijing, has a mountainous area of more than 12 million ha. The  Taihangshan Mountain Afforestation Project, one of China's  largest afforestation projects in full swing, has been written  into the "21st Century Agenda of China".    According to the project, by the year 2000 the total green  area in the Taihangshan Mountain Region is projected to top nine  million ha and the forest cover rate there will climb from the  current 18.1 percent to 43.6 percent.    The three counties have promulgated a set of policies  stating  that all capable individuals, enterprises, institutions and  departments can participate in the bidding for the right to  develop barren areas, either individually or jointly.    According to the policies, which set no limitations on the  area of land a bidder can offer to buy, the auctioned barren  areas can be inherited, leased or transferred before the auction  contracts expire.    They also stipulate that the bidding winners must strive to  achieve the initial afforestation target set down by related  departments for the first three to five years. Otherwise, the  auction deal will be invalidated and the areas covered by the  contracts re-auctioned.    An official at the Forestry Department of Hebei Province  said  that the auction of the right of use of barren areas is an  experimental reform measure that has a direct bearing on  agricultural property rights relations in the countryside as  well as on the interests of farmers.    He added that the reform is also a bold experiment to  integrate the land with the market.    The official said that the long-term limit applied to  auction  deals, generally ranging from 30 to 70 years, has helped form a  direct and stable relationship between investment and economic  returns.    This has triggered farmers' enthusiasm to channel more money  and labor into improving the uncultivated areas, he said, adding  that in the places where the reform measure has been introduced,  economic and social benefits have become obvious.    Qin Wenping, Forestry Bureau director of Zhanhuang County,  said that since the county first started auctioning the right of  use of undeveloped areas in 1990, the county's forest cover rate  has risen from 13.7 percent to 20.4 percent.    He also said that the county's annual output of fruit has  doubled to 20 million kg and per capita income increased by some  1000 yuan (more than 120 U.S. dollars).    Official sources said that the auction practice has also  been  started in Henan, Shanxi and Liaoning Provinces.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Pledged shares are like stolen jewels Sir, A thief stole some jewellery, took it to a pawnbroker and used it as security for a loan. He walked out of the shop and under a bus. It is difficult to imagine that the law would find that the jewels belonged to the pawnbroker and not to the people from whom the thief had stolen them. What is the difference between the pawnbroker and the banks which are laying claim to the shares which Robert Maxwell had pledged with them shortly before his untimely death?

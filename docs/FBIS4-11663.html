			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, March 30, (SPA) -- The general secretariat  of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] has  reaffirmed the Islamic nation's solidarity with the just  struggle of the Palestinian people to restore their firm,  unequivocal national rights of self-determination and the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem  as its capital on Palestinian soil, under the leadership of the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people.    This came in a statement issued today by the OIC Secretary  General Dr. Hamed al-Ghabid on the occasion of the Palestinian  Land Day on March 30.    He said this occasion comes at a time when Palestinian  people  are suffering from the escalation of killing, oppression and  persecution by Israeli authorities since the Hebron massacre.    He pointed out that Tuesday's carnage which claimed the  lives  of six Palestinians and wounded scores others at the Jabalia  refugee camps and was committed by Israeli occupation forces is  a new proof of continued Israeli hostilities and non-commitment  to the establishment of just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    He said this confirms the necessity to secure immediate  international protection for the Palestinian people as the  current situation triggered by Israeli inhuman practices warns  of a near explosion and an escalation of violence and threatens  to destroy the peace process.    Dr. Ghabid expressed the OIC's strong condemnation of the  killing and repression carried out by Israeli occupation forces  against the Palestinian people.    He urged the international community to shoulder its  responsibilities and force Israel to halt its criminal acts  immediately and secure international protection for the  Palestinian people.</p>

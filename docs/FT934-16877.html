			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Record Malaysian financing for YTL BANK BUMIPUTRA, the Malaysian bank which in the past has been dogged by controversy and bad debts, is heading a group of institutions arranging a MDollars 2.66bn (Dollars 1.04bn) debt financing package for YTL, a listed Malaysian construction company. The package, which will be entirely in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, is described by Schroders, YTL's financial advisers, as the largest debt financing ever arranged for a Malaysian borrower. YTL has the licence to build, own and operate two power stations in the south of the Malaysian peninsula under the country's independent power producers (IPP) programme. National Power of the UK was to have taken a 10 per cent equity stake in the project, but it withdrew in July this year citing 'contractual differences.' Subsequently, the German Siemens group has become involved in a turnkey project to build the two power plants, but is not taking any equity in the project. There had been speculation that without a foreign equity partner YTL would face problems raising such a large amount of project finance. Banking analysts say the government, keen to make a start on IPP projects to satisfy Malaysia's growing power needs, is likely to have exerted some pressure on state-controlled Bank Bumiputra to arrange the loan. The financing consists of two facilities: a 15-year fixed-rate ringgit bond issue, which will be subscribed by the state-run Employees Provident Fund (EPF), and a 15-year ringgit floating-rate commercial loan. The loan is underwritten by Bank Bumiputra, United Malaysian Banking and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany. Bank Bumiputra plans to sell down its floating-rate loan to other Malaysian banks. KfW is also being funded by local banks.</p>

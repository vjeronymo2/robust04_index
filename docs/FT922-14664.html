			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith and Lang launch attacks on SNP MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, yesterday warned that Scots would be playing into the Conservative party's hands if they voted for the Scottish National party. The only way to get rid of the Tory government was to vote Labour, he said. Meanwhile at a campaign meeting in Newton Stewart, in his marginal constituency of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, attacked the SNP as the 'cutting crew' of Scottish politics. 'A separate Scotland would have an annual budget deficit starting at Pounds 5bn. That is Pounds 1,000 a year for every man, woman and child in Scotland. 'Because of that deficit, public spending in Scotland would be cut. The health service would be cut. Schools would be cut. Housing would be cut. Roads would be cut.' Taxes would have to rise to fund the vast deficit a separate Scotland would incur, he warned. Mr Smith was speaking in Glasgow following publication of an opinion poll showing support for the SNP at 31 per cent, its highest level since 1989 and only seven points behind Labour on 38 per cent. The poll, by Market Research Scotland for Grampian Television and the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal newspaper, put the SNP four points above their level in other recent polls and Labour about four points below. Mr Murray Elder, Labour's Scottish organiser, said there was 'no underlying evidence that this poll is a fair reflection of where we stand.' Mr Smith said: 'A vote for Labour is a vote for a Labour government in just seven days' time. Scots voters must now ask why make a protest when you can make a difference?' Labour fears that strong support for the SNP could enable the Conservatives to hold seats by reducing the Labour vote. A letter from Mr Lang to Mr John Major, which was leaked to Labour, indicated the Conservatives wanted to use the SNP for this purpose. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, claimed yesterday that his party was on course for an election victory which would end 'Conservative colonial rule' in Scotland. Mr Smith said a Scottish parliament, which a Labour government intends to set up in its first session, would not have a say in macro-economic policy. Its contribution to economic development would be mainly through training, education and local authorities. The Scottish parliament would mean democratic control in Scotland of powers which were already devolved administratively to the Scottish Office. This appeared to confirm the thrust of a paper by economists on the economic effects of constitutional change in Scotland published this week by Bell Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbrokers, which said a devolved Scottish parliament would have limited economic powers, contrary to the claims of many of its supporters.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS LOSE DESPITE BENJAMIN'S BEST EFFORTS  </P> <P> It would seem physically impossible for a 7-foot, 250-pound center to disappear  right before 10,758 fans, especially one who was playing probably the best game  of his career, but the Clippers made it happen Friday night.  </P> <P> The same magicians also made an 11-point lead vanish in the final 7:55 of the  game.  </P> <P> Of such miracles are 13-51 teams made.  </P> <P> That's where the Clippers stand after a 108-105 loss to the Charlotte Hornets  at the Sports Arena that wasted 34 points and 23 rebounds, both career highs,  and a season-best eight blocked shots by center Benoit Benjamin.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with the way I shot the ball," said Benjamin, who is averaging  24.2 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.6 blocks in the last four outings. "When I get  the ball, I can do things like that."  </P> <P> So how many times did Benjamin get the ball in the final two minutes?  </P> <P> Once. On an offensive rebound.  </P> <P> In beating the Clippers for the second straight time, Charlotte (16-48) closed  the game with a 15-4 run that turned a 101-93 deficit into a victory. The  Clippers, who got their last field goal with 3:12 to play, made just 17 of 30  free throws (56.7%), missing four of their final eight attempts.  </P> <P> The Clippers capped it off by blowing at least a chance to tie the game. They  got the ball back with six seconds left after Kurt Rambis missed a layup, but  Gary Grant pushed the ball upcourt and fired a straight-away three-point shot  as Coach Don Casey and assistant Jim Eyen were imploring their players for a  timeout. No one on the court heard them.  </P> <P> With the retirement of Norm Nixon, and Reggie Williams out with a sprained left  thumb, Casey had only three guards at his disposal. One was Grant, who had a  sore lower back after a hard fall in the fourth quarter of Wednesday night's  loss to Miami.  </P> <P> At the start, though, it didn't seem to hinder the Clippers much. After falling  behind, 16-8, they led, 33-26, by the end of the first quarter, as Benjamin had  11 points and seven rebounds, and Grant contributed 10 points and six assists.  </P> <P> The Hornets, who have held opponents to 100 or fewer points in only one of  their last 40 games, closed the gap minutes into the second quarter. They then  went ahead, 56-53, on Dell Curry's three-point basket from the left corner with  one second left.  </P> <P> Benjamin made 10 of 11 shots in the first half for 22 points, and he also had  12 rebounds and four blocked shots.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> The retirement of Norm Nixon was as much a happening as an occasion. In  addition to the usual wishes from teammates at Friday morning's shoot-around,  Little Richard, who grew up with Nixon's mother in Macon, Ga., also called.  Later, after a news conference at CBS/MTM Studios in Studio City, Rev. Jesse  Jackson, on the lot for a guest appearance on "A Different World," stopped by  to acknowledge the event. Nixon's wife, Debbie Allen, is an executive with the  comedy series. Nixon, who announced his retirement Thursday just 19 games short  of completing his 10th year, did not rule out the possibility he will play  again, maybe even this season with a team looking for some playoff insurance.  "My heart is still in basketball," he said.  </P> <P> Although General Manager Elgin Baylor said no money deal was worked out that  would allow Nixon to sign with another team, Nixon said he is a free agent  after the Clippers agreed to buy out his contract for 1989-90 as well as pay  him for the remainder of this season. Not that he has any immediate plans to  play for another team, especially since it would mean leaving his family. "It  was a relief (getting the matter settled), but I really haven't had the chance  to think about the magnitude of what I've done," he said. "I'm in the middle of  it. In about four days, I'll probably sit back and say, 'Damn, I retired from  basketball.' " If he has for good, plans include managing his wife's music  career and getting into other personal management and working in merchandising.  "I'll be getting the same amount of playing time when I'm retired than when I  played," he quipped, a joke aimed at his lack of playing time in recent weeks.  </P> <P> The Clippers shot 75% in the first quarter, hitting 15 of 20 shots. . . . Kurt  Rambis, in his first appearance at the Sports Arena with Charlotte, got a big  ovation during pregame introductions.  </P></p>

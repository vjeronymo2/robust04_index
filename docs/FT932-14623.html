			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat There is logic in the removal of Queens Moat Houses from the FT-SE Mid 250 index at a nominal price of 1p. Its current value is zero because holders cannot sell. However, assuming the quotation will eventually be reinstated at a higher price, the move amounts to an unintended distortion of the index which will come as a blow to the infant derivatives market. The problem could be avoided if the suspension was lifted, allowing the market to establish a clearing price. US investors do not expect to be trapped by such long suspensions.</p>

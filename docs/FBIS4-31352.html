			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- The trial of ten former  senior officials of the Albanian communist system accused of  misappropriation of the state property in great proportions in  cooperation and of abuse of office still in cooperation,  continued on June 3 with questions to the witnesses.    Only eight out of 137 witnesses brought their testimonies  before the court on June 3. Their testimonies were related with  the "incident" in the Russian Embassy, an event for which the  communist government executed without trial 22 intellectuals and  imprisoned scores of others unjustly. They also spoke about the  way the commissions for deportions and concentration camps  functioned.    The first to be interrogated from the witnesses was the  former attorney general in 1951, Siri Carcani. "I have only  signed what was brought to me from above, without knowing  anything concretely," Carcani declared.    The other witness, Rasim Dedja, former deputy chairman of  the  Second Interior Branch, said that the lists of those to be  executed or imprisoned for the "incident" in the embassy were  formulated by the premier of that time, Mehmet Shehu.    Former judge of the Supreme Military Court of that time,  Vangjel Kocani, in the capacity of a witness, declared in the  court that under instructions from senior bodies he had only  signed the court decision after the 22 intellectuals had been  executed.    Notes from the meeting on the incident held by the  government  at that time, Qemal Ceka, former stenographer, said at the  court, are not mine but they are notes taken by the former  secretary general of the Council of Ministers, Adil Carcani  himself.    Former member of the CC [Central Committee] of the PLA  [Albanian Workers Party] and former general director of the  radio and television and later editor-in-chief of the newspaper  ZERI I POPULLIT, Todi Lubonja, sentenced to 15 years of  imprisonment by the communist regime for his liberal viewpoints,  expressed his regret for the arrest of defendant Ramiz Alia. He  said in his testimony that on the instruction of Alia, former  reporter Xhelil Gjoni had written the first article against  religion in Albania. (this article opened the way to  anti-religious move in Albania in 1967.)    Due to their grave health problems, defendants Adil Carcani  and Manush Myftiu asked through their attorneys to leave the  courtroom, and their request was accepted. The next session of  the trial will continue on June 4 with the questioning of other  witnesses.</p>

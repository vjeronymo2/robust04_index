			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Mass was celebrated in Vilnius Cathedral for the first time  since the Communist authorities of Soviet Lithuania seized the building 40  years ago and turned it into a warehouse. The 17th-Century cathedral in the  Lithuanian capital was packed as Bishop Julijonas Steponavicius prostrated  himself in front of the pillared altar in a reconsecration ceremony. The  cathedral was seized in 1949 as part of a campaign by Communist authorities  against organized religions in the three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia  and Estonia, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. The  authorities agreed last October to return the cathedral amid signs of a warming  in relations between church and state.  </P></p>

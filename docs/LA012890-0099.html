			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE LINES ARE BEING DRAWN IN AREA CODE SPLIT  </P> <P> Officials in nine cities are looking for ways to fight a telephone company plan  that would split the cities in two, giving some -- but not all -- of their  residents a new area code in 1992.  </P> <P> The result, they say, would be confusion that could clog emergency phone lines,  damage businesses and sacrifice city unity for easy profits.  </P> <P> In Bell Gardens, for example, the current 213 and new 310 area codes would  bisect the business district, forcing one bank to dial long-distance to reach  its biggest customer across the street.  </P> <P> In Beverly Hills, homes on three streets would not be linked with their own  prestigious community by area code, but with downtown Los Angeles, around which  the new U-shaped 310 code wraps.  </P> <P> In Culver City, 12 addresses would be reached by dialing 213, while the rest of  the city would be assigned to 310.  </P> <P> "The thing that angers us most is that nobody ever talked to us about this,"  said West Hollywood Mayor Abbe Land, whose city would be split almost in half  along La Cienega Boulevard. "The phone company made a decision and said, 'Live  with it.' "  </P> <P> "I don't care which area code we get, we just want one," she added.  </P> <P> When announcing the plan last month, representatives from GTE California and  Pacific Bell said the companies had no choice but to create two area codes out  of the old 213 zone because they were running out of phone numbers.  </P> <P> They said their engineers had examined 20 options to find a plan under which  very few cities would be divided by codes when the 310 area is formed in two  years. The splitting of cities "was unavoidable . . . because telephone  exchanges and city limits are not related," the companies maintained in a press  release.  </P> <P> They emphasized that dialing an extra four digits to reach a neighbor might be  an inconvenience but would carry no extra cost. And customers would keep their  old seven-digit numbers.  </P> <P> But officials from South Gate to Inglewood to West Hollywood have fielded  dozens of calls from residents and businesses about the phone companies'  failure to shape the new 310 area code to match city borders.  </P> <P> Despite the phone companies' insistence that such a match is nearly impossible  technically -- and would be very costly if feasible -- officials from most  divided cities remain critical of the plan.  </P> <P> Some have demanded to know the precise cost of putting their cities into a  single area code. (GTE now estimates the average cost at $1,854 per individual  phone line.) Others have questioned the phone companies' statements of good  intentions.  </P> <P> "What they did was take the (path) that was most cost-effective for them," Bell  Gardens City Manager Claude Booker said. "I think they did one study -- how to  maximize profits."  </P> <P> In Bell Gardens, as in neighboring Commerce, the phone companies followed their  own franchise lines, rather than forge new borders that would match the  political boundaries of the two cities, the phone companies confirmed.  </P> <P> Booker said he has contacted all other divided cities -- including neighboring  Commerce, South Gate and Lynwood -- in an effort to build a united front  against the plan at the Public Utilities Commission, in the Legislature and  possibly in court. The utilities commission has no authority to veto the plan,  but Booker said appealing to the commission could generate pressure against  splitting cities.  </P> <P> The Bell Gardens City Council declared its opposition to the split on Monday,  saying in a resolution that the change "appears to be self-serving for two  monopolies at the expense of our citizens."  </P> <P> Louis Shepard, city administrator of Commerce, agreed. "They're ignoring  anything other than their own convenience," he said of the phone companies.  </P> <P> Interest in a coalition is also apparently building on the Westside and in the  South Bay.  </P> <P> "I've spoken with council members from Inglewood and Beverly Hills, and they're  angry too," said Land of West Hollywood, who maintains that a legal challenge  to the plan is her city's final option.  </P> <P> Culver City Mayor Joselle Smith said she thinks "there will be a cooperative  response by all the cities affected."  </P> <P> In Inglewood, Councilman Daniel Tabor's home would be in a different area code  than his City Hall office.  </P> <P> "It's irritating, it's inconvenient and it's confusing," he said of the plan.  "For example, I've got calls from people who want to know how they'd call the  police in another area code."  </P> <P> Phone company officials say that citizens would still call 911 for emergency  police and fire service in both area codes. But city officials say they are  concerned that residents making non-emergency calls may clog the 911 line to  avoid a long-distance call to police.  </P> <P> "We believe they will dial 911 because they can dial it quickly," Booker said.  "You and I know it always registers extra money when you dial long-distance.  And (residents) are going to continue to think that."  </P> <P> Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue said, in fact, that a survey of calls to the  regional emergency dispatch center used by his city shows that residents do not  take quickly to change: About half still use an old emergency number instead of  911, which has been in effect about five years, he said.  </P> <P> "People just don't change habits very easily," Jue said.  </P> <P> City officials also say that local businesses -- especially those such as  restaurants and retail shops, which rely heavily on customer whim -- are  concerned that customers may not search two area codes to find telephone  numbers, opting instead for a competitor in the same city with the same area  code.  </P> <P> The phone companies say such concerns are common when new codes are  established, but that the problems have never developed.  </P> <P> Seven cities or communities were split in 1984, when the 818 area code was  implemented in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. The greatest concern  was in South Pasadena and Monterey Park, because significant parts of each were  in different codes, Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lissa Zanville said.  </P> <P> "But we haven't heard anything from them since that time," she said.  </P> <P> City and business representatives in Monterey Park said fears of problems from  the split proved unfounded.  </P> <P> "I do not recall any kind of increase in our 911 traffic" because of the  change, said Georgette Hudson, supervisor of the city's emergency dispatch  center.  </P> <P> Valerie Olson, manager of the Chamber of Commerce, said business did not  suffer. "There was adjustment on the part of the people, but there really were  no problems whatsoever," she said.  </P> <P> A campaign against the 310 boundaries reached the Legislature in early January,  just two weeks after the phone companies announced their plan.  </P> <P> State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, whose district includes Beverly Hills and Culver  City, said the effect on business is one of the reasons that he has authored a  bill intended to make phone companies more accountable when drafting new area  codes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal's bill, which unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday, would  require public notice from phone companies before they implement new codes. It  would also force the companies to consider a set of criteria -- including  geographical features, common interests and the cohesiveness of communities --  before dividing cities into two area codes.  </P> <P> Several cities have backed the bill, although some officials said they favored  an outright prohibition on city splitting, as was proposed early this month by  Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). Moore withdrew her bill last week for  lack of support.  </P> <P> According to the phone companies, Rosenthal's measure is unnecessary. The  companies say they have given affected cities and the public more than two  years' notice of the new 310 zone and are arranging detailed presentations to  the cities.  </P> <P> Dominic Gomez, area vice president for Pacific Bell, said his company  considered all the factors listed in Rosenthal's measure and more when deciding  how to split the 213 zone. The franchise areas of the two phone companies were  a lesser consideration, he said. Two of the nine cities -- Bell Gardens and  Commerce -- are split along franchise lines.  </P> <P> The U-shaped 310 area, which borders downtown Los Angeles on three sides, made  sense, Gomez said, because it kept within the 213 zone the communities most  closely associated with the downtown area, such as Hollywood.  </P> <P> A key technical consideration, he said, is that phone lines are connected to  specific exchanges, or main offices. It is extremely difficult and expensive to  route an existing line into a different exchange, said Gomez, adding that the  310 zone represents a "sound, sincere business decision that impacted the least  amount of people possible."  </P> <P> A small sampling of customers showed that some are more concerned than others  about the 310 split.  </P> <P> The manager of the Bell Gardens bank that will be in a different area code from  its principal customer said his business should be affected very little.  </P> <P> "From a banking standpoint it might become an irritation, but that's called  change," said manager James Lyle. "We're usually not an impulse call."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Last month, GTE California and Pacific Bell announced that the 213 area code in  parts of Los Angeles County would be divided in two, with the creation of a new  310 area code that forms a horseshoe shape around downtown Los Angeles. Under  the change, effective in 1992, nine cities will be split in two, with each city  partly in the 213 area and partly in the 310 area. The cities that would be  split are Bell Gardens, Beverly Hills, Commerce, Culver City, Inglewood,  Hawthorne, Lynwood, South Gate and West Hollywood.  </P> <P> NEW AREA CODE BOUNDARIES  </P> <P> Rough boundaries for 213 area code and the new 310 area code, as determined by  GTE California and Pacific Bell, are based on existing telephone number  prefixes rather than geographic lines. The change is to take effect at 12:01  a.m. Saturday, Feb. 1, 1992, after which there will be three-month period when  callers can use either area code. Customers in the 818 area code will be  unaffected.  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (30): Fast-growing sector - Paul Taylor on portable computers Sales of portable computers have been one of the fastest growing segments of the personal computer market over the past four years. The 'notebook' computer, in particular, has become an important business tool and the de facto standard for portable computing in the 1990s. Advances in technology have enabled PC manufacturers to pack most if not all of the functionality of a desktop PC into an A4-sized notebook package priced at Pounds 1,500 or less. Today's notebook PCs weigh about 6lb, are mostly powered by fast Intel 486 processors and have large hard disks, colour screens and credit-card sized PCMICA expansion slots. The main advances in recent years have included 'dual-scan' colour displays making colour notebook PCs more affordable and easier to use with programmes such as Microsoft's Windows. In addition, battery life has been extended through the use of low-power chips, power-saving features and improved battery technology. For example, Dell Computer's new Latitude range includes an innovative dual Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery option which effectively doubles battery life to a maximum 13 hours. However, as Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest consultant, points out, relatively few portable PC users actually use their machines while on the move and can therefore usually plug their portables into a wall power outlet making battery life less of an issue. There is little doubt that business usage of portable computers is increasing. When Dataquest asked corporate computer purchasing managers across Europe whether any of their employees used portable PCs, 70 per cent replied 'yes' with the UK and Germany showing the highest uptake. The three largest groups of users were top executives and finance staff; sales and marketing; and engineering and maintenance. When respondents were asked whether employees were able to use their portable PCs or data terminals for communicating with the office while travelling, 32.5 per cent claimed at least some of their employees made use of such a facility. Most of these employees made their connection over the public switched telephone network although a quarter said they used cellular telephone connections, 18.5 per cent used private or public mobile radio and a similar proportion said they used mobile packet data services. In the study, the most important uses listed for mobile data communications were sending and receiving electronic mail, sending and receiving facsimiles, transfering files, accessing purchase and inventory databases and accessing customer and invoicing databases. According to Dataquest, portable computer sales in Europe were worth Dollars 3.6bn last year and represented 17.4 per cent of the total European PC market. In terms of unit shipments, portables represented 14.5 per cent of the 10.3m PCs shipped in 1993. Growth of the portable PC market has flattened since the 'boom' years between 1990 and 1992. Nevertheless, Dataquest predicts that between 1993 and 1998 portable computer sales will grow by a compound annual rate of 23.4 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent for desktop PCs. Within the portable PC segment, notebook PC sales represent the lion's share of the market and sales grew by just over 18 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Slower growth in the notebook PC market in Europe has led to intensified competition between manufacturers and to considerable consolidation. In 1991, the top four vendors represented 52.4 per cent of total sales, but by 1993 this had risen to just under 60 per cent. Shipments of sub-notebook portable PCs  - typically weighing less than 4lb  -are also growing quickly according to Dataquest, although with continued miniaturisation the distinction between notebook and sub-notebook PCs is likely to blur over time. At the other end of the scale, older style lap-top PCs  - the second generation of portable PCs after 'transportables'  - are all but defunct. Perhaps the most disappointing segment of the portable PC market, after an initial flurry, has been the market for organisers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other hand-held computing devices. Although some expandable organisers, such as Psion's Series 3, have been well received, Mr Golberg argues that wider acceptance of hand-held PCs is dependent on the widespread availability of reasonably-priced communications, in particular wireless networking, and on rationalisation among the many competing platforms. In the meantime, however, some hand-held computing devices, particularly those with wireless communication features built in, have found niches in vertical markets  - for example, for meter readers, traffic wardens and the emergency services.</p>

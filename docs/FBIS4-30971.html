			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Damir Dukic: "A Muzzle for `Labrador'"] </F>   [Text] The arrest of Radojko R. Radojcic, age 42, from  Zagreb, who was once an official of the Central Committee of the  League of Communists of Croatia, continues the Labrador affair,  which has dragged on for two-and-a-half years now, and whose  exposure, along with the Opera case, is the greatest success of  the Croatian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in the  intelligence war being waged continuously with the Serbian  secret services. But those two affairs were at the same time, at  least until Radojcic's apprehension, only the tip of the  iceberg, since networks of Serbian informers were largely  undetected. All of this is clearly supported by the history of  Labrador itself.    At the height of the fiercest aggression of the former JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] in the fall of 1991, it became obvious  that essential information was "leaking" from responsible  positions in the Croatian Government and that there was for  certain a group that was conducting in an organized way or  preparing terrorist actions in order to compromise Croatian  policy and its top people. One of the most serious confirmations  of the existence of such groups were the actions of bombing  Mirogoj, where the graves of Jews are located, and the placing  of explosives on the building of the Jewish congregation in  Zagreb, which was aimed at portraying the Croatian Government to  the world public as neo-Nazi. Suspicions proved to be correct,  since over the period from 15 to 17 October 1991 the MUP  initiated an investigation against 12 persons for what was then  alleged to be "association for the purpose of hostile activity,  terrorism, commando operations, and sabotage, and in order to  cause public panic and insecurity."  <H5>  Five at Large </H5>   Five of those 12 were at large (among them Radojcic), while  seven were arrested (Srecko Ozegovic, Branko Trazivuk, Mile  Vasiljevski...), among them both Croats and Serbs, some of them  cadres "inherited" from the former regime, while others came to  their positions after the change of government. The group, which  came to be called Labrador from its own plan of operations,  consisted of three "security" officers, four officials in the  MUP department for protection of the constitutional order, one  authorized official of the MUP, two from the technical services  of the Croatian parliament, a former policeman from the Zagreb  Police Department, and another person not employed. The group  was led and inspired from Belgrade, which was also the origin of  the equipment in the form of the time bombs.    It was only a short time after the processing of the  arrestees that the Croatian police brought in another 50 persons  suspected of the same crimes. Milan Brezak, assistant minister  of internal affairs, himself declared in early November that  some of these people were sitting in offices next to his, and  they were planning to blow up important facilities, to  assassinate leading figures.... The investigation has made  progress, revealing an incredibly intertwined KOS  [counterintelligence service] network, which was later confirmed  in a newspaper interview by Ante Nobilo, former deputy district  public prosecutor in Zagreb, who said that the investigation had  penetrated an increasing number of political circles, revealing  new members of KOS.  <H5>  The Belgrade Trial </H5>   However, before the investigation was concluded and the  suspects thoroughly questioned, the arrestees were released,  that is, exchanged, on the basis of a political assessment.  Thus, further investigatory proceedings were stopped before all  the KOS connections and all the informers were discovered.    This assessment was later confirmed by Lt. Col. Ivan  Sabolovic, who was tried in Belgrade for the bombing of Jewish  facilities in Zagreb. Sabolovic said that only a part of the  network was blown, since their essential structures remained  untouched. Just like Sabolovic, certain other essential  organizers of the KOS networks in Croatia also remained out of  the reach of Croatian authorities, and this especially applies  to Col. Slobodan Rakocevic, former security chief in the "JNA  Air Force," who incidentally had the closest connections with  the Opera group (propaganda operations), another espionage  organization with the same tasks against Croatia. Nor was Slavko  Malobabic, who with five other persons was one of the principal  organizers of Labrador, accessible to Croatian authorities.  Since Malobabic was known in Zagreb as a "man with good  connections and friends" (at one time he held the position of  chief of staff of Stanko Stojcevic, chief of the Croatian  communists, and then the post of spokesman of the Secretariat  for Internal Affairs), one of the tasks that he and Radojcic had  was to bring new members into the group and expand the network.  It is still a secret how successful they were in that, and how  far they went in this espionage effort. Until Radojcic's recent  apprehension, when, we hope, the links of this dangerous chain  were completely revealed.</p>

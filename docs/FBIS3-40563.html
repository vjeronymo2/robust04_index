			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "the U.S. and the Kashmir Issue" </F>   [Text] The 170-member Human Rights Committee of the U. S.  Congress has asked Foreign Secretary Warren Christopher to play  an effective role in finding a peaceful resolution to the  Kashmir crisis. A letter this group sent to the secretary of  state stated that there was great concern about human rights  violations by the Indian armed forces and militant groups. They  have concluded that the Indian Army is committing atrocities  against the Kashmiri people according to an organized plan.  Therefore, the Indian government should be asked to explain the  situation, and should take to task the people involved in  violating human rights.    The situation surrounding the Indian government's violations  of human rights has become so serious that even the United  States has been forced to take notice. However, in order to be  "fair," the U. S. Congress has also accused Pakistan of  supplying weapons to the "terrorists." The fact is that Kashmiri  freedom fighters are not terrorists, and Pakistan is not  supplying them with any weapons. Pakistan is giving moral  support to these freedom fighters; however, talks about  providing them with weapons are totally wrong. This accusation  is coming from India. If the members of the U. S. Congress pay  attention to India's violations of human rights, they would not  spoil the issue by declaring the freedom fighters terrorists.  Nor should they recognize the Indian accusation of Pakistan  supplying the weapons in order to try to lighten India's weight  of crime. The Kashmiri freedom fighters are struggling to free  their country from the Indian tyrants, and they have the support  of the whole free world including Pakistan.    Since Pakistan is an important partner in the Kashmir issue,  it has a moral responsibility to help the Kashmiris. It seems  that the United States does not want a just solution to the  Kashmir issue. Instead, it has some secret plans about Kashmir.  Under this plan it is trying to involve China in this matter. An  important State Department official has announced that the area  given to China under the Pakistan-China border agreement was  part of Jammu-Kashmir. The United States is making this issue  even more complicated, and it could even hurt Indian interests.  Therefore, India should start meaningful talks with Pakistan  over Kashmir in order to keep international powers out of the  subcontinent. If an American military base is established in  Kashmir, it will prove a headache to India also.</p>

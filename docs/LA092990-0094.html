			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> INDIA;  </P> <P> LEADER DEFENDS PLAN TO HELP LOW CASTES  </P> <P> Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh fended off pressure to scrap  plans to help low castes as police shot and killed six people and a student  committed suicide in protests across northern India. Indian news agencies said  that a conclave of Singh's party, Janata Dal, renewed majority backing for his  plan, which would raise the quota of government jobs reserved for outcastes and  low Hindu castes from 22.5% to nearly half. Party leaders who had pressed him  to compromise won consent only to pursue talks aimed at persuading upper-caste  students to end seven weeks of violent protests, the news agencies said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ioan David dispatch from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Esteemed listeners: Two news conferences were held  at the headquarters of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova  this morning with the participation of the international  observers present at the 27 February legislative elections. One  of the two news conferences was given by the observers of the  Council of Europe, a body which was also represented by Senator  Adrian Paunescu [vice president of Romania's Socialist Party of  Labor], and the second was given by the delegation of  representatives of the CSCE and NATO Parliamentary Assembly,  which included eight Romanian parliamentarians. At the news  conference of CSCE representatives, four Romanian deputies were  also present.    During the dialogue with the press, the general opinion that  crystallized was that, generally speaking, the elections were  correct and without incidents, with the international observers  having access to all voting stations. The largest number of  objections referred to the entry of two or more persons in the  ballot booths at the same time, usually husband and wife or  relatives; in some cases, individuals from the voting sections  would advise the voters for what political grouping they should  vote.    The two news conferences were preceded by a meeting of the  international observers with Mr. Petr Lucinschi, president of  the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who thanked them for  their activity during yesterday's legislative elections. The  Parliament president said that a first and provisional estimate  of the results of the voting indicates that the following  groupings will surely be represented in Parliament: the  Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM], the Socialist Part  and Edinstvo Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front  [FPCD], and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals. As a matter  of fact, later centralized results coming from the provinces  confirmed his statement.    Afterward, Mr. Petr Lucinschi apologized to the  international  observers for certain organizational irregularities noted by  them and assured those present that the Republic of Moldova will  evolve toward economic reform, conciliation, and peace and that  it will observe the requirements on democracy formulated by the  European structures.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Kaihong (0491 7030 1347) and Liu Huaibing </F> (0491 2037 0365): "Northwest Accelerates Construction of Major  International Passages"]    [Text] Reform and opening up to the outside world have  pushed the great Northwest, which in former times was closed and  backward, toward the forward position of opening up to the West,  rapidly putting five province's autonomous regions -- Shaanxi,  Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang -- on the track of  economic marketization. The Northwest region, amid frequent  contacts with the outside world, is determined to break through  its "bottleneck" in traffic and communications, which are  unsuitable for economic development, and accelerate the economic  leaps of the five provinces and autonomous regions by gradually  achieving unblocked road, railroad, and air transport and  communications, thereby constructing a three-dimensional network  of passages.    In railroad construction, the building of the Lan-Xin  multiple-track railroad, in which the state has invested 3.9  billion yuan, is expected to be completed ahead of schedule in  1994. On it, within the borders of Gansu Province the  Qingshanbao-Zongjiazhuang and Dongming-Jilin sections will be  open to traffic respectively on 15 and 20 December. The  important competent parts of the Asia-Europe Land Bridge that  runs through parts of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia--the 65  tunnels of the Baoji-Zhongwei Electrified Railway--have all been  linked up. Furthermore, the plan to extend the Southern Xinjiang  Railroad to Aksu will be finished in the Ninth Five-Year Plan  period; after the Northern Xinjiang Railroad is formally  incorporated in the the national railroad network, it will  extend north to Karamay and Altay and south to Yining. When the  time comes, the handling capacity for goods will be improved,  threby promoting the economic development of the five provinces  and autonomous regions in the Northwest.    In road construction, all of China's longest road--the  Lan-Xin Road--has been blacktopped, making it a national  second-grade road surface.    To change the situation in which it has few roads and a low  road density, Gansu has put forward a plan for construction of a  "double crisscross" road network, which is estimated to be  completed in seven years from now. The rebuilding of the Gansu  section of the Lan-Bao Road has been completed, and the vehicle  speed per hous has been increased from the original 30  kilometers to 80 kilometers.    To achieve as quickly as possible the "joining in the east  and coming out at the west," Xinjiang has begun border post  capital construction with the focus on building roads. Last year  Xinjiang invested a total of 200 million yuan on building major  international passages, and it will transform seven port roads,  including (Baketu, Cui'enguosi, Alashankou), and (Tu'erduote).  The expressway that goes from (Dahuangshan) through Urumqi to  Turpan, for which the World Bank granted a loan of $115 million  and for which there was a total investment of 2.3 billion yuan  in Renminbi, and the total length of which is 285.5 kilometers,  will be completed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. Up to now  Xinjiang has built roads with a total length of 26,000  kilometers, the longest in China; 53 percent of its  open-to-traffic road surface is high grade or secondary high  grade, which puts it in first position among China's autonomous  regions.    The upsurge in development brought about by reform and the  opening up to the outside world had spurred a considerable  development of the Great Northwest Air Corridor. In this regard  Urumqi will open domestic air lines to Wuhan, Kunming, Haikou,  Shantou, Qingdao, and Ningbo, as well as Tacheng, Turpan, Hami,  and Malan within Xinjiang's borders. Also, to fully display  Xinjiang's geographical superiority, Urumqi will open direct  passages to various places in the world: to the east, in  succession opening air lines to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul,  Bangkok, and Singapore in East Asia and Southeast Asia; and to  the west, in succession opening international air lines to  (Aoshi, Bikshikaike), Moscow, (Shengbidebao, Ashihabata), Kiev,  Minsk, Karachi, and (Shajia). With Urumqi as the center,  Xinjiang has formed a network of 30 air lines linked to 19 large  and medium-sized cities in China and to 11 cities and counties  in the autonomous region, thereby becoming in China among all  the provinces and autonomous regions the one with the most  airports and longest air lines. In the Northwest region the  Yinchuan He [river] East Airport will be newly built; the  Lanzhou and Guohuang airports will be expanded; and the Xining,  Yulin, Ankang, and Hanzhong airports will be rebuilt or expanded.    The post and telecommunications facilities of the five  provinces and autonomous regions of the Northwest, under the  concept of "great communications," have entered the completely  new era of the satellite, microwave, optical cable, and  programmatic control. With a total investment of 750 million  yuan, the Xining-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Yining optical cable project,  and the Turpan-Hetian, Urumqi-Yining, and Urumqi-Altay digital  microwave projects, are being intensively constructed; and the  large-, medium-sized, and small cities of Xi'an, Xining,  Yinchuan, Lanzhou, Jiayuguan, Guohuang, and Urumqi have been put  in the international direct broadcast exchange network.</p>

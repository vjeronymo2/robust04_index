			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Man in the News: The doctor's distress call - Dr Sandy Macara Sandy Macara and Mark Santer are not household names. Many people, even after being told that one is chairman of the British Medical Association council and the other the bishop of Birmingham, would have difficulty deciding which was which. The difficulty will have been increased for casual newspaper readers this week with Santer (the bishop) attacking the 'distressing defects of the market model' in the government's health reforms, and Macara (the doctors' leader) addressing his members on the need to be positive in the face of despair and heal an unhappy society. Health ministers await the British Medical Association's annual conference with mounting feelings of discomfort, because it provides the medical profession with an annual opportunity to win valuable publicity in its ongoing battle with the government over the 1991 National Health Service reforms. This year, the government suffered damage before the conference even started. At the eve-of-conference evensong in Birmingham Cathedral on Sunday the bishop - whose wife Henriette is a clinical psychologist who chairs an NHS trust - delivered a sermon criticising the reforms. When the conference convened the next day, delegates adopted a resolution congratulating him for emphasising the 'moral principles on which the NHS should be based'. By the time Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, was on television trying to explain away the bishop's remarks, the BMA was claiming the moral high ground. Dr Macara, to whom the style of the pulpit comes as easily as it does to most bishops, continued the moral tone in his opening address to the conference. 'I give you a text for today from Milton's Paradise Lost,' he told delegates: 'What reinforcement we may gain from hope; If not, what resolution from despair.' The BMA chairman also found room for more earthy language. Doctors were being forced to serve a perverse philosophy of winners and losers. A new breed of NHS manager worked by confrontation, intimidation and even telephone bugging. Misleading information was peddled to distract patients' attention from real needs. This sermon, delivered to a conference audience rather than a cathedral congregation, was greeted with applause and Macara received a noisy standing ovation. It was a striking achievement by a man who had never seemed destined to occupy the position of chairman because he was outside the association's immediate hierarchy. When the NHS changes started to come into effect in 1991 Mr Jeremy Lee-Potter, an urbane surgeon who was then BMA chairman, sought to repair the association's relationship with the government, estranged by a long and bitter BMA campaign against the reforms. But many doctors remained opposed to the changes; to some BMA members, Lee-Potter's hand-shaking with ministers soon came to look like hand-wringing and abandonment of opposition to the restructured NHS. By last year's conference, there were calls for a challenge to Lee-Potter. Dr Macara, who chaired the annual conference, was sufficiently well-known to mount it, yet sufficiently distant from Lee-Potter's immediate colleagues in the BMA leadership circle to do so with decency. He ran for chairman of council, and won. Dr Macara, a 62-year-old public health specialist at Bristol University, acquired his belief in the importance of the universal state health service from his experience of the effects of poverty when working as a young doctor in Glasgow. Some colleagues were concerned that Macara's passion for the old-style NHS, and the florid, idiosyncratic style in which he sometimes expresses it, might create hostages to fortune that the government would use against the BMA. He has certainly attacked the reforms with an intensity that never became the diffident Lee-Potter; but he has also insisted that the BMA must argue from a well-researched position, and accepts that the best tactic is to look for step-by-step changes rather than total revolution. His strength comes from the fact that most doctors are still deeply unhappy about aspects of the NHS reforms. Many doctors specialise in trying to ride the three horses of public, professional and personal interest so closely together that the naked eye cannot tell them apart. Their patients do not always appreciate that, as well as being the doctors' professional association, the BMA is their trade union. It is currently moving into battle against government plans to introduce performance-related pay for medical staff, and this week's debate on the subject could have been taking place at any trade union conference - except that the objections were voiced in the language of professional and public concern. The tactic often infuriates ministers. Macara's criticisms are often echoed whenever doctors discuss the reforms. The inaugural address of Professor David Morrell, this year's BMA president, did not contain the ornate allusions of either the Macara or Santer addresses, but the same messages were there. 'There is, I believe, a very real risk that some members of our profession will be lured into market-place medicine. There will be lucrative rewards for those who respond to the demands of management and redundancy notices for others.' Is the criticism hitting home? Although Mrs Bottomley's detractors accuse her of undermining the NHS, she is, like Macara, a passionate admirer of the health service. If she leaves her post in next week's expected cabinet reshuffle, she will depart wondering why she was unable to dilute criticism of the reforms. Part of the explanation is that, while the BMA's long campaign did not succeed in dislodging the government from its policy path, it may have undermined the credibility of the reforms in the eyes of doctors and the public irreparably. Macara declared at the conference this week that the BMA was determined to reform the reforms. It might yet.</p>

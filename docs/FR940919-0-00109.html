			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Certain portions of today's rule are being promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to sections 3004 (d) through (k), and (m), of RCRA (42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 6924 (d) through (k), and (m)). These will be added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and that take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States may apply for either interim or final authorization for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HSWA provisions in Table 1, as discussed in the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of this preamble. Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to indicate that this rule is a self-implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of HSWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B. Effect on State Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As noted above, today's rule, with the exception of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the definition of solid waste (see preamble section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IX, and further discussion in this section, below), will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented in authorized States until their programs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to adopt these rules and the modification is approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to HSWA, a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting a program modification may apply to receive either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim or final authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially equivalent or equivalent to EPA's. The procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and schedule for State program modifications for either interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 18, 1992, EPA extended the period allowing interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization to January 1, 2003 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c) and 57 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60129).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program changes and must subsequently submit the modification to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA for approval. The deadline by which the State would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify its program to adopt these regulations is specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 271.21(e). Once EPA approves the modification, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with authorized RCRA programs may already have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements similar to those in today's rule. These State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have not been assessed against the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations being promulgated today to determine whether they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized to implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State program modifications are approved. Of course, states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with existing standards could continue to administer and enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their standards as a matter of State law. In the period between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of today's rule and the approval of state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program modifications, the regulated communities in authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states generally must comply with state regulations in addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the provisions in today's rule. The regulated community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should continue to consult with state agencies authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer LDRs. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work with States under agreements to minimize duplication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their efforts to implement their programs rather than take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate actions under Federal authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that submit official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations are not required to include standards equivalent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations in their application. However, the State must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify its program by the deadline set forth in &sect;271.21(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that submit official applications for final authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 months after the effective date of these regulations must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include standards equivalent to these regulations in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. The requirements a state must meet when submitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its final authorization application are set forth in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 271.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations promulgated today need not affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's Underground Injection Control (UIC) primacy status. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State currently authorized to administer the UIC program under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) could continue to do so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without seeking authority to administer the amendments that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be promulgated at a future date. However, a State which wished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement Part 148 and receive authorization to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that it had the requisite authority to administer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 3004 (f) and (g) of RCRA. The conditions under which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such an authorization may take place are summarized below and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in a July 15, 1985 final rule (50 FR 28728).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The modifications to the definition of solid waste in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule (see preamble section IX) are based on non-HSWA authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This portion of the rule, because it is not based on HSWA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, will be applicable immediately only in those States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that do not have final RCRA authorization. In authorized States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements will not apply until the States revise their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs to adopt equivalent requirements under State law. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, this modification broadens the ``closed-loop'' recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion from the definition of solid waste. The modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this rule is less stringent, or reduces the scope of, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal program. Therefore, although EPA strongly encourages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely adoption, authorized States are not required to modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their programs to adopt regulations consistent with and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> XVI. Regulatory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Regulatory Impact Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  Executive Order No. 12866 requires agencies to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a regulatory action is ``significant.'' The Order defines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a ``significant'' regulatory action as one that ``is likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material way, the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rights and obligations of recipients; or (4) raise novel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency estimated the costs of today's final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if it is a significant regulation as defined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order. The incremental compliance costs for today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule were estimated as a range from $194 to $219 million per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Therefore, today's final rule is considered an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically significant rule, having an annual effect on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy of over $100 million. The Agency prepared a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact analysis which analyzed the costs, economic impacts, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of today's final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section of the preamble for today's final rule provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a discussion of the methodology used for estimating the costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts and the benefits attributable to today's final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, followed by a presentation of the cost, economic impact and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit results. Limitations to these estimates are described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the results section. More detailed discussions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology and results may be found in the background document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Land Disposal Restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final Rule for the Phase 2 Newly Listed and Identified Wastes,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has been placed in the docket for today's final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

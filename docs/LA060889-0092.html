			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> 2 TAX INCREASES PROPOSED  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors will decide Tuesday whether to enact two  proposed tax increases to help fund the city's $108-million budget for the  fiscal year that begins July 1.  </P> <P> The proposals would raise the utility tax for residential customers to the same  levels paid by commercial users and would impose a tax on interstate and  international telephone calls.  </P> <P> The increase in the utility tax would raise the average residential customer's  bill by $1.57 a month. City officials said such a bill would still be $4 below  that of a comparable customer in neighboring cities because of Pasadena's low  rate for electricity. The tax increase would generate $750,000 a year.  </P> <P> The proposed telephone tax would extend a levy that already applies to calls  made within California. It would amount to 7.86% of the cost of the calls and  would generate about $1 million a year.  </P></p>

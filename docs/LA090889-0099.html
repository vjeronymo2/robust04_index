			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARD TO FIGURE;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP TRACK MEET STARTS TODAY IN SPAIN WITH ODD FORMAT  </P> <P> Tonight at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, King Juan Carlos of Spain will open  track and field's World Cup, a three-day meet that is being held for the fifth  time since 1977 but still has to be explained.  </P> <P> That is unfortunate because it has the potential of being one of the best meets  since the 1988 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> The format, however, has yet to catch on so that anyone other than the sport's  aficionados would notice. In other words, it is not the Olympics or even the  World Championships, which have been in existence only since 1983.  </P> <P> There are nine teams in both the men's and the women's divisions, including  four representing countries.  </P> <P> The United States and the host country, Spain in this case, have standing  invitations. Also, the top two teams in the European Cup are invited. For the  men, that is Great Britain and East Germany. For the women, it is East Germany  and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The field is completed with all-star teams from Africa, the Americas, Asia,  Europe and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand).  </P> <P> Each of the nine teams is represented by one competitor in 36 events, all  finals.  </P> <P> Some of the sport's greatest performers are entered here -- Morocco's Said  Aouita in the 5,000 meters, Great Britain's Sebastian Coe in the 1,500, the  United States' Roger Kingdom in the high hurdles, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor in  the high jump, East Germany's Silke Moeller in the women's 100 and 200,  Romania's Paula Ivan in the women's 1,500, Cuba's Ana Quirot in the women's 400  and 800, and Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen in the women's 10,000.  </P> <P> But there also are two or three athletes in each event who will not be  competitive. Good hosts they may be, but the Spanish belong in hardly any of  the events, much less all of them. The same can be said for the Asians. Japan's  Kazuhiro Mizoguchi is an obvious exception, having thrown the javelin farther  than anyone else in the men's field.  </P> <P> The International Amateur Athletic Federation has discussed eliminating the  World Cup, which now is held every four years, and scheduling the  ultra-successful World Championships at two-year intervals instead of four.  </P> <P> But IAAF President Primo Nebiolo of Italy said Thursday that there will be  another World Cup in 1993, although a site has not been selected.  </P> <P> Nebiolo said that the World Cup "unites the athletes of different continents."  </P> <P> Perhaps so. But he would have gotten an argument from the French Thursday, when  their excellent pole vaulter, Philippe Collet, lost his place on the European  team to the Soviet Union's Rodion Gataullin.  </P> <P> Gataullin originally was in the World Cup as a member of the Soviet team, which  finished second to Great Britain in the European Cup. But then the drug-testing  results came down.  </P> <P> Soviet shotputter Alexander Bagach tested positive for a banned substance and  lost his third-place points, which moved East Germany ahead of the Soviets and  into the World Cup.  </P> <P> But because Gataullin won the pole vault in the European Cup, it was determined  that he should represent Europe, instead of Collett, who was the original  selection and already was here to train.  </P> <P> Thursday, French officials walked around indignantly, which they do better than  anyone else in the world.  </P> <P> The Africans, as usual, were waist-deep in intrigue. They had announced earlier  this year that only athletes who competed in the African Championships at  Lagos, Nigeria, would be eligible for the World Cup.  </P> <P> No one, however, tells Aouita where to compete. So he did not go to Lagos. But  he still wanted to come here to run the 1,500. Under pressure from Nebiolo, the  Africans relented.  </P> <P> But Somalia's Abdi Bile, the 1987 world champion at 1,500 meters, said he  wanted to run that race. He also did not go to Lagos, saying that he had the  flu and also visa problems. Take your pick.  </P> <P> African officials announced this week that Bile will run the 1,500 and Aouita  the 5,000, a race that he won in the 1984 Olympics and the 1987 World  Championships.  </P> <P> Whether Aouita is happy with the compromise has not been determined. As of  Thursday afternoon, he had not reported for duty. Kenya's John Ngugi, the 1988  Olympic champion at 5,000 meters who did go to Lagos, is standing by, just in  case.  </P> <P> The United States left its problems at home, along with some of its best  athletes. Of eight U.S. individual champions from the Seoul Games, the only one  here is Kingdom. Six of the seven others chose for one reason or another not to  attend the qualifying meet, the national championships in June at Houston.  </P> <P> Jamaican-born but raised in Brooklyn and college-educated at Cal State L.A.,  Sandra Farmer-Patrick will compete for the first time in a U.S. uniform in the  400-meter intermediate hurdles. She is favored. Her husband, David Patrick,  will represent the U.S. men in the intermediate hurdles.  </P></p>

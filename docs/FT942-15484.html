			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Sweden swinging to the left Support for Sweden's opposition Social Democrats has risen to 50.5 per cent against 39.0 per cent for parties in the centre-right government, according to an opinion poll yesterday. The poll suggests the party is benefiting from turmoil in New Democracy, the populist party which holds the balance of power, where support has crumbled to 2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent in a month. A Social Democrat victory in September's general election is viewed as strengthening chances of a 'yes' vote in the Swedish referendum on EU membership on November 13.</p>

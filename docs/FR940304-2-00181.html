			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the failure to provide usage and maintenance instructions, the petitioner has argued that this information has always been provided with belts distributed to the general public. As for the belts covered by the petition, Am-Safe has concluded that since they are currently in service, lack of instructions for maintenance and use at this point is inconsequential as it relates to safety. With respect to this argument, NHTSA believes it more likely than not that instructions accompanying packaged belts will be discarded once the belts are installed. In addition, similar petitions from vehicle manufacturers have stated that maintenance and use instructions for belts are included in the operator's manuals of the vehicles in which the replacement belts have been installed. Given the fact that all seat belts must conform to Standard No. 209, NHTSA believes that there is such a sufficient similarity between belts of all manufacturers, whether used as original or replacement equipment, that the maintenance and use instructions in any specific vehicle operator's manual will be of general applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliances herein described are inconsequential as they relate to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (15 U.S.C. 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issued on: February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associated Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4916 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

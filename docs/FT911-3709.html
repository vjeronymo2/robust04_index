			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Weak dollar hits Bankers Trust BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent fall in first-quarter earnings, with a strong advance in trading income more than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies. Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m or Dollars 1.85 a share from Dollars 198m or Dollars 2.36 a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to Dollars 213m. The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase. Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m. Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate, currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled by 23 per cent. Loans on BT's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of the past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance companies and pension funds. BT's total loan portfolio stood at Dollars 19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986. BT is less exposed to the depressed real estate market than some other US money-centre banks, but it has nonetheless not been left unscarred. The bank lifted loan-loss provisions to Dollars 51m from Dollars 40m a year earlier. Non-performing assets, other than renegotiated Third World debt, jumped to Dollars 164m on March 31 from Dollars 65m. Real estate credits made up the bulk of the increase.</p>

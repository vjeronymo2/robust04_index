			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: SQM - privatisation, investment and capital expenditure Sir, On December 19 1990, the FT published an article which contained several inaccuracies about Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM). We would like to correct the most important errors. SQM was privatised in 1988 with many shares being taken up by its employees. SQM is therefore run for the benefit of not only its shareholders but also its employees as employees are shareholders. Your article wrongly suggests that employees were duped out of their shares in Pampa Calichera. The correct position is that the shares of this company were purchased by Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Grande SA The purchase was made in order to defeat a hostile and risky takeover bid mounted by foreign investor competitors of SQM. The majority of the shares in Oro Blanco, Pampa Grande and Pampa Calichera continue to be owned by employees of SQM and its subsidiaries. Over the past three years, SQM has made a significant investment of more than Dollars 13m in building houses and in improving current housing conditions of its employees in Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia. SQM's employees earn on average between Dollars 600 and Dollars 700 a month. The minimum monthly wage in Chile is about Dollars 75. Moreover, free housing, water, electricity and schooling, together with subsidised health service and transportation, are also provided to SQM's employees. Although your article correctly records planned future expenditure of Dollars 238m on plant improvements, it did not mention that since SQM's plants were built in 1930 they have been constantly updated and modernised; in the past three years alone more than Dollars 90m has been spent on plant improvements. On average, SQM's plants are less than 10 years old. SQM is a publicly listed company strictly controlled by the Chilean SEC, with a well-known board of directors and with no political allegiance to previous or current regimes in Chile. Patricio Contesse, general manager and CEO, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, Santiago, Chile</p>

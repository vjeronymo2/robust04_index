			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Absolute for Jakarta"] </F>   [Text] The Indonesian authorities' ban on three magazines,  and the demonstrations of support for the media this has  brought, have presented the government with a tricky question:  just what was the campaign of political openness signalled by  President Suharto four years ago meant to achieve? Broadly  speaking, it was to create the conditions for economic  upliftment and the modernisation of society. Just last week,  State Secretary Murdiono told a seminar that any political  system had to be dynamic and open to change in accordance with  new demands and conditions. "The global political trend demands  greater political openness and greater respect for human  rights," he had said. All that is worthwhile. For the country to  advance, it takes more than opening up the economy to foreign  participation. Domestic strengths need to be maximised. It can  be no surprise then that a liberalisation of the spirit has  brought with it an exuberance among activists that can come  uncomfortably close to upsetting public order. Recent events  have been revealing. If they spin out of control, the  consequences can be dire as Indonesian society in urban centres  remains a combustible mix of extreme wealth and unfulfilled  wants. It lacks the buffer of a growing middle class found in  Taiwan and South Korea when these countries began to ease off on  societal restrictions less than a decade ago. If not managed  properly, it could deal Indonesia's cause of openness a blow  which would take years to repair. That equally would be harmful  to an emancipating society.    The Medan labour riots over minimum pay were bad enough, but  they began to take on a racial complexion with the discovery of  anti-Chinese leaflets. Then came the Bapindo corruption case,  which has dramatised for many Indonesians to hold the Chinese  have on the economy and their friends in high places. Earlier,  the virulence of student agitation over a state-sponsored  lottery had warned the security agencies of the dangers of  pent-up emotions being released suddenly. In a separate case,  the sentencing of 21 students for defaming the president brought  home to many the power of pressure groups.    These are internal dynamics. Recent remarks by two key  generals leave one in doubt that the authorities are alive to  the dangers. This is a comfort to Indonesia's neighbours who  share its concern for internal stability to drive economic  expansion. Gen. Feisal Tanjung, head of the armed forces,  cautioned last month that political dialogue had to come with a  sense of responsibility and consensus to "take into account our  cultural condition". Brig-Gen Agum Gumelar, head of the Kopassus  [Special Commando Force] force which aided the crushing of the  communist forces after the abortive 1965 coup by the PKI, the  Indonesian Communist Party, has warned of the communist revival.  In today's context, that could be taken as a code for the  radical groups -- student and labour activists,  environmentalists and human rights advocates -- which some  quarters see as troublesome.    Here, the hope must be that just as it is vital to secure  public order, care must be taken that debate and legitimate  expressions of grievance are not snuffed out. Such a development  would ill-serve Indonesia. The difficulty, as is standard when  discussing a polity as complex as Indonesia's, is in making the  ground rules for participatory democracy as clear as can be.  Complicating the equation is the internal dimension. Indonesia  is the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, and it has hopes  for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.  In November, it will stage the second summit of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation members. Wanting to be a player on the  world stage carries with it obligations, such as adherence to  certain standards of behaviour, which may be at odds with what  has been happening at home. But domestic stability is paramount  -- this is an absolute to preserve conditions for uninterrupted  growth in Southeast Asia.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Portsmouth enjoys spectacle of restored Victorian tram A restored Victorian horse tram running down Broad Street in Portsmouth yesterday (left) was discovered in a Kent apple orchard in 1975, where it was being used as a shed (above). It was then bought by London Transport, which spent two years restoring it. The tram was originally supplied by the John Stephenson Company of New York to the London Tramways Company in 1882 and operated in south London until 1905. Suitable tram tracks were found in Portsmouth, where it ran some celebratory journeys yesterday before returning to London and its final home at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, which reopens on December 15 after a nine-month Pounds 4m redevelopment Photograph left: Tony Andrews</p>

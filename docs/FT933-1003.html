			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (11): Where to search for that second home / International IT WOULD be interesting but probably impossible to define the ideal holiday home because individual needs are so different. So how does one go about finding one's holiday ideal? Rich sources of ideas are the international property exhibitions, held in spring and autumn and advertised in newspaper property pages. The World of Property exhibition is now on in Manchester with more than 100 exhibitors and an expected attendance of 10,000. The French Property exhibition is another that draws about 7,000. Many buyers choose in a resort where they have spent foreign holidays, although if they plan to use the property for later retirement, they may find the place a ghost town out of season. Other holiday homes are bought as the result of visits to friends' properties. Spending holidays in rented properties in different resorts gives opportunities for comparison both of areas and property. The Spanish Villa Bureau (081-868-2242) has a choice of homes for renting on the Spanish mainland, Balearics and the Canary islands. Some holiday home buyers will shop for a rural ruin. But how do they find that without unnecessary risks and no building experience? Well, they could talk to Stanley Silver. After retiring from an export company Silver, who speaks French, went around Normandy and bought several neglected farmhouses. He had them partly renovated by local builders and put them back on the market and found there was a demand for them. Although his home is in London (071-602-2023) he has formed a company, Prince Estates, in France. Through his connections he is offered places that never reach estate agents. He buys the best and always has 20 to 25 available for selling on, priced perhaps from Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 20,000. Purchasers can make a choice and he can arrange through the local builders to have as much or as little done as the buyer wants. He prices each job - Pounds 2,000 for a septic tank, Pounds 1,500 for rewiring, etc. If he has not improved a property himself he is there to give advice on what needs to be done. Perhaps you would prefer Italy, but still with a guiding hand? A British couple, Patrick Beattie and his wife, Danny, bought a property in the Marche region, learning procedure as they went along. They have now settled there and turned their experience into a business, offering to help with buying and restoration. They call the company Followus. Their brochure gives clear details of their service and the sort of rural properties that might be bought. (Tel Italy 733-598917 or London 071-352-9881). A worldwide property search service was recently introduced by Sotheby's. A client seeking a second home and with no idea where to look, can go to the agency's New Bond Street, London, office and sit at a computer. Beginning with a colour-coded map of the world on screen, he can touch the region in which he might be interested and work through to the country and area. Eventually, when several possible choices have been made, a list of properties selected is shown and brochures with complete information are produced. The system stores about 500 to 600 properties and is updated every month. It is available in Sotheby's offices in Geneva, Monte Carlo, Vienna, Hamburg, Athens and Milan and many offices of Sotheby's agents in the US.</p>

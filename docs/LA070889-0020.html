			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARDINAL TIMOTHY MANNING  </P> <P> The Times' coverage of the life and death of Cardinal Timothy Manning (June 24)  proved three things to me. First, leadership means service; further, it means  making a difference for the good of all humankind. Second, such "mild-mannered"  leaders as Cardinal Manning are many times more profound than the leaders who  take a more reactionary approach. Third, he was truly a good man. I hope that  my epitaph reads the same.  </P> <P> SHAUN DI ANDRE STRONG  </P> <P> Brentwood  </P></p>

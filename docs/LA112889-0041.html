			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU WINS UGLY BUT EASILY AGAINST SONOMA  </P> <P> As U.S. International was well on its way to a 110-94 victory over visiting  Sonoma State in one of those unattractive early-season games Monday, a lone  voice carried from the crowd of 160 at Golden Hall.  </P> <P> "Why don't you leave your starters in there a little longer, coach?" the  partisan Sonoma State fan yelled. "Why don't you score another 50 points?"  </P> <P> The fan's critique did not get USIU Coach Gary Zarecky in a pique. Instead, he  was grateful. Zarecky has waited five years to hear that.  </P> <P> "When he said that, I remembered four years ago when I was driving to Golden  Hall to play a Division II team and we were the underdog," Zarecky said. "What  a change four years make. That means we're doing something right with the  program. To me it was a compliment."  </P> <P> That was more than Zarecky had for his team's play against Sonoma State (2-1),  which advanced to the NCAA Division II tournament last season.  </P> <P> "It was ugly," Zarecky said. "With a capital U."  </P> <P> Zarecky should not have expected anything more considering he cleared his bench  with 2:53 remaining -- in the first half.  </P> <P> Eleven of the Gulls' 13 players scored and USIU was never threatened after  taking a 16-14 lead. USIU led by only 55-45 at the half, but ran that to 80-63  midway through the second half and 110-88 with two minutes left in the game.  </P> <P> Guards Kevin Bradshaw (28 points) and Steve Smith (20) led the Gulls. Forward  Demetrius Laffitte added 19 points and 13 rebounds. Creedence Perkins led the  Cossacks with 27 points.  </P> <P> And although USIU was always in control, it never really played under control.  </P> <P> "I tried different players with different combinations and that can get out of  sync with the starters," Zarecky said. "It's a 'W' and for this program, a 'W'  is an important thing."  </P> <P> But Zarecky couldn't be faulted for being concerned about his team's play. He  knows the Gulls will have to play a polished game when they play at No. 16  Oklahoma in the Sooners' season opener Wednesday.  </P> <P> "They were out there for themselves, but at what point do you say as a coach,  'let them have fun,' " Zarecky said. "But it's not going to be fun Wednesday  night."  </P></p>

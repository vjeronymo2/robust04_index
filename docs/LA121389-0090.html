			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAMESE PARENTS ADVISED ON TROUBLED YOUTHS  </P> <P> Rocked by recent reports of gangs, teen pregnancy and alienation among  Vietnamese-American youth, about 30 parents came to Westminster High School  Tuesday night for advice on how to handle their troubled young people.  </P> <P> "I don't want to say that it's hopeless, but the situation is alarming," said  Chi Duy Do, a counselor with Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a  nonprofit social services agency.  </P> <P> Citing the 15-year-old Vietnamese-American honors student whose newborn baby  drowned recently in a high school toilet, reports of violent feuds among gangs  of teen-age girls and increasing drug abuse, Do said the Vietnamese community  must begin facing up to its youth problem.  </P> <P> "We have to ask our children why they prefer to spend more time in prison than  in the warmth of their families' home," Do said, speaking in Vietnamese.  </P> <P> The forum was one of the first all-Vietnamese programs for Westminster High  parents. Speakers explained how to recognize cigarette burns and cuts that  could signify gang involvement, how to spot drug abuse and which Orange County  agencies can provide parents with Vietnamese-language help.  </P> <P> "They need our love and support," said counselor Tran Linh. "Pool them into the  family. Don't let them run with bad company."  </P> <P> Among the problems that Do and other speakers said contribute to teen  estrangement are loneliness, lack of basic education in Vietnam in preparation  for American schooling and language deficiencies. Attributing some of the  problems to "a new American-style materialism that their parents cannot  satisfy," speakers also said that many parents' long work hours prevented them  from spending enough time with their children.  </P> <P> "If we only think of getting rich, then we will lose our children," said Linh  Tran. "They will become uncontrollable and they will turn around and wreck our  wealth."  </P></p>

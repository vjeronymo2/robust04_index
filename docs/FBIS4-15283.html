			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 14 of 64] </F>   [Text] According to experts, arms trade was one of the most  profitable spheres of Soviet foreign trade. In Russia the  exports and imports of weapons and military equipment have been  entrusted to the government-owned company Rosvooruzheniye  recently formed by a decree of President Boris Yeltsin. Our  reporter Vitaliy Jibuti has interviewed its General Director  Viktor Samoilov.    INTERFAX: Analysts claim that Russia has lost a considerable  share of the arms markets of the Soviet Union. How true are  such claims?    SAMOILOV: In my opinion only the countries affected by UN  sanctions are lost. This applies primarily to Libya and Iraq.  By the way, several capitalist countries received compensation  from the United Nations and the International Monetary fund for  severing economic ties with those countries. Only the Soviet  Union and Russia as its legal successor got nothing after the  introduction of sanctions. According to my estimates, the  losses of the Russian Federation amount to $1015 Bn.    INTERFAX: Which of the traditional arms markets has Moscow  retained best?    SAMOILOV: The Middle East, India, China, Africa and East  Europe. However, the difficulty lies in the change in the very  structure of the arms market. In the past there was no question  of settlements in hard currency with socialist countries. When  in 1990 it was decided to switch to settlements in hard  currency, which I by the way find absolute thoughtless and  wrong, 1991 was declared the year of payments. As a result the  Soviet Union and Russia after were left in debt to practically  all former socialist countries. I think the lack of  professionalism of the economic leaders of that time the main  cause for such an imbalance.    The matter will have to be settled yet. The Soviet Union  supplied East Europe with valuable raw materials and  manufactured goods getting in return mostly green peas and  tomatoes. As a result the Russian Federation owes its partners  hundreds of millions of dollars. At the present stage the main  article with which Russia can pay back its foreign debts, I  think, is weaponry.    INTERFAX: If Russia has kept its traditional arms markets,  why has trade dropped?    SAMOILOV: The volume of trade changed with the change of the  methods of settlements. Since 1991 Russia has practically  stopped selling arms for credit.    Earlier the Soviet Union supplied arms and military hardware  mainly on the basis of government agreements and credits.  Political as well as economic factors were taken into account.  Credits were given for a minimum of seven years. Often the  term was 10 or even 20 years. There is even one contract for 43  years which is still in force. This is the explanation for the  impressive volume of trade and the recent leadership of Moscow  in the business.    I would want to remark that at the moment the volume of  American arms trade for cash is practically the same as Russian.  Last year Moscow imported armaments worth $2 Bn. The the USA  claims that it sold $30Bn it means credit deliveries as well.  The credits are usually given at sufficiently advantageous  terms. Today it is senseless speaking of a return to the old  volume of Soviet arms trade. This requires a healthy economy  and solid investments in the industry, because ties should be of  long-term nature here.    Any contract for cooperation in defence is concluded for at  least 20 or 25 years. It is clear that partners can be  satisfied with only government contracts. That is why at the  end of last year the Russian government united several  organizations trading arms in one, "Rosvooruzheniye". The  leadership of the company does not wish to keep this  megacorporation for a long time. As soon as the process of  forming joint-stock companies in the munitions industry picks  up speed and structures appear guaranteeing foreign companies  the observation of contracts for 20 to 25 years in complex types  of equipment, Rosvooruzheniye is going to give freedom and  independence in arms trade to them. However, the appearance of  such Russian companies requires time.    At the moment American arms dealers have only one competitor  - the Russian Federation. The program of arms sales should be  part of the program of military development and adjusted to the  program of conversion. That is we should know what plants are  going to survive in 20 to 25 years, what types of equipment are  going to remain competitive on condition of their modernization  during this time. Otherwise Russia risks to lose its markets.  Individual deals can only keep up the staggering  military-industrial complex for some time. But such an approach  is devoid of statesmanship.    INTERFAX: What realistic amount of weaponry can Russia  export this year?    SAMOILOV: Trade for cash can be increased by 100 to 150  percent. If we take trade for credit, in a favorable situation  the contracts might total $10-15 Bn, but with a delay in  payments. This is in line with the defence programs of the  countries that are capable of purchasing Russian weaponry. I  must say that the figure includes the markets from which  embargos might be lifted.    The figures are realistic because Russia, unlike the Soviet  Union, is not isolated from the world community. The Russian  banking and financial systems are integrated in the  international system. That is why for concluding one deal or  another Moscow can use first class foreign banks as guarantor.  Besides, Russian commercial banks are gradually becoming  stronger, developing into solid financial institutions which can  be dealt with. I am convinced that if our company offers them a  well- considered program of crediting some country or another to  which Russian army goods are going to be sold, Russia banks will  show interest in that.    But today constant complaints on political and economic  instability in Russia undermine the reliability of domestic arms  manufacturers and contracts for the delivery of weapons. This  has also affected the volume of Russian exports. Why should a  solid client sign a contract with the Russian Federation for the  delivery of the latest weaponry, if it is not clear who is going  to control the manufacturing facility tomorrow and whether the  country is going to stand by its commitments in general?    "Rosvooruzheniye" has worked out a program of covering part  of Russia's foreign debts by deliveries of special equipment.  The program is designed for two or three years and should bring  the country over $1 Bn. For the purpose our company has asked a  government credit to support Russian arms manufacturers.    After 1991 the manufacturer has been getting the returns for  the exports, but not all manufacturers are satisfied with the  terms of the financial transactions. Many of them do not  believe in the stability of the Russian government or are  dissatisfied with the tax system. That is why some companies  are trying to keep their money in foreign banks. This is an  understandable desire, I think.    "Rosvooruzheniye" guarantees full return of hard currency to  Russia, the sale of half of it to the state and the return of  the rubles to the manufacturer.The manufacturer also gets the  rest of the hard currency, but only in the territory of the  Russian Federation.    I would also want to say that Rosvooruzheniye is interested  in direct contacts with regions and in the possibility of  uniting manufacturers into industrial groups that could carry  out serious economic programs. Our company has set up a  scientific center that supports such an economic policy.  Production groups in the military-industrial complex should  become the main performers of major contracts on military-  technical cooperation and guarantee their functioning for 20 to  25 years.</p>

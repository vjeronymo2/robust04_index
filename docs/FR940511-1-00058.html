			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> There is no specific statutory commitment to the principle of parental choice of providers in the title IV&hyph;A child care programs as there is for the CCDBG program. Parental choice, however, is addressed in the current title IV&hyph;A regulations. If more than one category of care is available, the regulations require the State to provide the parent or caretaker relative with an opportunity to choose the arrangement. Also, the State IV&hyph;A agency is required to establish at least one method by which self-arranged care may be paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be compatible with the current CCDBG regulations, the existing title IV&hyph;A child care regulations include an effects test concerning the regulatory provisions that allow States to adopt the health and safety requirements of other Federal or State child care programs. Additionally, they contain an effects test concerning the At-Risk provider registration provisions which States must adopt. The title IV&hyph;A child care effects test is the same as the effects test contained in the CCDBG regulations, i.e., that a State's requirements and procedures in those areas may not have the effect of excluding any categories of child care providers. For the same reasons given for removing the CCDBG effects test provisions, however, ACF proposes to remove the title IV&hyph;A effects tests requirements at &sect;&sect;255.4(c)(2)(iii), 257.41(a)(3), and 257.41(b)(2)(v). We do not propose to, and do not believe this action will, delete or weaken the current title IV&hyph;A parental choice provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Part 98_Child Care and Development Block Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Immunizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We are proposing to amend the CCDBG health and safety regulations to require that grantees establish rules requiring children receiving CCDBG services to be immunized. While this change affects only the CCDBG regulations, grantees may apply the immunization requirement to title IV&hyph;A child care programs for a more seamless child care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CCDBG statute currently includes references to immunizations. Section 658E(c)(2)(F) requires grantees to provide assurances that provider requirements are in effect to protect the health and safety of children receiving services under &sect;&sect;98.50 and 98.51, including ``the prevention and control of infectious diseases (including immunizations).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 658E(c)(2)(G) of the Block Grant Act also requires grantees to assure that procedures are in effect which ensure that child care providers comply with all applicable health and safety requirements described in paragraph (F) of section 658E. However, section 658P(5)(B) allows grantees to exclude grandparents, aunts or uncles from provider health and safety requirements. The current CCDBG regulations reiterate these statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surveys of licensed child care facilities indicate that the majority of States require some proof of immunizations for children enrolled in licensed or regulated child care centers and family day care homes. However, individual States differ in their specific requirements and regulatory approaches. In addition, requirements for the immunization of children in legally unlicensed care vary widely. Consequently, there is concern that current immunization policies and practices may be inadequate to protect large numbers of young children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preventable diseases that were practically eliminated years ago are again infecting our youngest and most vulnerable children. More than 55,000 measles cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1989 and 1991. In 1990, 64 deaths from measles were reported, the highest number in two decades. A survey conducted by the CDC in 1991 found that only 37&hyph;56% of two-year-old children were fully vaccinated. (``Childhood Immunizations Fact Sheet,'' Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC, February 12, 1993.) Since a large percentage of children receiving assistance under the Block Grant program are under 5 years of age, we believe that the proposed requirements will assist in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases among preschool age children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we propose amending &sect;98.41(a)(1) to require that grantees' health and safety plans include specific provisions requiring children to be immunized in order to receive services under the CCDBG. State and Territorial health and safety plans must incorporate (by reference or otherwise) the latest recommendations for childhood immunizations of the respective State or Territorial Department of Public Health. Since there may not be a similar public health authority for Tribes to follow regarding immunization standards, we are proposing to allow Tribes the option to determine the immunization standards to be followed for children to receive CCDBG services. Tribes may choose standards set forth by the State Public Health Department or the Indian Health Service. Tribes will be required to identify the source of these standards in their CCDBG plans. In addition, we propose that all grantees consider requirements which include provisions for documenting regular updates of the child's immunizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sainsbury chairman rejects accusations of high food prices LORD SAINSBURY, the outgoing chairman of the food retailer, yesterday countered suggestions that UK food prices were high compared with those abroad by saying that the group's return on capital employed, at 21.4 per cent, was similar to that achieved by leading US and French food retailers. The group's UK food retail operating profit margins rose from 7.7 per cent to 8 per cent in the year to mid-March, higher than those made by retailers outside the UK. High margins in the UK have led to criticisms that British food retailers are overcharging customers. Lord Sainsbury said the increased margins were the result of opening larger stores which offered more higher margin goods than the smaller ones. He said these stores involved heavy capital spending. Mr David Sainsbury, deputy chairman and Lord Sainsbury's successor, said that group capital expenditure had fallen slightly in the latest financial year to Pounds 766m. He expected it to rise to about Pounds 800m in the current year. After last year's rights issue which raised Pounds 489m, gearing had fallen to 17 per cent. It would rise to about 20 per cent in the current year, Mr Sainsbury said, but would then stay at about that level. Annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m (Pounds 518.2m) came after capitalising Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 51.4m) of interest. Lord Sainsbury said that the Sainsbury and Savacentre chains had achieved sales of Pounds 7.9bn, a rise of 12.9 per cent, and operating profits of Pounds 632.2m, up 17.3 per cent. During the year, 21 new supermarkets were opened, including the group's first store in Scotland. The sales area of the Sainsbury chain rose by nearly 10 per cent to 7.6m sq ft. No new Savacentres were opened. Homebase, the group's DIY chain, also increased profits, by 17.7 per cent to Pounds 15.5m on sales 14.7 per cent higher at Pounds 257.6m. Lord Sainsbury said Homebase was one of only two of the leading DIY chains to increase profits as the recession had made it a tough market. In the US, Shaw's, the New England supermarket chain, suffered a sharp drop in profits as recession led to customers trading down. Shaw's operating profits fell by a third in dollar terms but in sterling were 29 per cent lower at Pounds 21.4m on sales 7.7 per cent higher at Pounds 1bn. Haverhill Meat Products, which sold its Palethorpes subsidiary in the 1990-91 year for Pounds 14m, incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a Pounds 2.7m profit.</p>

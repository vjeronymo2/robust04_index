			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / BMW aims to maintain Rover alliance with Honda Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board, is to meet Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, chief executive of Honda in Tokyo next week in a first round of talks aimed at maintaining the alliance between the Japanese carmaker and Rover. BMW stunned Honda on Monday with its Pounds 800m takeover from British Aerospace of an 80 per cent stake in the UK carmaker. Honda still holds the remaining 20 per cent of the equity in the Rover and Land Rover vehicle operations. Mr Pischetsrieder is anxious to maintain Honda as a partner for Rover in vehicle production and development, at least in the medium term. Honda and Rover have forged a close relationship in the past 14 years, and Mr Kawamoto was quick to express dismay at the entry of BMW. He said the BMW takeover had 'negated' the long-term efforts of Honda and Rover to establish a firm future for Rover as 'a British company with its own brand identity'. Honda's resentment at the way that British Aerospace engineered the move was also highlighted yesterday when Mr Andrew Jones, the company's UK plant manager, admitted the company was shocked at the deal. Speaking at the House of Commons select committee on employment he agreed with a suggestion from MPs that the decision could deter Japanese investors from investing in the UK. While he maintained that Honda would remain committed to its Pounds 370m investment in the UK at the Swindon Honda plant, he said it was important to understand the way Japanese companies approached corporate relationships. Mr Jones said they took a long-term view and liked to build their relations on 'trust and sincerity'. Any sudden deviation would affect their behaviour, he said. British union officials, however, reacted favourably yesterday to BMW's purchase after Mr Pischetsrieder gave them the assurances they had been seeking on job security and investment plans in the UK. 'We could not have asked for anything more positive,' said Mr John Allen, the AEEU engineering union official for the auto industry. Mr Pischetsrieder told them that BMW would guarantee the future of Rover's plants, maintain the commitment to product development plans and keep current employment levels.

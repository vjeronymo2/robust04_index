			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Hungary's Communist Party has concluded that the execution of Premier Imre Nagy  after the 1956 uprising was a "criminal act" and expressed hope that his  reburial will be a cause for national reconciliation. The decision by the  party's 118-member Central Committee overturned more than three decades of  official party dogma. Party spokesman Laszlo Major told a news conference in  Budapest that Nagy was given a "fabricated political trial" and said his  "execution was certainly judicially illegal." Nagy's body was exhumed from an  unmarked grave March 29 for reburial on June 16.  </P></p>

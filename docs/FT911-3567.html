			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt waits for the dark days to pass - Andrew Fisher looks for the good news which might inspire the German stock market THIS YEAR has been fairly dispiriting for the German stock market. While the west German economy remains strong, its growth is slowing down. In east Germany, the dismantling of the old communist system is causing immense industrial and social strains. And recession abroad, coupled in the case of the US with a rising dollar, has bit deeply into export earnings. On top of all this, the political climate has turned sour with the defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate. As well as demonstrating that voters had lost confidence in the government's handling of affairs after unity - they certainly disliked tax increases after promises that these could be avoided - the state election also removed its majority in the upper house of Parliament (Bundesrat). Thus the Bonn cabinet could find life tougher in the months ahead, since the Bundesrat has the power of veto over legislation, including tax. Yet the stock market outlook is by no means all gloomy. Some analysts feel the time may be ripe for foreign institutional investors to pay more attention to the German market, since it has so clearly failed to keep pace with other exchanges. 'People are underweight in a market which has underperformed,' says Ms Katrin Kandell, an analyst at the London office of Sal. Oppenheim, the German bank. 'They are starting to look at 1992. There has to be some positive news in the next six months.' What could that be? Indications of a bottoming out in the east German economic slump could be one element. Another could be evidence that the knocks which west German exporters have taken over the past year are becoming less painful. Degab, the investment analysis offshoot of Deutsche Bank, recently forecast that German corporate earnings would rise by around 8 per cent next year after declines of 5 per cent in 1990 and 1 per cent in 1991; in 1989, they grew by 13 per cent. Two sectors which have been especially buffeted by the problems on export markets, chemicals and cars, are expected to show a marked improvement next year, while the surge in retail and consumer companies' profits should ease and construction, helped by the rebuilding of east Germany, should remain strong. Germany's construction companies are currently enjoying a prolonged boom, with business in the west also vigorous. A study by the Frankfurt office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK stockbrokers, shows that seven out of the German companies with the best liquidity ratios are from this sector. They also have valuable land and property assets, which are considerably understated in their balance sheets. BZW's German Company Handbook gives a good illustration of the financial solidity of German corporations. Out of 138 companies covered, 53 have no gearing at all and only 21 have any net debt. Moreover, 58 of them finance all capital spending through cash flow. Thus those with heavy future commitments in east Germany, such as RWE and Veba, the energy concerns, have plenty of scope for internal funding. Mr Harry Christopoulos, a BZW analyst, says: 'German companies have lots of assets and low gearing.' Also, adds Ms Kandell, more of them are using their property port-folios for development projects, thus unlocking some of their value. Her hope is that German companies, prompted by the demands of east German investment or the desire to ward off unfriendly takeovers, will start to pay more attention to their share prices. At present, they can lower their tax bills by salting away profits in reserves and thus understating earnings. One day, though, EC tax harmonisation may change all that.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           ASSET ANALYSIS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Company          *Land and       Company                *Liquidity                     buildings  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Leffers               52.2       Hochtief                    42.1 2  Horten                43.1       Dyckerhoff &amp; Widmann        39.3 3  Hornbach              40.9       Kampa-Haus                  38.0 4  WERU                  40.1       Bilfinger+Berger            37.9 5  Harpener              39.8       Kali und Salz               35.0 6  Kaufhalle             38.2       Linotype                    32.4 7  Kampa-Haus            31.1       Hako                        30.6 8  Kaufhof               29.4       SABO                        28.4 9  Karstadt              29.1       Strabag                     28.2 10 ASKO                  28.2       Holzmann                    27.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *As % of Balance Sheet total at end 1989 Source: Barclays de Zoete Wedd  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRAINS CALLED LOUD  </P> <P> Imust disagree with Debra Cohen ("Plug for Light Rail," Aug. 25) that a  "light-rail system is engineered to be clean and quiet."  </P> <P> The Blue Line trains have been equipped with VERY loud air horns, which are  sounded with traditional long-long-short-long blasts at each grade crossing.  </P> <P> Ms. Cohen is invited to try to carry on a conversation or watch television in a  living room with Blue Line trains passing 12 times an hour. They are NOT quiet.  </P> <P> JERRY MARTZ  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

Seven generals and 35 field grade officers discussed more  than 30 topics at a seven-day debate hosted by the Defense  Ministry from Dec. 23-29 last year. They covered consciousness,  personnel, promotion, morale, welfare, exercise, ways to secure  high-quality manpower and manage reserved war potential,  command, control, telecommunications, computers and information.    Most attendants, selected by the ministry, lived together  during the debate, which concluded that societies like "Hanahoe"  and "Aljahoe" create disharmony within the military and tarnish  the honor of the military.    Society members were accused of monopolizing major posts,  which they exchange among themselves, and of being exclusive to  officers from rival societies.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae instructed Army headquarters  and the three armies Dec. 22, a day after he was appointed, to  organize seven-day debates to discuss military reform and report  back directly to him.    There were some who said the ministry should punish club  members more severely than at present and give them  disadvantages in personnel management and promotion.    Some worried that former society members, insisting they  have  led the military so far, will strengthen their unity against the  disadvantages they have suffered since the government was  inaugurated in February last year.    Minister Yi is an ex-member of Hanahoe, along with former  Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Toyota's drive for the 20-somethings - How the car company has tapped into a new market Targeting Japan's 20-somethings has become part of the answer to the conundrum facing Toyota Motor, the country's leading car maker: how to revive its faltering sales and profits. The company has tapped into Japan's dankai nisei - translated as the 'second mass generation' - to sell Rav 4, its new recreational vehicle. Thanks to surging demand for the car, the company's domestic sales and production in June were higher than a year before for the first time for 13 months. With their large disposable income, the 8m men and women in their late teens and 20s - the children of the baby boomers in their 40s - are fast becoming the core of Japan's consumer market. Hideki Hashimoto, general manager of Toyota's advertising and marketing department, says unlike the widely held image of Japanese consumers, the 20-somethings are not necessarily brand conscious, although they have an eye for quality. 'The dankai nisei doesn't perceive a car as a status symbol like the older generation. They want something casual - not too posh and not too macho - which they can drive in the city or in the countryside,' he says. Following the recent boom in multi-purpose vehicles, Toyota developed the car in order to cater for increasing demands for a cheaper and smaller recreational vehicle. At Y1.7m (Pounds 11,100), Rav 4 costs around half as much as most recreational vehicles thanks to lower development and design costs achieved by using the same parts from other cars. For example, Rav 4 shares its engine and steering wheel designs with Celica, a sports car, and a common door mirror is used for both Rav 4 and Carina, a four-door sedan. Another factor behind the car's cheaper price is lower profit margins at the dealer level. In an unprecedented move, Toyota's car dealers agreed to lower the retail margins for Rav 4 in order to increase sales. Toyota says it started planning the promotional campaign a year ahead of the car's launch. After introducing it in two consecutive motor shows, the marketing team noted the crowds of young people it attracted. The team studied filmed interviews of auto show visitors, and decided to focus its promotional efforts on consumers in their 20s. But while the company wanted to leave a strong impression with its campaign, it was also careful not to be too pushy, since younger consumers are more confident of their own tastes and dislike being told what is good. 'We wanted to communicate specifically to this generation, so we included an element of entertainment,' says Hashimoto. Toyota spent more than 1.5 times the cost of an ordinary promotion campaign, sponsoring events such as basketball games and mountain bike races in shopping areas popular among teenagers and people in their early 20s. Using comics has also been an effective promotional strategy. Toyota bought eight pages of Shonen Jump, a weekly comic magazine which offers a range of stories from sports to the more lurid type. Shonen Jump's circulation totals 6.3m, which comes in third after 10m for Yomiuri Shimbun and 8m for Asahi Shimbun, two leading mainstream news dailies. 'These days even universities and companies use comics for textbooks and manuals, and we wanted to use this trend effectively,' says Hashimoto. Toyota also placed ads in the television programme pages of leading newspapers, while tying up with a popular sports club in placing advertising features in magazines. A leading attraction of Rav 4, apart from the price, is the 130 optional accessories which can be added to the vehicle. Customers can use computers in showrooms to look through CD-Rom catalogues and simulate creating their own personal vehicle - a feature which has appealed to the younger generation. Thanks to the promotional efforts, orders for the car in June totalled 17,000 units, 8.5 times the original monthly target of 2,000. The production line is now operating at weekends to meet demand, while consumers wanting to buy Rav 4 need to wait until October due to the backlog of orders. In spite of Rav 4's popularity, Toyota's marketing team is not relaxing its promotional efforts. It says only 20 per cent of the orders are from women. 'Our next task is to try to attract female customers by using women's magazines,' says Hashimoto.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Solidarity Party [PS] President Samuel Lewis has  announced his political organization will face the election  process alone without alliances to save the party's honor and  ethical principles. Taking advantage of a news conference held  yesterday at PS headquarters, Lewis read a communique explaining  the official PS position on the 8 May presidential elections.    The PS unsuccessfully tried to forge electoral alliances  with  the Nationalist Liberal Republican Alliance [Molirena], the  Christian Democratic Party [PDC], and the Arnulfista Party,  which already have their three-member presidential tickets.  Lewis said the party's conciliatory efforts to reach agreements  that would serve as a basis for unity and constructive work have  been fruitless. According to the Electoral Tribunal, 8 February  is the deadline for the political parties to officially announce  their candidates.    The PS president said that with rare exceptions, resentment,  personality conflicts, and the repulsive practice of seeking and  proposing alliances to obtain political privileges still prevail  in the political parties.    The PS announced its proposal "to run independently in the  upcoming elections and to appeal to the people and uncommitted  political parties to form a grand dignity front to secure an  elections victory" to its political organizations.    The PS president has not discarded the possibility of an  alliance with the National Unity Mission, which is also planning  to run alone in the upcoming elections.    Solidarity will hold its party convention on 30 January and  conventioneers are expected to ratify the presidential ticket  proposed by the party's political committee, composed of Lewis,  who heads it; Carlos Clement, first vice president; and Marisin  Villalaz, second vice president.</p>

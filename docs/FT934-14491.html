			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Fresh row over milk reforms DAIRY companies have become embroiled in another row with the Milk Marketing Board about arrangements for liberalising the Pounds 3.3bn milk market next April. The dairies say the board will continue to monopolise haulage arrangements for milk, making it more difficult for new entrants to the market. The board will be wound up in April when it plans to transform itself into Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative. But the dairies have objected to board proposals which envisage transferring existing haulage contracts for the milk market to the new body until 1995. 'Our main concern is that as we go to a free market, there should be open access for everyone to the transport system,' said one dairy representative. The board says it will put all of its transport contracts up for tender at the end of next year, but the dairies are arguing this should be done as soon as the market is liberalised. The contracts will allow Milk Marque to tie up existing haulage capacity in the initial stages of the new market, even if it fails to secure all of the supply. Mr Trevor Blackburn, chairman of Northern Foods' dairy group, said: 'It is an attempt to monopolise all available milk haulage beyond the end of the scheme to create another substantial difficulty for organisations seeking to contract directly with farmers in the free market.' The board said it could not understand why the dairies were so upset, as the contracts would be put up for tender at the end of 1994. At the end of this month, the board will take over 23 milk delivery depots from Dairy Crest. Haulage contracts from these depots will be put out to tender by January 1994. Lex, Page 24</p>

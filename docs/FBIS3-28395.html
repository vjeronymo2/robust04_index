			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] General Doan Khue, member of the party Central  Committee Political Bureau and minister of national defense,  recently made a working visit to inspect Group B-24's training  activities in the Fourth Military Region. [passage omitted]    The Thao Nguyen Regiment has served as a model training unit  for Group B-24 and the Fourth Military Region. Last year, the  regiment completed its training program in a satisfactory  manner. Those participating in skills contests in land  transportation, artillery, engineering, communications, and air  defense all won first or second prizes from the Fourth Military  Region and the Ministry of National Defense.    Despite difficulties with budget allocations, lack of seeds,  and bad weather conditions, the cadres and soldiers of the Thao  Nguyen Regiment and other units under Group B-24 actively  participated in production to improve their living conditions.  The quality of their daily meals has improved considerably.  Tens of hectares of land have been turned into ponds to raise  fish. Each cadre or soldier has turned out 11 kg of vegetables  per month. Cultivation and animal husbandry have generated  additional income. As a result, meals have been supplemented by  250 to 300 dong each. Group B-24's personnel usually have three  dishes at each meal. This has put an end to the bad practice of  making one's own cooking arrangements and other negative habits.  As many as 97 to 98 percent of the troops stay healthy and  participate in learning and training activities. The work  performance of 10 of the Thao Nguyen Regiment's 12 troop feeding  units has been rated as good. As an example, one can cite the  troop feeding units of the 4th and 5th Battalions and the  regimental command.    Also on this occasion, Gen. Doan Khue called on a number of  mothers of fallen combatants who live near the group's  bivouacking area. He visited Mrs. Duong Thi Nga and her family.  Two of Mrs. Nga's sons have been listed as fallen combatants.  Besides the care provided by the local party committee and  administration, Mrs. Nga and other mothers of fallen combatants  here are also assisted by the cadres and soldiers of Group B-24.  Gen. Doan Khue also visited Mrs. Nguyen Thi Vung and her  family. Mrs. Vung's three sons and one son-in-law have been  listed as fallen combatants. Mother Vung is 90 years old.  During the course of the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle,  Mother Vung actively motivated her children to set out and fight  the enemy. Now, as in the past, the mothers of fallen  combatants always motivate the soldiers to undergo training and  stand ready for combat.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading condom maker claims technical advance LONDON International Group, the health products and toiletries company which is the world leader in branded condoms, yesterday said it had developed a polyurethane material which represented an advance in condom technology. LIG said the material, trademarked Duron, had advantages over latex - normally used to make condoms - which made it more acceptable to users. The group's shares closed up 12p to 213p. It claims 23 per cent of the world's branded condom market, with names such as Durex in the UK, Ramses and Sheik in North America, Hatu in Italy and London in Germany. Dr Bill Potter, the group's scientific affairs director, said Duron was twice as strong as latex and could therefore be made much thinner, giving greater sensitivity. It was also, transparent, odourless, and hypoallergenic  -less likely to cause allergic reactions than latex - and not damaged by oil-based lubricants. It has all the attributes of latex in terms of reliability and effectiveness against pregnancy and disease, including Aids, he said. Dr Potter said that in tests, Duron had proved it could be an effective barrier to viruses much smaller than HIV, the Aids virus. Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive of LIG, said the group had spent Pounds 10m during the past five years developing the product, including building a pilot plant at its Cambridge research facility. This would produce condoms for test marketing, which would start in the US next year and be extended to other countries depending on regulatory approvals. The material has already won US Food and Drug Administration clearance, and key parts of the manufacturing process have been patented. Mr Clive Kitchener, LIG director of marketing, said the condoms would sell at a substantial price premium to latex ones, but market research showed people would pay more for a better product. He said the group still expected growth in the latex condom market and that condoms made from Duron would expand the market, attracting new users. Mr Butterworth said the group would build one or more full-scale production units once results from test marketing were clearer.</p>

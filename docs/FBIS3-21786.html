Miroslaw W., who was a chauffeur at the  Zairean Embassy in Poland for 14 years, was taken into custody  in July 1993 on the Polish-German border. The 4.7 kg of heroin  was found in a suitcase supposedly covered by diplomatic  immunity, and which was to go to Brussels. The drugs are  estimated to have a street value of roughly 3 million German  marks. Miroslaw W. testified that he was totally unaware of the  contents of the suitcase, and was transporting it on orders from  Boekwa Lokolo Okombe, councillor at the Zairean Embassy in  Warsaw. The German prosecutors are currently preparing an  international arrest warrant for the Zairean diplomat.

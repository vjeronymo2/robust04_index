			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan and Russia agreed  Friday [27 May] to expedite scientific cooperation in research  and development of 69 projects that cover biotechnology, new  material manufacturing and 13 other fields, Japanese officials  said.    The agreement came at the second meeting in Tokyo of a  Russo-Japanese committee which is designed to step up  cooperation in science and technology, the officials said.    The panel was set up following the 1991 breakup of the  Soviet  Union in order to push joint research with Russian scientists  who have excellent records of achievements in basic scientific  research.    The projects include one aimed at developing techniques to  forecast earthquakes based on satellite observations of the  earth.</p>

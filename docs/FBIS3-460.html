			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 7 March on SAPA PR Wire </F> Service]    [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] remains firmly  committed to a free and fair elections campaign, where all  parties will have access to all voters. During the last few  weeks the ANC has been criticised for the actions of people who  claim ANC membership. Our opponents can rest assured that we  will do everything in our power to protect their right to  campaign. We ourselves are the victims of large scale  intolerance and in many parts of South Africa we are not able to  campaign.    We have fought long and hard for the right to vote and all  of  us who are serious about democracy must protect each other's  rights in the electoral process. But we must caution other  parties to make adequate security arrangements when they enter  areas where many voters are hostile to them. We take very  stringent precautions when our leaders speak in right wing or  hostile areas. Each party has a responsibility to work closely  with the SAP [South African Police] and the peace committees and  must provide its own marshals to protect its leaders and  supporters.    Our opponents can expect us to control our members, but we  cannot provide protection against the millions of South Africans  who were deeply wronged by apartheid and who may express their  anger in irresponsible ways. We will however do our best reach  every ANC supporter and to especially target supporters who have  in any way interfered with the freedom of other parties.    Our message to our members is simple: We will not tolerate  any intimidation threats or violence against our opponents. ANC  members who break electoral code of conduct will be disciplined  by our structures as well as face prosecution for crimes under  the electoral act. We have nothing to gain from violence and  intimidation. If you do not like a party or its policies, stay  away from their meetings and activities. Our task is to take  our message to the voters and to persuade them that the ANC is  the best party to run this country.    We have been accused of paying lip service to political  tolerance. To ensure tolerance amongst our members the ANC has  embarked upon the following: Our elections campaign manual  forbids any disruption of political meetings. We have trained  monitors for every branch to deal with breaches of the electoral  code of conduct. A letter from the president of the ANC,  Comrade Nelson Mandela, has been sent to every branch, region  and office-bearers. A poster with an accessible version of the  electoral code of conduct for political parties has been  dispatched to all regions and branches throughout the country.  During the week of the 13 March, the ANC is dispatching senior  ANC and ANC Youth League leaders to all ANC regions to ensure  that the message of tolerance reaches out to all our members and  supporters.    The ANC believes that it has already been partially  successful and would like to point out that the National Party  and the DP [Democratic Party] have had many peaceful visits to  areas where the ANC has undisputed majority support.    The fact that disruptions have been few and peaceful has  been  due to the very hard and consistent work on the part of our  structures. In many areas ANC office bearers have worked hard to  diffuse potentially explosive situations.    The divisions in our country are very great, anger and  distrust run very deep. Political campaigning in this country  has always been robust. However we cannot afford to disrupt  this fragile process towards democracy, by adopting campaigning  strategies that increase polarisation.    The ANC will do our utmost to keep the campaign clean and to  use it to overcome the bitterness of the past. We appeal to all  other parties to work just as hard at achieving real political  tolerance.</p>

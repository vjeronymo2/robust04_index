			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Life after the revolution: America It is a strange sensation. I take a short break from writing this column and return to find the Washington political landscape altered beyond recognition. I used to write almost apologetically about the late Ludwig von Mises, the Austrian proponent of entrepreneurial capitalism. Hardly anyone, I assumed, would have heard of him. Now I discover that Mises - who regarded Milton Friedman as a wimp - is fast becoming a mainstream author. He is one of the intellectual heroes of Dick Armey, the Texan libertarian who takes over as majority leader in the House of Representatives next month. To grasp what this means, remember that Armey replaces Dick Gephardt, a 'liberal' Democrat so far behind the times that he led the abortive congressional campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is a shift from a politician who distrusted markets to one who is passionate about them. Yet Armey's elevation is receiving relatively little attention because Washington's political elite is transfixed by his boss, Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich. It is impossible to conceive of a greater contrast than that between Gingrich, a conservative firebrand who fizzes with ideas, and Tom Foley, his decent but deadly dull, predecessor. The Senate is admittedly undergoing less of an ideological upheaval, although the intellectual space separating Bob Dole from former majority leader George Mitchell is not inconsiderable. Dole in any case will be dragged to the right by Trent Lott of Mississippi, his new deputy and an ideological soulmate of Gingrich and Armey. On balance, this unexpected shift of political power will be good for America. It is not healthy in a democracy for one party to monopolise any of the levers of power. After 40 years in the cold, House Republicans deserve a chance to prove themselves. So far they are doing remarkably well. Gingrich is managing a difficult transition more adroitly than have most former presidents. He is biting the bullet on procedural reform by rationalising the labyrinthine House committee structure, cutting staff, liberalising debate rules and curbing the powers of committee chairmen. Political analysts sympathetic to the Democratic cause, such as Thomas Mann at the Brookings Institution, ruefully concede that such valuable reforms would never have occurred under Foley and Co. If nothing else, US democracy looks set to function more efficiently. Gingrich's policy goals are more controversial. In the media he is frequently portrayed as a batty reactionary, hell-bent on recreating Dickensian orphanages and other 19th century horrors. Having read his manifesto, the 'Contract with America', I find most of the assessments puzzlingly negative. Without agreeing with everything Gingrich says, he strikes me as having a better sense of the direction the US needs to take than either the Clinton White House or the Democratic Party at large. Unlike most politicians he is not a prisoner of the policy assumptions of past decades. Contrary to the knee-jerk reaction of Keynesians, Republicans are not foolish to favour a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. In a myopic political system beholden to special interest groups, there is an overwhelming temptation to finance current spending by borrowing from future generations. A constitutional prohibition may be the only plausible long-run solution; unlike past expedients, it would be a roadblock that Congress itself could not remove at will. Critics who complain that Gingrich has not specified a route to fiscal balance miss the point: once the destination is unavoidable, a way will be found. Much else in the reviled contract makes sense. Is it backward-looking to want to stimulate entrepreneurship by reducing capital gains tax rates toward international norms? Is it daft to want to reform a chronically inefficient legal system and hence reduce the economic burden imposed by crushing litigation costs? Is it, indeed, so very foolish to argue that the child of a 15-year-old crack addict might be better off in a well-run institution? Gingrich's rhetoric is often astringent, but the themes that preoccupy him - personal responsibility, economic opportunity and so forth - do not strike me (or, apparently, the American voters) as anachronistic. In any case, there are no dictators in US politics. Gingrich will have to compromise if he is to get legislation through the more moderate Senate and avoid the veto of an enfeebled president. The value of the contract is as a spur to public debate. Washington is now abuzz with ideas. There is, for example, a spirited debate under way about the advantages of replacing income tax with a progressive tax on consumed income - what is known in the UK as an 'expenditure tax'. No such idea would ever have emerged from the Clinton White House, yet it has a powerful logic in a country with a chronically low national savings rate. And, thanks to the congressional Republicans, there is serious talk of transferring responsibility for many social functions from Washington to the states. This seems eminently sensible: if nobody really knows how to reform welfare, why impose a single blueprint on the whole nation? Why not try several different policies? Again, the Clinton administration ought to be sympathetic: budget director Alice Rivlin proposed just such a devolution of power to states in her 1992 book, Reviving the American Dream. Gingrich's November revolution has turned Washington upside down. In every sphere the unthinkable is becoming thinkable. The old politically-correct reading lists are waste paper. Keynes is out; Mises is in. It is a great new world.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A-BOMB TRIGGERS FOR IRAQ SEIZED IN LONDON;  </P> <P> NUCLEAR WEAPONS: A U.S.-BRITISH STING OPERATION INTERCEPTS 40 DEVICES BEING  SMUGGLED FROM CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> U.S. and British agents in London seized 40 Iraq-bound nuclear bomb triggers  that had been smuggled out of Southern California, officials said Wednesday.  Six people, including two Iraqi nationals, were arrested.  </P> <P> The raid on a cargo hangar at Heathrow Airport climaxed an extraordinary  international sting operation that began in San Diego 18 months ago,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "It was a sting all the way," said one State Department source.  </P> <P> "We've stopped some very serious business from going forward," said U.S.  Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett.  </P> <P> Neither Hallett nor other American or British officials would discuss the  operation in any detail. It was not clear if the triggers were sought by the  Iraqi government or if that nation has developed nuclear weapons capability.  Nor did officials explain what had prompted the investigation.  </P> <P> At the White House, President Bush said in a statement that the arrests  underscored his "deep concern about the issue of nuclear proliferation in the  Middle East."  </P> <P> The President added: "We again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise special  restraint in providing materials related to the development of nuclear,  chemical and biological weapons and intermediate-range missiles in the volatile  area.  </P> <P> "Furthermore, we urge all states in the area to adhere to the non-proliferation  treaty. Iraq is a signatory of that treaty. Iraqi officials are well aware of  our views on nuclear proliferation, which we have made clear on several  occasions."  </P> <P> A sealed indictment in the case has been returned in federal court in San Diego  and may be unsealed today, sources said.  </P> <P> According to an NBC News report, CSI Technologies Inc. of San Marcos, near San  Diego, alerted officials to an attempt by two Iraqis to buy the sophisticated  electronic devices used to trigger nuclear weapons. CSI executives could not be  reached Wednesday for comment.  </P> <P> A second U.S. firm, EG&amp;G of Wellesley, Mass., said late Wednesday that it,  too, had been cooperating with authorities.  </P> <P> EG&amp;G's president, Donald M. Kerr, said in a statement that the firm had  provided customs agents with more than 40 inoperable trigger devices, known as  krytrons, apparently for use as decoys in the sting.  </P> <P> EG&amp;G, which has a sales office in San Diego, is the only domestic  manufacturer of the devices, which are strictly controlled by the U.S.  government. Such devices generally are acquired at advanced stages in the  production of nuclear weapons, nuclear experts said.  </P> <P> EG&amp;G is a major contractor for the Department of Energy, which is  responsible for producing nuclear weapons for the nation's arsenal. EG&amp;G  also runs the department's Nevada Test Site and its facilities at Rocky Flats  in Colorado, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls and the  Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.  </P> <P> Sources said that a crate containing the EG&amp;G trigger devices was shipped  to London earlier this month aboard a TWA plane out of Los Angeles  International Airport. At Heathrow, the crate was stored at a TWA cargo depot  for several days. Authorities moved in as the container was about to be loaded  onto an Iraqi Airways flight bound for Baghdad, sources said.  </P> <P> In a statement, Britain's Customs and Excise Department named three of those  arrested as Ali Daghir, 49, a company director with dual Iraqi and British  nationality; Lebanese engineer Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37; and export executive  Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a Frenchwoman married to a Briton. The other  three people arrested were not identified either by British or U.S. officials.  </P> <P> NBC News identified Daghir as the main suspect and said he allegedly posed in  London as an importer of frozen french fries from the United States.  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported from London that British authorities said they  had also arrested Iraqi national Omar Latif, who was immediately served with a  deportation order, and a Cypriot with a British passport who was released after  questioning. The Home Office said Latif was being deported because of  "attempted breaches of legislation governing the export of strategic goods from  the United Kingdom." The Iraqi ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office  and informed of the expulsion order.  </P> <P> It was unclear if Daghir or Latif had any ties to the Iraqi government.  </P> <P> "We are deferring (on the release of any details) to the British government at  their request, due to the extreme sensitivity to Iraq," said U.S. Customs  spokesman Dennis Shimkoski.  </P> <P> He was referring to the execution in Baghdad two weeks ago of Farzad Bazoft, a  British-based journalist convicted of espionage.  </P> <P> The President's concerns were echoed by experts in nuclear proliferation.  </P> <P> "This just points out the shortcomings in the international system, which isn't  going to catch them every time," said Deborah Holland, issues director for the  Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based organization that studies  terrorism and nuclear proliferation.  </P> <P> Gary Milhollin, director of the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear  Arms Control, said the incident has significant implications.  </P> <P> "The first thing it means is that a country which has joined the  non-proliferation treaty (Iraq) has violated it by trying to make the bomb,"  Milhollin said. "The device they were trying to import secretly obviously was  intended to make a nuclear weapon. So they have been caught red-handed in  violation of this treaty."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Douglas Frantz, David Lauter and Robin Wright in Washington  and Alan Abrahamson in San Diego contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRAQI SMUGGLING PLOT ABORTED  </P> <P> USA:  </P> <P> Nuclear weapon triggers go from California to New York to Britain.  </P> <P> Heathrow Airport:  </P> <P> Triggers found in cargo shed. Several suspects arrested.  </P> <P> Baghdad:  </P> <P> In 1981 Israel destroyed nuclear power station which it alleged would produce  nuclear weapons.  </P></p>

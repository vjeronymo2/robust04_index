			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colin King] </F>   [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 28 Jan, CANA -- Guyana has  received enough commitments of finance from bilateral and  multilateral donors to cover projected financing gaps for  1994-96, the World Bank said here Friday.    New commitments of US320 million dollars, about US70 million  dollars in escess of earlier expectations, were received from  representatives of donors meeting here in a special sub-group  gathering on Guyana under the Caribbean Group for Co-operation  in Economic Development (CGCED).    The World Bank in a statement coming out of the consultation  said Guyana's prospects for sustained development are  "promising" but reiterated a theme of the meeting -- the need  for deeper reform, a clear developmnt agenda, and consistent  signals to the private sector.    "Good result," conference chairman Yoshiaki Abe of the World  Bank summarised for reporters Friday at the end of the two-day  meeting. An effusive Guyana Finance Minister Asgar Ally said the  objectives of the meeting had been achieved.    World Bank officials declined to provide detailed breakdowns  of the commitments received but among them was US20 million  dollars from the Caribbean Development Bank, in addition to US35  million committed last year, well-placed sources told CANA.    The United States and Britain also signed agreements here  Friday extending further assistance to Guyana.    The U.S. package, a PL480 commodity agreement, covers three  years and provides US6 million dollars for 1994, while the  British assistance under the Overseas Development Administration  is for five million pounds sterling over three years to the  public sector reform programme.    The commitments from the various donors are intended to fill  the gap remaining in Guyana's projected US500 million dollars  financing requirements in the 1994-96 period after accounting  for international trade, transfers, and already committed  inflows.    During the meeting here, attended by 100 representatives of  27 countries and international organisations and addressed for  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the invitation of the  Guyana Government, the government presented its economic  policies and programmes for consideration.    "I think that basically what we have set out to achieve we  have achieved.... One of the objectives of this conference was  to close the financing gap in 1994 and that gap has been closed.  We have also had commitments beyond 1994," Ally told reporters.    The meeting, the first such to be hosted by the country  making the pitch to the financing community, was billed as an  important milepost along the country's economic recovery  programme, started in 1988.    "The meeting recognised the significant progress achieved  since the country embarked on its economic recovery programme in  1988. The donors, however also acknowledged the huge constraints  Guyana faces in view of the high external debt, the dilapidated  economic and social infrastructure and pervasive poverty," the  Bank said.    "Guyana's prospects for further sustained growth and poverty  alleviation are promising.    "To achieve them will require a deepening of the reform  programme, the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework,  the elaboration of a clear development agenda, and consistent  signals to the private sector," the Bank added.    Ally said the Guyana presentations during the meeting laid  the basis for "the donors to better understand the problems of  Guyana."    "I come out of that meeting very reassured that we have  friends overseas, both among the (international financial  institutions) and among the donor countries. Guyana is really  lucky to be in a position where it has so many firends that are  prepared to help us at a time when the availability of aid and  soft loans is drying up.    "I think that for Guyana to be able to come out with this  kind of success is indeed remarkable to the country and to the  people and to the government.    "The conference has been a success and the foundations are  now being laid for sustaining growth and to sustain democracy."</p>

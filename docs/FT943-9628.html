			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: A tribute to Glock - Promenade concert The Proms paid tribute to Sir William Glock on Sunday, as well they might. During his reign as Controller of Music at the BBC (1959-1972) he effected a revolution in British music, which badly needed one. This double-length programme echoed perfectly his own soigne tastes: passionate respect for the Viennese classics and the early modernists (Ravel, Stravinsky), a great - and back then, unfamiliar - interest in the roots of Western music before Bach, fastidious attention to what was new. Those of us who were around at the time will not forget the excitement of the 'Invitation Concerts', which spotlit serial and post-serial music for the first time on the BBC. Such continental-influenced stuff had been granted only minimal air-time before. Only a few Londoners who attended coterie concerts were (imperfectly) aware of the most potent musical developments elsewhere. With Glock, the Third Programme suddenly became for many of us our main entree to serious new music, both by foreigners and by adventurous young Brits: Maxwell Davies, Goehr, Birtwistle - even adventurous older Brits (Lutyens, Maconchy), and also an exiled Spaniard (Roberto Gerhard, once a Schoenberg pupil) - so long as they met Glock's severe standards for radically new musical thought. There is probably some truth in recent charges that Glock was hoity-toity about 'contemporary' British music in the post-Elgar, post-Bliss, post-Walton tradition; but in the late 1950s and the '60s, that vein had no semblance of vitality. Lutyens was represented here by the second performance (only now]) of a BBC commission from Glock's days, The Tears of Night for counter-tenor (James Bowman), soprano trio and ensemble: nocturnal, grave, hieratic, curiously affecting. I remember Gerhard's 1960 sextet Libra from some performances that made far more vivid sense of it than this Prom account, efficient but unimaginative under Martyn Brabbins: where were the abrupt surprises, the dangerous glee, the uncanny suspension at the end when the mock-primitive flute arrives? We missed those. But the Nash Ensemble also figured as accompanists to Skaila Kanga's artful harp in Ravel's Introduction &amp; Allegro (it is time to admit that this is an imperishable, superbly constructed work, not just a charming confection); and the New London Consort remembered the late David Munrow's style in sets of lively Renaissance dances. Quite rightly the concert included a post-Glock piece, George Benjamin's recent Sudden Time. It meets every Glock criterion - articulate thought, professionalism, a refusal of any cosy routine - and positively over-fulfills its brief. As conducted by the composer with his customary precision, its friendly, consonant, unexpected sounds both gave pleasure and promised further depths to fathom. At the beginning and the end we had grander stuff. Colin Davis led an irresistible Haydn Symphony no. 99 and Mozart's B-flat Piano Concerto K. 450 with Imogen Cooper. I confess to finding her by turns sentimental (downright smoochy with the second subject of the first Allegro) and elsewhere too muscularly forthright, but I may be stupid; certainly she is a thoughtful artist, perhaps too self-consciously self-effacing. The best things in the concert came from Pierre Boulez. In Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms he took the first movement far above the composer's tempo, which lost the sense of a measured introduction but gained the effect of a seamless prelude to the central double Fugue - which he read as prescribed, and transparently; the Finale too, which rose to its awesome, timeless rewards in the long coda. Then his own Cummings ist der Dichter (with the BBC Singers and electronic enhancement) came to exact, volatile life, as never before in my experience. It postdated Glock, I think, but it served as an ideal model for what he has treasured most: clarity, economy and calculated originality - a joy to hear.</p>

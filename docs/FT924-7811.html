			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Siemens, Skoda talks suspended JOINT venture talks between Siemens and Skoda Pilsen, the biggest engineering group in Czechoslovakia, were suspended in mid-session yesterday after Skoda's new chief pressed new demands which went 'far beyond' the terms discussed so far, the German electro-engineering group said. No date was set for resumption of negotiations through which Siemens hopes to take majority stakes in Skoda's transport and power plant businesses. Siemens said it was still prepared to go ahead with both deals, but stressed the contracts must be signed by the end of this month 'if the joint ventures were to get off to a successful start'. It gave no details of Skoda's fresh demands. Negotiations, which have been going on since the turn of the year, developed into a game of cat and mouse earlier this month when Mr Lubomir Soudek, backed by two Czech banks, bought a 38 per cent stake in Skoda. Mr Soudek was appointed chief executive and immediately declared Skoda should retain a majority stake in the locomotive-making business. He said he was considering the second deal under which KWU, the Siemens power plant subsidiary, was to buy two-thirds of Skoda-Energo. Siemens, which wants both deals signed quickly and simultaneously, has said that an early settlement will allow it to pass on to Skoda of a share in a DM56m (Dollars 35m) rolling stock contract for Singapore.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Hopes rise of South African breakthrough HOPES of a breakthrough in South Africa's political stalemate rose yesterday with the news that government and African National Congress (ANC) officials held talks brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance, the visiting US envoy. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, said the two sides had met to discuss the release of remaining political prisoners, one of the central conditions for the resumption of constitutional talks. The news came as Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, announced that the government had 'no objection to the presence of impartial and objective observers' from the United Nations as monitors of next week's two-day general strike. About 10 UN officials would observe the demonstrations. They are scheduled to leave for South Africa today and remain for two weeks. The government move, supporting a proposal made earlier by Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, will help ease the tension likely to surround a week of industrial action intended to force the speedy transition to a majority rule government. Mr Ramaphosa said Mr Vance, who leaves Johannesburg today at the end of his 10-day fact finding visit, had 'facilitated contact between the ANC and the government to ensure the release of all remaining political prisoners'. Mr Botha led the government delegation at Tuesday's meeting; Mr Thabo Mbeki, director of international affairs, led the ANC team. It is the first official meeting since the ANC pulled out of all negotiations after the Boipatong massacre on June 17. More than 400 political prisoners were still being held in South Africa and the homeland territories, Mr Ramaphosa said. 'A further meeting is scheduled for the near future,' he said, adding that the ANC expected the prisoners to be released before Mr Vance's departure this evening. Mr Vance, who met President FW de Klerk in Pretoria yesterday for the second time, said afterwards that he hoped to report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, next week. Mr Vance said he believed existing structures could be used to help solve the country's problems, a reference to last year's national peace accord signed by all leading parties and to the Goldstone Judicial Commission investigating political violence. Mr Ramaphosa said a 'hitch' had arisen because of the non-arrival of a 'communication' from Mr Kobie Coetsee, the justice minister. But he understood that Mr Vance had raised the problem at his meeting yesterday with Mr de Klerk. 'We have reason to believe that he will stress the seriousness of this matter with the state president . . . a quick resolution to this problem of political prisoners is one of those steps that the government needs to take,' Mr Ramaphosa said.</p>

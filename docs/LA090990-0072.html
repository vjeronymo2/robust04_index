			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR, AUTHOR  </P> <P> In Kari Granville's article "A Couple of Cops, With a Twist" (Sept. 2),  producer Rob Cohen and director John Badham found this wonderful screenplay,  "The Hard Way." And actor Michael J. Fox loved the unique story and actor James  Woods thought the idea was fabulous, and throughout the article we learned all  about Rob's and John's and Michael's and James' feelings and thoughts about  this fantastic screenplay.  </P> <P> Only one thing was left out of the article: Never once did anyone mention the  name of the person who wrote this wonderful, fabulous, unique screenplay.  </P> <P> I wonder what would happen if, suddenly, by some magic, the words on the script  disappeared and Rob and John and Michael and James were left holding 120 blank  pages. Would they be able to make their wonderful movie or would they be just  sitting there quietly, with their fingers up their you-know-what?  </P> <P> HOWARD ALBRECHT  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P> <P>  A spokesman for the Badham/Cohen Group said that several people worked on the  script and that the screenwriting credit has not been determined yet.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: FT reports service THE Financial Times has launched a new, free service for private investors who would like to receive the annual reports of listed companies, writes Philip Coggan. All that you need to do is ring 081-643-7181 and quote a code which is listed at the end of the London Share Service listings in the FT. This code will be changed every week. Then name the company concerned and give your name and address. The report will be sent to you on the next working day. The service is open to all readers, whether in the UK or overseas. The lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm on weekdays and there is an answering service at other times. For today only, the lines are open between 9 am and 4pm. At present 130 listed companies have agreed to join the service. The companies concerned are identified with an ace-of-clubs symbol in the share listings pages. Companies which have joined include Bank of Scotland, Hanson, National Power, Smithkline Beecham and Unilever. Only one annual report per company can be sent to each individual, but you may order the reports of several different companies.</p>

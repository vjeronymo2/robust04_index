			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: CS First Boston fills top spot in senior reshuffle CS FIRST BOSTON, the global investment banking group, has appointed Mr Allen Wheat to the post of president and chief operating officer vacated by Mr Archibald Cox. Mr Cox resigned after clashing with management over compensation levels for the firm's investment bankers. Mr Wheat's appointment to the top job at CSFB was accompanied by several other management changes, and coincided with a decision to unify the firm's three geographic units - First Boston in New York, Credit Suisse-First Boston in Europe, and CS First Boston Pacific in Asia - under the single name of CS First Boston. Mr Wheat, who will handle the day-to-day running of the firm and report to Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of CSFB, scotched speculation among some industry analysts that his appointment meant CSFB was shifting the emphasis of its business away from investment banking and towards trading in the capital markets. This was based on Mr Wheat's recent handling of the firm's highly-profitable derivatives unit. Mr Wheat and Mr Hennessy said yesterday CSFB would continue to devote equal energy to capital markets, underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. The unification of the group under a single name, meanwhile, was not unexpected. It comes three months after CSFB reorganised its businesses along product, rather than geographic, lines. That move marked an acceptance by senior executives and CSFB's parent, the Swiss financial group CS Holding, that business rivalries and personality clashes between the New York, London and Tokyo units had doomed the group's attempt to build a unique global investment banking franchise. Tensions between the three units had contributed to the departure of Mr Wheat's predecessor. Mr Cox resigned in July after a string of top New York investment bankers left the firm over a row about compensation. The departed bankers were unhappy that their annual bonuses last year were low because of the poor performance of CSFB's European and Asian operations. Mr Wheat said the firm's businesses in New York, London and Tokyo had all performed strongly so far this year. If the momentum was sustained, the improvement in earnings would be reflected in 1993 staff bonuses, he said. Mr David Mulford, co-head of worldwide investment banking, and Mr Robert Diamond, head of fixed income and foreign exchange, were appointed vice-chairmen of CSFB.</p>

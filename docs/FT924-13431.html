			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (17): Doubts over the 'Holy Grail' - Integrated services digital network / ISDN THE Integrated Services Digital Network was once seen as the holy grail of business telecommunications, but now it looks as if it may become just one of a number of possible solutions. Digitisation of the old analogue telephone system will provide some important benefits, but the ISDN superstructure of digital network services may not become all-pervasive. Thus the hopes of the European Commission, the telephone companies and some governments may therefore be disappointed and the predictions of many industry analysts overturned. ISDN was conceived 20 years ago by the International Consultative Committee of Telegraph and Telephone (CCITT) as an all-embracing system for public communications. But it proved such an enormous task that it was to some extent overtaken by events, notably the spread of private networks. ISDN is now said to be available to 90 per cent of UK businesses in most towns and cities. It offers clearer lines, faster connections, greater reliability and lower costs for calls. It is up to six times faster than the old technology, with data calls being made at 64K bits per second. File transfer is one of the principal applications. An ISDN link can be set up in a second and a half, whereas a modem link might take 15 seconds. A file which takes a minute to send by modem could be sent by ISDN in only 15 seconds. Also, a modem might need to dial several times to get a connection, whereas an ISDN call should connect first time. ISDN is therefore eroding the sales of modems, the analogue devices used to translate and send information between computers across the phone lines. But Mr Mark Orchart, marketing manager for Cray Communications (formerly Dowty Information Systems) says that sales of modems to smaller companies are holding up well because ISDN remains largely a club for large corporations. BT's business development marketing manager, Mr Tony Corris says that around 1,200 UK companies were using its ISDN services in June. These were mainly large companies and some small firms with a publishing operation which involves a need to send a lot of data and colour graphics to a tight timetable. But Mr Corris acknowledges that medium-sized companies on the whole have not so far taken up these services. There are several reasons why ISDN has not spread as quickly as forecast. Mr Keith Mallinson, principal analyst with market researchers Yankee Group Europe, suggests there is an underlying conflict of interest between the suppliers and the users. The service is most appealing to an organisation such as a bank with many branches around the country or a retailer which needs to poll its stores during the night to pick up the previous day's transaction data. But it is precisely these services to remote areas, he points out, which are least profitable for the suppliers. Also, the adoption of ISDN by users can damage the telephone company's income from other sources, such as leased lines. Both BT and Mercury are offering attractive tariffs for ISDN compared to those for the old analogue system. But the initial cost of equipment to connect to ISDN is still too high, there are cheaper alternative methods of communication, and there are still no international standards. A meeting this month of the North American ISDN Users Forum could produce an international standard for the application program interface, which could give an important stimulus to the market. Mercury's entry level has now been lowered to only 15 lines, which may bring the system within the reach of more small and medium-sized users. They could benefit from ISDN because they have been unable to afford to set up their own private networks. All European Community countries are obliged to introduce ISDN, but the speed at which they are doing so is related to the status of the telephone company in each country and its national political position. Those in regulated environments, which means most of Europe's telephone companies, may have an incentive to invest heavily in ISDN and pass as much as possible of the massive cost on to customers. In the process, they acquire a strategic asset which may help them against new competitors in the event of deregulation. Those working in a more commercial environment may be less keen on incurring the cost of developing ISDN. Thus, the telephone companies in France and Germany are able to force the pace more than BT and the growth of ISDN in those countries in the past year has been impressive. In the US, growth has been patchy but a big promotional exercise next month should bring a new wave of take-up during next year. There is a rising demand for international ISDN connections. Mr Luke Broome, manager of business telephony for Mercury, says this demand comes mainly from large companies looking for cheaper and more flexible ways of video-conferencing. BT has ISDN routes to 20 countries now and Mercury has recently launched its first ISDN routes to the US and Hongkong. Virtually all the business centres worldwide will be accessible within the next year. These international routes will also be used for backing up private business networks, for faster, improved-quality faxes and for higher quality voice transmission for broadcasters. It is arguable that expectations of the growth rate of ISDN were set too high from the start, that it will fulfil its promise but over a longer period. Even in the more advanced US market, ISDN only began to find applications in 1990, led by a group of the largest companies. The spread of new applications, especially those in multimedia (combined audio, video and data), such as video-conferencing and the videophone, could transform the industry in the next few years. ISDN may be, after all, still just waiting for these things to happen.</p>

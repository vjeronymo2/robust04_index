			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Major's moment of truth John Major's decision to bring the Maastricht treaty back to parliament within the next few months means that he knows the moment of truth cannot be postponed any longer. In the end there could be no alternative to a decisive trial of strength between the prime minister and the Euro-rebels, and sooner must be better than later, because the mere passage of time could only make his position weaker still. He has no option but to put the question to the test, because failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty would mean the ruin of his political credibility at home, and the ruin of Britain's credibility in the Community. Until last Thursday procrastination and evasion might have seemed looked like a safer policy; but in reality it would just have been a slower and more insidious road to the same sort of ruin. The consequence would be that the UK would be marginalised when the other member states then started to discuss between themselves - as they undoubtedly would - alternative arrangements. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand have recently stressed their continued commitment to the existing 12-nation Community. No doubt that is what they would prefer; but if the Maastricht treaty were to fall in Britain, there is no chance that the other member states would sit with their hands folded, waiting for something to turn up. Mr Major has now set himself a shorter deadline, because he knows the patience of Paris and Bonn is strictly finite; and that is because President Mitterrand has very little usable time left. The Elysee Palace claims that his prostate cancer is not dangerous; but he is surely having treatment for it, and cancer treatment is always exhausting, especially for a man of 75. More important, Mr Mitterrand is running out of political road. The general elections next March are likely to see bring a very heavy defeat for the president's Socialist party and a sweeping conservative victory. In the normal course of events, this probably means a conservative government led by the Gaullists; but while the Gaullist leadership campaigned in favour of Maastricht, a large majority of its followers voted against. There are some advance murmurings that the conservatives' victory could be so large that they might be able to force the president out of office. Either way the president's European policy will be in jeopardy. If he wants to keep the Maastricht treaty on the rails, or look for some alternative, he needs to know how things stand very soon. Mr Major's domestic pretext for going into battle for the Maastricht treaty is that he believes he will be able to claim important improvements in the way the treaty will operate. Among other things, he expects to get a piece of paper agreed at the Birmingham summit which will put strict limits on gratuitous interference by the Brussels institutions. Specifically, this should clarify and strengthen the principle of 'subsidiarity', by which the Community should not intervene in matters which can be better handled in the member states. The problem with this so-called 'Birmingham declaration' is not just that it is bound to be juridically ambiguous, but that it is transparently intended to deceive. Britain and others are trying to blame the Commission for the current wave of popular anti-Community sentiment, which surfaced in the French referendum. But to pretend that the Commission has grabbed power from the member states to satisfy the overweening centralist ambitions of Jacques Delors is deliberate and shameless misrepresentation. The Commission does not deserve to be idealised. It is no doubt bureaucratic, self-satisfied and incompetent; but it is no more bureaucratic, self-satisfied and incompetent than the British Treasury, or indeed any Whitehall department. The fundamental point is that the Commission has no powers except those given by the member states; and the attempt to make it a general scapegoat for the present malaise is grotesque. If the government serves up this kind of deception as its primary life-line to ratification, it is obviously in deep psychological trouble. Last Thursday Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, gave a speech which was meant to be a strong defence of the Maastricht treaty. Unfortunately, it showed that the government does not really like any part of the treaty; not European monetary union, nor a common foreign policy, nor powers for the European Parliament, nor the social charter, nor immigration and justice - nothing. Instead, Mr Hurd claimed that the treaty would make it easier to enlarge the Community, to conclude the Uruguay Round, implement the single market and reform the agricultural policy. Alas, all these fall-back claims are simply untrue. If the Hurd speech gives a true picture of what the government collectively thinks about Maastricht, then it almost certainly cannot push the treaty through the House of Commons. It is one thing to make an appointment with fate. It is quite another to muster the spiritual intensity to win over the waverers and cow the rebels. This government does not like the treaty which it described a bare 10 months ago as a triumph for Britain, and it shows.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- The head of France's  far-right National Front party, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on Wednesday  [16 March] criticized the trial of wartime Nazi collaborator  Paul Touvier as "unnecessary" and his alleged crime "a detail of  the past."    Touvier, whose trial starts Thursday in Versailles, west of  Paris, will be the first French national to be tried for crimes  against humanity. He is accused of ordering the reprisal  execution of seven Jewish hostages on June 29, 1944 when he was  intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia in the eastern  city of Lyon.    "It strikes me as sad that 50 years after the war we still  cannot pardon our former German adversary and that we are trying  to find in an 80-year-old man the responsibility that might  really belong to the Vichy regime, but especially also to the  governments that prepared the build-up to the war and that lost  the war," he said on French radio. (Touvier is 79).    "France has enough other problems than to dig up details of  its past," Le Pen said.    Le Pen, known for his anti-Semitism, once described Hitler's  "final solution" -- the mass extermination of Jews -- as "a  point of detail of history."    The Touvier case will throw the spotlight on wartime French  collaboration with the Germans -- still a sensitive subject in  France -- and also raise questions about the role of Roman  Catholic clergy who sheltered and funded Touvier for some 45  years.</p>

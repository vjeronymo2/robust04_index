It  urged them to make sacrifices for the honor of Iraqis and for  Kurdistan to regain its freedom, joy, and national allegiance.    In a statement issued by the party's political bureau on the  24th anniversary of the 11 March Statement of 1970 and the 20th  anniversary of issuing the autonomy law in 1974, the party said  the evil criminals -- the brokers of world politics -- are not  satisfied with the war of annihilation they waged against our  Kurdish people. Thus, they have gone a step further by stealing  the property of the Kurdish masses, smuggling this property to  Iran, and selling it in their own interest. Those evil  criminals are not satisfied with undermining Kurdish national  rights and sabotaging the autonomy institutions. Thus, they  have embarked on a new mockery to split in half power centers,  institutions, and interests.    The party hailed the wise leadership of President Saddam  Husayn, the hero of liberation and engineer of autonomy. It  praised President Saddam Husayn's courageous stand in the face  of all the vile plots being hatched against our Iraqi people.</p>

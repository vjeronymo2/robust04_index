			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Need a reason to smile?  </P> <P> Just think: No more political commercials!  </P> <P> Election-night glamour was in particularly short supply at the Democrats' local  command base, the Biltmore Hotel.  </P> <P> The highest-ranking candidate to visit, attorney general hopeful Arlo Smith,  left at 8 p.m. Hollywood types were also scarce, though Smith was collared in  the lobby by a rap singer who crooned the following ditty:  </P> <P> The A to the R to the L to the O.  </P> <P>  I went to the polls and voted like so.  </P> <P>  The man on the ballot, well don't ya know.  </P> <P>  For attorney general, his name was Ar-lo.  </P> <P>  So I'm gonna make a rap and it goes like so:  </P> <P>  I love this tie, it's burgundy.  </P> <P> At that point, the rapper put his arm around the startled, 63-year-old Smith  and lifted his tie. The singer gave his name as Casanova Ace and said he was  originally of New York but now of Paramount (the city, not the studio).  </P> <P> Somehow, mention of an Arlo Smith rap song reminds us that the Doo Dah Parade  is approaching. And KCOP (Channel 13) is terming itself the only TV station  "with the guts to bring it to you." The 15th edition of the zany procession  will be televised live for the first time on Nov. 25.  </P> <P> Doo Dah czar Peter Apanel's strategy is obvious. With turnouts growing so large  in recent years, Apanel -- in the contrary tradition of the Rose Parade parody  -- has begun pleading with people not to attend.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he even recorded a message on his telephone that said: "You  can't find a place to park. It won't be any fun. It's gonna be too crowded."  Several alarmed people phoned the city, thinking it had been canceled, and  Apanel was chewed out by Pasadena police.  </P> <P> So now he's adopted a new ruse. His hope: People will stay home and catch it on  TV.  </P> <P> And here's an event that sounds like a Doo-Dah joke:  </P> <P> The L.A. Business Council will host a speech today at noon on "The Outlook for  Real Estate in the 1990s," given by real estate agent Mike Glickman.  </P> <P> Yes, the same Mike Glickman whose lavish operation collapsed earlier this year,  forcing him to file for bankruptcy. Perhaps some of his 157 creditors will want  to listen to his pearls of wisdom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The lot behind 71-year-old Musso &amp; Frank Grill in Hollywood is believed to  be the oldest continuously open parking operation in the city.  </P></p>

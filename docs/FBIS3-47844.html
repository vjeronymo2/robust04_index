			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Quoting a high-ranking official of the Russian  Pacific Fleet Command, Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that in  addition to exporting four submarines to North Korea, Russia  concluded a contract to sell 10 submarines to North Korea.    According to this official, the contract to export the  submarines was concluded at the North Korean Consulate in  Nakhodka. He also revealed that Russia's export company is the  (Dariol) Company, which sells submarines by salvaging the ones  that have sunk in the Far East area or that are being kept by  submerging them at sea.    The (Dariol) Company received permission to export the  submarines in accordance with the plan to reduce the Pacific  Fleet's weapons. However, permission must be officially received  by the central government to export the submarines as they are,  without changing the structure of the vessels. The TOKYO  SHIMBUN reported that, therefore, an alternate method will be  used. A Russian vessel will tow the submarines to the North  Korean side.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Communist Threat Tactics Will Not Get Support for NP --  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 January in its page 6  editorial comments on the 27 South African Communist Party  (SACP) members placed among the top 50 positions of the African  National Congress' (ANC) election candidates' list. The  National Party (NP) "complains that 'the strategically strong  position into which the SACP has manoeuvred itself spells danger  to the whole process of establishing a true democracy with a  strong and growing economy'. That may be so, but Red gevaar  [threat] tactics will not swing Black votes to the NP -- and we  doubt whether it will swing any other votes to it either. We  will have to accept, like it or not, that the Reds who were  under our beds in the days of the total onslaught are now on top  of the beds."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   ANC `Deserves' Chance To Govern; DP Has Watchdog Role --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 January in a page 18  editorial states: "We recognise that the African National  Congress has earned its place as the majority party in a  government of national unity." "Whether or not one agrees with  the tactics the organisation employed over the years, The Star  believes the ANC under Nelson Mandela deserves its chance to  govern. Thereafter it should be judged according to its  performance in government, and be retained or removed by the  electorate." The paper believes the "presence in government of  small but talented and principled parties such as the Democratic  Party [DP], as well as individuals from the National Party,  Inkatha Freedom Party, Pan-Africanist Congress and others, is  very much in the long-term interests of the country, and the ANC  itself." Although the DP is "much too white, too upper- class  and too unrepresentative" its presence in the government of  national unity "will be invaluable." It will "play a watchdog  role, help entrench a workable multiparty system, and defend the  core principles to which it and its predecessors have been  committed. Bear in mind, too, that proportional representation  means every vote counts: the DP is not going to win the  election, but every vote it receives will contribute towards its  presence in parliament."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC's `Totalitarian' Style -- "The ANC is not yet the  government, but already it shows a totalitarian-style inability  to distinguish between its own narrow party interests and the  national interest," points out a page 6 editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 27 January. That is the  BUSINESS DAY's explanation for the ANC's "request that it be  permitted to purchase a building, presumably with a foreign  donation, through the financial rand. It has also asked that  duties be waived for the importing of motor vehicles, office  equipment and T-shirts, all designed to assist the ANC's  election campaign." The request was "cynically" framed in terms  of the "'leveling of the political playing field'," and has gone  to the finance subcouncil of the Transitional Executive Council  for adjudication "where, it so happens, the ANC and it allies  are well-represented." If the ANC "were as committed to  'transparency' as it claims to be, it would ensure that the  subcouncil discussion on its request was open to the public. We  hope the episode is not a preview of the open, honest government  we can expect after the election."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Government Urged To Avoid Lesotho Crisis -- "The South  African government is wise to act with circumspection in the  Lesotho crisis, and should do everything possible to avoid  becoming involved, even if the government of the tiny mountain  kingdom has asked that SA troops be sent to quell the fighting  between rival army factions in Maseru," advises a page 8  editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 25 January.  "Pretoria, which has done well in mending its fences with  Africa since February, 1990, does not wish to be suspected of  reverting to a spoiling role in a neighbour-state."</p>

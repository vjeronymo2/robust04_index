			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / S African strikers fired on Labour unrest in South Africa drew a violent response from the security forces yesterday when police fired on striking forestry workers, injuring at least 20. Private security personnel used stun grenades and rubber bullets to quell a disturbance by striking gold miners, Patti Waldmeir reports from Johannesburg. Five miners were injured in demonstrations, including a sit-in by 300 miners underground at an Anglo American mine near Carletonville, south-west of Johannesburg, the company said. Violence also broke out at a forestry plantation near Piet Retief, close to South Africa's border with Swaziland. Police said they fired birdshot to disperse 4,000 workers, injuring at least 20. Local officials of the African National Congress said four had died, but police denied this. Labour unrest, either backed by unions or unofficial, has increased in South Africa since the black-majority government of President Nelson Mandela came to power in May. Pay is the biggest issue, as black workers raise their expectations following the demise of apartheid and white minority rule.</p>

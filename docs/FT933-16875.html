			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Equitable Dutch deal approved THE DEAL under which Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, will acquire control of Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society took an important step forward yesterday when with-profits policyholders approved the transaction. The deal means that the Edinburgh-based institution will cease to be a mutual company. At a special meeting the change was approved by 29,885 policyholders, with 1,491 against. Only two policyholders voiced serious opposition to the deal, the largest demutualisation by a British life company. Scottish Equitable said it needs to make the change to bring in new capital to continue expanding its unit-linked business. Under the deal Scottish Equitable will transfer all its business to a new company, Scottish Equitable Plc, which will be 100 per cent owned by Aegon. Aegon will inject Pounds 40m into this company and also pay Pounds 200m for an initial 40 per cent stake in Scottish Equitable Plc's unit-linked and other non with-profit business. The with-profits fund will remain for the sole benefit of with-profits policy holders. A voting trust is to be established to give additional safeguards for the rights of all policyholders. At the meeting, Mr Colin Fisher, a with-profits policyholder, moved the transaction be adjourned for three months. 'This is a takeover (by Aegon) from day one,' he said. He called for 'proper scrutiny of the strategy that led to this position - only that can tell us if the people sitting opposite are the right people to be running the company.' The motion to adjourn the meeting was defeated by 167 votes to eight.</p>

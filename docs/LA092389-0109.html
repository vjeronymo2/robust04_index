			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEZBOLLAH VOWS REVENGE FOR SAUDI EXECUTIONS  </P> <P> Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement vowed revenge on Friday against Saudi  Arabia for beheading 16 Shiite Muslims from Kuwait who were convicted in two  bombings that killed one man and injured 16 others during the annual Muslim  pilgrimage last July in the holy city of Mecca.  </P> <P> Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued a statement condemning the Saudi government  for the executions, which it described as a "massacre" and an "act of  terrorism."  </P> <P> "We consider the execution of 16 Kuwaiti pilgrims a terrorist act carried out  by the rulers of (Saudi Arabia) who are intruders to Islam in order to satisfy  America, the mother of decadence and terrorism in the world," the statement  said.  </P> <P> "The spirit of deep hatred controlling the practices of this terrorist regime  against the genuine Muslim will be a motivation for avenging the blood of these  oppressed Muslims," it said.  </P> <P> Hezbollah is believed to hold some of the 14 Western hostages missing in  Lebanon. It has also been linked to the crash of a French DC-10 airliner in the  Sahara Desert Tuesday.  </P> <P> The one-page statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western news agency in  Beirut.  </P> <P> Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, also warned  during Friday prayers in Beirut of "chaos" following the executions.  </P> <P> He said there was a plot to harm Iran's image and accused the Saudi judges of  sentencing the men to death because they were Shiite pilgrims commemorating the  death of Iran's spiritual leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  </P> <P> He was repeatedly interrupted by hundreds of bearded worshipers who raised  their fists and shouted, "God is great, death to (Saudi King) Fahd."  </P> <P> Saudi Arabian newspapers said Friday the Kuwaiti bombers, who were publicly  executed on Thursday, were anti-Muslim puppets -- but made no reference to any  Iranian involvement.  </P></p>

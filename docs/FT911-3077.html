			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo faces change KALAMAZOO, the office stationery and business forms company, is considering moves which could end its control by the Kalamazoo Workers' Alliance. They have been given a cautious welcome by the KWA trustees. Mr Kenneth Dibben, chairman, said that the board and trustees had been having discussions concerning the possibility of issuing shares for acquisitions or to raise funds. He added that the main concern of the trustees, who control 51.5 per cent at the moment, was that the company could be taken over and the payment of dividends discontinued despite making profits. 'We have been looking at some of form of entrenched dividend rights,' he said. He was hopeful that agreement could be reached within two or three months. Mr Dibben believed that if the company had been able to issue shares earlier it is unlikely that it would have paid cash for recent acquisitions, which had left it with high borrowings during the downturn. Kalamazoo also announced the return to interim dividends with a 0.5p payment, the first since 1988. For the six months to the end of January pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.03m against losses of Pounds 1.29m. Mr Dibben said that taking the recession into account, and the fact that most of the profits were earned in the second half, he expected full-year profits of not less than Pounds 3m, compared with Pounds 1.3m. Turnover fell to Pounds 28.35m, against Pounds 31.52m of which Pounds 3.7m was from discontinued activities. Earnings per share were 1.8p (nil). KWA has held a controlling stake for about 25 years. Its holding began at 30 per cent and it was intended by the original owners that this would eventually rise to 100 per cent through purchases. However on the death of the company founder involved, KWA was not legally allowed to make further purchases. Mr Dibben said it was un-fortunate that the holding at this point had been 51.5 per cent. 'If it had been 30 per cent or 80 per cent we would not be in this difficulty,' he said.</p>

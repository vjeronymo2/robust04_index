			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Edison in Deutsche Shell deal EDISON, the stock market listed energy subsidiary of Italy's Montedison group, is buying the Italian activities of Deutsche Shell for Dollars 230m. The activities include a share of around 49 per cent in a series of licences to extract natural gas from 13 fields concentrated in the Adriatic. Edison said its share of the total gas reserves in the fields will amount to over 20bn cubic metres. The remaining share is held by AGIP, the Italian state-owned energy group. The deal will boost company plans to triple its natural gas output to around 2bn cubic metres a year over the next 20 years, representing around 12 per cent of national demand. The acquisition should make Edison the biggest private-sector energy group in Italy, said an official. Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement producer, has acquired 70 per cent of Cemos Ostrava, one of Czechoslovakia's biggest cement groups. The deal follows December's purchase by Italcementi of Cement Hranice, the largest cement producer in Czechoslovakia. Together, Cement Hranice and Cemos Ostrava control about 15 per cent of the Czechoslovakian cement market. Italcementi, which is part of the Italmobiliare group, has an annual capacity of around 20m tonnes and controls about 36 per cent of the Italian market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan: "The Federal Intelligence </F> Service Will Be Granted More Rights"]    [Text] Bonn, 3 February -- In the future, the Federal  Intelligence Service (BND) will not only be responsible for  intelligence activities, but will also assume tasks in the fight  against crime as well. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] adopted  corresponding legal regulations on Thursday [3 February]. Thus,  they finally settled differences of opinion on the planned "Law  on the Fight Against Crime 94," which will probably be discussed  for the first time by the Bundestag on 24 February.    The BND should be allowed to pass on findings on weapons and  drug deals, money laundering, counterfeiting of money, and  terrorism, obtained accidentally or on purpose, to the police or  public prosecutor's offices. According to the current  regulations, the intelligence services are allowed to tap  telephone conversations abroad only if the "free and democratic  order" of the FRG or its security are in peril.    The coalition has suggested that the satellites and other  monitoring equipment of the BND should also be used to register  conversations on a regular basis that include information  pointing to serious crimes. The BND should also be allowed to  eavesdrop on persons if prosecution authorities ask for  administrative assistance in the event of telephone tapping upon  judicial order.    FDP legal expert Burkhard Hirsch and Detlef Kleinert pointed  out that the coalition's intention is not to expand the tasks of  the intelligence service. It only wants to "utilize the  technical possibilities of the BND," Hirsch stressed. He also  rejected the allegation that the new law is mixing the tasks of  the secret services and the police. The BND should merely  "place its equipment at the disposal of the police and provide  administrative aid."    The draft law also stipulates that offenders who are caught  red-handed should appear in court within one week in the future  and be kept in prison until that time. Violent crimes should be  punished more severely.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian chief negotiator in talks with Latvia Sergey  Zotov told INTERFAX that agreement was reached on two of the  four papers on Russian pullout at the fresh round of talks, now  under way in the resort town of Jurmala outside Riga. Both of  them are ready for initialling, he said.    The question is one of the two draft deals on the withdrawal  of Russian troops by August 31 and social security nets for  servicemen over an interim period. Zotov says this provides for  the servicemen's right to privatize their housing before selling  it to local residents and to take out or transfer property to  their relatives in Latvia and other property guarantees.    The two sides are holding further talks on Russia's radar  installation at Skrunda and an agreement on social security  safeguards for retired Russian servicemen residing in Latvia.    Moscow and Riga are still wide apart on the amount to be  paid  for the leasing of the facility.    Russia put forward a new proposal agreeing to pay in fuel  exports to Latvia in exchange for the use of the installation,  the diplomat said.    Earlier, agreement had been reached that Moscow would  continue using its advanced warning radar station in the next  four years and take a further 18 months to dismantle it.    On social security safeguards for retired Russian  servicemen,  Zotov said that differences remained on granting permanent  residence to those who retired after Latvia gained independence  in August 1991. (The Latvian bureau for monitoring Russian troop  withdrawals puts their numbers at about 15,000 - IF)    "Russia will never renege on its demand that all Russian  servicemen retiring before January 28, 1992 be granted permanent  residency in Latvia even if the whole deal on troop withdrawals  has to be thrown out", Zotov said.    The latest round is to end on Thursday but not on Wednesday  as planned before.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is stepping  up diplomacy toward third world countries in an apparent bid to  win their support for its nuclear development program ahead of a  non- aligned foreign ministers' meeting slated for May in Egypt.    In March alone Pyongyang has sent nine missions abroad,  chiefly to non-aligned nations, with a view to easing  international pressure for sanctions and avoiding full outside  inspection of its nuclear facilities, according to the official  North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press.    Among the nine missions were three sent directly by the  Foreign Ministry, each headed by a vice minister-level official.    One led by Kim Yong-il is traveling to West African  countries: It has already visited Mali and Senegal and will  proceed to Guinea and Ghana.    Another headed by Pak Myong-ku visited Mongolia, meeting the  Mongolian premier in Ulaanbaatar last Friday, NAEWOE quoted  North Korean media as reporting.    The third led by Kim Chang-kyu visited Thailand from March  18-22 and Malaysia from March 25-28. Meeting the premiers and  foreign ministers of these two countries, Kim reportedly  explained North Korea's plans to leave the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Washington continues applying  pressure. He is scheduled to visit Singapore from March 29-31  and Indonesia from April 1-3.    Earlier, a Workers' Party mission headed by Secretary Hwang  Chang-yop visited Vietnam and Laos. In a meeting with  Vietnamese Communist Party leaders on March 7, Hwang sought to  increase cooperation between the two countries and win  Vietnamese support. In Laos, he met with Laotian political  leaders on March 10.    Other missions sent overseas were led by Vice President Kim  Pyong-sik, Education Commission Chairman Choe Ki-yong, Vice  Premier Hong Song-nam, Supreme People's Assembly Secretariat  Director Yi Mong-ho and Vice Information Committee Chairman Yi  Pong-hui.    Vice President Kim's team is currently visiting Venezuela  after stopping in Peru and Ecuador, while Education Commission  Chairman Choe is in Syria as President Kim Il-song's special  envoy after a trip to Egypt from March 20-23.    Vice Premier Hong is visiting Pakistan from March 25 to  April  13 to boost bilateral economic cooperation and seek Pakistani  support in the nuclear row.    Heading the North Korean delegation to the 91st Inter-  Parliamentary Union general meeting held in Paris, Supreme  People's Assembly Secretariat Director Yi explained Pyongyang's  position on the nuclear dispute in meetings with national  delegations.    Joining in this diplomatic campaign to evade international  pressure over the nuclear standoff are North Korean diplomats in  Africa and Latin America, according to NAEWOE.</p>

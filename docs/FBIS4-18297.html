			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Liam Clarke report: "Hume Presses Major To Call Sinn Fein </F> Bluff"]    [Text] John Hume, leader Of the Social Democratic and  Labour party, yesterday urged John Major to call Sinn Fein's  bluff by agreeing to its demands for a clarification of the  Downing Street declaration.    Hume, whose talks with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader,  opened up the latest peace process, said that if the party was  shown to be bluffing he would turn his back on it and ensure  Sinn Fein's total isolation from democratic politics.    The veteran nationalist leader said there were two possible  consequences if the government agreed to Sinn Fein's demand.  "One is a total cessation of violence with all its enormous  positive consequences or, as some people believe but I don't, if  Sinn Fein is bluffing then its bluff will have been called and  it will be isolated in a way it has never been before."    Hume said he was disappointed that the ceasefire, due to  last  from Tuesday to Thursday, was so short. "I wanted a complete  cessation of violence," he said.    An Irish government spokesman said Albert Reynolds, the  taoiseach [prime minister], shared dismay at the failure of the  IRA to deliver a permanent end to violence. "The feeling has  been growing that if we or the British give them one more  concession they will just demand more," he said.    The spokesman emphasised that Reynolds was bringing no  pressure on the British, either privately or publicly, to meet  Sinn Fein. He said: "John Hume speaks for himself on this one.  He must be deeply disappointed."    Republican sources said yesterday that the IRA had  originally  intended to hold the ceasefire in June. It appears to have been  rushed forward following pressure from Hume and prominent Irish  Americans, many of whom were disappointed by the failure of  Adams to announce concessions on his visit to the United States  earlier this year.    Bill Flynn, the New York businessman who invited Adams, has  voiced growing impatience with Sinn Fein in recent weeks. This  weekend Father Sean McManus, another key Irish-American  activist, said he did not believe that a three-day suspension of  hostilities was enough to satisfy the growing demand from Irish  Americans for an end to the conflict.    Yesterday, Adams appeared to soften Sinn Fein's position. He  gave the party's clearest indication yet that a British  declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland was not  a pre-condition for a complete cessation of IRA violence. "At  the end of the day, republicans want to see an end to British  jurisdiction in Ireland. But we have to take on board that the  Unionists have an opposite view," he said.    However, an IRA source said the movement's leaders were  claiming to be on the brink of victory. They have told internal  meetings that the government last year gave assurances that it  secretly wanted Irish unity. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein  leader involved in secret contacts with the government, is  expected to allude to these alleged assurances at a republican  rally in Dublin today.    There are growing fears in security circles that if the  government does not budge there will be an escalation of  terrorism.    IRA members have been told to prepare for a renewed terror  campaign, while loyalist paramilitaries have ended their  informal contacts with the Irish government and are threatening  to start a bombing campaign throughout Ireland.    The British and Irish governments appear to have accepted  that there is unlikely to be an early end to violence. They  have begun drawing up a joint document on the future government  of the province and Anglo-lrish relations.    An Irish government source said the document would be  unveiled when events had "cooled down" after the European  elections in june.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said:  "The two governments are working on a joint structure scheme  that will represent, in their view, the best means by which a  satisfactory package could get broad support."</p>

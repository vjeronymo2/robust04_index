			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (4): Need to train more precisely on target - A skills problem THE West Midlands region is typical of the skills mismatch which bedevils much of Britain. Even in recession, companies report difficulties in acquiring the skilled labour they need. Sandwell demonstrates the problem. In this urban district in the Black Country, 45 per cent of the workforce is employed in manufacturing. Ethnic minorities account for 25 per cent of the population. Mr John Bedingfield, chief executive of the Sandwell Training &amp; Enterprise Council (TEC), says that companies tell him they need to find skilled labour  -yet 20,000 people, 17 per cent of the workforce, are without jobs. Asked how many of these would be unemployable even in a buoyant economic climate, Mr Bedingfield replies that it is impossible to say. 'I'd like to think that no-one, or at least very few people are unemployable. But it is important to establish where education ends and training begins. Some young people in the area have low education attainments and aspirations. It is a question of teaching them interview techniques, showing them how to make out a curriculum vitae, motivating people who have never had jobs. Only then can you think about specific vocational training. Sandwell TEC is tackling training through two programmes it inherited from the government's training agency: the youth training programme, and employment training for adult long-term unemployed. Youth training includes a system for the financial support of young people of 16 and 17 upwards. The programme gives them training over two years, either through an approved training provider, or (ideally) a job. The hope is that the trainee will achieve a national vocational qualification. For adult returners the period of training is usually shorter; up to six months. There are about 3,000 people on the two schemes. Over 80 per cent of Sandwell TEC's budget of Pounds 12.5m is allocated to these two projects. But there are many other schemes - Investors in People, for example, in which companies make a public commitment to develop their employees to achieve business objectives, and give counselling in schools. Mr Bedingfield says: 'More precise targeting is the key to training; we are in close touch with 70 companies and try to match training to their needs.' Sandwell is one of 10 TECs in the West Midlands; the biggest is Birmingham TEC, which has a Pounds 50m budget from the government. The Birmingham TEC, like the others, was set up (in 1990) to manage and develop the Department of Employment's training programmes for young people and adults and to support new and developing businesses. The TEC has refined the youth training programme into a system of credits. A printed voucher is issued to a young person, enabling him or her to pay for up to 104 weeks of training. Vouchers can only be cashed with an employer or training provider approved by the TEC. The Employment Training (ET) programme has been renamed Training for Work; an initiative aimed at the adult long-term unemployed. Those eligible must be between 18 and 60 and unemployed for 6 months, but the programme also includes people with disabilities; ex-regular members of the armed forces; people whose first language is not English; people requiring literacy and numeracy training; returners to the labour market and victims of large scale redundancies. The TEC claims that this broader scheme is better than the old ET because it stops 'skills leakage' - that is, people who, made redundant, then join the long term unemployed. It also enables older people, not merely school leavers, to acquire vocational qualifications. Training for Work provides intensive vocational training (usually up to 34 weeks) aimed at achieving a national vocational qualification (NVQ). Birmingham TEC has 5,600 on its youth credits training scheme and between 8,000 and 9,000 on Training for Work. It claims that both are successful. In 1990-91, 1022 participants achieved an NVQ at level 2. In the following year the figure had more than doubled: to 2443. Birmingham TEC believes that it is well on the way to meeting national education and training targets: 80 per cent of young people to have a NVQ to level 2 by 1997; 50 per cent of young people to reach NVQ level 3 or equivalent by 2000. (NVQ level 2 is equivalent to four GCSEs; level 3 to two A-levels. The TEC likes to feel it is doing much more than simply continuing the government's training programmes. Mr Larry Freeman, head of marketing services, says: 'The government schemes we inherited are aimed at the unemployed. It is perfectly proper that we should try to reduce unemployment through training. But I believe we cannot have a real skills revolution in this country unless we combine these programmes with initiatives for the 80 per cent of the available workforce who are in jobs.' Mr Freeman feels it is especially important in an area such as the West Midlands, which depends on advanced manufacturing to do something for those with jobs. He says: 'There is a need for employees in engineering and electronics continually to upgrade their skills.' Accordingly, the Birmingham TEC has introduced a number of programmes for those in work. The Weekend College programme is thought to be unique to Birmingham. This gives vouchers, worth Pounds 60, to adults with no skills or low skills, enabling them to go to college for a certain number of weekends, to upgrade their skills or learn new ones. More significantly, perhaps, Birmingham TEC has launched a Skills Investment Programme which brings together employers in eight different sectors of employment. Together with the TEC, employers research a sector's needs. Initiatives for employees - either on site, or elsewhere - follow. Mr Freeman says: 'These programmes make a start on what has become known as 'up-skilling.' But what is really needed is a national strategy to meet the changing needs of industries.'</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Leading Article: Hurry up, Mr Schlesinger IN ITS interest rate decisions, the Bundesbank has chosen to imitate the tortoise rather than the hare. This looks increasingly unwise. Its job is to secure monetary stability in Germany. Sharp reductions in the interest rates it sets seem consistent with its objectives. They should not be further delayed. The Bundesbank is right to worry about current disputes over the foolish commitment to reach pay parity between eastern and western Germany in 1994. Pay trends in the east have national significance. The smaller the competitive pressures from eastern Germany, the more difficult it will be for the Bundesbank to achieve its target for inflation. Furthermore, high pay and high unemployment in eastern Germany will ensure the prolongation of the current budgetary drain into the indefinite future. The all-German public sector borrowing requirement is running at about 6 per cent of total German gross domestic product. Given the recession and the number of elections next year, it is likely to be at that level, or higher, for many years. These are good reasons for concern. But the Bundesbank is responsible neither for the terms of German monetary union, nor for subsequent fiscal policy. It is only responsible for ensuring that the mistakes of others are not validated by monetary policy. That aim has now been achieved. The best single indicator of success is long-term interest rates. At a little over 6 1/2 per cent, these are some two and a half percentage points below their levels at the beginning of 1991. They have been below current levels only for three brief periods in the last 25 years. Credibility has been regained. The price has been high. It is true that the economy is coming off the top of an economic expansion lasting a decade, during which west German GDP rose by 31 per cent. But GDP fell by 1.4 per cent between the first and last quarters of 1992. More dramatically, industrial output has fallen by 11 per cent from its peak in early 1992, to levels last seen in mid-1989. Meanwhile, broad money supply (M3) has shrunk in early 1993. This does, indeed, follow gross overshooting of last year's targets, but that overshooting reflected exceptional factors, including foreign exchange intervention within the European exchange rate mechanism. Furthermore, the rapid monetary growth of 1992 has as yet produced no subsequent boost to domestic demand and should probably be ignored. Inflation subdued Inflation is more subdued than it looks. The annual rise in hourly wages has fallen from 7 per cent in 1991 to a little over 4 per cent. The Bundesbank remains concerned about consumer price inflation; the latest annual rate is 4.3 per cent, more than twice its target. But this overshooting in substantial part reflects higher housing costs and higher administered prices, including increases in value added tax. Yet higher administered prices and indirect taxes are the inevitable consequence of efforts made to improve the public finances, for which the Bundesbank itself has called. The Bundesbank should also recognise that its policies have brought disinflation to the entire ERM zone. But that effect also threatens its own domestic achievements. To the extent that high short-term interest rates undermine currency stability, they weaken the credibility of ERM parities and force large-scale foreign exchange intervention, which then undermines domestic monetary control. In all, a forward-looking central bank would now be cutting interest rates sharply. Nor would this be unprecedented in Germany. It is what the Bundesbank did between August 1982 and March 1983, when the discount rate was lowered from 7.5 to 4 per cent. This time things have been very different. The discount rate has been lowered by a mere 1 1/4 percentage points since September 1992. The three-month rate of interest is about 8 per cent, down only some 1 3/4 percentage points from its peak in the middle of last year. Not only are the reductions themselves small, but short rates remain well above long rates. Extreme caution The Bundesbank's rationalisation for what seems to be extreme caution is fear of the effects of interest rate reductions on the exchange rate and long-term interest rates. It also argues that short-term interest rates are not particularly important for German economic activity. These arguments are far from persuasive. The expectation in the markets is that short-rates of interest will be below 6 per cent by the end of the year and lower still in 1994. Faster movement towards a recognised destination may not weaken the D-Mark, which has already fallen against the yen and the US dollar since last autumn. Furthermore, the German recession means that a depreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar, which would not be matched by one against most European currencies, is unlikely to be inflationary. As for the feared effect on long-term interest rates, the way to find out is by trial and error. Should long-term interest rates soar - or the D-Mark plunge - short-term rates can always be increased once more. But there are already strong forces working towards low long-term interest rates. It is difficult to accept that the current yield curve is needed to achieve that result. Finally, short-term interest rates do matter to Germany. Some 80 per cent of credit to industry is indeed long term, but much of this is at variable rates of interest, themselves determined by short-term rates of interest. Furthermore, the Bundesbank tends to forget that short-term rates of interest matter even more to neighbouring countries. Yet if the Bundesbank brings contraction to France, it also reinforces the recession in Germany. The Bundesbank should stop prevaricating. Short-term rates should probably be at least 1 1/2 percentage points lower than now, a level which would still give Germany a flat yield curve. Its job is not to make political points. Now that credibility has been restored, it is time to adjust interest rates sharply. Further delay cannot be justified.</p>

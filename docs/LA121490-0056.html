			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ LEAVES KING, SIGNS SIX-FIGHT DEAL WITH ARUM  </P> <P> Julio Cesar Chavez, the Mexican junior-welterweight world champion, signed a  six-fight contract with Las Vegas promoter Bob Arum Thursday night.  </P> <P> Chavez's Los Angeles lawyer, Leon Pizante, said the 18-month deal was worth  about $15 million and would begin May 1. Chavez, who had been unhappy fighting  for New York promoter Don King, walked out of a King news conference last week  in Atlantic City, N.J., because, he explained later, he felt King was ignoring  him.  </P> <P> King was unavailable for comment Thursday night.  </P> <P> Pizante and Alberto Gonzales, Chavez's American manager, said King's contract  with Chavez was abrogated when King was unable to provide Chavez with a rich  rematch with Meldrick Taylor in early 1991. Taylor, beaten by Chavez last  spring, has signed to fight welterweight champion Aaron Davis instead.  </P> <P> Chavez, from Culiacan, defeated Ahn Kyung-Duk Saturday in an title fight at  Atlantic City. His record is 73-0, but U.S. record keepers list him at 72-1.  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Bill Cayton, Mike Tyson's estranged manager, says he will try to block Tyson's  proposed fight with Razor Ruddock next spring.  </P> <P> Don King, Tyson's promoter, said last Sunday, after the former heavyweight  champion had knocked out Alex Stewart in one round, that Tyson would next meet  the high-rated Ruddock, probably in April.  </P> <P> But Cayton said Wednesday that he would take steps to prevent the fight,  because Tyson could make far more money fighting Ruddock by first regaining the  championship. Cayton also said King agreed to the Ruddock fight primarily to  avoid a lawsuit by Ruddock's promoter.  </P> <P> "This is a typical Don King move," Cayton said. "He's doing this because it's  in his best interests, not Mike's. He has a troublesome lawsuit pending in  Edmonton (filed by Murad Muhammad, Ruddock's promoter), and this fight would  cancel out the suit.  </P> <P> "It's a foolish, unnecessary fight. Mike would make triple the money fighting  Ruddock after he's won the title back. Also, even though I believe Mike would  beat Ruddock, it is a high-risk fight for him, because Ruddock is the  second-best heavyweight in the world."  </P> <P> Cayton was Tyson's co-manager with Jim Jacobs until Jacobs' death in 1988.  Cayton and Tyson had a falling out shortly afterward, and Tyson has been  advised by King ever since. Cayton's managerial contract with Tyson does not  expire until Feb. 12, 1992.  </P> <P> Many in boxing wonder why King isn't advising Tyson to sit tight until after  the Evander Holyfield-George Foreman title fight April 19, then sign to fight  the winner for the championship, or at least take a low-risk fight or two.  </P> <P> King said he fears Holyfield or Foreman would duck Tyson after their fight.  </P> <P> "We have no guarantee Holyfield's people will want him to fight Mike at any  time," King said Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>Arellano   Felix Group   <F P=102> 94WB0042A Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 12 May 94 STATES  Section p 2 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0042A </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Cabrera] </F>   [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 11 May--Agents from the  Attorney General's Office (PGR) mounted an operation here today  (from 1630 to 1930) at the exits of the international bridges  crossing to the United States. Its purpose was to trap the  members of the Arellano Felix family and its accomplices,  according to the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) first commander  in the state, Javier Norona Guerrero.    He added that the operation was conducted on the export  lanes  by 100 Federal Judicial agents who, besides seeking "escapees,"  were also looking for possible drug shipments on those bridges.    Norona Guerrero claimed that the instructions from the PJF  director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, who visited Nuevo Laredo and  Matamoros, Tamaulipas, today, are to continue the search for the  Arellano Felix brothers and Juan Garcia Abrego. The latter  apparently was here a few days ago.    He noted that the thorough inspections of departing vehicles  were made strategically. The sides of the lanes were blocked by  a group of Judicial Police agents armed with "banana clip"  weapons, while others requested identifications and searched  automobile trunks.    Although Carrera Fuentes left this town today, a PGR group  led by Commander Jose Luis Patino is reinforcing the search for  Garcia Abrego and the Arellano Felix group in the Casas Grandes  region.    As for a possible "tipoff" to the fugitives, Norona Guerrero  explained that there was none, because the measure is part of  the permanent campaign to find the aforementioned drug  traffickers.    Before leaving Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera announced that  a  security corridor had been formed from Tijuana to Matamoros, to  prevent the Arellano Felix group and Garcia Abrego from leaving  Mexico.</p>

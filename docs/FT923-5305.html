			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Bush to agree F-15 fighter sale to Saudis PRESIDENT Bush is expected to inform Congress soon that he intends to go ahead with the sale of 72 F-15 aircraft, worth some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn), to Saudi Arabia. Some Jewish leaders said yesterday that they had been informed of the White House decision and executives of McDonnell Douglas, which manufactures the aircraft, have been increasingly confident of a favourable response to the Saudi request. Before that Mr Bush is likely to announce today his approval for the sale of 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan when he visits General Dynamics in Texas. The sale has been opposed by China. Saudi Arabia's contribution to the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq, the presidential election campaign and Mr Bush's decision to support Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees for Israel have all being working in favour of the F-15 order getting the go-ahead. The decision will be a disappointment for British Aerospace which was hoping to fill the gap for Saudi Arabia with additional Tornado aircraft if the F-15 sale did not proceed. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, strongly criticised the proposed sale earlier this month and Jewish organisations in the US will campaign against it, especially if Saudi Arabia is to be sold a variant of the F-15 which is more advanced than those in Israel. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the only Gulf countries which publicly backed the decision by the US, France and Britain to ban Iraqi aircraft from flying south of the 32nd parallel. To refuse or further postpone the F-15 sales would be politically embarrassing to Saudi Arabia at a time when its commitment to the US Gulf policy has never been stronger. McDonnell Douglas has also warned Mr Bush that without the Saudi order the F-15 production line would soon have to be closed with the loss of many thousands of jobs directly and more in ancillary industries. With unemployment having risen for most of the past year in the US and Mr Bush lagging in the opinion polls the president would have to present powerful arguments for not securing the McDonnell Douglas jobs. General Dynamics has warned that it will have to dismiss nearly 6,000 workers in Texas, the president's home state, if the Taiwan order is not approved. Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger for the presidency, has been campaigning hard in Texas and believes he has a better than even chance of capturing the state in November.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres left for  Bucharest this evening and will meet there tonight with PLO  leader, Yasir 'Arafat. In their talk the two will try to  resolve the remaining disagreements. Minister Peres will also  demand that 'Arafat supply information on the Israeli MIA's and  captives. Our correspondent Dov Gilhar reports:    [Begin recording] [Gilhar] Bucharest is becoming another  stop of the peace train. Peres has left for an international  economic conference in Romania, where he will meet with 'Arafat  in an attempt to overcome the last obstacles in the Cairo talks.    [Peres] Besides the MIA's issue, most of the talk will focus  on how to bring about the conclusion of the negotiations from  the viewpoint of issues, timetable, and arrangements.    [Gilhar] In the wake of the report you heard from Major  General Shahaq this morning, do you believe it will be possible  to conclude the negotiations by next weekend?    [Peres] I do not know if this will be the case indeed, but  the impression is that we are at the final stage, and barring  unexpected developments, we may be able to conclude the  negotiations within two to three weeks.    [Gilhar] In tonight's meeting Peres will also demand to  receive information on the MIA's issue. Before his departure  Peres heard a report on significant progress on civilian matters  at the Cairo talks. The Israeli delegation leaders came from  Cairo to Jerusalem this morning to brief the foreign minister  and prime minister on the remaining disputes. Rabin heard from  Maj. Gen. Shahaq that the talks are delayed over the PLO's  demands that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners be  released and that it exercise legal powers also regarding  Israelis who move through the autonomy areas. [passage omitted]  [end recording]    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1700 GMT on 20 April reports on the Cairo talks, adding that  "several issues have remained unresolved in the deliberations of  the Security Committee. The problem of the prisoners' release  has not been solved yet, although an agreed timetable was  already set for the release of 5,000 prisoners: 2,500 will be  released upon the signing of the agreement, and the rest will be  released three weeks after the signing. The Palestinians demand  that a timetable be set for the release of another 3,500  prisoners approximately, including Hamas members, but Israel is  opposed to this." On civilian matters, "three questions remain  open, and they will be transferred to 'Arafat and Rabin for  decision: the question of area code for Gaza and Jericho; the  Palestinian stamp; and the passport."]</p>

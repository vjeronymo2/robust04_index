			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Information from the  State Statistics Bureau (SSB) showed that China's reforms in the  fields of fiscal system, finance and foreign trade were  proceeding smoothly in the first quarter of this year.    According to figures from the Customs Department, the  country's export volume reached 19.1 billion U.S. dollars in  the first quarter, up 18.7 percent on the same period last year.    The figure turned out to be 20.4 billion U.S. dollars for  the import sector, which saw a rise of 18.2 percent.    Ye Zhen, spokesman for the SSB, told a press conference here  today that China also enjoyed an increase in its foreign  exchange reserve, and the market exchange rate remained stable.    According to him, the government's financial revenue (debt  receipt was not included) was raised by 21.4 percent in the  first three months, while financial expenditure (debt servicing  was not included) registered a 23.8 percent growth.    Loans for working capital and fixed assets made up much of  the 35.1 billion yuan-bank loans newly granted during the period.    At the same time, bank savings were raised to about 207.2  billion yuan.    To sum up the whole situation of China's economy, Ye said  that the main stem of the macro-economy was good, but prominent  difficulties and problems still exist.    The prices in the country's urban and countryside markets  remained on the rise. The retail sales prices jumped by 21  percent over the same period last year. Prices of life  necessities witnessed the highest rates of increase.    But Ye also said that as the government stipulated policies  to restrict price rises, price soaring has obviously been slowed  down since March.    In other aspects, production of the state industry was only  increased by 2.2 percent. The state-owned enterprises were  making less profits, more enterprises suffered from losses, many  others were in arrears with loans or goods payments.    Ye noted that China's macro-economic control is at a  critical  period, adding that the economic growth rate was moderate, but  tight control was still necessary for the rate of price rises.    He concluded that reforms in the next period should put  equal  emphasis on stabilizing prices and boosting economic growth.</p>

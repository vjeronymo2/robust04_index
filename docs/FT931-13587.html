			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Metal Exchange's three-months LEAD prices fell below a technical support level yesterday to reach the lowest level for 11 months. As bearish fundamentals were underlined by a report from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (see story above) the price declined Pounds 4 to Pounds 286.25 a tonne - and the fall would have been twice that but for sterling's weakness against the US dollar. The COPPER market was described by traders as featureless and Pounds 20 of the three months position's Pounds 25 rise to Pounds 1,482.25 a tonne was attributable to the currency factor. The TIN market's cautious rise continued with the three months position closing Dollars 67.50 higher at Dollars 6,065 a tonne. But the advance was trimmed in after hours trading, which ended with the price at Dollars 6,030 a tonne. Precious metals moved high but failed to break through overhead resistance. GOLD closed 50 cents up at Dollars 330.05 a tonne while PLATINUM was Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 373.50 a tonne. Gold dealers said they had hoped producers might hold off selling to clear space for gold above Dollars 330 an ounce. Compiled from Reuters</p>

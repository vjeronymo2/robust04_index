			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / G7 backs new effort to secure success in trade talks THE world's leading industrial countries yesterday concluded their three-day economic summit, agreeing that the 'highest priority' was a successful conclusion to talks on liberalising world trade. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada - issued a communique supporting a new effort to reach agreement by the end of this year in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The communique also said they had agreed to promote long term growth by trying to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health care systems. 'All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start,' US President Bill Clinton said. He cited Wednesday's agreement by the US, Canada, Japan and the European Community to reduce or eliminate import tariffs on a range of manufactured goods, which he said would help bring global trade talks to a successful conclusion. On Russia, Mr Clinton said the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) programme to help privatise state-owned industries 'will not only bolster prospects for freedom there, it is a very solid investment for the US'. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the summit, with its progress on trade, had been better 'than I anticipated and better than most people expected'. He also secured agreement to make future summits more informal. The meeting would have a catalytic effect on the trade talks, help to restore confidence and growth, and create jobs, he added. Mr Clinton will leave Tokyo this morning for South Korea, probably without Japan's agreement to use numerical targets to open its markets to imports and reduce its trade surplus. Reporting on last night's dinner between Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, Mr David Gergen, the White House counsellor, said the two leaders had only 'touched on' the question of what is known as the framework agreement. They had agreed to leave matters in the hands of their ministers. Negotiations were continuing overnight, he said, and were 'quite fluid'. But Mr Clinton 'has not yet seen any piece of paper'. Mr Gergen said it was 'within the realms of possibility' that there would be an announcement before Mr Clinton leaves for Seoul, but it was equally possible that nothing would be forthcoming. The president, he said, would have to approve what could be a complicated document and was also due to attend bilateral talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin this morning. US officials have been careful not to raise expectations that such an important deal could be reached in Tokyo with a Japanese government facing elections next week. The US has felt that it is better to sign a solid agreement than a hasty one. Japanese officials said the talks on a proposed trade framework had narrowed the differences between the two governments but had not eliminated them. Even late yesterday afternoon Mr Miyazawa was sending his negotiators revised instructions.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Quotes of the day 'This Budget means tax increases this year, tax increases next year and tax increases the year after, a massive betrayal of election promises.' Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor 'Anything that begins to generate the capability for small and medium-size businesses to create more employment is very good news.' Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank 'The total tax on a pint of beer will rise by 1 1/2 p and a bottle of wine by about 5 1/2 p' Norman Lamont, before the Treasury admitted that there is no longer any such thing a  1/2 p 'This is close to the budget the CBI asked for ..but we would have liked an assurance on the continuation of improved investment allowances, and the Budget comes with a sting in the tail: future tax increases.' Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry 'His proposals for 1993-94 are sensible. But his fiscal stance for 1994/95 makes a rather firm assumption that economic recovery will be under way before it has actually happened.' Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher 'Not a single adjustment was out of harmony. It will give a lot of confidence to business, especially that the government is starting to tackle the fiscal gap. But he has left me to go on running my business, and that's what I wanted to be able to do.' Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons 'The statement is based on the assumption that economic recovery is well under way and can be sustained. But in construction the recovery is still very limited and fragile. It is important, therefore, that the Budget paves the way for a further cut in interest rates as soon as possible.' Sir Brian Hill, president of Building Employers Confederation</p>

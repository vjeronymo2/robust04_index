The Russian troops stationed in Latvia went on higher alert  in connection with the incident, but they neither left the  places of their deployment nor launched any aggressive actions,  he pointed out.    As INTERFAX already reported, Monday morning groups of armed  Latvian militiamen seized several installations belonging to the  North-Western Group of Russian Troops. The two Russian generals  who came to the locality were arrested on instruction from the  head of the administration of a Riga district. Only when  President Guntis Ulmanis intervened and presented his apologies,  the Russian generals were released and the invaded installations  were freed.    According to Krylov, this "gross and unprecedented action  was  probably designed to provoke Russia to take retaliatory  measures." "The saddest thing is that it was launched at a time  when progress was being made at the Russian-Latvian talks in  Riga in regard to the key aspects concerning the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Latvia," he noted.</p>

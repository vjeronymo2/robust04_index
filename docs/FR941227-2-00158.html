			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against type or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted by the federal government; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Program measures relating to the use of light procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in FAR Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, request for project grant must be submitted to the Airports District Office at the location identified in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> clause above. The City of South Lake Tahoe submitted to the FAA on September 24, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January 1984 through December 1991. The Lake Tahoe Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on May 18, 1994. Notice of this determination was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lake Tahoe Airport Study contains proposed noise compatibility program comprised on actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to (or beyond) the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 14, 1994, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180-days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-days period shall be deemed to be an approval of such a program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted program contained seventeen (17) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Associate Administrator for Airports effective November 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for thirteen (13) of the specific program elements. The approved elements included existing noise abatement procedures, preferential runway use procedures, runup policies, request FAA advisories, noise abatement program, noise monitoring system, rezoning, navigation easements, and property purchase options. Four (4) program elements were disapproved for purposes of Part 150 pending submission of sufficient information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports on November 14, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the City of South Lake Tahoe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Hawthorne, California on November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert C.

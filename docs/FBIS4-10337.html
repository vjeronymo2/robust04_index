			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with elected constituent member Carlos "Chacho" </F> Alvarez, founder of the Grand Front, by unidentified reporter on  10 April; place not given]    [Text] [LA PRENSA] How would you define the Grand Front?    [Alvarez] The Grand Front is a center-left movement. I  define  it as an open political alternative aimed at recovering values  that the Argentine people are losing.    I do not know if the fact that we propose modernizing the  economy with emphasis on social aspects means that we are on the  government's left. But we think Argentina must be more equitable  and balanced.    [LA PRENSA] Do you identify yourself with any European  socialist movement?    [Alvarez] I think there is a models' crisis. Marxism failed.  The authoritarian socialist systems collapsed. Social democratic  movements also have failed in their aim of creating more  equitable societies. The idea of a fundamentalist market system  also has failed. The opposite is happening; there is an increase  in racism and xenophobia.    Our challenge is to create a new model. This model does not  have to look like any of the options currently dominating the  international scene.    [LA PRENSA] If you controlled the public administration,  what  type of model would you implement?    [Alvarez] It is difficult at first to place ourselves in a  different situation than the present one. We represent Argentine  society's need for an efficient political force to control  excesses and abuse of power.    We will try to develop an alternative economic program after  the election for constituent members is over.    Our growth must be gradual. We must institutionalize the  Grand Front as a political force first.    [LA PRENSA] Is it true, as comments have it, that you are  working on a mini-cabinet to eventually run for mayor?    [Alvarez] I am not tied to any candidacy. I want to be part  of a political project capable of becoming a government  alternative.    We made this clear to the Socialist Party. We proposed the  name of Socialist Party followers to head our tickets in this  election.    However, we are going to work on city matters because the  people are not going to vote for us to rule the country unless  we show that we are efficient administrators of a local  government.    [LA PRENSA] But neither will they vote for you to administer  the city unless you explain what you intend to do first.    [Alvarez] Correct. We must develop a clear administration  and  government alternative and show that corruption in the public  administration is not fortuitous. Corruption is systemic,  structural, and is affecting the operation of services that are  indispensable for the development of a better standard of  living. For instance, the most pessimistic estimates of the  black money circulating in our financial system is around $4  billion per year.    [LA PRENSA] Are your remarks that stability is an important  achievement and that you will maintain it, indications of the  Grand Front's economic project?    [Alvarez] It would be silly to deny the importance of  stability. We believe that stability is undeniably beneficial  for society, but we must face the problems that stability alone  cannot solve.    [LA PRENSA] Do you believe in privatizations?    [Alvarez] We must study them on a case-by-case basis. It is  an instrument that we do not reject.    I do not think we can talk about a [Economy Minister  Domingo]  Cavallo model. There are instruments. We must analyze them one  by one. We do not have ideological prejudices against the  instrument of privatization.    But we must always analyze privatizations case by case. For  instance, we believe that the privatization of Aerolineas  Argentinas was very bad because we now have a single airline and  it is in foreign hands. We know we cannot reverse the process  but we want to discuss efficiency, service quality, and fare  structure.    In sum, we agree with some privatizations and disagree with  others.    In the same way, we do not think it is prehistoric to  discuss  if the state could have efficiently administered some profitable  companies, as occurs in other parts of the world.    [LA PRENSA] What about the economic opening?    [Alvarez] The opening process bets on Argentine companies'  improved competitiveness. We propose a different opening model,  making sure -- as is done by the most advanced countries in the  world -- that some industries have the necessary level of  competitiveness and insertion into the world. The idea is to  design an economic system between the private sector and a state  that guides, establishes the infrastructure, and seeks  competitiveness.    If we leave everything in the hands of the market's  spontaneous development we may end up without production of  goods with high added value. I do not think it is bad for the  state to help private companies.    [LA PRENSA] Could Patricio Aylwin's government be an example  of your policies?    [Alvarez] The Chilean model developed in stages. First, the  government sought an efficient economic plan, with a  not-too-dogmatic vision. There is, for instance, a Chile Fund  that helps small- and medium-size companies become competitive  in the world.    But the system also forgot areas that remained on the  sidelines and at the margin of the ideological reconversion.    I do not think Argentina should wait for a new government to  begin looking at the areas that were left aside.</p>

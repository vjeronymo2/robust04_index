			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Takare shows 89% advance as expansion continues TAKARE, the nursing group for elderly and chronically ill patients, lifted pre-tax profits by 89 per cent, from Pounds 2.99m to Pounds 5.63m, in the six months to June 30. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the rise was 'fully in line with our expectations', and added that the financial growth reflected the physical expansion of the group - during the first half a further 720 beds were added to bring the total in operation to 3,345. The company said that the scheduling of beds was weighted towards the first half. There are another 1,455 beds under construction and by the year-end Takare expects to have more than 5,700 beds in operation or under construction. Since it gained its full listing in April 1989, the company has raised some Pounds 74.7m in equity issues and there have been Pounds 50m of debenture issues. Turnover rose to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 12.4m) and earnings per share advanced by 33 per cent to 5.7p (4.3p). The average number of shares in issue in the half was 88.9m, against 62.9m in the corresponding period. The interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.5p). Some 32 per cent of Takare's patients are contracted from the National Health Service, 54 per cent are private patients means tested and underpinned by Income Support, and 14 per cent pay their own way. Mr Bradshaw said the government's as yet unrevealed plans for reforming community care would change the way that Takare would be paid. The DSS Income Support umbrella would be withdrawn and the so-called 'Algebra Formula' would come into play. Nursing home care would then be funded in part from the DSS and in part from local health authorities. Mr Bradshaw was confident Takare would not suffer as a result. COMMENT The number of old and chronically ill patients will steadily increase, so Takare, as an expanding provider of care, should continue its already impressive progress. However, the cycle of good results might be dented by the government's reforms scheduled for next April. At the moment, uncertainty is the problem; later, being paid by two masters might be. Recruiting good enough middle management to run the growing number of homes is likely to be a more consistent problem. Further demands on shareholders will arise, though not before September 1993, as Takare has promised. Forecasts of Pounds 11.8m pre-tax for the full-year give earnings of 12.1p per share and a prospective multiple of 16. This is not too steep in the context of continuing earnings growth.</p>

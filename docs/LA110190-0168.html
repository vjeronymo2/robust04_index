			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOES ATTACK COUNTY STUDY OF 3 CANYONS AS LANDFILL SITES  </P> <P> About 200 homeowners, schoolchildren and politicians met at a scenic spot off  Mulholland Drive on Tuesday to condemn a county report naming three Santa  Monica Mountains canyons as potential landfill sites.  </P> <P> With placards declaring "It Stinks" and other angry slogans, the landfill  opponents cheered on elected officials who threatened legal and legislative  action if the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts dump garbage in Mission,  Rustic and Sullivan canyons.  </P> <P> "I am absolutely appalled that anybody would think we need anything like a dump  site here," state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) told the gathering  near the Bel-Air Skycrest subdivision. "I am going to do everything I possibly  can to prevent this from happening."  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), through a spokeswoman, called on  sanitation officials to cross the canyons off their landfill list and said  their use would violate a federal law protecting land in national parks from  being used for garbage dumps.  </P> <P> Although the Sanitation Districts own Rustic and Sullivan canyons and Los  Angeles County owns Mission Canyon, all three lie within the boundaries of the  Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which just received $12  million in federal funds for land acquisition.  </P> <P> The Sanitation Districts have pledged that the three Westside canyons would be  exempt from landfill development if the Santa Clarita Valley's Elsmere Canyon  becomes a regional garbage dump. But protesters Tuesday said they were alarmed  that a recent study still lists Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons as  possible landfill sites.  </P> <P> The three canyons are all just south of Mulholland Drive and west of the San  Diego Freeway, in the hills above Brentwood.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, accused the Sanitation Districts of "trying to splinter the forces  against landfills" by making the Westside canyons' exemption contingent upon  the development of a landfill in Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> Towsley Canyon, also in the Santa Clarita Valley, and Blind Canyon, in the  Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, are also named as possible landfill  sites in the study.  </P> <P> The controversial study, a draft environmental impact report on a countywide  trash-management plan, has been the subject of continuing public hearings since  its release Aug. 31.  </P> <P> Grace Chan, the Sanitation Districts planner who supervised the study, said  public comments will be accepted until Dec. 3, after which the report will be  completed and submitted to the Sanitation Districts' Board of Directors for  final approval. The deadline for public response had been today, the reason for  Tuesday's rally. Chan said the report also addresses recycling trash and  hauling it to remote areas by train.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), City Councilman Marvin Braude  and David Gackenbach, superintendent of the national recreation area, were  among the officials present.  </P> <P> About 22 fifth-graders from the private Westland School, adjacent to Mission  Canyon, attended to call attention to the potential health hazards of a  landfill.  </P></p>

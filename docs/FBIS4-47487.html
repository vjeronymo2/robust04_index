D. Mukhamedyarov, doctor of technical </F> sciences; UDC 621.383.8]    [Abstract] The properties and advantages of optoelectronic  instruments with a symmetric input are reviewed, including the  author's initial work along these lines. However, the emphasis  here is explanation of the theoretical and practical basis for  the algebraic-geometric synthesis of the structure of two- and  three-channel optoelectronic systems with a symmetric input  involving the two geometric operations of shifting and rotation  of the input transducers and six algebraic operations in the  electronic channel. This makes it possible to obtain new  synergetic functional capabilities -- the combining of system  elements and components resulting in a considerably greater  effect than with their simple addition, thereby achieving a  considerably higher quality level. This ensures obtaining a  linear zone of the output function with a prestipulated  accuracy; control of steepness (response) and range of the  output function from tenths of a unit to several thousands;  invariance to the strength of the input signals; reduction of  the errors associated with nonidentity of the channels by a  factor of ten. Accordingly, the accuracy of three-channel  systems is an order of magnitude greater than for two-channel  systems. The practical introduction of this method in the  designing and fabrication of various specialized instruments  will make it possible to reduce their size and weight by a  factor of 3-8, considerably enhance their useful life and  reliability.

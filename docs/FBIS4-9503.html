			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Peter Zwack, chairman of the </F> Liberal Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party; place and date not  given: "List Leaders Give Interviews -- Zwack: The Party of  Economic Conscience"]    [Text] In our election series, the list leaders of parties  that set up national lists are giving interviews on the typical  program points and concepts of their parties. In reply to our  question, Peter Zwack, chairman of the Liberal Civic  Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party [LPSZ-VP], said that they would  like as many entrepreneurs as possible to get into parliament  because it is impossible to base a successful economic policy on  ideologies.    [Zwack] We want to represent the interests of small and  medium sized enterprises. Initially, our organization was  called Entrepreneurs' Party and we later added the name Liberal  Civic Alliance to this. This expresses our intention also to  open toward the intellectual entrepreneurs, namely lawyers,  doctors, and so on. At the moment, Hungary does not have a  strong middle class, therefore, the LPSZ-VP mainly deals with  economic issues. This party is something unique to Hungary, we  could call ourselves the party of economic conscience. We  intend to help as many entrepreneurs as possible into  Parliament. We would be happy to end our operation in eight to  12 years' time if the economic processes get to a level where  our party is no longer needed.    We find it unfortunate that the current coalition was  organized on an ideological basis and the professional  viewpoints were pushed into the background. The Christian and  popular-national way of thinking is respectable but an economic  policy cannot be based on this. In our view, the serious  economic crisis is partly due to the fact that the government  did not have a clear economic policy that could have been  followed. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to create  enterprises.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The LPSZ-VP is part of the four-party  liberal cooperation. In view of the various polemic statements,  how stable do you think the liberal bloc is?    [Zwack] The alliance is more stable than the media often  allows people to believe, although arguments certainly do exist  between the leaders of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  and the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]. Prime Minister  Peter Boross is applying clever tactics when he says that a  contest of the left wing and the coalition can be expected at  the elections. In contrast to this, the experience of setting  up the candidates shows that the liberal bloc is so strong that  even if it does not reach 50 percent, it will be able to choose  its coalition partners. As a matter of fact, in my view, a  responsible prime minister cannot state that the country will  not have a stable government unless the current coalition wins.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What are your views on your party's election  chances, with special reference to the fact that, according to  the surveys, the LPSZ-VP's current support does not reach the 5  percent necessary to get into Parliament?    [Zwack] It is unfortunate that we did not manage to set up a  list in Budapest in the end. At the same time, we put up 69  individual candidates and we have regional lists in 14 counties.  We are doing all we can to get into Parliament, but even if we  do not succeed in this, our party will play a more important  role in the future than now. Our link with the entrepreneurs  may upgrade our role, among our allies are those liberal parties  that we hope will be determining forces in the next government.  We will suggest the establishment of an economic top ministry,  an advisory body for the future prime minister, which will  consist of small and medium entrepreneurs, and the introduction  of a two-chamber parliamentary system.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If the parties of the liberal bloc do not  reach 50 percent, you will have to think about the potential  coalition partners. It is obvious that two alternatives exist:  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] or the current coalition  parties. Has the LPSZ-VP formed its stance on this?    [Zwack] Not yet, and this issue was not discussed at the  latest meeting of the four liberal parties, either. We will be  able to decide with whom to form a coalition when the election  results are known. We agreed that we will do all we can for the  best possible election performance of the liberal bloc and that  we will begin coordination talks on the future government  program. We can be certain about one thing: The better our  results are at the elections, the fewer compromises we will have  to accept when the coalition is formed.</p>

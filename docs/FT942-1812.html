			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus remains confident despite fall in share price Shares in Lotus Development plunged by more than a quarter in New York yesterday morning following the US software group's gloomy sales and profits projections the night before. The heavy selling came in the wake of growing disenchantment in the investment community in recent months, prompted by slowing sales of the company's applications software products, which account for 70 per cent of revenues. At the close of trading the shares were Dollars 37, down Dollars 14 3/8 . This capitalised the shares at less than half the level reached at their peak in mid-March, when it they were valued at Dollars 3.9bn. Lotus continued to maintain yesterday that its long-term prospects remained unaffected by the profits warning. It blamed the share price fall on its failure to meet market expectations for one quarter. 'We've sinned in that regard,' said Mr Robert Schechter, senior vice-president for international business. 'But over the long run, we feel very, very confident.' He said that the company's fast-growing communications software products, which already account for 30 per cent of sales, continued to experience growth which was 'at or ahead of expectations'. The Massachusetts-based company had warned that sales in the second quarter, to the end of June, would be Dollars 230m-Dollars 240m, roughly level with the previous year, and that earnings per share would be 20-25 cents. Most analysts had been expecting close to 50 cents a share. It revised its earnings per share projection for the year as a whole to Dollars 1.80-Dollars 2, down from its earlier forecast of Dollars 2-Dollars 2.15. The company said the sales fall-off was due to delays in the release of a number of upgrades to its biggest applications software products, including 1-2-3, a spreadsheet package, and Approach, a database product. This was caused by development delays, related to difficulties in integrating the various products and integrating them with the company's popular Notes communications software. Lotus' shares are now back at the level last seen at the end of last summer. Their run-up through to March was based on optimism over the company's communications software, one field where it is regarded as being ahead of arch-rival Microsoft.</p>

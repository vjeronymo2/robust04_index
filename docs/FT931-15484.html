			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WORRIES ABOUT the poor economic outlook led to a dull day in both stock index futures and traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. Early firmness for the March FT-SE future contract, which opened at 2,797, faded and the contract fell to 2,784 at around 10.30am as profit-taking became the order. March regained momentum to trade uneventfully for the next few hours, before traders caused another sell-off at around 2.30pm as they focused on the weakness in the gilts market due to the imminent auction and a lack of strong support from Wall Street. Sellers continued to emerge for the rest of the session, sending the contract further into retreat and pulling the underlying cash market lower. March fell to the session's low of 2,770 just ahead of the close. Light bargain hunting helped the contract recover a little to finish at 2,774, down 21 from Monday's close and some 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 14. Turnover fell to 6,542 lots. Volumes were also down in the traded options. The day's total of 26,739 was well below Monday's 34,506 lots. Some 10,929 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, although the Euro FT-SE 100 option only saw 311 lots transacted. J. Sainsbury was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,211 lots traded, followed by Grand Metropolitan with 1,106 contracts.</p>

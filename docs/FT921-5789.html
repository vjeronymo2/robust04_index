			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Share option gains of 90 per cent seen DIRECTORS typically make gains of more than 90 per cent on the value of their share options, according to a survey by Incomes Data Services, a research company. The highest gain reported is a Pounds 2m profit made by a director of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group. The findings are based on a sample of 113 options exercised by directors of 41 companies during the fourth quarter of last year. Share option schemes give executives the right to buy shares in their company in the future at the current market price. The survey finds that directors typically exercise their share options after four years. Three quarters of the options reported in the survey were exercised within five years of being granted. A link is seen between the length of time an option is held and the profits made. The 25 best-performing options were held for an average of 5 1/2 years, while the 25 worst-performing options were held for less than four years. Some high-performing options, such as a 789 per cent gain on an option granted by Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal company, resulted in a large gap between the median profit of 93 per cent and the average percentage profit of 127 per cent. The median profit in cash terms reported in the survey is nearly Pounds 62,000. Some 17 of the top 25 options made a profit of more than Pounds 200,000. A separate survey by Paisner, the law firm, shows that more than 20 per cent of the companies which joined the stock market last year set up employee share-ownership plans. That survey suggests that there was an expansion in the numbers of employee plans and a steep decline in the number of senior executives with large share profits compared with previous years. The best endowed plan, at Pounds 5.3m, belonged to JIB Group, the insurance broker. Top Pay Unit Review. Incomes Data, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS. Wider Share Ownership.

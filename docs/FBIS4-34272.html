			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Elvira Lobato] </F>   [Text] The Communications Ministry records of radio and  television station shareholders show that the Brazilian market  has a great radio broadcasting empire headed by the family of  businessman Roberto Marinho.    The listing of franchises recorded at the Communications  Ministry shows that the Marinho family has the largest number of  main stations in markets where the purchasing power is greatest.    The Marinho family has stations in Brasilia, Recife, and Rio  de Janeiro. It has four of its own and two in partnership in  the state of Sao Paulo; two of its own and one in partnership in  Minas Gerais; and four more in partnership in Parana State.    The SBT (Brazilian Television System) of the Silvio Santos  group has nine television stations in the name of companies that  belong to the Abravanel family (Abravanel is the surname of  Silvio Santos).    The group has six franchises in the southeastern region  (four  in Sao Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro), one in Rio Grande do  Sul, one in Brasilia, and another in Para.    The Saad family, which owns the Bandeirantes network, has  four television franchises in the state of Sao Paulo, and one in  each of the following capitals: Curitiba, Brasilia, Belo  Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.    The Saad and Sirotsky families hold the largest number of  radio stations; each own 21 stations.    The Manchete group, according to Communications Ministry  records, has three stations in the southeastern region (Sao  Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Rio de Janeiro) and two in the  northeast: Fortaleza and Recife.    According to a survey conducted by Intermeios (of the  magazine MEIO &amp; MENSAGEM [MEDIA AND MESSAGE]), the amount  collected from advertisements by television stations last year  was approximately $1.3 billion, while the amount collected by  radios was approximately $100 million.    The market estimate is that Globo and its affiliated members  collect more than 60 percent of the money obtained from  television adverstisements, while SBT and its affiliated members  receive around 20 percent.    The strongest radio broadcasting groups in the country are  affiliated with Rede Globo, as are the stations belonging to the  most influential political leaders, which increases Roberto  Marinho's political power.    In the southern part of the country the market is dominated  by the Sirotsky family, owner of the RBS [Rede Brasiliera do  Sul] network, affiliated with Globo. Members of the family have  10 television franchises in Rio Grande do Sul (plus two under  its administration by commercial agreement), and three in Santa  Catarina.    In addition to the south, the Sirotsky family also appears  as  shareholders of one station of Itapemirim television, in  Cachoeiro do Itapemirim. The shareholder of this company is the  Gazeta group from Espiritu Santo, which is also affiliated with  Globo.    In the northern region, the Amazonas Radio and Television  group, which belongs to the Daou family, has main stations --  affiliated with Globo -- in Roraima, Rondonia, Acre, Amapa, and  Amazonas. It is the strongest group in the region.    In the central west, the two strongest groups -- the Camara  family in Goias and Tocantins, and the Zahran family (Mato  Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso) -- are also affiliated with  Globo. The Camara family has seven television and 12 radio  franchises, while the Zahran family has four television and one  radio franchise.    In the northeast, the only group that has franchises in more  than one state is the Jereissati family (Verdes Mares group):  two radio and one television station in Ceara (affiliated with  Globo), one radio station in Rio de Janeiro, and another in  Alagoas.    The strongest local groups in the largest northeastern  states  are linked to politicians.    In Bahia, Federal Deputy Pedro Irujo Yaniz (PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party]) has two television franchises  (affiliated with the SBT) and four radio stations. His son Luiz  Pedro Irujo is a partner of the Marinho family in two Globo  radios in the state.    The main Bahia State television station affiliated with  Globo  is TV Bahia, which has among its shareholders federal Deputy  Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (PFL [Liberal Front Party]), son of  former Communications Minister and former Governor Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes, and Cesar Mata Pires, Carlos Magalhaes'  son-in-law.    In Sergipe, the family of Senator Albano Franco (PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]) makes up the strongest radio  broadcasting group: It has two television stations (one  affiliated with Globo and another with SBT), and three radio  franchises.    In Alagoas and in Maranhao, the stations affiliated with  Globo belong to the families of two former presidents of the  Republic.    In Maranhao, TV Mirante, affiliated with Globo, is listed as  being under the name of Jose Sarney's sons (1985-90), who also  own four radio stations.    Former President Fernando Collor de Mello (1990-92) is among  the shareholders of Gazeta TV, affiliated with Globo, in Alagoas.    In Rio Grande do Norte, former Regional Intergration  Minister  Aluizio Alves is among the main partners of TV Cabugi,  affiliated with Globo.</p>

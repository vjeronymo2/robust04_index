			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MEASURES FAIL AFTER DEBATE ON RELIGION  </P> <P> Shortly before she was elected mayor, Sally Anne Sheridan said she would bring  peace to City Hall by practicing a less-divisive form of leadership. The City  Council majority, led by Mayor Larry Agran, had created political rifts with  the public over issues he supported, she said.  </P> <P> But more than a dozen speakers at Tuesday night's City Council meeting accused  Sheridan and council ally Barry J. Hammond, elected in June, of driving a wedge  between residents by trying to bring religion into city business.  </P> <P> For more than four hours, residents and council members debated the merits of  measures providing for a Christmas tree in the City Hall plaza and for  beginning council meetings with a moment of silence.  </P> <P> Both measures failed, although the council voted unanimously to create a  special task force to study opening the plaza to holiday celebrations  throughout the year.  </P> <P> Several speakers, including rabbis and Christian pastors, spoke against the  measures, saying a Christmas tree and "silent invocation" would inject religion  into government, discomfiting residents who do not share the majority's  religious beliefs.  </P> <P> Councilman Hammond, though, said a "holiday tree" would be a symbol of the  season and would not endorse or promote religion.  </P> <P> Several Irvine residents disagreed.  </P> <P> "To me, a tree is only a symbol of religion," said Coralia Maier, 17, a student  at Woodbridge High School. "And I would like to remind the City Council that  not all of us share this religion."  </P> <P> "Please don't try to make this a secular issue," said Robin Kale, 36, a data  processing consultant. "A tree with lights on it in December is for a holiday,  and it's not mine."  </P> <P> Councilman William A. (Art) Bloomer, who voted with Councilwoman Paula Werner  to defeat the Christmas tree and invocation plans, said both issues are better  left alone.  </P> <P> "I believe it is time to get rid of the divisiveness," Bloomer said. "It is not  the time for us to get involved in religious issues at City Hall."  </P> <P> But Hammond, who supported both measures, said the issues were not divisive.  Instead, he said, a small number of residents who oppose the current council  majority were trying to defeat the measures in order to create issues for  debate.  </P> <P> While some of the speakers at Tuesday's meeting were expressing genuine  opposition to the measures, most were simply voicing political opposition to  the new council members, he said.  </P> <P> "This is a group of people who, in my mind, are trying to make an issue out of  anything they can," Hammond said.  </P> <P> Hammond said he suggested starting council meetings with a silent invocation  because at least 50 residents have asked him to bring up the issue.  </P> <P> Most city councils in Orange County begin meetings with a short  nondenominational prayer. By adding a silent invocation, Irvine would be doing  nothing unusual, Hammond said.  </P> <P> "The issue is not whether we can offend anybody," Hammond said. "It's what's  the policy for the city that will offend the least number of people." TOM  McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francois de Guillebon: "French-Chinese Trade: </F> The Balladur Effect"]    [Text] Is [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's trip to China  beginning to yield results? This is now a question worth asking  after Friday's [13 May] visit of Beijing Mayor Li Quiyan in  Paris, which resulted in various companies announcing  partnership agreements. Manufacturers had been calling  insistently for improved bilateral relations, whose past  acrimony had slowed the progression of trade agreements and  investment in China.    The positive impact of Edouard Balladur's trip to China in  early April had been rather overshadowed by internal policy  disputes triggered by the various arrests of dissidents in  Beijing. People soon seemed to ignore the trip's actual goal:  To put an end to the crisis following the sale of aircraft to  Taiwan and to restore relations between Paris and Beijing.  However, in a few weeks' time, French companies have managed to  successfully expand their activities in China.    GEC Alsthom, which was defeated in the competition for the  Canton subway, announced yesterday that it had signed a letter  of intent for the creation of a joint venture near Beijing which  will manufacture steam turbines and alternators for nuclear  plants. As for Lafarge-Coppee, it is tackling the Chinese  cement market (350 million tonnes per year and a 10-percent  growth rate). It signed an agreement with the Beijing city  authorities involving the establishment of a joint venture.  Later this year, Carnaud-Metalbox will begin with the  construction of a plant for beverage cans capable of producing  500 million cans per year to meet the demand of local and  international brewers.    "Diplomatic relations between France and China have improved  greatly following the visit of the prime minister," the company  says. "This undoubtedly helped us win this contract, which is  worth almost Fr200 million. But one must also mention the years  of talks, meetings, trips, and negotiations."    There is action on the agro-food market as well. On  Wednesday, the Danone group, formerly BSN, signed an agreement  involving the creation of a joint venture on a number of  products that remain to be identified, with the exception of the  group's leading product: Danone yogurt. Pernod-Ricard has also  created a joint venture with Beijing Winery for the production  of 11 million bottles of wines and vermouths worth Fr80 million.  Pernod-Ricard will be hard-pressed to compete with  Remy-Cointreau, whose cognac has been enjoying a good reputation  in the Chinese community in Singapore and Malaysia since 1979.  "Drinking cognac is a sign of success, it is the trendy thing  to do," the company explains. Since 1980, two joint ventures  have been established. The first produces a wine called Dinasty  on a site 120 kilometers from Beijing and has now reached the  10-million-bottle mark. The second produces a sparkling wine  based on the champagne method, called Imperial Court. Its first  vintage won instant approval last year with 150,000 bottles sold.    Last March, Degremont, a Lyonnaise des Eaux subsidiary and  the world leader in water processing, announced five contracts  for the design and construction of waste water reprocessing  plants. The company first established itself in China as early  as 1987; today it has 25 plants in the country. Because it had  been largely benefiting from financial grants by France,  Degremont was hit by the tension between Paris and Beijing  caused by the Tiananmen massacre and by the susbsequent sale of  aircraft to Taiwan. As a result, there were no new developments  between 1990 and 1993. The company is currently seeking to end  its dependence on the state's changing moods and is pleased to  note that more and more contracts are funded with Chinese  capital.</p>

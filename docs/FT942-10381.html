			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Lilley aims to ease fears over post offices Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, will today unveil measures to boost rural post offices in a move to ease backbenchers' fears over proposals to privatise the Post Office. In a speech to the Federation of Sub-Postmasters, which represents 19,000 sub-post offices, he will commit the government to strengthening the post office network by making it easier to pay benefits across post office counters. The Department of Trade and Industry is still finalising its 22-month review of the Post Office, which favours privatisation. Mr Lilley, who is understood to favour the flotation of the Royal Mail, the letters division, and Parcelforce, the parcels arm, will make it clear that his reforms to post office counters will remain in place irrespective of the government's review. A significant number of Tory backbenchers oppose privatisation because of the perceived threat to the rural post offices, many of which rely on a subsidy from the Post Office. Their fears were increased last year when Mr Lilley announced an expanded range of benefits available for payment direct to bank and building society accounts, which is seen as a threat to the post office network. However, the government made clear that the system would not be made compulsory. Mr Lilley will today attempt to assure both backbenchers and sub-postmasters that there is no fear that large numbers of post offices face closure. He has decided to make benefit payments through post offices more secure by introducing three main reforms: The use of bar codes on benefit books will be extended to clamp down on fraud. Computer terminals will be installed in post offices, to enable postmasters to verify claimants. Benefit books will be replaced in the medium term with special payment cards designed to cut theft and fraud. Ministers believe Labour has mounted a 'scare campaign' about the threat of automated credit transfer in its campaign against privatisation. Mr Lilley intends to use his speech today to assure the postmasters that the government needs the post office network to deliver benefits and that many people would still prefer payment across the counter. He is also known to support the DTI's favoured method of privatising the Royal Mail and its parcels arm, which would leave Post Office Counters - responsible for the sub-post offices - in the public sector. His speech coincides with a campaign by Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, to win over MPs to the merits of more commercialisation or privatisation by stressing his commitment to the rural post offices.</p>

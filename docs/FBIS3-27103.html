			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Profits Rise 62 Percent"] </F>   [Text] China's industry generated 145 billion yuan ($16.9  billion) in profits last year, representing growth of more than  62 per cent over the previous year.    And last year's sales were 42 per cent up on 1992, the State  Statistics Bureau said yesterday.    Encouraged by the rise in profits and sales, Chinese  factories have been busy gearing up industrial production since  the beginning of the year, according to bureau economists.    Output in January this year jumped by more than 33 per cent  over the same period last year.    The bureau has not released sales and profits for this  January. But January's sales of finished products were 1.3 per  cent up on the corresponding month in the previous year.    However, the loss-making factories which are sitting on  large  amounts of raw materials and stocks still pose a big headache  for China's industrial development.    Most loss-making factories are State-owned enterprises.    And over one quarter of firms in the State-dominated heavy  industry sector reported operating losses last year.    The performance of these loss-makers was considered  particularly poor given that more than 68 per cent of last  year's profits were generated by heavy industry.    Industry will have to improve efficiency as well as gear up  production, according to the bureau.    Industrial production should slow down a bit this year due  to  the government's brakes-on industrial development policy, which  aims to safeguard the health of the national economy.    The central government's targeted growth of industrial  production should be slightly above 20 per cent this year, which  is essential for ensuring a 9 per cent of GDP growth in China,  official sources say.    The bureau also said that the industrial production in  coastal areas is better than that of the country's land-locked  regions.    Industrial enterprises in East China's coastal Shandong  Province topped last year's output and sales league in the  country.    However, Shanxi Province, a major coal producer in North  China, came bottom, according to the bureau.</p>

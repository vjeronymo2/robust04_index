			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Battle to defend premium brands THESE are difficult times for producers of deluxe brands of Scotch whisky and champagne. The problems of recession in their largest markets worldwide have been compounded by over-production. Prices have come under pressure from value-hunting consumers and from cut-price products. Some investors have begun to question whether consumers will ever again pay premium prices for a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky or Moet et Chandon champagne. 'I have absolutely no doubt that as economic conditions improve, consumers will move back to strong premium brands,' Mr Anthony Greener, Guinness chairman, said yesterday. In the US, sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label and Dewar's whiskies were already beginning to pick up as the recession receded. With a maturation period of five or six years, it has always been difficult to balance Scotch production with demand. The industry is now exercising more control than it did a decade ago. Guinness has moth-balled four malt distilleries this year and production is down to two thirds of capacity. But the imbalance cannot be corrected quickly. Some suppliers have been able to buy whisky cheaply on the open market, blend it, bottle it and sell it at knock-down prices to large retailers. These tertiary brands, priced as low as Pounds 7.99p a bottle in the UK, have sold well. They, together with low inflation, have restrained the price of premium brands - Guinness's price increases this year have averaged 2 per cent. The market has polarised. For some consumers value-for-money means buying the cheapest; for others it means perhaps drinking less, but buying high quality, premium brands. 'We have not even thought of cutting prices,' Mr Greener said. 'We have a range of brands that we can position at different price points. To move existing brands downwards would put us on a slippery slope from which we would never recover.' The champagne industry, too, has been beset by the parallel problems of over-production and economic recession. This year the grand old champagne houses of Reims and Epernay in eastern France have experienced the toughest trading conditions in the industry's history. Earlier this year the difficulties were aggravated by the strength of the French franc, which had risen by up to 20 per cent against key European currencies - notably the lire, peseta and sterling. The strong franc made it more difficult for the champagne houses to maintain momentum in their export markets. It also raised the risk of 'parallel imports' being brought into France and Germany from weaker currency countries. The total market, which had fallen from a peak of 249m bottles in 1989 to 214m by 1992, was virtually flat in the first half of this year, according to the Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne. However, this disguises an increase in sales of low quality petits champagnes, dumped on the market for as little as FFr35 (Pounds 4) a bottle, squeezing the profitability of established brands. Many producers have been forced to cut prices. LVMH, the market leader, this spring tabled plans for the first ever redundancies in the industry. The champagne unions won a legal battle to block LVMH's proposed cuts. Price cuts and the recent fall in the franc's value seem to have some effect: the CIVC reports that sales of champagne have risen this autumn, 'but only very slightly'.</p>

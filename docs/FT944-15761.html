			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Observer: One step forward Absent from the massed military forces guarding the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince over the weekend were the fifty soldiers President Lech Walesa so readily promised Bill Clinton last month. But not for want of trying. The first hurdle was a reluctant domestic cabinet, miffed at Walesa's freelance activities, and initially unwilling to produce funds for tropical uniforms and medical jabs. But the defence ministry has finally stumped up and the troops are kitted out and awaiting an American aircraft. Only trouble is, they have now mustered so much equipment that a single machine may be insufficient. The US State Department counters that it is 'between financial years' and hence not in a position to fund additional transport. Oh, the trials of a country on the long march to NATO membership.</p>

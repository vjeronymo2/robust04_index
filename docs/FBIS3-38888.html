			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed P.-H.D.: "The `Foch' in the Adriatic"] </F>   [Text] France has decided to reinforce its presence in the  Adriatic. The Foch aircraft carrier is expected to leave for  the Adriatic sea tomorrow morning at the latest, with an escort  consisting of the Suffren missile-launcher frigate and the Meuse  refueling ship.    The three ships will join with the Ouragan landing-barge  transporter -- which has been carrying out the "Balbuzard"  national mission -- as well as the Cassard antiaircraft frigate  and the Commandant de Pimodan destroyer -- which have been  participating in Sharp Guard, the embargo control operation of  the WEU [Western European Union].    The Foch's air strike capabilities will include some 20  Super  Etendard jets as well as a number of Alize aircraft and  helicopters.    These will complement the French Air Force already present  in  Italy: 10 Mirage 2000 RDI air superiority fighters based in  Cervia (Italy); five Mirage F1 CR reconnaissance aircraft and  eight laser-guided assault Jaguar aircraft based in Istrana  (Italy); one C-35 refueler aircraft and one AWACS radar aircraft.    In addition to shipboard aircraft such as those on the U.S.  Saratoga carrier, over 120 U.S., British, French, Spanish,  Turkish, and Netherlands aircraft are based ashore around the  former Yugoslavia.    In total, it is estimated that NATO has over 160 aircraft  under its command in the region. The departure of the Foch for  the Adriatic sea will therefore assume a primarily political  meaning.    This meaning is meant to be all the stronger since the  government had to suspend the second testing campaign of the  marine version of the Rafale fighter aircraft on the Foch, which  was to take place mostly this week.</p>

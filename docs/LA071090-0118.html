			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: WHERE THE GRASS EATERS GROW: FOCUS;  </P> <P> TREES HAVE ROOTS IN PLACENTIA GRASS EATERS CULT  </P> <P> On the surface, its an unpretentious neighborhood. Nothing to write home about.  It's mostly an area of tract homes, a few small apartment complexes and a  private community thrown in for good measure.  </P> <P> It's the kind of neighborhood where Norman Rockwell would have set up his  canvas to capture towheaded boys charging down the streets on their bicycles,  or a group of teen-age girls giggling and chatting as they walk home from  school. It is an unaffected middle-class neighborhood where backboards sit  precariously perched over garages, motor homes intermittently dot the streets  and lawns are clipped weekly or biweekly by working families as time permits.  </P> <P> But it wasn't always that way. The only telltale sign of secrets past stands  inconspicuously on the neatly trimmed greenbelt of a private residential  street.  </P> <P> Sandwiched unceremoniously between the pool and tennis court are two macadamia  nut trees documented by a bronze plaque embedded in a brick platform. They are  the only living testimony of a bygone era and the existence of a colorful,  mysterious cult known as the Placentia Grass Eaters.  </P> <P> In 1837, Spain granted 35,790 acres to Juan Pacifico Ontiveros. Through a  series of transactions, the property ended up in the hands of a real estate  firm, the Robinson Trust. In 1872, the trust gave one of its agents, Col. J.K.  Tuffree, 662 acres as a wedding present.  </P> <P> Four years later, the colonel sold 24 acres of his land to George R. Hinde, the  found of a religious colony which ate only raw vegetables and fruits on the  theory that cooking destroys the spiritual essence of food, which they believed  to be the clothing of the soul.  </P> <P> Legend has it that Hinde, a transplanted New Yorker, promptly set about  erecting a huge, $10,000, two-story mansion in which all the members of the  colony cohabited, but did not commingle. Of particular interest to lookers-on  was the hulking, round turret tower. Rumor had it that all the rooms in the  mansion were round, because round rooms supposedly would ward off evil spirits  lurking in corners. So when Dr. Louis Schlesinger arrived from England to  become president of the colony, he began to conjure up those spirits regularly  and engage the group in seances and other strange spiritualist rites. It was  little wonder that while they called themselves Sociatas Fraterna, the  surrounding community dubbed them the Placentia Grass Eaters, and referred to  them as freaks, faddists and spooks.  </P> <P> But whatever the townspeople thought of them in a religious context, they  respected their green thumb and came from miles away to purchase their excess  crops. In 1883, Walter (Thales) Lockwood, a former Shaker minister, took over  both the cult and the property, and together with Hinde, began experimenting  with grafting fruit and nut trees. It was Hinde who is credited with developing  the Placentia perfection walnut, and the Hinde and Thales loquat also thrived  in the sect's orchards.  </P> <P> Those two famous macadamias, which stand as a historical landmark, were the  first such trees brought to California (circa 1884 by Hinde), along with litchi  nut trees, so the colony could sell its produce to the Chinese community  working in nearby celery fields and on the Pacific Railroad line.  </P> <P> Irrespective of the cult's historical savvy, the villagers still sensed there  were strange goings-on within the cloistered community. And when a child in the  colony died, chaos ensued.  </P> <P> A lawsuit was filed claiming the child had died of starvation, and rumors ran  rampant that the cult surreptitiously buried its deceased members in unmarked  graves by wrapping the body in a sheet, lowering it into a hole, dumping 100  pounds of quicklime over it along with some water and topping it off with fill  dirt. A second suit was filed when the society not only failed to officially  report births and deaths locally, but also refused to furnish pertinent  information to federal census-takers.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, though, the townspeople could have simply sat back and  let cultural evolution run its course. After all, a cult that doesn't commingle  will eventually cease to mingle at all. When Thales died in 1921, the property  was deeded to a woman who ran the colony with her son. However, the cult didn't  prosper during the 1920's, and S. James Tuffree, an heir of the colonel's,  bought the property back and demolished every one of the society's buildings in  1933. Alas, in doing so, he wiped out virtually every trace, memory or remnant  of the Placentia Grass Eaters.  </P> <P> But life goes on. Today the neighborhood is a docile setting full of Kodak  moments and Rockwellian images. But few would have ever known the folklore of  the venturous vegetarians were it not for two macadamia nut trees swaying  nonchalantly in the gentle Placentia breezes -- as if nothing has ever  happened.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 4,273  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +1.3%  </P> <P> Median Age: 27.5  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 81%  </P> <P> Latino: 8%  </P> <P> Black: 3%  </P> <P> Other: 8%  </P> <P> By sex and age: In hundreds  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 27.7 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 27.1 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $16,491  </P> <P> Median household: $34,212  </P> <P> Average household: $36,865  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 34%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 43%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 16%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 5%  </P> <P> $100,000 and more: 2%DALLAS M.

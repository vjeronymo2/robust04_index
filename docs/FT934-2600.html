			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: South African bank to invest Pounds 13m in Lloyd's One of South Africa's largest banks will today announce a Pounds 13m investment in a Lloyd's insurance subsidiary, providing a much needed fillip for the insurance market's initiative to attract corporate capital. Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa), a bank holding company with insurance interests, will invest about Pounds 6.5m in Absa Syndicate Investments (Absil), which will support about 12 syndicates with some Pounds 13m in capacity. Mr Louw Van Wyk, managing director of Absa Financial Services, said the bank already had a long-standing association with Lloyd's through its insurance and broking activities. Absil will work with the Wellington Members' Agency, one of the market's largest, which looks after the affairs of 600 Names. Mr Julian Avery, chairman of Wellington, said the Absa decision was particularly encouraging following the recent failure of a number of capital raising efforts. Last Monday Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance brokers, announced the withdrawal of their London Market Investors vehicle, which had aimed to raise Dollars 300m (Pounds 201m) for Lloyd's. Three UK trusts have also failed to gather support - Minories Investment Trust, Nelson Lloyd's Trust and Johnson Fry Corporate Insurance Recovery Fund. Another US fund, Lutine Capital Corporation, has experienced difficulties in persuading enough US investors to support another Dollars 300m initiative and could fail to meet its minimum capital target of Dollars 200m by a December 15 deadline. Overall however, investment trusts and insurance companies have committed more than Pounds 860m in capital to the Lloyd's market, with Lloyd's easily exceeding its initial target of Pounds 500m. Absa was formed in early 1991, following an agreement to merge the interests of the former Allied, United and Volkskas banking groups.</p>

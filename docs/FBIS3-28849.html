			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) --  Arrangements are being made to fly back the first of 10  British-made Hawk 100 advanced jet trainers purchased by  Malaysia at the end of the month, Royal Malaysian Air Force  (RMAF) officials said Monday. RMAF pilots would be flying the  aircraft from Britain to its new home at the RMAF air base in  Butterworth, better known as Malaysia's fightertown. The  officials said the nine other Hawk 100 would be delivered by  British Aerospace (BAe) in batches until the end of the year.  [passage omitted]    The Hawk 100s were bought under the RM [Ringgit Malaysia]  2.4  billion memorandum of understanding [MOU] signed between  Malaysia and Britain in 1988. The RMAF also ordered 18 hawk 200  aircraft under the same agreement. The RMAF would be the first  air force in the region to fly the British-made aircraft.  Indonesia is reported to be buying the aircraft too. [passage  omitted]    The MOU also provides fog training of RMAF pilots and ground  crew, including technicians, under an offset programme. A total  of 69 RMAF technicians would be attending 20 types of courses.  Four selected RMAF pilots, who completed a three-year training  programme, would become instructors on the creation of a new  squadron at the Butterworth air base. [passage omitted]    In December 1990, Malaysia reached agreement under the same  MOU for a rm400 million offset deal involving technology  transfer to Malaysian defence-related industries such as  Syarikat Malaysia Explosives, the country's ordnance  manufacturer and AIROD Sdn. Bhd. [Company Limited], Malaysia's  privatised aircraft and overhaul facilities.    The offset programme, for the local manufacture of air  delivered ordnance and ammunition (bombs and missiles), ground  support equipment, aircraft components, repair and overhaul  services would enable Malaysia to be self-sufficient in the  support of the fleet of Hawk aircraft.</p>

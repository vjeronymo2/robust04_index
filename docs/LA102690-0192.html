			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GOLDEN STATE FWY. SNARLED BY CAR-TRUCK ACCIDENT IN NEWHALL  </P> <P> One person was injured and southbound traffic on the Golden State Freeway  backed up four miles this morning in Newhall when a car slid underneath a big  rig trailer and then crashed into another truck, the California Highway Patrol  reported.  </P> <P> The 8 a.m. accident just south of Calgrove Boulevard forced the closure of  three lanes for about an hour, CHP Officer A. J. Torres said.  </P> <P> The CHP said Michelle LeClair of Valencia was driving south on the freeway at a  high speed when she swerved to her right to avoid a slower-moving car in her  lane. LeClair's convertible Ford Mustang crossed one lane and then went  underneath the trailer of a tractor-trailer rig driven by Ron Read, 38, of  Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> "She went completely under the trailer and through and then hit a truck that  was next to it," Torres said.  </P> <P> The second tractor-trailer rig was driven by Willie Mann, 57, of Ontario. The  Mustang rebounded from the collision and partially went back underneath the  trailer driven by Read, the CHP said.  </P> <P> The Mustang was dragged underneath the trailer, which was carrying a load of  frozen pies, about 100 feet before it came to a stop. LeClair was trapped in  the wreckage for about 20 minutes before being removed by Los Angeles County  firefighters and taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital for treatment of  injuries.  </P> <P> The accident closed the southbound freeway to one lane for nearly an hour.  Torres said traffic backed up to McBean Parkway before two lanes were reopened  about 9 a.m. The fourth lane was opened about 10 a.m.  </P></p>

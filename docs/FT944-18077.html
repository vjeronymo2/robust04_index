			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Ford That Ford, the UK's largest car maker, has introduced short-time working for October and probably for the rest of the year, should set alarm bells ringing. The question is whether they are ringing for Ford, the UK automotive industry, or the economy in general. Ford's UK business is clearly in difficulties. The group's market share has slipped from 30 per cent in the mid-1980s to just 22 per cent. But the company's particular problems only partly explain yesterday's announcement. It was also an admission that the UK automotive industry had been expanding at an unsustainable rate. Car sales during the first seven months this year rose an astonishing 14 per cent, far faster than the economy. In August, the most important month of the UK automotive calender, sales growth slowed to only 2.8 per cent, a deceleration likely to be confirmed by September's figures tomorrow. If more discounts are needed to inject life into the market, margins for manufacturers and suppliers will remain tight - hence yesterday's fall in automotive component manufacturers' shares. A deceleration in the UK automotive market is unwelcome when prospects for the retail and housing sectors remain so uncertain. However, any slowdown need not undermine the UK's economic recovery. Ford, with the lowest proportion of overseas sales of any significant UK manufacturer, has been unable to export itself out of trouble. Others should compensate by increasing exports to rapidly recovering continental markets.</p>

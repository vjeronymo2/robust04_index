			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Need To Control Inflation"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was elected one month  ago. This short time is not enough to evaluate a newly elected  government's efficiency. Even though during this short period  Benazir Bhutto has achieved many things, the results of these  achievements have not reached the people. Therefore, even  knowing that not much can be achieved in one month, the people  are dissatisfied and worried. Perhaps they are wondering if they  will benefit from the change in the government. If there are  benefits, when will they reach the people's level?    The People's Party was successful in the general elections  in  October, and was also successful in getting its party's people  elected as the speaker and deputy speaker in the National  Assembly. This was followed by the success of Mr. Farooq Laghari  in the presidential election. All of these have important  political ramifications. Because of these successes, the prime  minister is in a position now to focus on implementing her  election promises to work for the country's security and the  welfare of the people. If we look at it in this context, we must  say that these successes will benefit the people. That is why  the People's Party members are expressing joy at these  accomplishments. However, the people, who are already expressing  joy at the success of the newly elected government, are also  expressing some minor disappointments. Perhaps all of this is  because the people have been stuck in the vortex of inflation  and unemployment for a long time. They want to get out of it  immediately. They have high hopes for Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto and her government. They are becoming restless about  fulfilling their expectations as soon as possible.    The situation demands that the newly elected government, in  addition to implementing additional parliamentary victories and  plans, also take immediate steps that help the poor, the middle  class, and salaried people. These steps should be clear and to  the point, so that an average man can feel and understand their  importance and benefits.    Prime Minister Bhutto called a meeting of economic experts  soon after her election, and expressed concern over the  continued increase in prices of essential items. She instructed  them to find ways to control these prices. The results of the  steps they took should have been felt by the people by now. The  people will be satisfied with these results only when inflation  is reduced. They will learn about them when they go to purchase  their daily necessities in the market, and find that they do not  have to pay more than they did yesterday. As a first step, there  should be stability in prices. The next step should be  reductions in the prices of necessary items. The people are not  ready to listen to the government experts' excuses about the  economy, unless it will result in the stabilization of prices in  the first phase, and reduction in the second phase.    Those who earn a few hundred or a few thousand rupees a  month  understand their economy much better than any economic expert,  because the experts earn heavy salaries and benefits. They  discuss economic philosophies in fancy offices, furnished with  expensive furniture and rugs, located in posh buildings. They  are removed from the facts of life, and are unable to understand  the real problems of the poor.    In addition to controlling inflation, employment  opportunities should also be increased. To this end, the  restrictions and the hiring freeze government and  semi-government agencies and departments should be removed.  People should be hired on the basis of their abilities and  experience to fill the vacated positions. At the same time, mid-  and long-range plans should be made to create new employment  opportunities. These are the immediate steps that will result in  people being satisfied, and they will feel that the change in  the government is benefiting them.</p>

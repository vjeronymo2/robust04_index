			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- During its meeting on  Thursday, the Russian Federal Government rejected the draft of  the federal investment programme for 1994 which had been  submitted by the Finance Ministry. The rejection was largely  inspired by the draft's lack of a mechanism for creating an  investment market in the country. The Finance Ministry has been  given a week to resubmit an improved draft programme.    Investment in Russia continued to decline in 1993, due to  the  overall fall in production, high inflation rates, and the high  risk level for private investors. Despite the government's  efforts to stimulate investment by cancelling the tax on profits  which are reinvested, offering subsidized credits, and  reassessing basic assets, the rate of decline was only slowed  somewhat. In 1993, the value of investments declined by 16 per  cent, compared to 40 per cent in 1992, according to the report  presented to the government today by First Deputy Finance  Minister Yakov Urinson.    Urinson pointed out two priorities for the government  investment policy. The first is the more effective use of  investments provided by the state budget, with a transition away  from credits "on demand" towards those given out only to the  most promising enterprises after examining their business plans.    The second priority stresses the formation of a more  attractive investment climate drawing on funds from enterprises  themselves and private investors.    The Finance Ministry feels that the implementation of those  measures will improve the investment climate already in 1994,  and have its greatest effect in 1995. However, Urinson pointed  out, overall investments from all sources into the country's  economy have declined by 10 per cent in 1994. Government  centralized investments have gone down by 40 per cent. The  remaining funds will be directed towards easing the most serious  problems.    The draft presented by the Finance Ministry included the  suggestions of many ministries and departments. In particular,  the state construction committee suggested that a point be added  to the draft about opening special accounts for amortization  deductions and advancing up to 30 per cent of the yearly limit  to companies working on contract. The Russian Agricultural  Ministry protested that the draft did not envisage the financing  of branches of the agro-industrial complex from the federal  budget, whose funds are handed out only for the support of the  most important sectors of the economy.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Denisov: "Fighting Continues in </F> Karabakh, and Each Side Attempts to Show Itself in the Best  Light"]    [Text] In an interview with a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent, Murad Petrosyan, deputy commander of the army of  Nagornyy Karabakh, refuted a report by the Azeri side of  allegedly high losses on the part of Karabakh forces. He said  that Karabakh forces are sticking with defensive tactics, and  are suffering significantly fewer losses than the enemy. Last  week Karabakh detachments lost several dozen men killed, while  the Azeri Army lost over 600. In the words of Petrosyan, forces  of the army of Nagornyy Karabakh captured 15 light armored  vehicles, 8 tanks and 5 IFVs as trophies, and brought down one  airplane of the Azeri air forces.    According to a statement from Petrosyan the Armenian side  also possesses information indicating that Afghan mujahadin are  taking part in fighting on the Azeri side east of the rayon  center of Mardakert.    The Azeri Ministry of Defense evaluates its position more  optimistically. In its statement it noted that the offensive has  been halted in all sectors, and over the last three days the  advancing troop formations lost 16 units of armored equipment in  the Terter sector.</p>

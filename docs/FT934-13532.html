			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cynicism could obscure important debate on internal controls Sir, The unjustified cynicism of Mr George Lapsley and Mr G M Simon (Letters, October 8 and 15 respectively) about the reasons underlying the recent publication of draft guidance on internal control threatens to obscure what promises to be an important debate in the Financial Times. First, the working group on internal control is not 'the working party of the institute'. It comprises individuals put forward by the 'hundred group of finance directors' and the English and Scottish Institutes of Chartered Accountants. Only two of its six members are in practice, the others are directors. The views expressed are those of the working group and do not, at this stage of the consultation process, represent the considered views of any other body. Second, the working group was set up at the request of the Cadbury Committee itself which had highlighted the importance of a framework of effective accountability; the committee had also recognised that considerable work was required not only to develop a set of criteria for assessing the effectiveness of internal control systems, but also to provide guidance on the form in which directors should report. As noted in your Leader ('Tightening up internal control', October 5), such matters produce a 'catnip' effect on accountants who have traditionally found themselves made responsible for these matters. Third, the draft offers guidance to the directors of listed companies and does not seek to impose additional audit requirements. Fourth, the draft is consultative. Comments received by the deadline of February 28 1994, including we hope from Messrs Lapsley and Simon, will be considered by the group and will be either incorporated or noted in its final response to the Cadbury Committee. It will be up to the Cadbury Committee to decide how the response should be used.

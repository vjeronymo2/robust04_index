Unconfirmed reports, coming from Middle East sources, have  it  that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has felt the Syrian grip on his  organization tightening up and is now seeking a better base for  the movement.    Through his own contacts with Armenians in Syria and  Lebanon,  sources claimed, Ocalan is currently making arrangements to base  the PKK in Kurdish area of Armenia where the organization has  increasing mass support.    Observers here suspect that such reports aim at putting  Turkey's policy with regard to Syria off track and forcing it to  ease its pressure on the PKK.    Recently, Turkish officials signed a security protocol with  the Syrians, accepting the exchange of terrorists and the  extradition of draft dodgers. A majority of PKK militants are  known to be draft evaders. Syria also guaranteed it would not  allow terrorist organizations to use its territories. Turkey  observes a complete embargo on Armenia and has no diplomatic  ties with the country. Turkish contacts with Armenia only take  place on a multilateral level and are limited to such things as  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation scheme, CSCE and the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council.    With Syria, however, Turkey has strong bilateral ties and  there is considerable U.S. pressure on that country as well.  Official sources in Ankara suspect that the message given via  speculation on the PKK leadership's intention to move is that if  Syria is further pressurized, Turkey may lose any indirect  control it has on this organization.    In other words, the message could be that if Turkish  pressure  goes too far and the Syrians get more disturbed over Ankara's  tightening grip, it could send the PKK off to a country where it  will flourish freely. If the PKK is based in Armenia, it would  be literally impossible to prevent its organizational activities  there with the lack of diplomatic contact.    Meanwhile, security sources on Tuesday denied a report which  appeared as a banner story in the Turkish daily HURRIYET and  said there had been no contact between the National Intelligence  Organization (MIT) and the Syrian secret service, Mukhabarat.    HURRIYET claimed in its report that two MIT officers had  secretly travelled to Damascus last week and were taken to the  house where PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan lived. The report said  the agents saw someone in the garden who "looked like" Ocalan  but could not be sure. It also noted that it was not clear  whether the PKK leader was under custody or only protected very  closely. The Syrians reportedly claimed he was detained. An  intelligence source, who asked not to be identified, told the  TURKISH DAILY NEWS that no one from MIT had visited Syria  recently for the said purpose. He said "the scenario" described  in the paper was not possible "since such relations do not exist  between our service and theirs."</p>

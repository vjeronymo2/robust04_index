			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Norweb to shed 1,200 jobs in restructuring Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity company, is to shed 1,200 staff over five years after announcing yesterday the sector's first corporate restructuring following the recent regulatory review. There are plans for further acquisitions in the US and the company may refinance Keadby power station in Humberside, in which it has a 50 per cent stake, and buy back shares through 'off-market' tenders involving institutional shareholders. The job cuts were attacked by union leaders, who contrasted them with the pay and share options enjoyed by directors of electricity companies. Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said he expected tens of thousands of jobs to go in the industry. He said the directors of privatised power companies were greedy and out of control. Norweb's announcement came amid growing speculation in the City about change in the sector, with takeovers, mergers and balance sheet restructuring all considered as possibilities. Shares of most of the 12 regional distribution companies in England and Wales rose again yesterday, with Norweb up 17p at 822p. Norweb said that its job cuts programme was necessitated by the regulator's review of price caps which would lead to a cut in income of Pounds 300m over the next five years, Pounds 40m of it next year. It said it accepted the revised price controls even though it did not agree with the the regulator's methodology and approach. Nine of the 12 companies have agreed to the controls, and the other three are expected to do so. Norweb is the only one of the companies which has not operated a redundancy scheme until now, and has cut proportionally fewer of its staff than most. It expects the introduction 'for a short period' of a voluntary severance scheme to help it cut 800 of the 5,000 staff in its core electricity businesses within 18 months. A further 400 will follow, with the 1,200 total representing nearly a quarter of the current core staff complement. Norweb employs another 3,000 in non-core businesses. As part of the restructuring, five area offices will be replaced by three, but Norweb said local customer services such as repairs would not be affected. It said the severance programme would cost Pounds 20m but because of provisions made in previous years, profits would not suffer. The company said the annual pay bill would be Pounds 25m a year lower at the end of the century as a result of the cuts compared with Pounds 120m this year. Hinting at further investments in the US, Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said: 'It would be ludicrous to invest in a single power station in the US and then do nothing else.' The company is also considering whether to bring the financing of Keadby power station on to its balance sheet. It estimates this could increase gearing by about 15 per cent and lower costs.</p>

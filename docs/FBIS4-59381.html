			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, adviser to PLO </F> Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the  studio, on 12 May; from the "With The Events" feature --  recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th in Cairo, good evening.  Jericho tomorrow and Gaza next week. The challenges are great  and you must have something to say on this occasion?    [Sha'th] The Palestinian people have been anticipating this  day for a long time. True, there are challenges and  difficulties and, true, there is responsibility that comes with  freedom, but this is the opportunity for the Palestinian people  to govern themselves on their soil. It starts here in Gaza and  Jericho. This is the starting point for a people who have  suffered for a long time. Now, the horizons of freedom and  independence have begun to be seen over their soil. This people  and their leadership must rise to the level of responsibility.  Freedom and independence, even at the starting point, means  great responsibility in terms of the people's security, freedom,  free expression, participation in decisions, and the tiring work  to achieve economic development and social justice. All these  things are required from us when we take the first step in Gaza  and Jericho.    [Mu'addi] The challenges are great, and the PLO is suffering  a financial crisis that even caused a delay in the transfer of  powers. What has happened?    [Sha'th] Yes, we are facing a financial problem. This  problem has made our entry more difficult, but we are gradually  overcoming this problem. I am confident that the presence of  the police force inside Gaza and Jericho will be received with  thousands of invitations and real support from the citizens. I  believe we have all seen the cordial welcome they received.  This, however, will not substitute for the money needed for  equipment, uniforms, and transportation. We are seriously  seeking to overcome these problems. The United States and the  European Union have pledged funds, while equipment and other  items will be coming from Japan, France, Greece, Germany, and  other countries. We are working day and night to realize this  support and transfer it to the Palestinian police force as soon  as possible.    [Mu'addi] What will be the future steps after the assumption  of powers and the establishment of self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho, which will apparently start be next week?    [Sha'th] I have always told people the difficult phase is  over, but the more difficult phase is still ahead of us.  Undoubtedly, the transfer is important, but now we have to  discuss how to form a competent, clean, and responsible  government. How do we start the measures for economic  development? How do we start preparations for elections?  Above all, how do we continue negotiations to assume powers in  the West Bank and reach an agreement on the interim phase in the  West Bank and Gaza which will lead to the withdrawal of Israeli  troops from cities and camps in the West Bank? All these  matters are required. Some resulted from the signing of the  agreement. Other topics must also be discussed after the  transfer to Gaza and Jericho. These are missions for the  forthcoming phase.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has struggled for a long time to  see the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Will  Nabil Sha'th be a member of the long-awaited Palestinian  national authority?    [Sha'th] I will do whatever I am asked to do by my people  and leadership. I devoted myself a long time ago to serve this  people and their cause. I will not hesitate to serve my people  in any position.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.</p>

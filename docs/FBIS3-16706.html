			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Both Partners and Competitors"] </F>   [Text] In the new world, under radically changed  conditions, Russia and America might be not only partners but  also competitors, and each country might have its own strategic  aims in international policy which do not coincide with the  other side's interests. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry  made such an admission on the eve of his visit to Moscow.    The Pentagon head declared that there should be active  cooperation with Russia in those cases where the two countries'  interests coincide and that mutual attempts to act independently  should be perceived calmly when such interests do not coincide.  Americans should also be prepared, however, for the fact that  the strategic aims of Russia and the United States might also  contradict each other.    Precisely in order to prevent such a turn, the United States  must give all possible support to Russia's democratic processes  and peace-loving steps, the defense secretary emphasized. Among  the main areas of cooperation in the military and  military-political sphere between the two countries he  particularly singled out cooperation in destroying chemical  arsenals and part of the nuclear arsenals, in combating the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and in converting  defense production. The Pentagon chief named as examples of  direct cooperation along military lines the exercise planned for  this summer by Russian and U.S. peacemaking contingents -- the  27th Motorized Rifle Division and the 3d Mechanized Division  respectively.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following his return  from the Muslim-held part of Sarajevo this afternoon, Vitaliy  Churkin, special Russian envoy for former Yugoslavia, told  journalists in Pale that in the context of an initiative for the  overcoming of the newly created situation, he had "numerous  contacts in Sarajevo with the relevant factors for the entire  situation in Bosnia" [as received].    We had very long and strenuous negotiations in the past 48  hours, Churkin stated, stressing that he had traveled between  Pale and Sarajevo three times.    Churkin singled out as positive the fact that the region of  Gorazde is more peaceful. He added that he has received  assurances from the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs that no  offensive actions will be continued in this area.    In return the Serbs expect adequate confirmation by the  other  side, Churkin said. "Apart from that, as regards the  continuation of fighting in other areas, what we are going to do  and what we can do here in Sarajevo is not to talk about Gorazde  alone, but rather about the situation in general," the Russian  envoy said.    The ultimate aim of all activities is, he said, a political  agreement, and he asssessed that there are no special  opportunities for success unless all sides realize that without  mutual cooperation and cooperation with the international  community there can be no political agreement or normalization  of relations in this area.    "When I say normalization, I am thinking here of the lifting  of sanctions and the return of Yugoslavia to normal  international life," Churkin added. He pointed out that he made  to President Karadzic "some specific proposals which include  placing the warring sides under control" and that "the  implementation of these initiatives on the ground could ensure  stability in this area."</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Easing the burden of small company audits THE PROSPECT of tougher auditing standards and the costs of the new compliance mechanisms are making a nonsense of existing audit requirements for small companies. This month's proposed new standards from the Auditing Practices Board (APB) put greater burdens on auditors by recommending that they are more pro-active in ensuring that a company is a 'going concern', and that they issue more definitive opinions on the financial statements in audit reports. Meanwhile, auditors are having to adjust to a costly new regulatory regime, introduced in October 1991. All auditors must now be registered as competent to carry out company audits. They are subject to inspection to ensure they are complying with new regulations, which lay down standards for practice management, independence, professional conduct, technical competence, training and the conduct of audits. To date, there are over 15,600 auditors names on the register, responsible for scrutinising the accounts of more than 1m companies. Many are small firms and sole practitioners whose client portfolio contains only small companies. They have been forced into this complex and costly regime because unlike other EC countries, UK company law does not differentiate in its audit requirements between the multinational conglomerate and the owner-managed corner shop. Consequently neither do the current auditing standards and guidelines. The more effective the APB's future pronouncements are in tightening up on recognised inadequacies in the audit process, the greater the regulatory burden they will impose on the small business sector and the less appropriate the regime will become for the sector. Many practitioners and proprietors of small companies hold the view that the law is an ass on the subject, and the closer one gets to the practicalities of auditing small companies the more asinine it becomes. There are questions over whom the audit benefits, conflicts over the auditor's role, and practical difficulties in conducting audits. Consider the situation of a small trading company controlled and run by a husband and wife as directors. In compliance with the requirements of company law, they maintain the legal minimum accounting records: a cash book, personal ledgers for debtors and creditors, and a record of the year-end stock, along with supporting vouchers. The directors do not normally have the knowledge or expertise to prepare their own legal accounts, calculate their tax liabilities or carry out the duties of the Company Secretary. So they hire a practising accountant who performs these tasks as their agent and often acts as a business adviser. The relationship becomes muddied when the accountant has to shift position from acting as agent for the directors to acting as auditor of the company. The law requires him to report to the shareholders on the truth and fairness of accounts which he has just prepared for them in their capacity as directors. In other words, the auditor expresses an opinion on his own work to enable the directors to report to themselves as shareholders] Equally, fundamental problems can arise because of the inevitable limitations on the audit of a small company. The main objectives of an audit could be summarised simplistically by five questions. Is the income complete? Do all payments represent value to the company? Are the assets over-stated? Are the liabilities under-stated? Do the accounts comply with the law? To answer these questions, the auditor makes an assessment of the company and designs his work accordingly. He takes account of the track record of the company and the directors, the reliability of the accounting records, the consistency of accounting ratios, the systems of internal control, and his judgment of the key areas of activity where effort should be focused. Having made this assessment, he plans the mix of tests he will carry out. Audit testing may include compliance tests on the control systems, review of transactions, verification of the existence and valuations of assets and liabilities by reference to documentation or by other corroborative evidence, and a detailed review of the accounts. Any problems identified must be discussed and resolved before an audit opinion can be given. But because there is no internal control and division of duties in a husband and wife company, a vital source of comfort for the auditor is not available. It is not possible to corroborate evidence or rely on the systems within the organisation. Purchases and existence of assets can be confirmed through third parties, but how does an auditor confirm that all income has been accounted for? If he has reason to suspect that income is being diverted from the company by the directors, he can only address his queries to them, which is not going to contribute much to the audit process. There is also the problem of dealing with discrepancies between the cash account and bank statements. Unidentified payments could be legitimate business expenses, but equally could be directors' personal expenses passed through the books of the business. Compliance with the Companies Act - particularly the requirement for maintenance of proper accounting records - also causes difficulty. The accountant often has to compensate for deficiencies in record-keeping by meticulously constructing accounts from a jumble of paper. Accountants describe these records as 'paper bag jobs', or old-fashioned 'spike audits'. Having carried out this task and charged a fee for it, when he puts on his auditors' hat the accountant is understandably reluctant to qualify his client's accounts for a breach of the Act. But expressing a true and fair view opinion in such a case may be stretching a point. There used to be a form of audit report which referred to accepting assurances from management in the absence of other corroborative evidence. This was much used by small practitioners in small company accounts, but was eventually viewed by the former Auditing Practices Committee as an excuse for not doing an audit and was withdrawn. Although it was not the best of vehicles, it was a form of tacit recognition that there are many situations in small companies where an auditor is forced to rely heavily on information given by the directors without other corroboration. Objections have been raised to abolishing small company audits in the past by third-party users - the banks and the Inland Revenue in particular - and by other creditors, to whom the auditors owe no duty of care, but who nevertheless make use of information in audited accounts. A less onerous and more realistic reporting regime for small companies is needed, and there are precedents both in the US and in the Antipodes. Accounts of small companies are reviewed by qualified accountants, which provides reasonable assurances to third parties without the need for a full audit. As most of the accounts preparation work for small companies is already done by practising accountants, this makes the process very much simpler and more cost effective. A similar system in the UK would mean that small companies would have some obligations in exchange for the benefits of limited liability, without incurring the costs of auditing and audit compliance. That would leave the Auditing Practices Board and the Regulators to get on with the job of dealing with the major problems.

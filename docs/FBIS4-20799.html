			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Sinyurah by Lisa Frydman; place and </F> date not given; first paragraph is JERUSALEM POST comment]    [Text] Publisher, activist and banker, east Jerusalemite  Hanna Sinyurah shares his views on the aftermath of Hebron,  prospect for economic success in the territories, and putting  Jerusalem on the peace agenda.    In the wake of the Hebron massacre and threats of  Palestinian  retaliation, it was nerve-racking meeting Hanna Sinyurah at his  office on Nabulus Road.    Sinyurah, who was heading for Tunis, said politely that our  meeting would either take place at his office or no interview.  Not only was he short of time, but he was short of patience for  the "psychological war of fear" which separates east and west  Jerusalem.    Walking up two flights of stairs in the old, decrepit office  building, I found Sinyurah seated behind a desk flooded with  paperwork. Wearing a crewneck sweater and a trendy sports  jacket, Sinyurah looked out of place in his more conservative  surroundings. His manner was cool, reserved and all business;  time was of the essence.    Our meeting came at the end of a particularly hectic month.  Named the chairman of the new International Palestine Bank,  scheduled to open as soon as it received approval from the Bank  of Israel and the PLO, Sinyurah had been traveling constantly  between Madrid, Tunis and Israel. The bank is being established  by Sinyurah and a prominent group of Palestinians, together with  Bank Leumi, the Commercial Bank of Morocco and Spain's Banco  Central Hispano. The consortium hopes to establish branches  throughout the territories and will be involved in all banking  ventures, including local and international investments,  transactions and project development. Sinyurah, however, says  all economic plans will remain frozen until problems in the  political sphere are resolved.    Sinyurah, a pharmacist and the former editor of the  now-defunct AL-FAJR daily, just launched the new  English-language Palestinian weekly, THE JERUSALEM TIMES. Unlike  AL-FAJR, a known mouthpiece for the PLO, Sinyurah says he's  trying to insure the TIMES remains independent of the  powers-that-be and to turn it into a commercially viable entity;  his focus is on ad revenues rather than big-name benefactors to  keep it afloat.    Sinyurah also serves as chairman of the European-Palestinian  Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the board of trustees of  the Workers' Education Association. Considered a prominent  member of east Jerusalem's intelligentsia, Sinyurah boasts  friends and contacts on both sides of the Green Line. An idea  man bubbling with blueprints for economic prosperity in the  territories. Sinyurah has nonetheless been forced to succumb to  the tortoise-like movement of the peace negotiators: No peace,  no bank.    [Frydman] How is the delay in the peace negotiations  affecting the development of the Palestine Bank?    [Sinyurah] We are waiting for approval by the Bank of  Israel.  But the progress of the bank runs at the same rate as the peace  process. Right now, everything is on hold.    [Frydman] How did the Palestine Bank develop&gt;    [Sinyurah] It grew out of discussions between the  Palestinians and Bank Leumi, which resulted in an agreement for  the International Palestine Bank to buy branches of Bank Leumi  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This grew into a four-way  partnership, which will operate all types of banking activities,  with emphasis on international trade relations, investments and  transfers of money in and out of the area.    [Frydman] Jordan is also establishing a network of  banks in the territories. Is this healthy competition, or a  threat?    [Sinyurah] Look, the Palestinian authorities have adopted a  market economy, so we are encouraging investment. All the  partners are our neighbors. We want our people, who have  suffered the most, to develop the economy, but we certainly  understand that we cannot do it alone and need international  assistance. There is a signed agreement between the PLO and  Jordan on economic cooperation. There is a similar signed  agreement with the Egyptians. We are also working on such an  agreement with the Israeli side.    [Frydman] According to Bank Leumi, the bank's initial  capital is slated to be about $40 million. Is this enough for a  smooth beginning?    [Sinyurah] You can actually start a bank according to  regulations with $10 million. So, when you begin with $40  million it's a good start. At the same time, we will be growing.  We have already been contacted by American and German interests.    [Frydman] Is the bank planning any specific investments  in Jerusalem?    [Sinyurah] Unfortunately, the status of Jerusalem will be  held off to second-stage negotiations at the peace talks. And  that must change, because really this principle issue cannot be  postponed. However, as far as Jerusalem goes, at the moment we  have no intention of opening a branch of the bank. But the four  partners will have interest in a Dutch holding company, which  will have offices in Jerusalem.    [Frydman] What are the bank's goals and priorities in  Jerusalem?    [Sinyurah] In the future, as a bank we are looking forward  to  investing in the infrastructure of the Palestinian economy. As a  Palestinian, I am concerned that the life of east Jerusalemites  will be improved. There are shortages of housing for  Palestinians. There's a big gap in infrastructure as compared to  that of west Jerusalem. And we feel that not only our bank but  also other interests should invest in the development of the  infrastructure of east Jerusalem so that it can one day be  comparable to the west side's economy.    [Frydman] What's your opinion of the Olmert  administration as compared to the Kollek administration so  far?    [Sinyurah] Well, I know both Kollek and Olmert personally.  Yet, at the same time, I feel that today Olmert is at the mercy  of the ultra-religious community. Jerusalem has always been a  right-wing city and I think he will lead the way for more  tension to develop. I'm watching Olmert on issues such as  housing, upgrading services, etc. I'm not going to prejudge  Olmert, but we have not seen much of anything yet.    [Frydman] Hindsight is 20/20. Had the residents of east  Jerusalem come out to vote in the mayoral election, do you think  the Palestinians would have more of a voice in City Hall? Was it  a mistake?    [Sinyurah] I have been involved in politics for a long time  and I feel that at least under the present situation  Palestinians have been denied civil rights. Palestinians did not  come out to vote because it would have meant legitimizing the  present state of affairs.    [Frydman] Yet how else can you change the status  quo?    [Sinyurah] I also believe that we can emphasize our rights  by  establishing Palestinian prosperity and I feel that if there is  Palestinian prosperity in east Jerusalem along with Israeli  prosperity in west Jerusalem that can also build bridges of  cooperation. I still believe in cooperation between both sides  of Jerusalem, but only on an equality basis and this doesn't  seem to be the case right now.    [Frydman] What is your vision for the future of  Jerusalem--a divided city? A unified municipality?    [Sinyurah] An undivided city, but with two sovereignties in  cooperation with each other. This city has its history, its two  peoples. If we want to have peace we must consider this, but  that does not mean that we cannot have peace, if people are  sincere and understanding. Right now, there are a lot of  Palestinians who are deprived of their rights.    [Frydman] You wear many hats. How do you plan to juggle  serving as head of the Palestinian Bank with publishing a brand  new newspaper and ensuring its financial success?    [Sinyurah] First of all, I come from the media. I have been  working in this line of work for the past 20 years. I was out of  it for a very brief period of five months and I could not stand  it, which is why I came back into the business working for THE  JERUSALEM TIMES. This won't take up so much of my time because I  am no longer working as editor-in-chief but serve as its  publisher.    As far as AL-FAJR, I can tell you that the English edition  of  that paper never lost money. It was the financial troubles of  the Arabic edition that led to the demise of both the English  and Arabic papers. I also plan to enter into local radio as soon  as possible.    [Frydman] Let's get into the logistics of the new  newspaper. Who's your target market--what's your strategy?    [Sinyurah] Right now we are printing 5,000 copies weekly. We  are trying to regain AL-FAJR's lost readers from the United  States. Our goal is to increase our circulation to 10,000  copies. At present we have a local audience of one thousand  Palestinians, but our target audience is Israelis and here I am  still having a lot of problems in that market. I have about two  hundred regulars, but I want to broaden this number to about  three thousand. That's why I am adding a new dimension to the  JERUSALEM TIMES, which will focus on the business/economic  aspects of Israel, in which many Israelis are interested. This  will provide Israeli businessmen with information about how the  Palestinian economy is developing.    We have an excellent market in major cities in the United  States, which includes Middle East experts, university faculty,  students, etc. AL-FAJR also used to have quite a few  American-Jewish readers--our next target market. We would also  like to expand the TIMES to goverment readers as well.    [Frydman] Can the TIMES realistically stay a commercial  paper with an even-handed viewpoint, or will it inevitably  become politically biased like AL-FAJR?    [Sinyurah] Well, there will be a political section in the  paper. But again, my concentration will be developing the  economic section. There will also be a cultural section to  demonstrate the mosaic of Palestinian cultural life and people,  and a religious section.    [Frydman] Do you plan to open your paper to opposing  viewpoints? Will Israeli writers find room on your op-ed  page?    [Sinyurah] We have already contributions from Israelis, a  British-Jewish expert on Jerusalem, etc., so yes, our paper is  open to anyone who has something to say regardless of opinion,  but in a way that will build the bridges of understanding of our  two peoples. At the same time, my newspaper is open to all  perspectives in the Palestinian camp.    [Frydman] What was the feeling in your community about  the immediate condemnation of the Hebron massacre by Prime  Minister Rabin, Rabbi Lau, Mayor Olmert, and the majority of the  population?    [Sinyurah] I can tell you that although they had expressed  their outrage, Palestinians worry about how we are going to  protect ourselves.    [Frydman] Many Israelis perceive a double-standard  here, because when terrorists strike Israelis, it seems that  groups jockey to claim responsibility, and condemnation doesn't  occur unless there's international pressure.    [Sinyurah] That's not true. I think actions against humanity  are not accepted by the Palestinians in general. And many  Palestinian leaders--'Arafat and others--have condemned terror.    [Frydman] What's your feeling about the Western Wall  plaza being closed by police authorities for fear of  violence?    [Sinyurah] I think the Israeli authorities were being wise  in  wanting to avoid clashes. All the holy sites should be  protected. Unfortunately, despite security measures we had the  massacre in Hebron, so clearly the protection is not adequate.  But the steps taken were appropriate.    [Frydman] In light of the massacre and the fanatics on  both sides of the fence, is peace a reality or are we all  deluding ourselves?    [Sinyurah] Look, we have no other alternative. If we allow  the extremists to win then we have no future. The only way to  fight back is to cooperate. We must stress education. We have to  change the stereotypes. It's a long process. We are changing  from a mentality of war to a new mentality of working together.  It won't happen overnight. It's going to take 10, 15, 20 years.    [Frydman] What is your next venture?    [Sinyurah] To work at peace. I would like to remain in  politics, but only in the background. My real goal is to do  everything possible to improve the economic status and push  forward initiatives in the area--which would stabilize the  forces. We can have all the agreements in the world, but real  peace will only come with economic prosperity in the occupied  territories.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris in Japan retail link Seven-Eleven Japan, the leading Japanese convenience store chain, will join forces with Philip Morris, the US foods and tobacco group, to develop processed foods and canned beer for the Japanese and American markets. The move will provide the retailing group with low-priced beer and food products and give Philip Morris increased access to the Japanese market and US convenience stores. Japanese retailers are trying to lower product costs by tying up with manufacturers and by-passing wholesalers. Seven-Eleven and Miller Brewing, Philip Morris's brewing subsidiary, will launch a low-priced beer in Japan in June. The product will be sold later in the US. The price of the beer will be 20 per cent lower than the retail price of the canned beers produced by the four leading Japanese breweries. The retailer, which owns Southland, the Seven-Eleven operator in the US, is also teaming with Kraft General Foods, a Philip Morris foods subsidiary. The two companies have been test marketing chilled sandwiches in Texas, and Seven-Eleven plans to sell Kraft products, such as cheese and coffee, in Japan.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 17 and 22 March.    Radio Reloj at 3052 GMT on 17 March reports that a tourist  installation, the (Villa Don Lino) on the north coast in Rafael  Freyre Municipality, Holguin Province, has already met its plan  to bring in $450,000 in hard currency, 1.5 months before the end  of the season. The manager said there are agreements with  Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Canada that will allow  the installation to continue receiving tourists from those  countries during the month of April.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 18 March reports that Mario  Medero, director of the 10 de Octubre Power Plant in Nuevitas,  described as extraordinary the efforts of plant workers to find  solutions to problems and increase efficiency. Last week,  workers worked 14-hour shifts to solve problems in the plant,  and Unit No. 3 is being repaired to increase its productivity.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 18 March reports that 21,000  caballerias of planted sugarcane fields were hand weeded during  the first two months of the year: 8,000 caballerias in January  and 12,000 caballerias in February. The objective for this month  is to equal or surpass the record achieved during the same month  in 1980 when approximately 20,000 caballerias of cane fields  were weeded.    Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 18 March reports that the 1993-94  potato harvest in Matanzas is going well. The province's  agricultural organizations are expected to surpass 300,000  quintals by 19 March. The harvest is scheduled to continue until  mid-April in the 145 caballerias planted in potatoes for  consumption.    Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 18 March reports that Matanzas  Province has a second millionaire mechanized canecutting brigade  among the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) forces.  This second millionaire brigade is from the 19 de Abril  Cooperative in Perico Municipality. ANAP has 40 mechanized  canecutting groups.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 19 March reports that Carlos  Martinez Salsamendi, president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce,  and Javier Taverna, president of the Chamber of Commerce of  Navarra Province, Spain, have signed in Havana an agreement for  the exchange of publications of the two chambers of commerce;  exchange of scientific-technical, commercial, and economic  information; courses; symposia; and technical support -- as well  as cooperation in projects for building buses and in the graphic  arts industry.    In the same newscast it is reported that under a joint  management agreement between the Spanish corporation Hoteles de  Espana and Cubanacan, the Camaguey Hotel in the city of Camaguey  will join the Hoteles de Espana chain on 1 April. Installations  in Sancti Spiritus and Holguin will also be operated under that  system.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 19  March  report the following:    The potato harvest has begun in Sancti Spiritus Province,  which "planted close to 40 caballerias" in potatoes this time.  Because better quality seed was planted this year and crops were  tended better, the province expects to harvest more potatoes  than last year despite the fact that a smaller area was planted.    On 18 March, the provincial bureau of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Pinar del Rio Province called for an intensification of  effort in the tobacco harvest, "a campaign that is becoming  tough because the planting plan has not been met, yet the aim of  arriving at the number of quintals promised for this year is  being maintained." Over 50 percent of the 1,809 caballerias  planted in tobacco in Pinar del Rio is still unharvested; and at  the present time, 411 caballerias are behind as regards  different kinds of tending. The availability of electrical  energy to dry blond tobacco has improved in the last few days.    The workers of the Jose Antonio Echeverria Contingent are  working intensely in order to finish the isotopes center -- the  only one of its kind in Cuba -- this year. The center, located  on the border of Guanabacoa and San Jose de las Lajas  Munipality, will research and produce compounds for use in  nuclear medicine.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 on 19 March reports that the Spanish  firm (Hoteles C) reached an agreement with the National  Institute for Tourism to manage and market the Camaguey Hotel in  Camaguey, the (Pernec) Hotel in Holguin, and the caves of Sancti  Spiritus.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 19 March reports that Cuba and  Venezuela are negotiating an agreement having to do with the  specialty of ecological tourism.    Radio Reloj at 2047 GMT on 21 March reports that a group of  65 Uruguayan municipal-level unionists visiting Cuba donated a  shipment of medicines and school supplies on 21 March.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 21 March reports that a  new cane Basic Cooperative Production Unit, La Polka, has been  formed in Santa Cruz del Sur Municipality, Camaguey Province,  and is showing excellent results. Close to 200 caballerias of  cane were planted in Cienfuegos Province during January and  February. Cienfuegos' cane planting plan for January-June calls  for planting 1,000 caballerias and weeding all the fields  planted.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 22  March  report that "thanks to Cubanacan S.A., Cuba has an international  sky-diving center that guarantees that any international quality  event can be held here." The center is located in Varadero and  possesses the latest technology and constitutes a very  attractive hub in every way. "At the official inauguration, a  group of athletes from western Cuba performed sky-diving  demonstrations. At the end of this month, 50 Brazilians will be  diving as part of their preparations for the Latin American  championship."</p>

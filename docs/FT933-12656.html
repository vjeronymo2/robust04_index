			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US-Canada beer accord US and Canada are close to resolving a protracted dispute over barriers imposed on each other's beer exports, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. An accord, already agreed between Ottawa and Washington, is in the process of being cleared with Canada's 10 provincial governments, which control beer and liquor distribution within their borders, according to an industry source. Last year the US slapped a Dollars 3-per-case duty on beer brewed in Ontario in retaliation against Ontario's 10 cent-per-can 'environmental levy'. Ontario and British Columbia have also imposed minimum prices on imported beers, making them uncompetitive with domestic brands. Under the draft agreement, the provinces will reduce their minimum prices and lower a number of non-tariff barriers on imported beers. They will also be barred from introducing any new discriminatory measures against US beer.</p>

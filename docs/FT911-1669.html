			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Bass to close two breweries as market changes BASS, the UK's leading brewer, is to close two of its 13 breweries with the loss of 480 jobs. Production at Preston Brook, near Runcorn, Cheshire, and Springfield, Wolverhampton, will end in August. The move follows growing competition in the industry, with the government forcing the leading brewers to free thousands of their pubs from 'tied' beer supplies. Bass has begun to sell or lease about 2,600 of its pubs. Commenting on yesterday's decision, Bass said that in a rapidly changing beer market, cost efficiency was vital 'and scale economies are becoming increasingly important'. It added: 'Having evaluated the range of options, we have concluded that the best solution is achieved by the closure of the breweries.' Production of Springfield bitter and Charrington's IPA will be transferred from Wolverhampton to Bass's Cape Hill brewery at Birmingham, where a Pounds 15m programme to improve efficiency has been completed. Runcorn's production of Carling Black Label lager and a wide range of other beer brands will be redistributed among several of Bass's other breweries, including Burton-upon-Trent, where some Pounds 50m has been invested in improvements over the last four years. Most of the jobs will go from the 20-year-old Preston Brook brewery, where 430 workers will be made redundant. Mr Doug Henderson, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the Bass decision was more evidence of the 'appalling state' of the brewing industry. He said that he had urged the Office of Fair Trading to review the industry. 'If the government is at all concerned about what is happening in the industry, it must act now,' he said.</p>

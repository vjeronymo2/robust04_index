Zvizdic: "Changes at the Head of the Embassy </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina?"]    [Text] We have learned from a reliable source that Bisera  Turkovic, the first ambassador of Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia,  will probably not hold that office any longer. It is claimed at  the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb that Ambassador  Turkovic "has left for a holiday abroad, which will last for  several weeks," but it is not stated why she left.    It seems that her successor is already known. It could be  Mr. Neven Kulenovic, who is already the charge d'affairs at the  Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb.    According to the information that we have, it seems that  Ambassador Turkovic has left for Australia after returning from  Sarajevo several days ago. We have also learned that Mrs.  Turkovic came to Zagreb directly from Australia on 25 March 1993  in order to present her credentials to the Croatian president.    It can hardly be believed that this is not a feigned journey  because there is no justification for the absence of the  ambassador at a moment when important things are going on in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and when negotiations between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are starting.    It is difficult to predict whether the dismissal of  Ambassador Turkovic will influence Bosnia-Herzegovina policy  toward Croatia. We have learned, however, that the Sarajevo  leadership has on several occasions blamed the ambassador for  her alleged inactivity in diplomatic communications and her lack  of initiative.    Bisera Turkovic was born in Sisak [Croatia], where she lived  until the age of 18. Then she moved to Zagreb where she  graduated from Law School. After that she practiced as a lawyer  in Sarajevo. In the trial against the Sarajevo intellectuals in  1984 she was mentioned as one of the participants, and she left  Yugoslavia that same year. She lived in Australia and completed  her post-graduate studies of criminology there. She returned to  Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992, two months before the war  started, and stayed in Sarajevo until the autumn of 1992. She  was an activist in the Party of Democratic Action. She has  three children.</p>

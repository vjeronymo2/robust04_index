			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICHE OF THE VERY RICH;  </P> <P> LIFESTYLE: HOW HIGH CAN HOME PRICES GO ON SECLUDED HARBOR ISLAND? MAYBE TOO  HIGH, SOME LONGTIME RESIDENTS SAY.  </P> <P> Picture the island: a part of Newport Beach that can be walked end to end in 15  minutes -- less if you don't stop to gawk -- but oh, so private and hard to  reach. Signs on Bayside Drive direct motorists away from this little jewel, and  access is via a bridge wide enough for only one car at a time.  </P> <P> Nearly all the houses have private docks. Although there is public access from  the water, once someone gets from the water onto the island, he's on private  property.  </P> <P> Some of the houses feature swimming pools or tennis courts. Most are built on  lots in the 5,000- to 9,000-square-foot range.  </P> <P> This is tiny Harbor Island, where decades ago lots went for $5,000 -- or $2,500  if a house was built on the property within a year of purchase. Now it's the  home of the $9-million tear-down, and, foot for foot, it may be the priciest  enclave in Orange County.  </P> <P> One family owned two lots from 1928 through 1989. Title to the property then  changed hands four times in 18 months; two men who paid $6.6 million in May,  1989, sold it eight months later for about $9 million.  </P> <P> Those two lots once belonged to Gladys Gardiner, who was called by one friend  "the island newspaper" because of her interest in the latest goings-on. She was  a gregarious woman, friendly and outgoing.  </P> <P> The current owner is just about the opposite, a man with such a penchant for  secrecy that he bought the property through an agent in January, keeping his  name off public records until July.  </P> <P> The new buyer? Donald Bren, president and owner of the Irvine Co. and the  county's only known billionaire.  </P> <P> Bren, who also has homes in Holmby Hills and on Linda Isle and an apartment in  New York City's tony Pierre Hotel, joins such Harbor Island residents as George  Argyros, developer and former owner of the Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> Bren's purchase of the Gardiner property comes amid a spate of building and  remodeling in this community of only 25 or so homes, some of them, like Bren's,  built on double lots. For some, the recent boom, with homes routinely selling  for $5 million and up, signals the end of an era, a time when island residents  may have been nearly as rich as sheiks but weren't quite as flashy about it.  </P> <P> For a spot that once was the summer home of violinist Jascha Heifetz and held  an estate of Howard Ahmanson, the banker whose name lives on at the Ahmanson  theater, part of the Los Angeles Music Center, Harbor Island started modestly  enough.  </P> <P> The property was dredged and filled in the 1920s, after Balboa Island and Lido  Isle, and developed by Joseph Beek and Louis Briggs. Beek's son, Allan, said  three or four people lived on the island in the early days, including Gladys  Gardiner and her husband, Everett, whom everyone called Duke.  </P> <P> Everett Gardiner "was a college chum of my father" at what is now Caltech, Beek  said. "It was a typical rich-boy, poor-boy relationship. My dad was poor,  working his way through school. Everett had inherited wealth, but they became  strong friends."  </P> <P> Gardiner, whose parents lived on the Balboa Island property that Beek said was  later bought by actor Buddy Ebsen, had degrees in law and engineering but never  worked in either field. He was, however, a tinkerer.  </P> <P> During World War II, Gardiner built himself a car, "a little, open, four-sided  wooden thing with wheels on it and an electric motor," recalled Jean Watt, who  grew up on Harbor Island and still lives there. With gasoline tightly rationed  during the war, Gardiner used the electric car "to go over to Balboa Island and  around town," Watt said.  </P> <P> Linda Isle, then called Shark Island and not yet developed, was known as a  fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes, Watt said. So Gardiner poured oil on  the ponds where the insects would otherwise flourish.  </P> <P> "Kids liked to go down and chat with Gladys," Watt said. "We called her 'the  island newspaper.' She was the one who knew what was going on. She was the one  you could count on to know why the ambulance came on the island. And Duke was  the one you could count on to fix something if it was broken. They were really  the guts of the island."  </P> <P> Duke Gardiner died in 1960. Gladys continued her volunteer work for the  Assistance League of Newport Beach well into her 90s. As the years went on, she  grew concerned about rising property taxes and inflation, her friends said.  </P> <P> So in 1981, she deeded her house to Hoag Hospital, which let her live in it for  the rest of her life and paid her $10,000 a month in return for inheriting the  property. In January, 1989, she died of heart problems, leaving an estate of  $800,000 -- half of which went to Caltech, the rest to charities and friends --  and the house.  </P> <P> In that year, property values in Orange County were going wild.  </P> <P> One parcel that Beek recalls his mother sold for about $300,000 in 1972 or  thereabouts -- a good chunk of change for that time -- now is valued at $6.9  million by the county assessor. Another home is priced for sale at about $15  million (reduced from the original price of more than $17 million, according to  real estate agents). Properties bought in the last few years routinely show  assessed values of $3 million, $5 million, $9.25 million.  </P> <P> One 15,000-square-foot house boasts two elevators, one at each end, to make it  easier to get from the basement to the first and second floors. The owner said  that workers pumped 15,000 gallons of water a minute for eight months to lower  the water level enough to pour the concrete for the basement.  </P> <P> But as prices have increased, the sense of community has decreased, some  old-time residents say.  </P> <P> "It used to be a great place," said Larry Porter, 44, who grew up on the island  but, with his siblings, sold the family property three years ago after his  parents died. "But now it's, well, like everything in general has changed. The  flavor of living in Southern California now (has changed). The island is kind  of a fortress for, in my opinion, people who are somewhat insensitive of the  way they've been economically blessed."  </P> <P> In bygone days, "there was an island Christmas party," said Porter, who now  lives elsewhere in Newport Beach but is thinking of moving out of the area. The  atmosphere year-round, he said, was one "where you waved to your neighbor, you  liked your neighbor. You wouldn't hesitate to borrow something from someone.  Nowadays, they don't even talk to each other over there."  </P> <P> Jean Watt is less harsh but agrees that in the old days "we had more  neighborhood kinds of things going on. Now it's kind of everyone does their own  thing."  </P> <P> "My father would have described it as 'Everyone has too much money,' " said  Watt, a longtime community activist and co-founder of the environmental group  Stop Polluting Our Newport, which had notable success in limiting noise from  planes at nearby John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Today's islanders seem to be "interested in getting more money, building bigger  houses and getting more cars," Watt said. "It's just gotten to be one of those  places where, like a lot of others in Newport, they feel that every square foot  has to have something built on it because it's worth more money that way."  </P> <P> Winifred Voegelin said that, with all the recent changes on the island, "you  kind of hunker down." She has lived there for 40 years; she once hosted, with  her late husband, a lawyer who for years was an officer for the Los Angeles  Area Chamber of Commerce, an annual lawn party for the Los Angeles consular  corps, followed by a Newport Bay cruise that started and ended at the dock on  their property.  </P> <P> Although the recent flurry of building and remodeling bothers resident Hansel  Benvenuti, a retired doctor, he finds things on the island in general pretty  fine.  </P> <P> The neighbors are "friendly but keep to themselves," he said. And the property  has appreciated quite nicely.  </P> <P> Nearly 20 years ago, Benvenuti paid $275,000 for the lot; he figures it cost  about $600,000 to build the house. He estimates the package is now worth about  $5 million. "I couldn't afford to buy it today," he said. On the other hand, he  figures he can't afford to sell it, because of capital gains taxes.  </P> <P> Benvenuti's wife, Martha, a retired lawyer, said many people look at Harbor  Island without knowing what it is they're seeing. "They see the homes from the  water, and they don't know where they are," she said. She especially treasures  her garden and "my view of the bay every morning when I wake up."  </P> <P> Though parking is a problem, requiring the Benvenutis to hire a valet when they  have a party, she said Harbor Island remains "a private place for people who  want privacy."  </P> <P> Gary Hamilton, head of the island's community association, moved there from  Corona del Mar four years ago.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be on the water with a big yard, relatively speaking," Hamilton  said. "There are not many places on the water with yards. It's one of the  beauties of Harbor Island that everybody is restricted; they cannot build out  close to the sea walls, so they have large yards, big setbacks."  </P> <P> Hamilton was a co-owner of what is now the Bren property for a while, buying it  from Hoag Hospital for $6.6 million with Jim Peters, another home builder.  </P> <P> In January, Lowell C. Martindale Jr., a lawyer for O'Melveny &amp; Myers,  bought the property on behalf of Bren. None of the principals would say what  the price was, but county records show its value at $9.25 million.  </P> <P> Hamilton did say that the purchase offers were "so attractive" that he and  Peters scrapped plans to raze the Gardiner residence and build two homes for  themselves on the site.  </P> <P> Martindale said it's "a possibility" that Bren opted to use an agent lest the  sellers see the billionaire coming and jack up the price. Also, he said, "Mr.  Bren, for such a prominent figure, is a private person and would probably  prefer to keep his personal affairs private to the extent he can."  </P> <P> Martindale said Bren plans to tear down the Gardiner residence and build a new  one. That means he could wind up with the highest-priced property on Harbor  Island.  </P> <P> Last year, one home -- a part of the old Ahmanson estate -- sold for about $14  million, and it's still under construction. The other home on the Ahmanson  property, which was divided after his death, is up for grabs at somewhere  around $15 million.  </P></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tories must take blame for unemployment Sir, Martin Wolf is mistaken ('Something's gotta give', October 2) with his claim that 'it is untrue unemployment in the 1990s represents a specific failure of Tory Britain. The UK has not done worse than continental economies Labour so much admires'. I hold no brief for any political party, but I must point out that Britain has been the only country in the Community that is completely self-sufficient in the various forms of energy. Today's Tory government must take responsibility for the mass unemployment and massive imbalances in both finance and trade after 14 years in office. In addition, it is wrong to make such a dubious comparison, bearing in mind the immeasurable effects of Germany's decision to unite, which has damaged its economy and that of its neighbours so badly. It cannot be gainsaid that, with all its advantages of energy and having curbed the misused power of the unions, Britain should be leading the European Community in prosperity instead of floundering in debt and disunity.

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 5-AA BOYS;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK'S QUICKNESS OVERCOMES MILLIKAN'S HEIGHT ADVANTAGE  </P> <P> Don't tell Saddleback High School Coach Pat Quinn that basketball is a game for  big men, because his Roadrunners are short.  </P> <P> But Quinn's players have quickness, and Millikan High School has the footprints  on its back to prove it.  </P> <P> Saddleback (18-11) ran the Rams (20-8) out of the 5-AA playoffs Friday night  with a 65-61 victory at Millikan.  </P> <P> "I'll take the quick guy over the big guy," Quinn said, "The height  disadvantage doesn't bother us, and the kids take it as a challenge."  </P> <P> Saddleback's front line, its average height less than 6-foot-3, looked up at  Millikan's two 6-foot-5 forwards and two 6-foot-8 centers.  </P> <P> "We gave away inches all over the place," Quinn said, "But our big guys played  great tonight, and I was surprised that we were able to play a power game."  </P> <P> Forward Jim Galbert had 13 points to go along nine rebounds and six steals, and  center Marco Gomez added 10 points and a team-high 19 rebounds.  </P> <P> Saddleback outrebounded the Rams, 49-41, and also made 24 steals.  </P> <P> Guard Andre MacFarlane had five steals and scored a game-high 23 points.  MacFarlane's two layups following steals highlighted a 15-3 burst over the  final 6 minutes 30 seconds of the second quarter to give Saddleback a 32-25  halftime lead.  </P> <P> Saddleback threatened to blow the game open starting the second half with eight  unanswered points to build the lead to 50-33 at the end of three quarters.  </P> <P> After Saddleback's switching defenses frustrated the Rams into shooting 25%  from the field for the first three quarters, Millikan made its last gasp by  outscoring the Roadrunners, 15-5, in the first 3:39 of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Millikan employed its seldom-used press to force numerous Saddleback turnovers,  sparking the Ram rally.  </P> <P> Pat Thacker led the charge, scoring 12 of his team-high 17 points in the fourth  quarter, but the team's 28-point final period wasn't enough.  </P></p>

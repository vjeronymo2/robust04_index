			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Australia powers through 2,000 level - The equity rally has not been dampened so far by the political crisis A stalled government budget, the prospect that parliament could be dissolved, an unemployment rate close to 11 per cent, and weak commodity prices do not seem the most promising ingredients for an Australian stock market surge. Yet, in spite of these negative factors, the All Ordinaries index powered through the 2,000 mark this week, reaching new post-1987 crash highs. It closed yesterday at 2,026, for a week's rise of 2.7 per cent. On an annual basis, the advance is even more remarkable: last November, the All Ordinaries dipped to a low of 1,355. Since then, it has risen by over 50 per cent, adding more than ADollars 80bn (Dollars 52bn) to the value of Australian shares. Analysts have few doubts about the forces that are driving the advance. The first is corporate profitability. The recent reporting season - most companies have June year-ends - showed widespread improvements in earnings. According to one tally of 500 listed companies, total after-tax profits increased by 98 per cent. This was partly due to a much lower level of 'one-off' charges, suggesting that recession-induced write-offs are coming to an end. But profits before tax and 'abnormals' were also up by about 49 per cent. As analysts at Macquarie Bank point out, much of this advance stemmed from cost-savings and production efficiencies which led to higher margins, rather than increases in demand. Those same 500 companies saw sales rise by a mere 4.5 per cent. Assuming that there are more productivity benefits to be garnered, this should mean that earnings advances can be sustained even if world economic conditions remain lacklustre. 'There's not much downside risk in the current year,' suggest Macquarie analysts. 'Future earnings advances are not heavily contingent on sales.' In this respect, then, the country's high unemployment rate, which stood at a seasonally-adjusted 10.9 per cent in September, is not entirely unwelcome. Most economists believe that the figure reflects the structural changes which are taking place in the corporate sector, as a nation adjusts to lower import tariff barriers and companies fight to become competitive. Employees may lose in this situation, but investors gain. The second motor behind the market's advance is the relatively low interest rate environment, and the fact that real returns on competing fixed interest investments and money funds look unappealing at present. Finally, seasonal factors may be weighing in. The stock market tends to pick up in the nation's summer months, and reinvestment of dividend payouts after the June year-end helps share prices higher. Nevertheless, there are some potential worries on the horizon. One is the amount of corporate fund-raising that is under way. The ADollars 2.4bn Woolworths flotation and current ADollars 1.6bn Commonwealth Bank share sale may have grabbed the headlines, but they have been accompanied by a raft of smaller issues. However, opinions differ about the impact that this supply of new paper will have on share prices generally. Mr Peter Masi, senior dealer at BZW in Sydney, suggests that many investors have been making money on recent issues, and some of these gains are being reinvested in other stocks. Nevertheless, he warns that the weight of new issues could cause some liquidity problems in the coming months, putting a temporary damper on the market's progress. Taking a slightly longer view, analysts at Macquarie Bank predict that about ADollars 12.5bn could be raised through equity issues over the 12 months to end-June 1994. But this, they point out, would only represent a 5 to 6 per cent increase in terms of total market capitalisation. The major question is why the political situation is having so little impact. Part of the answer may lie in the fact that corporate improvements, and the eventual recovery of world demand, are independent of the Canberra hothouse. It is also unclear where the budget impasse will eventually lead, and the senate is coming up for a two-week recess. Nevertheless, the uncertainty has already told on the Australian dollar, and Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, did acknowledge recently that there might come a time when interest rates would need to rise to help support the currency. In that case, warns one analyst, share prices might not look quite so appealing.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA RECRUITS SHINE AS U.S. JUNIORS DEFEAT SOVIETS  </P> <P> Judging by the performance of three incoming freshmen Sunday night against the  Soviet Union's junior national team, the future looks bright for UCLA's  basketball program.  </P> <P> Tracy Murray, Zan Mason and Mitchell Butler, a trio of prized recruits landed  by Bruin Coach Jim Harrick, were the standouts for a group of Southern  California high school all-stars in a 127-99 victory in front of 1,600 fans in  UC Irvine's Bren Center.  </P> <P> Murray, the state's career and single-season scoring leader at Glendora High  School, scored 25 points but it was the play of another future Bruin, Mason of  Westchester, who was most impressive. Mason led all scorers with 28 points and  added 13 rebounds.  </P> <P> Oakwood's Butler added 11 points and had the play of the game when he drove  through the lane and made a no-look wrap-around pass in the final minutes of  play.  </P> <P> "Those three kids are going to play a big role in putting UCLA on the national  map," said Bob Gottlieb, the U.S. coach. "I think UCLA is a quality center away  from a national title in four years."  </P></p>

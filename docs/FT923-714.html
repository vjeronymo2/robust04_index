			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Shares rise to Molins' 'blissful' results SHARES in Molins jumped 18p to 319p in a falling market as the tobacco machinery manufacturer reported improved profits for the first half and increased the interim dividend by 50 per cent. The pre-tax return was 6 per cent up at Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 6.8m), in spite of a slight decrease in sales from Pounds 75m to Pounds 73.5m. The dividend is raised from 3p to 4.5p on earnings per share 10 per cent ahead to 18p (16.4p). Analysts hailed the results as 'absolutely blissful' in a week which saw grim news from other engineers such as British Aerospace and Vickers. Forecasts were for a further advance in full-year profits to Pounds 16.5m, compared with Pounds 15.5m last year. Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said he was optimistic about the group's prospects: 'We feel better about the business today than we did a year ago.' The absence of a hostile predator for the first time in more than four years had left the board time to concentrate on business development. He gave a strong indication that the full year dividend would be higher than last year's 12.75p. He said Molins felt confident it 'should be able' to pursue a progressive policy, adding the usual caveat that any pay-out would depend on actual profits. The improved results were largely the result of a better return from the tobacco machinery operation. Trading profits increased by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 6.6m on sales almost 2 per cent lower at Pounds 48m. Strong demand in Brazil and China more than offset a downturn in the US, where Molins achieves some 40 per cent of machinery sales. Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director, said the group enjoyed a strong position in the important Chinese market, which accounted for 30 per cent of the total world demand for cigarettes. Packaging machinery suffered from exposure to the US. Operating profits fell 30 per cent to Pounds 700,000 on sales Pounds 1.1m lower at Pounds 24.4m. Increased competition was also having an effect on prices, although as the US market leader, Molins was less vulnerable than others to discounting. Negotiations over Molins' pension fund surplus with independent trustees continued. The surplus had been estimated at about Pounds 90m, although under Inland Revenue rules, only about Pounds 38m would be available. Mr Hamish McPhee, finance director, said it was too early to estimate how much of the surplus the company would eventually receive.</p>

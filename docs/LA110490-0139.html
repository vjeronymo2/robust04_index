			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE READERS RESPOND TO 'MOVIEMAKERS, MOVIE CRITICS AND YOU';  </P> <P> SHORTER MAY BE BETTER  </P> <P> Bad criticism is just disorganized thinking. The best review I ever read was  composed of only two paragraphs.  </P> <P> The writer first described the film's plot, character relationships and theme,  objectively and without judgment.  </P> <P> Despite his strong opinion of the work, I felt I knew exactly what happened on  the screen and could judge for myself whether I wanted to pay to see it.  </P> <P> Good critics should describe the film, then describe their reaction to it  separately and completely.  </P> <P> PHILLIP H. WISSBECK, Los Angeles  </P></p>

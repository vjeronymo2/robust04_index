			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HUNTERS PLAY KEY ROLE IN CONSERVATION  </P> <P> Certain animals of the wilderness are hunted and harvested at certain times of  the year to allow humans a variety of game and to keep a balanced reproductive  population of that species. As for domestic livestock, it's slaughtered  according to demand. We can find domestic animals prepackaged for purchase, no  feelings felt for the animal we never saw. For the hunter, game is a variety of  meat. Deer are not killed daily like livestock.  </P> <P> As for cruelty, it happens all the time all over the world. Wild and domestic  animals are abused, maimed and driven out constantly, with or without the  hunter. Cruelty to animals is something that can be caused by nature itself.  </P> <P> JEFF STATZ, North Hollywood  </P></p>

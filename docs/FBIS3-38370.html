The post will  fall vacant on 1 March.    Yesterday evening, Defense Minister Ter Beek told the Second  Chamber that the decision to appoint a Dutch officer was  justified because the Netherlands has never refused to provide  troops for UN operations. There are now about 3,000 Dutch  soldiers in former Yugoslavia.    The Dutch officer, whose name was not divulged on the  grounds  that he currently resides abroad, will be responsible for  coordinating the troops together with General Rose. This  includes, among other things, negotiating with the commanders of  the warring parties in the area.</p>

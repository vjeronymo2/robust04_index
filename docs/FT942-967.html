			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Once the company car is gone - Finance Thinking of becoming an ex-company car driver? You are not alone. The new tax regime is prompting growing numbers of drivers to consider going private, particularly if their company car is a perk, rather than a tool, of the job. But remember that it is not just the cost of the car but all the peripherals - like insurance - that you need to take into account when weighing up your options. Young, accident-prone, inner-city dwelling drivers of sporty cars might find it cost-effective to stick with a company car, because their insurance premiums could be well over Pounds 1,000 a year. Even more mature drivers of standard cars with an unblemished driving history can face unexpected problems when buying their own insurance for the first time. Many insurers refuse to accept a clean company car driving record as qualification for a no-claims bonus, but they normally accept discounts transferred from other insurers. Others only take your record into account if you are over a certain age  - which can be as high as 55. And of those offering discounts, very few give new ex-company car drivers a full no-claims bonus, which can cut premiums by up to 65 per cent if you have been accident-free for four or five years. For example, Direct Line, the largest direct insurer, earlier this year introduced a no-claims discount for ex-company car drivers - but only over the age of 30, and only up to a maximum of 50 per cent, rather than the company's usual 65 per cent maximum. Although the recent trend in motor insurance has been towards direct, telephone-based insurers, drivers going it alone for the first time could be well advised to talk to a broker, who may know which insurers are sympathetic, as well as calling a few insurers direct. As proof of your driving record, you will usually need an official letter from your employer, though a few insurers ask for a declaration from the company's insurer. Of course, a no-claims bonus is only worth having if it makes the eventual premium cheaper than the alternatives. Simon Ward, of telephone broker Telesure, says that insurers who do not give ex-company car drivers immediate no-claims discounts can sometimes still be cheaper - but this is not likely in the majority of cases. So before launching into a recital of all your details over the phone to an insurer, it is worth asking at the outset what their attitude is to accident-free former company car drivers.</p>

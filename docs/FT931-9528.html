			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Lack of boost for lower-paid attacked THE public-sector pay limit has not been significantly tilted towards the lower-paid among the 1.5m people covered by pay-review bodies. Almost all the doctors, dentists, nursing staff, teachers and members of the armed forces covered will, from April 1, get a rise of around 1.5 per cent, the limit announced by the government in November. Only the teachers pay-review body proposed any significant reforms to the structure of pay determination, and even teachers will not be fully subject to performance pay until the outcome of pilot studies is known. The lack of tilting towards the lower-paid in the other pay review bodies was condemned by some pay analysts. Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation said: 'An opportunity has been lost to protect the living standards of the lower-paid and to set an example in the rest of the public sector.' He believes that the implementation of the 1.5 per cent limit by the pay-review bodies will set an example for the other 3.5m public-sector workers covered by the pay limit. The 1.5 per cent rise will apply to settlements not to wages bills, some of which could rise slightly more than 1.5 per cent as a result of an increase in the number of people on higher pay scales. Over the past two years the NHS pay bill has increased by 22 per cent while the increase on pay scales has been only 15 per cent. Managers may have room for uneven distribution of the 1.5 per cent within, but not between, negotiating groups. All the unions continue formally to oppose the 1.5 per cent limit but industrial action is not expected. The health unions made no attempt to tilt the award towards the lower paid, saying that they did not want to disturb 'internal relativities'. One of the armed forces pay review body members, Prof John White, resigned after the government imposed the 1.5 per cent limit. The doctors and dentists review body also refused to produce a report because of the limit. The review bodies are expected to report in the normal way next year although the government is determined to prevent any public sector pay 'catch up'.</p>

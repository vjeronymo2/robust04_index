			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I agree with Francis Albert of Long Beach that the canceled CBS show "The  People Next Door" had an "idiotic concept" (Viewers' Views, Oct. 8), but any  program with Jeffrey Jones as its star couldn't be all bad. He's one of the  most underrated actors around today, full as he is with sly wit and sharp,  funny malice. I didn't care for the show's overblown premise either (about a  cartoonist whose imagination comes to life), but it was a pleasure seeing Jones  every week.  </P> <P> Jon Sieruga, San Bernardino  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (25): Tactical advantage for racers - New mobile communications application As the European cycle racing season draws to a close, riders on the Motorola squad will be hanging up their Lycra and switching off their radios. For three years the American-based team has been using lightweight portable radios to give it a tactical advantage and to improve race safety. In the big races like the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, the Spanish Vuelte and the Tour DuPont in the US, the teams of up to nine riders each have to keep in touch with their managers who follow in cars. They need to know when team tactics are changing and when a colleague needs help. Traditionally, the manager has driven alongside the riders and barked instructions. The Peloton Communication System that Motorola uses means this dangerous manoeuvre is no longer necessary. Each of the riders carries a receiver in their jersey pocket and an earpiece fitted into his crash helmet. It can pick up the manager's signal at up to four miles away, a distance that can easily separate first and last riders on an Alpine race. To keep the manager informed of what is happening in the centre of the bunch, one rider in the team has a transmitter unit, weighing eight ounces, fitted under his saddle and a microphone mounted on the handlebar. He tells the manager whether any team-mate needs attention and how rival teams are performing. The Motorola team reckons the system gives it a competitive advantage. The team spokesman and former Tour de France cyclist Paul Sherwen is convinced it helps them to win - 'in the Paris-Nice five-day race last year, our rider Frankie Andreou got out front in a breakaway group,' he says. 'It became clear that he was wondering whether he should drop back to conserve his energy. Then our team leader realised that the chasing group was tiring and the message went to Frankie to keep up the pressure. As a result, the break- away survived much longer than it would otherwise have done.' He also believes the team's radio saves time - 'if you are in the middle of the main bunch of up to 200 riders and you have a puncture, you put your hand up and hope that a race official sees it quickly. The official then gets a message to your team manager who drives forward with a spare wheel. It can take more than a minute to get help,' says Sherwen. Similar equipment has long been in use in automobile racing. Motorola has worked with the Benetton Formula 1 team and with Indy Cars in the US, but every ounce counts when cyclists have to pedal for six hours up 12,000 ft mountain roads. 'Motorola managed to cut the weight of the receiver unit to just 2.5 ounces by modifying a standard Minitor pager,' says Paul Sherwen, 'It is just light enough for the riders to accept the burden.'</p>

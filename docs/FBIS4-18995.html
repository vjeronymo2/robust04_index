			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans-Georg Heinrich, political scientist at </F> the University of Vienna and a member of the Moscow  "Parliamentary Center" who worked for in the White House in  Moscow for three years, by Werner Pirker; place and date not  given: "Between Compromise and Crash"]    [Text] [Pirker] An Austrian in Khasbulatov's empire -- is  this not a slightly bizarre picture?    [Heinrich] I was not classified so easily in political  terms. I did not belong to the Khasbulatov faction, but I know  quite a lot about the inner logic of this power struggle.    [Pirker] Is the struggle about Russia a personal power  struggle or even a gang war?    [Heinrich] The personal dimension certainly played a big  role. However, it was not the hostility toward Yeltsin, which  essentially characterized Khasbulatov's action, but that toward  Filatov, who moved from the Supreme Soviet Presidium to the  presidential structures and was thus considered to be a traitor.    First of all, of course, it was an institutional conflict,  with both sides being blamed for the escalation of events.  Thus, the president never really managed to empathize with the  the parliamentarians, who, for the first time since the Soviet  era, had real power. Originally they were on the president's  side and advocated reform policy. At the same time, the Supreme  Soviet whose deputies were responsible to their constituencies,  felt the mood at the grassroots more strongly than was the case  at the administrative level.    The institutional division of the country become visible for  the first time in spring 1992; both sides used populist tactics.  However, at that time it would still have been possible to come  to an agreement since the monetaristic line of the West was not  generally rejected by the Supreme Soviet. Even after 21  September 1993 compromises would still have been possible.    One should not ignore the fact that this was also a conflict  between political factions, and, naturally, this also has an  economic dimension. The Supreme Soviet Presidium is an economic  power. I got to know the functioning of the Khasbulatov faction  to a certain extent -- dollars, that is dollars earned from  Western relief supplies -- played a not insignificant role.  What happened in the President's surroundings in this respect  is largely known anyway.    [Pirker] Is it thus primarily the law of redistribution that  determines various people's actions?    [Heinrich] It is redistribution without rules. The  president's circle has now laid its hands on the building of the  Parliamentary Center and has largely rented it to foreign  companies. And this has been accomplished under guise of  democratic president versus communist parliament. All that is  not true.    [Pirker] But it was presented in this way in the Western  media. Even though they knew better?    [Heinrich] I would not say that lies were spread  deliberately. There is rather a lack of readiness or ability to  assess the events in a differentiated manner. However, there  were also foreign correspondents, who wallowed in Moscow's  political morass and produced "facts" that corresponded to their  ambitions.    [Pirker] In addition to the profane aim of enriching its  participants, does the Moscow power struggle not also reflect a  basic conflict over the direction of the reforms' development?    [Heinrich] As I said before: The Supreme Soviet felt the  pressure from below against the effects of the reform more  strongly. However, it would be wrong to think that Supreme  Soviet advocated an antireform line. Even regarding the shock  therapy there was no clear line dividing the political factions.  People with an antireform image often advocated rather more  monetaristic positions then the monetaristic establishment,  which helped itself very generously to the state budget --  partly out of restraint to prevent a social explosion, partly to  keep the lobbies in a good mood. Thus, the energy lobby, which  produces two-thirds of foreign currency revenues, was treated  very accommodatingly by Gaydar. Of course, the Supreme Soviet  also participated in this policy of excess spending; regions  were subsidized to gain political support. The ties between the  local nomenklatura and the nomenklatura in companies in the  struggle for subsidies has essentially characterized the lobby  structure.    [Pirker] After the bloody massacre in October, which was  supposed to put an end to the power crisis, forces have been  regrouped, leading to the conclusion that the winners have not  really won?    [Heinrich] I agree with that. The radical democrats'  strategy to get rid of the opposition has failed. The  opposition is now stronger than ever. This is, above all, also  expressed in Russian foreign policy, which has now become less  ingratiating, at least in its rhetoric, toward the West than  prior to October.    [Pirker] Does that not mean that the real winner was the  army, which now wants to implement its big power ideas?    [Heinrich] It is within the General Staff, and not the army  as a whole, where the phenomenon of dissolution is becoming  rather more intensive. The gap between the army leadership --  which behaves like a privatized company -- on the one hand, and  the middle and lower echelons on the other has become even  larger. There is an extremely hateful mood; spying on one  another within the officer cadre has become some sort of  struggle for survival.    [Pirker] What are the scenarios for further developments?    [Heinrich] One word more on the failure of reform. The  reformers -- such as Gaydar and Fedorov -- came from nothing,  without any real power bass: the three large lobbies in the  energy, agriculture, and large industrial sectors. One cannot  pursue politics in Russia outside these structures. The need  for reform naturally remains, but another kind of reform.  Because the reform pursued so far has not been monetaristic,  either: it was either worse than that, or nothing at all  happened. The most likely development now is to plod along; the  departure of the radical reformers from the government makes the  situation a bit easier, because this has defused the power  struggle and the Supreme Soviet, too, is in a more constructive  mood than had originally been expected. As a result, the  prospects for reform have increased. The changed reform  strategy will probably be the following: preventing the  collapse of companies and establishing financial-industrial  associations, meaning that the system is to be made controllable  again. For this one needs a broad-based consensus, because the  problem thus far has been that none of the presented reform  plans has had the necessary legitimacy. One either had to  accept cutbacks or try to gain legitimacy by autocratic rule, by  attacking the legislature but oppressing the regions, and so on.  I hope that it has now been realized that the problems cannot  be solved by force, that one has to deal with the opposition in  a civilized manner. This would be the optimistic scenario. The  pessimistic scenario is that the struggle between the factions  will continue unabated. Closing down the enterprises would be  simply disastrous. It would be closing down without a  structural policy. Structural policy would mean a gradual  transition to privatization, to real privatization. A  countertrend is exerted, above all, by the mafia, which feeds on  the monopolistic structures because it aims at winning the  monopoly and not at winning over competition. The end result  would be a total crash. However, I believe that things can also  be done differently.</p>

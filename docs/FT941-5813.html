			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: ABP Judging by Associated British Ports' 38 per cent operating margins, running ports is nice work if you can get it. ABP is in the particularly happy position of owning several well-positioned ports accounting for 25 per cent of the UK's seaborne trade. The company has done a good job in establishing and exploiting such an asset base. The worry is when such businesses indulge in fruitless diversification. Sadly, ABP has done that, too. The company's move into commercial property close to the top of the cycle ravaged its balance sheet during the downturn. The renewed upswing in property should save further blushes - although it grates that ABP claims to have realised a Pounds 6m 'profit' on an Torquay shopping centre having written it down so heavily against the revaluation reserve. Its decision to fix so much of its debt long term at around 11 per cent has become a further embarrassment given the subsequent trend in interest rates. That is especially so when the company generates cash in such profusion. The market appears to have forgiven all past misdemeanours in pushing the shares so far. That may prove justified given the scale of current development activity around its ports and the marked upswing in trade. The longer term growth prospects, though, do not appear so promising considering ABP's high market share. That may not matter if the management starts channelling more cash back to shareholders. But a yield of 2 per cent suggests it has a long way to go.</p>

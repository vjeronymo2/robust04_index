The conference dealt with the new political and economic  situation in our country. Mahamadou Kone has this report:    [Kone] The newsmen at the conference took the opportunity to  ask questions about our country's current political and economic  situation, a situation that is marked, among other things, by  the devaluation of the CFA franc, the resignation of Prime  Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, the appointment of a new  government, and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle. It will be  recalled that the reshuffle was prompted by the withdrawal of  the ministers from the National Committee for Democratic  Initiative [CNID] and the Rally for Democracy and Progress  [RDP]. [passage omitted]    This political situation led to speculations that the  government would call early elections, a possibility that ADEMA  Secretary General Mohamadoun Dicko has ruled out:    [Begin Dicko recording] We are still open to everyone; we  continue to champion dialogue; we still want to join hands with  all democratic forces because we know that we need everyone if  we really want to speed up our march toward establishing and  consolidating the rule of law, and strengthening our young,  fragile democracy. Despite the withdrawal of CNID and RDP, we  are resolutely open to everyone -- to all those who want to help  consolidate our democracy -- but there is no question of calling  early elections. No, there is no need. We trust our people and  our ability to run this country. [end recording]    [Kone] Mr. Dicko said accountability prevails in the  drafting  and implementation of the republican pact, adding that since  some of the signatories to the pact have questioned it, ADEMA is  preparing a new document on the joint management of state  affairs. The ADEMA secretary general stated, however, that the  ruling party has qualified men and can run the country alone,  but it prefers consultations.    Mr. Dicko said the devaluation of the CFA franc will  undoubtedly reduce the purchasing power of the people. To  alleviate the hardship, the ADEMA head suggested a change in our  consumption habits and the promotion of solidarity among all  Malians.</p>

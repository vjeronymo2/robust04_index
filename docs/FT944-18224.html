			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Lloyd's Names win battle against Gooda Agency: Court ruling gives 3,000 members prospect of record Pounds 504m compensation Hard-hit members of Lloyd's of London won a significant victory yesterday when the High Court held out the prospect of record compensation for losses incurred as a result of 'culpable' and 'unjustified' risks taken by the now-defunct Gooda Walker agency. The Gooda Walker action group, representing 3,096 Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, claimed compensation should total at least Pounds 504m. This would be more than double the previous largest award by an English court. But the figure was swiftly disputed by lawyers representing the insurers of the 71 Lloyd's agencies defending the case - out of whose funds any compensation will be paid. The judgment provided encouragement for other groups of Names taking legal action against Lloyd's agencies - particularly those involved in similar 'spiral' insurance, by which underwriters agree to cover others against excessive losses from catastrophes. In the judgment, Mr Justice Phillips said the spiral was 'like a multiple game of pass the parcel'. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the action group, which had claimed Pounds 629m in compensation for its Names, said: 'The parcel turned out to be a time-bomb that exploded in our faces.' Compensation was ordered for losses incurred as a result of five catastrophes - including the Piper Alpha North Sea oil rig disaster in 1988 and the 1989 Caribbean Hurricane Hugo. The verdict also offered some protection against losses resulting from the catastrophes but not yet reported. The scale of the compensation awarded and the prospect of further legal victories by Lloyd's Names will add to the pressure for the insurance market to make a fresh attempt to reach an overall settlement for all outstanding claims, which could total in excess of Pounds 3bn. Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, said last night that 'the decisive result achieved by the Gooda Walker Action Group should make it clear that the defendants of this and other spiral cases can expect no advantage from resisting Names' claims further in court'. A spokesman for Lloyd's said it 'would do anything we can to help' a settlement but the initiative had to come from the defendants. Last night, however, lawyers representing the 'errors and omissions' insurers, which provide Lloyd's agencies with cover against negligence claims, hinted they may appeal against yesterday's decision. The result of any appeal is unlikely to be reached before next summer. The insurers are certain to dispute the level of compensation in court. The insurers' solicitors, Clyde and Co, said said some of the agencies sued successfully are in liquidation: 'Others may follow. Many have no or insufficient insurance cover to respond to awards of damages now likely.' The action group conceded that the 'errors and omissions' cover of the agencies they sued would be insufficient to meet their claim. In his judgment, the judge said the principal negligence by Gooda Walker was the failure of its underwriters to arrange sufficient reinsurance to cover the risks to which they were exposing Names. He also criticised other aspects of their work, including poor monitoring of risks assumed by syndicates. The judge said Names should only be compensated for losses that were a result of the failure to provide enough reinsurance.

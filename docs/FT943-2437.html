			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Although profit-taking ahead of the September interim book closing by investors looking to boost their midterm earnings will weigh on bond prices this week, the effects are likely to be minimal since a sluggish stock market, low short-term rates and a firm yen are expected to support confidence. A weak stock market has always been good news for bonds. Fears of over-supply on the stock market, which hit prices last week, are expected to linger over the next month. Investors are worried that a spate of equity-linked financing issues will affect liquidity. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which was planning to offer a large convertible bond issue next month, is expected to postpone the deal. To prevent a further fall in share prices, the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain an easy stance on the short-term money markets. Traders expect the overnight call rate to remain around 2.1 per cent. Bond investors are also expected to focus on the US-Japan bilateral framework talks on trade. Government comments about the talks are likely to increase ahead of the agreement deadline at the end of the month, which will affect currency movements. Any negative news on trade will support the yen, which in turn will help bond prices. Meanwhile, activity may increase, as trading for October settlement starts tomorrow.</p>

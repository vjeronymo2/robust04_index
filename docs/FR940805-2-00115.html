Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the changes in market structure that have taken place since Rule 103 was adopted, the Commission believes that the benefits of the Amex proposal outweigh an burdens it may impose. Specifically, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should enhance the quality of the Amex market. The Amex established the membership categories of Registered Equity Trader and REMM to provide a means by which Amex members could, under certain conditions, add depth and liquidity to the market by initiating proprietary transactions on the floor of the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The Commission, however, notes that Rule 103 may frustrate that purpose, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  to the extent it may be unnecessarily restrictive given the risks posed by Registered Equity Traders' and REMMs' dealings in stocks in which they (or their member organization) have an option position. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For further discussion of the conditions for Registered Equity Trader and REMM participation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> notes 4&hyph;5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex argues that there is a disincentive for any Amex member who participates in the options market (or who is associated with a member organization that participates in the options market) to be active as a Registered Equity Trader or REMM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For further discussion of the risks of such activity and the safeguards contained in the Amex proposal,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> notes 12&hyph;16 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review, the Commission believes that the Amex proposal may reduce the current disincentive for members, especially options market participants and their associated persons, to act as a Registered Equity Trader or REMM given Rule 103's restrictions. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  For instance, Amex members currently serving as Registered Equity Traders and REMMs could initiate proprietary floor trades in situations where they presently cannot do so; moreover, other members might be encouraged to service in that capacity. In the Commission's view, an increase in the capital committed to such supplemental market making activities could improve the depth and liquidity of the Amex market, particularly in times of market stress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

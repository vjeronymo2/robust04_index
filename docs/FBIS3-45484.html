			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Looking Forward To a Good Beginning in </F> Cross-Strait Relations This Year"]    [Text] The Third Session of the First Council of the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] of  the Chinese mainland concluded in Beijing last Thursday. The  session was called at the beginning of the year and was a good  opportunity to summarize cross-strait nongovernment exchanges,  as well as to review prospects for cross-strait relations.    The year 1993 was one in which great developments were made  in cross-strait relations. Cross-strait nongovernment exchanges  expanded, there was an unprecedented amount of Taiwanese  investment in the mainland both in scope and type, and  cross-strait bilateral trade continued to grow drastically. The  cross-strait high-ranking nongovernment "Wang-Ku talks" were  held for the first time, and ARATS-SEF [Straits Exchange  Foundation] routine talks were held in Taipei for the first time.    The mainland authorities issued a White Paper on "The Taiwan  Issue and China's Reunification" in 1993, which states to the  world the Chinese mainland's position, principle, and policies  on the Taiwan issue in a comprehensive and systematic way so  that the world may have a clearer picture of the issue.    The rapid development in cross-strait relations has internal  impetus, namely China's reform and opening up, the elevation of  its position in the world, and the cultural tradition and  flesh-and- blood ties shared by people on the two shores. In  modern history, Taiwan was ceded to Japan for over half a  century, and has been separated from the Chinese mainland since  1949. Since the beginning of the 1980's the economic  development and ties between the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong  have become increasingly closer. Thus a new opportunity for the  reinvigoration of the Chinese nation has surfaced.    Before Chiang Ching-kuo passed away, he lifted the ban on  Taiwan people going to the Chinese mainland to visit relatives.  That was a practical measure with great vision, and has played  a great role in promoting the relaxation and gradual development  of cross-strait relations characterized by long-termed  confrontation. Changes have gradually taken place in Taiwan's  situation with the end of the Chiang era. The Kuomintang  second-generation leaders who are now in office are  characterized by fewer ties with the mainland, but with weaker  anticommunist sentiments. On the one hand, they have handled  cross-strait relations with a comparatively practical attitude,  and gradually relaxed restrictions on Taiwan businessmen  investing in the mainland. On the other hand, however, they  have the consciousness of being content to retain sovereignty  over a part of the country, and always want to give prominence  to a "political body on an equal footing" in cross-strait  exchanges, while doing their best to embody "one China, one  Taiwan" in ties with foreign countries. The surfacing of the  monster "vacationing foreign affairs" [du jia wai jiao 3256 0250  1120 0094] is one example.    It is precisely such an erroneous mentality of being content  to retain sovereignty over a part of China that has resulted in  unfavorable effects on cross-strait relations today. The  repatriation of hijackers from mainland China should never have  been difficult to achieve, and could have been entirely resolved  through full negotiations between ARATS and SEF in the spirit of  the Jinmen Accord. But the Taiwan Authorities decisionmaking  tier is bent on giving prominence to the political and legal  nature of this routine issue, thus making the issue exceed the  nongovernment scope of ARATS and SEF. Consequently, the matter  remains unsolved. It is universally known where the crux of the  problem lies.    While dealing with cross-strait political issue, ARATS  Chairman Mr. Wang Daohan said that this issue called for both  mainland and Taiwan Authorities to send negotiators. That was a  sensible and reasonable attitude. Because both ARATS and SEF  are nongovernment organizations authorized by relevant Taiwan  and mainland authorities, and were founded to resolve specific  issues in cross- strait ties, the ARATS-SEF routine and  functional talks should be free of political intervention.  However, will Taipei be courageous enough to send men to  conduct talks with the mainland on political issues?    The cross-strait economic and cultural exchange will  continue  to expand, the talks between ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei and  his SEF counterpart Mr. Chiao Jen-ho may make arrangements for  the second Wang-Ku meeting, which is the hope and interest of  compatriots in both Taiwan and mainland China. Taipei suddenly  spread the news yesterday that the Tang-Chiao talks would be  postponed. That is not a rational and practical attitude. We  hope that Taipei's decisionmakers will be good to their word and  let the Tang-Chiao talks be conducted as scheduled so that  cross-strait relations may enjoy a good beginning this year.</p>

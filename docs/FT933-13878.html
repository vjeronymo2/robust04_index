			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts close little changed despite fall in unemployed CONFIRMATION that UK unemployment is beginning to fall was ignored by a gilts market which traditionally reacts nervously to such statistics. Debt prices eased back after the news that the jobless figure had fallen by 7,600 in June - the fifth successive monthly decline - but recovered to close virtually unchanged along the length of the yield curve. Although the market has shrugged off previous unemployment data as suspect, most economists acknowledged yesterday that there was now a genuine downward shift. Also, the statistics coincided with long gilt yields being at a 20-year low and the market being potentially sated by a Pounds 700m five-year tap. However, the appetite for gilts remains so strong that the tap of five-year stock was exhausted quickly and bond prices, off a quarter point around midday, recovered to close firmer for the 10-year maturities and steady for the ultra longs. Mr John Kendall, economist with Baring Sterling Bonds, said: 'We still have nearly 3m people unemployed, so it will be a while before the labour market tightens to the extent that it is exerting inflationary pressures.' Overseas investors, who Mr Kendall estimates hold around 18 per cent of the market - including 8 per cent in foreign central banks - were continuing to buy. THE GERMAN Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged was anticipated but led to some consolidation in the Bund market yesterday. Bund futures for September fell 0.25 to 96.11 as the German central bank was unable to draw investors' attention away from the pressures within the European exchange rate mechanism. FRENCH government debt prices held relatively steady, despite the Bundesbank's failure to cut rates. On the Matif, September futures eased 0.14 to 119.82. One economist suggested that once the German central bank eases, speculators will know that it will feel unable to cut rates again for some time. Consequently, they might begin to sell the franc more heavily without fear of being punished by rate shifts. AMONG the high yielders, Italian government bonds saw profit-taking following a recent strong performance. However, yesterday' auction of L1,500bn of 10-year BTPs saw the net yield fall to 9.53 per cent from 9.76 per cent previously. The result was at the more optimistic end of forecasts. In Portugal, an auction of 10-year government bonds was also aggressively bid, even though underlying bond prices suffered from the general ERM nervousness. The Es10bn of stock was taken up with the yield coming in at 10.336 per cent against expectations of 10.4 per cent. LONGER-DATED US Treasuries posted fresh gains yesterday, sending yields to new lows as the market continued to benefit from recent good inflation figures. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 107 13/32 , yielding 6.552 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.957 per cent. There was some early follow-through buying from Wednesday, when news of weak consumer price inflation provided a strong lift to Treasury prices. Yesterday's economic figures were less encouraging, although a big drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity for July was bullish for bonds. Longer-dated prices were further aided by some fresh municipal defeasance buying. The day's other news had little effect on market sentiment. The Labor Department announced a smaller-than-expected 2,000 increase in weekly jobless claims, and the Commerce Department announced a 0.2 per cent rise in May business inventories.</p>

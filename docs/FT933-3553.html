			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Russians welcome German business invasion: A new spirit of co-operation between the two nations on the enterprise front THE IRONIES never absent when Germans meet Russians on their own soil were on full display in Nizhny Novgorod this week when delegations of German businessmen and politicians came to Russia's most market-oriented region to advise, to learn and to do business. Mr Heinz Rhunau, former chairman of Lufthansa and now deeply engaged in assistance to the Nizhny region, says that 'I am happy that I can come here and talk to him (embracing his translator) without a rifle in my hand'. Outside the administration building where he has been meeting the region's leaders, a war memorial exhorts - 'Comrades, remember the life of those who left us ..they fell, for honour and freedom, for the motherland. Think on this down the centuries, as you walk beside them.' Mr Rhunau, of an age to have fought in that conflict, now advises the West Deutsche Landesbank and the government of North Rhine-Westphalia in its work with Nizhny: the region is steadily strengthening its links with the German state. Giving a fulsome toast on Thursday night, Mr Boris Nemtsov, the young governor of the region famous for his - increasingly unusual - pro-market views, said that 'we have signed protocols on 25 different deals with North Rhine-Westphalia, and 25 of them are being fulfilled.' Mr Rhunau lighted on Nizhny because (he counts off the reasons): 'One, excellent production equipment; two, highly educated workers; three, a high social sense - people here are disciplined; and four, the leadership here are the Russians of tomorrow.' Mr Nemtsov and his colleagues may be Russians of tomorrow: but distinguished Russians of the past head the local economy which is heavily biased towards defence production. Indeed, as Mr Rhunau and his team negotiated with Mr Nemtsov, an esplanade-full of tanks, guns, military vehicles and Migs were presented for show in Nizhny's second defence fair - as local cash-strapped industries tempt domestic and foreign buyers to arm themselves better. The man whose plants make these and other products (such as the Volga car) are at best sceptical of the market. A German-Russian seminar on military conversion last week was a rehearsal of positions - the Germans stressing the need for market knowledge and company-level initiative, the Russians talking of their ability to switch production rapidly to produce goods for an empty, undiscriminating market. 'Why has there not been a catastrophe here when the state slashed military spending last year?' asks Mr Vladimir Luzyanin, general director of the Hydromash engineering plant. 'Because in the 1970s we had already been directed to devote part of our production to consumer goods. So for most of us, it was a matter of increasing that proportion. We did it in 18 months.' Mr Luzyanin and his colleagues do not want joint ventures with foreign companies. He wants to trade. 'We have orders to make parts for the Airbus,' he says. 'And for other western companies. We do all this. Now. With some more money we will do better, by ourselves.' Mr Yuri Sedakov, head of the NIIS plant which makes printed circuit boards and production equipment, has, he says, got exemption from privatisation and taken his enterprise under control of the Ministry of Atomic Energy because 'we have a unique range of equipment here, a unique technology - we cannot allow it into the hands of those who might neglect it.' Perhaps they are wrong to be so dismissive. At the military hardware exhibition, Mr Karl-Heinz Kleidzinski, a social democrat member of the Bundestag, a former (peacetime) fighter pilot and defence expert, kicks the tyres on a howitzer and notes that its range is 24kms. 'It is not competitive. The howitzers in the west have a range of 30kms: it could be destroyed while getting into range. The Mig 29 is made in Nizhny: one stands on the esplanade, guards handing children into the cockpit as Russians and foreigners view what three years ago was shrouded behind hangars in a city which itself had been closed until the end of the eighties. Yet these 'red directors' are the flower of the Soviet crop -commanding, highly educated, devoted to their enterprises. They like neither the chaos of the 'market' nor privatisation but insist they can run their enterprises for the benefit of the country they have served. After six years of Gorbachev, two of Yeltsin, industrial leaders in Russia's most market-oriented region remain what they have always been.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'IVAN TERRIBLE' APPEALS CONVICTION;  </P> <P> DEMJANJUK'S WAR CRIMES TRIAL JUDGES DESCRIBED AS BIASED  </P> <P> The trial judges who convicted retired Ohio auto worker John Demjanjuk of  killing Jews at a World War II death camp were biased, his attorney said today  in court arguments appealing the war crimes conviction.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, a three-judge panel found that Demjanjuk was a brutal guard  known as "Ivan the terrible," who operated gas chambers at the Treblinka death  camp in Poland from 1942 to 1943. More than 850,000 Jews died there.  </P> <P> Demjanjuk, 70, of Cleveland, was sentenced to death under a 1950 Israeli law  allowing prosecution of Nazis and their collaborators.  </P> <P> The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has maintained he is a victim of mistaken identity  and that he was incarcerated in German POW camps during the period in question.  </P> <P> Speaking before a five-justice Supreme Court panel, Demjanjuk's Israeli  attorney, Yoram Sheftel, said he disputed the conviction on 10 points. The most  significant, Sheftel said, was "the bias of the court."  </P> <P> "It should lead to the clear conclusion that the conviction should be canceled  and especially in a case where the sentence is capital punishment," he said.  </P> <P> Sheftel argued at length about what he said was a hostile atmosphere created by  news reports and the judges' treatment of the defense during the 17-month  trial.  </P> <P> He claimed the trial judges -- Dov Levine, Dalia Dorner and Shmuel Tal --  subscribed to a clipping service that twice daily delivered reports from  newspapers. He also asserted the judges briefed reporters on occasion.  </P> <P> He said biased reporting "clearly had a great deal of influence on the court.  Sometimes I thought I wasn't sitting in a court but at Bloomfield," a football  stadium near Tel Aviv, Sheftel said.  </P> <P> He said there were frequent shouts and interruptions from the audience at the  trial, which was held in a converted movie theater.  </P> <P> "Not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in fact was not  done," said Sheftel.  </P> <P> Throughout today's proceedings, Demjanjuk, wearing a dark brown prison uniform,  listened impassively from a witness stand, guarded by two policemen. He  muttered "good morning" in Hebrew as he entered the courtroom wearing handcuffs  and then embraced his son, John Jr.  </P> <P> Demjanjuk's wife, Vera, also was present and refused to speak to reporters.  </P></p>

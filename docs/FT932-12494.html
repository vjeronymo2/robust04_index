			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Now for the hard part WESTERN GOVERNMENTS have reacted with palpable, and understandable, relief to the vote of confidence which Russian voters registered in their president on Sunday. Having invested so much political capital in supporting Boris Yeltsin and his economic policies over the preceding month, they could not fail to be gratified that those long-suffering citizens who voted saw fit to approve of both by a convincing margin. But it is far too early for anyone to breathe easily about the future of Russian reform. On the contrary, the most painful and urgently needed decisions are yet to come. It is far from clear how or when President Yeltsin will take them, and whether his government is either inclined or equipped to make them stick. But without decisive action now to curb inflation and stabilise the economy, backed with western aid as promised by foreign and finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo two weeks ago, the danger of a hyperinflationary collapse is bound to grow stronger by the week. Mr Yeltsin's essential problem is the struggle with his opponents in the Congress of People's Deputies, which the referendum result has done little to resolve. However strong his popular mandate, the president still has scant prospect of persuading deputies to accept a new constitution that will do them out of a job. If he fails, he may himself set a date for new parliamentary elections. Either way, Russia seems set for several more months of political uncertainty, heightened in the autumn by another election campaign. It is scarcely a climate in which to expect rational economic policy-making. More likely, on the evidence of pledges to increase wages, pensions and credit to industry made by both president and parliament during the weeks before the referendum, it is a period of pork-barrel promises and intensifying inflationary pressures, something that the Russian economy will be unable to stand for very much longer. The immediate task is complicated by increasingly obvious divisions on the economy within the government itself. While ministers are unanimous about the need to control inflation, they have been all too ready to sanction the granting of new credits to bankrupt state enterprises. Ostensibly united in their commitment to the market, the president and government have failed to articulate a plausible strategy for getting there or to give the populace a coherent explanation of the choices they face. If anything, the result of Sunday's referendum has thrown those choices into even starker relief. It showed that President Yeltsin remains the best hope for Russian reform, and that if he chooses to push ahead with policies which will make economic and political change irreversible, he should be able to carry the majority with him. As important, the campaign exposed the intellectual bankruptcy among Mr Yeltsin's most vocal opponents. They know what they do not like, yet have nothing coherent to put in its place. But the campaign also demonstrated the emergence of a new political class arguing persuasively that talk of a so-called 'third way', in which change would somehow be made less painful, is an illusion. In practice, this alternative route will either lead back towards a command economy, or to chaos, or possibly to both at once. Although the president's instincts tell him to seek compromise, he should follow the suggestions of those who understand the choices Russia actually faces. This is the message western governments should waste no opportunity to convey to Russia's leaders over the next few weeks as they prepare to back their support for Mr Yeltsin with a fresh injection of money. The so-called 'systemic transformation facility' which the IMF plans to start disbursing in June, without applying strict conditions, is a clear if risky acknowledgement that a politically stable and reforming Russia is a prize well worth striving for. If it works, it will help keep the economy ticking over and contain inflation through what promises to be a turbulent summer. Mr Yeltsin cannot afford to relax.</p>

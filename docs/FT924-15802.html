			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Abbot's bid for Blystad cleared The Takeover Panel yesterday cleared a bid by Abbot Holdings for Blystad Group of any breach of its code. Three directors of Blystad, which is involved in oil services, had complained that there had been an arrangement between Abbot and the three Blystad brothers, who own 65 per cent of the target. It was alleged that Abbot had agreed not to try to recover immediately a loan of about Pounds 2m to a company in which the Blystads were interested in return for their acceptance of the Pounds 7.5m paper bid. An offer document is now expected. The directors who are not part of the Blystad family oppose the offer.</p>

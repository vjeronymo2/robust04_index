			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second change being proposed in this area is in regard to the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period that a hypothetical individual is assumed to be at the exclusion area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary. While the duration of the time period remains at a value of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours, the Commission is proposing that this time period not be fixed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to the appearance of fission products within containment, but that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various two-hour periods be examined with the objective that the dose to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE for any two-hour period after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance of fission products within containment. The Commission is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this change to reflect improved understanding of fission product release into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the containment under severe accident conditions. For an assumed instantaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release of fission products, as contemplated by the present rule, the two hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period that commences with the onset of the fission product release clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in the highest dose to a hypothetical individual offsite. Improved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of severe accidents shows that fission product releases to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment do not occur instantaneously, and that the bulk of the releases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not take place for about an hour or more. Hence, the two-hour period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commencing with the onset of fission product release may not represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest dose that an individual could be exposed to over any two-hour period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, the Commission is proposing that various two-hour periods be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined to assure that the dose to a hypothetical individual at the exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area boundary will not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE over any two-hour period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the onset of fission product release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site Dispersion Factors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Site dispersion factors have been utilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide an assessment of dose to an individual as a result of a postulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident. Since the Commission intends to require that a verification be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the exclusion area distance is adequate to assure that the guideline dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a hypothetical individual will not be exceeded under postulated accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, as well as to assure that radiological limits are met under normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating conditions, the Commission is proposing that the atmospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispersion characteristics of the site will be required to be evaluated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that site dispersion factors based upon this evaluation be determined and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in assessing radiological consequences of normal operations as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low Population Zone. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The present regulation requires that a low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population zone (LPZ) be defined immediately beyond the exclusion area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residents are permitted in this area, but the number and density must be such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the nearest densely populated center containing more than about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25,000 residents must be located no closer than one and one-third times the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outer boundary of the LPZ. Finally, the dose to a hypothetical individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at the outer boundary of the LPZ over the entire course of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident must not be in excess of the dose values given in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before 1980, the LPZ generally defined the distance over which public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective actions were contemplated in the event of a serious accident. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations in 10 CFR 50.47 now requires plume exposure Emergency Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zones (EPZ) of about 10 miles for each plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Commission considers that the siting functions intended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the LPZ, namely, a low density of residents and the feasibility of taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective actions, have been accomplished by other regulations or can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished by other guidance, the Commission continues to believe that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that limits the radiological consequences over the course of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident provides a useful evaluation of the plant's long-term capability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate postulated accidents. For this reason, the Commission is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain the requirement that the dose consequences be evaluated at the outer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of the LPZ over the course of the postulated accident and that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Physical Characteristics of the Site. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It has been required that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical characteristics of the site, such as the geology, seismology,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrology, meteorology characteristics be considered in the design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction of any plant proposed to be located there. The proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require that these characteristics be evaluated and that site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters, such as design basis flood conditions or tornado wind loadings be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for use in evaluating any plant to be located on that site in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to ensure that the occurrence of such physical phenomena would pose no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undue hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nearby Transportation Routes, Industrial and Military Facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for natural phenomena, it has been a long-standing NRC staff practice to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review man-related activities in the site vicinity to provide assurance that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential hazards associated with such facilities or transportation routes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will pose no undue risk to any plant proposed to be located at the site. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would codify this practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adequacy of Security Plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule would require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of the site be such that adequate security plans and measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the plant could be developed. The Commission envisions that this would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entail a small secure area considerably smaller than that envisioned for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adequacy of Emergency Plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule would also require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the site characteristics be such that adequate plans to carry out protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures for members of the public in the event of emergency could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

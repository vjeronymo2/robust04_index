In just one move, Cardoso may have played  into the hands of those contending that the plan is  election-oriented. Besides, in so doing, Cardoso has put his  successor at the Finance Ministry, Rubens Ricupero, in an  awkward position.    Ricupero's authority has been eroded by Cardoso. Ricupero  sustained this blow at a time when he is trying to strengthen  his position as manager of the economic plan and to free himself  from the persistent shadow of his predecessor. Proof of this is  Ricupero's assertion that the plan is acquiring a new identity.  For his part, Cardoso -- whose aim is focused on the election  -- has made it clear that he does not want his trademark removed  from the plan.    Cardoso also is leaving himself open to an uproar of  criticism by his adversaries, who are interested in weakening  his candidacy by way of his economic plan. If Cardoso wants to  influence the stabilization program's future, it would be best  for him to use his Senate seat to help revive the constitutional  revision process.</p>

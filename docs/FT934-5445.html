			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / People: Inchcape reduces its board Two of Inchcape's most senior directors are leaving the international services and marketing group, and the company has decided to take the opportunity to have a smaller and more strategically focused main board. According to Charles Mackay, the chief executive, the move to a smaller board is not intended to diminish the importance of the group's business streams - motors, marketing and business services. Indeed, the intention is to give each its own own board and increase their operational and financial autonomy. Alan Marsh, 57, who will take early retirement in May, is responsible for Inchcape's worldwide businesses with Toyota. He will be succeeded by David John, 55, currently the main board director for Inchcape's marketing business stream. Reg Heath, 52, who will leave on September 1 next year, is the main board director responsible for the group's other motor businesses, apart from Toyota. He was chief executive of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor distributor which Inchcape bought for Pounds 376m at the end of 1991. A well-known figure in the UK motor trade, Heath is credited by Inchcape with having done a 'terrific' job in integrating TKM. He is likely to receive plenty of offers, but so far has made no plans. Alan Davies, 44, will replace David John as chief executive of the marketing business stream. Maurice Rourke, 45, will succeed Heath as chief executive of Inchcape's motor businesses, other than Toyota. Neither Davies nor Rourke will be appointed to the main board. Simon Arnold, 60, will also step down from the main board in May, having reached retirement age. He will, however, continue as chairman and chief executive of Bain Clarkson, a position he has held since 1985 as part of his overall responsibility for Inchcape's worldwide insurance services business. John's move to run the Toyota businesses reflects the continuing importance to Inchcape of its links with the Japanese group. In 1990 Toyota paid Inchcape Pounds 60m for a stake in Toyota (GB), the UK distribution company, which will rise to 51 per cent in 1998. John has known Toyota from his time as chief executive of Inchcape Berhard, when he was responsible for Toyota operations in Singapore and Brunei. Davies, who replaces John as chief executive of Inchcape's marketing business stream, joined the group in 1989 and became chief executive of Inchcape Middle East last year. Before joining Inchcape, he spent 16 years with Rothmans International, the tobacco group. Rourke, who succeeds Heath, is currently development director for Inchcape's motor businesses other than Toyota. He has 20 years experience in the European motor industry and worked with Renault UK and BMW before joining TKM in 1977.</p>

Despite press reports claiming the Duma's unwillingness to  consider the "intermediate document", the upgraded draft was  submitted to the Duma by presidential structures on April 4 and  has been analyzed by committees, commissions, factions and  deputy groups, head of the duma press service Viktor Cheremukhin  told ITAR- TASS.    In his words, the U.S. congressmen were inspired by Rybkin's  words that the civic peace agreement will be concluded by  representatives of the three power branches and party leaders  and remain open to all political forces of society.</p>

This  paper will discuss the results of treating industrial  wastewater, sludge and other waste substances with this process.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The treatment of residential wastes, including wastewater  and  sludge, is of grave social concern in light of global  environmental problems.    The catalytic wet oxidation process, which is intended to  decompose these wastes with great efficiency, employs air  (oxygen) and specific mixtures of catalysts at high temperature  and high pressure.    Unlike conventional treatment methods, the process in  question is a new technique which is based on a quite different  physic-chemical treatment for decomposing pollutants. In this  process, highly concentrated pollutants, such as nitrogen  compounds (including ammonia), COD and BOD components and  sludge, are treated with very high efficiency in a single step  without any dilution. The pollutants are oxidized, decomposed  and converted into harmless N[.sub]2[/], CO[.sub]2[/],  H[.sub]2[/]O, etc. As a result, no sludge requiring secondary  treatment is generated, and the exhaust gas contains neither NOx  nor SOx. What is more, surplus heat energy can be recovered in  various ways depending on the treatment scale, while liquid  clarification, deodorization, disinfection and other desirable  effects can be obtained. The process can be applied to various  types of systems: individual-treatment systems, with complete  oxidative decomposition of pollutants; and combined-treatment  systems, in which organic substances are first partially  oxidized (low-molecular-weight substance processing) by  catalytic action and then undergo further anaerobic digestion  processes, to name two. The catalytic wet oxidation process can  be widely applied to the treatment of various types of  wastewater and sludge: industrial wastewater, sludge generated  in the activated sludge processing of night soil, industrial  wastewater and sewage water, residential wastes, and many others.  <H5>  2. The Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process </H5>   2-1. Features of the Process    This process has the following outstanding features not  found  in conventional treatment techniques such as, the noncatalytic  wet oxidation process (called the Zimmerman Process).    (1) Compared to the conventional Zimmerman Process and  similar wet oxidation processes, this process excess at removing  highly concentrated CODcr and other components which contain  persistent organic matter.    (2) This process can decompose various kinds of nitrogen  compounds which may exist in the wastewater and convert them  into nitrogen gas. The conventional processes cannot treat  ammonia and other nitrogen components.    (3) Along with the very efficient treatment of pollutants,  wastewater can be clarified, deodorized, disinfected, and then  completely recycled. The exhaust gas contains neither NOx nor  SOx and is odorless.    (4) Three to five hours after the system is started up, the  process becomes stable. From then on the system will maintain a  stable level of treatment without being affected by changes in  raw water quality.    (5) The treatment system is compact in design and requires a  relatively small installation space.    (6) Highly concentrated sludge, COD and BOD components,  ammonia and other nitrogen compounds can be efficiently  decomposed in a single stage process. Depending on the selected  process conditions, persistent organic and inorganic matter can  also be converted into easily decomposed or low-molecular-weight  substances, which can then be treated by further biological  processing (anaerobic and aerobic treatments).    This process has proved applicable not only to various kinds  of industrial and residential wastewater but also to sludge  discharged during the activated sludge treatment process of  night soil, industrial wastewater and sewage water.    2-2. Processing Sequence    Figure 1 shows the processing sequence. The wastewater and  sludge to be treated is first made homogeneous, preferably in  the storage tank. Then it is pressurized and fed to the heat  exchanger. Air is used as the source of oxygen. It is  pressurized to nearly the same level as the feed water and mixed  with the water just before it enters the heat exchanger.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-07A>      Figure 1. Flow Chart of the Catalytic Wet Oxidation  Process </FIG>     The heat exchanger is usually a multi-tube type. A  double-tube type is employed when a great many suspended solids  are contained in the feed water or when scale builds up in the  tube over time. The fixed bed of the reactor is charged with the  required amount of catalyst, which triggers the decomposition of  pollutants.    The mixture of unprocessed feed water and compressed air is  preheated in an exchange of heat with the high-temperature gases  and treated fluids coming out of the reactor in the  gaseous/liquid phase flow. The mixture is thereby heated to the  required temperature for starting the reaction. When the system  first starts operation, a furnace is used to heat the feed  fluid. When the target reaction temperature has been reached,  the external thermal source is shut down. From that point on,  the raw feed water is heated solely by the oxidized mixture  flowing out of the system. This exchange of heat creates a  self-sustaining temperature high enough to support the reaction.    2-3. Reaction Heat    Figure 2 shows the relationship between the level of  organics  in the wastewater and the amount of heat required for  reaction.[.sup]1[/] In the wet oxidation process, autogenous  combustion can be achieved in the range where the CODcr  components in the wastewater (or sludge) exceed 10 g/l. In this  process, the reaction heat derived from the decomposition of the  COD components as well as the heat generated by the breakdown of  the ammonia in the wastewater (or sludge) contribute to  effective heat recovery.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-07B>      Figure 2. Amount of Organics in the Wastewater; Heat Requirements[.sup]1[/] (comparison of wet oxidation and </FIG>     2-4. Reaction Conditions    The reaction conditions -- temperature, pressure, oxygen  demand, pre-reaction pH value, etc. -- will vary with the  components and their concentration in the wastewater or sludge,  as well as with the target water quality level. The oxygen  demand is the amount of oxygen that is required to completely  oxidize and decompose the pollutants in the wastewater or  sludge. Such pollutants can be fully decomposed with a volume of  oxygen that is 1.05-1.2 times the theoretical oxygen demand.  This figure is based on the decomposition reaction of each  component, shown in Figure 3.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-08A>      Figure 3. Decomposition Reaction Formulae of Various Components in the Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process </FIG>     The catalysts used in this process have proved to have a  long  service life in the high-temperature, high-pressure liquid phase  of the process. The catalytic elements use titania, zirconia or  the like (as either a one-element or two-element system) as the  carrier and they also contain a mixture of precious or base  metals (two or more metals) which comprise several percent of  the element. As shown in Photo 1, these catalytic elements are  spherical or honeycomb in shape. The amount of catalyst to be  added to a specific system depends on the results expected from  the treatment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-08B>      Photo 1. Catalysts (left: honeycomb catalyst, right: spherical catalyst) </FIG>     2-5. The Decomposition of Pollutants    Wastewater or sludge is introduced into the reactor, which  has been charged with the catalyst, at a specified temperature  and pressure. The pollutants in the water or sludge are  decomposed in the reactions shown in Figure 3. As shown in  Figure 4, COD components are decomposed into carbon dioxide and  water after passing through an intermediate stage as a  low-molecular-weight carboxylic acid.[.sup]2[/] The waste gas  discharged from the reactor contains neither NOx nor SOx and is  odorless.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-09A>      Figure 4. Mechanism of the Decomposition Reaction of COD Components </FIG>   <H5>  3. The Treatment of Industrial Wastewater </H5>   3-1. The Treatment of Wastewater (Gas Liquor) From Coke  Ovens    Table 1 shows the gas liquor treatment performance of a test  plant with several reactors, each of which is 300mm in inner  diameter and 6,500mm in height. (This plant was constructed in  1979 with an initial wastewater treatment capacity of 6  m[.sup]3[/]/day. Still in operation, the plant's treatment  capacity can be boosted to 60 m[.sup]3[/]/day when the  wastewater is relatively low in pollution. See Photo 2 [not  reproduced])     Highly concentrated COD and ammonia components are  decomposed  to a level of 10 mg/l or less after a 24-minute reaction (SV =  2.5 Hr[.sup]-1[/]). Phenol and cyanide are decomposed to  levels below the minimum limits of detection, and all suspended  solids can be thoroughly removed. Meanwhile, NOx and SOx  concentrations in the exhaust gas are reduced to levels below  the minimum limits of determination (0.5 and 2.0  Mg/Nm[.sup]3[/] respectively), with no signs of growth. It is  assumed that the reaction mechanism, especially the catalytic  COD reaction mechanism, provides a complex, sequentially  competing reaction which produces low-molecular-weight carbonic  acid as an intermediate product. The reaction rate formulae  which match the experimental results are:    -d(X NH[.sub]3[/]/dt = K[.sub]1[/] x (C  NH[.sub]3[/]) x (P O[.sub]2[/])    -d(X COD)/dt = K[.sub]2[/] x (C COD)[.sup]2[/] x (P  O[.sub]2[/])    The reaction rate constants of the COD and ammonia  components  correlate with the reaction temperature (150-280C) of the  processing gas liquor (initial pH 10.5 in reaction) as follows:    log K[.sub]1[/] NH[.sub]3[/] = 22.72 - 9119/T    log K[.sub]2[/] COD = 4.72 - 2020/T    As a result of the noncatalytic treatment of gas liquor, no  decomposition of ammonia is seen and the COD decomposition rate  is less than one hundredth that of catalytically treated gas  liquor. Even if the reaction time is prolonged two- to sixfold,  the residual COD value of about 1,000 mg/l remains nearly  unchanged in the effluent.    It has been confirmed that the catalyst developed for this  process is highly stable in actual use. An 11,000-hour catalyst  service life test, processing gas liquor from a coke oven,  showed that the catalytic activity was unchanged. The test  conditions and results are given in Figure 5. When the reaction  time is changed from 20 minutes to 35 minutes with the other  conditions remaining the same, no ammonia is detected in the  treated water and the COD value drops to below 10 mg/l.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-10A>      Figure 5. Continuous Activity Test Results: Gas Liquor </FIG>     Figure 6 shows the results of case studies of material  balance and heat balance after the treatment of gas liquor at a  rate of 40 m[.sup]3[/]/hr.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-10B>      Figure 6.

The Treatment of Wastewater Containing Highly  Concentrated Cyanide[.sup]3[/]    The treatment of wastewater containing highly concentrated  cyanide will be reported in detail in another session dealing  with ``Desalination and Water Treatment in Harmony with the  Environment.''    3-3. The Treatment of Other Types of Industrial  Wastewater    Table 2 shows the results of treating other types of  industrial wastewater.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  4. The Treatment of Sludge </H5>[.sup]4,5,6[/] and Residential  Wastes    4-1. The Treatment of Sludge    (1) The treatment system    Figure 7 shows a proposed new sewage and sludge treatment  system. Conventional sewage treatment systems that process  activated sludge need to retain the sludge for six to eight  hours for processing. The proposed new system allows a shorter  aeration time in order to effectively remove soluble BOD and COD  components. In the proposed system, most of the earth and sand,  extraneous large solids and suspended solids are removed in the  first stage of settling and straining. Then an activated sludge  process is used, requiring about two hours of aeration time. The  suspended solids and surplus sludge which remain after the first  stage of settling, straining and the final settling constitute  about 2-6 percent of the total liquid. This liquid is then  treated by the catalytic wet oxidation process.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-12A>      Figure 7. New Sewage and Sludge Treatment System </FIG>     The process can be used in two different types of systems:  individual-treatment systems and combined-treatment systems  which include an anaerobic digestion process (see Figure 6). In  the latter type of system, the sludge is made soluble and the  persistent organic matter is converted to easily decomposed  low-molecular-weight organic substances. The resulting fluid is  fed as needed to a separation membrane to let particles with  less than a certain molecular weight permeate through the  membrane. The fluid that comes through this membrane then  undergoes an anaerobic digestion process in order to recover the  methane gas it can produce. The sludge generated during this  process is circulated to the catalytic wet oxidation process for  re-treatment. The inorganic matter (ash content) is removed from  the system.    A research and development project was launched in 1991 with  the cooperation of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), the Water Re-use Promotion Center (WRPC), Osaka  Gas Co., Ltd. and other participant corporations.    (2) The results of treating sludge[.sup]4,5[/]    In this test, sewage sludge was used to prepare a  concentration-adjusted sample of sludge water. The results of  the test, using 4 percent sewage sludge water at 270C and  8.43 MPa of pressure, are shown in Table 3.     In the noncatalytic process, the amounts of the components  do  not change remarkably, even after one hour of reaction time. It  is clear from this data that the catalyst plays a very effective  role in this new treatment process. It should be noted that in  the noncatalytic process the amount of NH[.sub]3[/]-N is  increased. This is because the organic nitrogen components in  the raw water are converted to NH[.sub]3[/]-N during  processing.    In the catalytic process, T-N, NH[.sub]3[/]-N,  COD[.sub]Mn[/], COD[.sub]Cr[/], BOD, TOD and TOC can all  be almost completely removed in one hour of reaction time. To  remove the scale which can build up in the system, periodic  chemical flushing is carried out.    See references 4 and 5 the results of the anaerobic  digestion  processing sludge water which has been partially oxidized by the  catalyst.    4-2. The Treatment of Residential Wastes    With the tremendous changes in lifestyle today, the volume  of  residential wastes has steadily increased. The treatment of  those wastes is now a serious social issue for many reasons  including the rising cost of collecting wastes, the shortage of  incineration facilities, and the reduction in the number of  landfills, to name just a few.    To solve these problems, a research and development project  was launched in 1991 with the cooperation of the MITI, the New  Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, the  WRPC, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and other corporations. This project  is designed to develop two systems to recover new energy from  solid wastes and wastewater which have a high potential for  recoverable energy. One system is a high-efficiency transfer  system for solid wastes and wastewater, and the other is an  energy recovery system which combines a physic-chemical waste  treatment process (the process discussed in this paper) and a  biological treatment process in an effective way.    This technological development program is specifically  intended to carry out the following steps: pulverize kitchen  garbage and combustible wastes (paper and plastics), turn the  particles into sludge, make the sludge soluble in the  noncatalytic section of the catalytic wet oxidation system,  convert the resulting fluid to low-molecular-weight substances  in the catalytic section, and recover the methane gas produced  by these materials through the anaerobic digestion process.  <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   This catalytic wet oxidation process can be used to  completely decompose the highly concentrated pollutants which  are seen in various kinds of industrial wastewater and night  soil. It is also more effective than ever before in treating  sewage sludge, which contains a large quantity of solid organic  matter, without having to dehydrate and dry the sludge.  Depending on the selection of reaction conditions, this process  can be used alone or combined with other processes. In the  individual-treatment application, pollutants can be fully  decomposed into harmless substances. In combined applications,  solid organic matter is first made soluble and then converted  into low-molecular-weight substances (easily decomposed  organics) through a partial oxidation treatment. Finally a  biological treatment of the material (anaerobic digestion  treatment, for example) is carried out. The catalytic wet  oxidation process causes a substantial improvement in  performance in comparison to conventional processes such as heat  treatment or the Zimmerman Process. In addition to the treatment  of sewage sludge, residential wastes that have been pulverized,  converted to sludge and mixed with highly concentrated  wastewater, may also be treated with this process.    The authors hope that this process will be applied in many  fields and contribute to solving today's environmental problems.

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Mercury comes up with new number Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company, was yesterday offering compensation to the hundreds of new subscribers who could not take advantage of an offer of free calls on Christmas day because its network was overloaded. One-2-One, a sister company to Mercury Communications, had promised customers buying its phones between November 8 and December 24 an unlimited number of free calls to anywhere in the world on December 25. The mobile phone operator said that 80 per cent of new customers successfully made calls. But the level of demand, which surprised the company, meant that hundreds of subscribers were unable to make calls, mainly to numbers abroad. One-2-One is thought to have received more than 500 complaints and was yesterday dealing with them on a case-by-case basis, offering free call credits worth up to Pounds 40 to new subscribers shown on its computer to have been unable to make calls. It calculated that the average value of calls by new customers on Christmas day was about Pounds 41. The company said: 'We would not have launched a promotion if we thought we could not fulfil it. The company's reputation is very important. We did not anticipate some people spending the amount of time they did on the phones. Our forecasts were exceeded dramatically by a number of people.' At least 20 customers spent more than 12 hours on the phone, while another 20 made more than 2,000 calls between them. In total, 1.5m calls were made on One-2-One on Christmas day, totalling more than 6.3m call minutes (105,000 hours) - equivalent to 75 per cent of call traffic in a typical week. Free calls under the promotion accounted for 4.1m minutes - for which customers would otherwise have paid more than Pounds 2m. Some 2.3m minutes of international calls were made, 12 times the Sunday average. The operator, a joint venture between Mercury Communications' parent Cable &amp; Wireless and American company US West, insisted that it had remained within its Pounds 5m budget for the promotion. The number of One-2-One subscribers is thought to have risen to almost 200,000, from 140,000 at the end of September. It was unclear yesterday whether One-2-One would face regulatory action over the promotion. Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, said Mercury had not breached any of the conditions of its licence. However, Oftel would take up any complaints it received about the promotion with One-2-One. It had received two by yesterday. Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said this week he was writing to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to complain about the promotion.</p>

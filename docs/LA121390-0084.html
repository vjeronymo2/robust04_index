			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE POTTED PINE OPTION  </P> <P> If the practice of buying a new tree each year seems wasteful -- and purchasing  a fake conifer isn't an option -- you may want to look into buying a potted  tree.  </P> <P> "You can buy a five- to six-foot tree that's in a 15-gallon container," said  Michelle Dunn, manager of Nature's Best Nursery in Camarillo.  </P> <P> "One of the best trees to use is the Aleppo pine," Dunn said. "It's a real  compact tree that grows well in Southern California and is easy to prune a nice  Christmas-tree shape."  </P> <P> Dunn said to keep the potted tree outside in full sun after the holiday season  is over and the decorations are put away. "You'll also need to keep it well  watered, especially during the summer -- water it a couple times a week."  </P> <P> Don't expect to use the tree for more than two Yuletide celebrations.  </P> <P> If it stays in the pot much longer than that, "it will start to get root-bound  and soon after that it dies," she said. "The root system becomes choked and  there's just not enough soil to sustain the tree."  </P> <P> Dunn suggests transplanting the tree to your yard. "It's a good tree for  all-around landscaping."  </P></p>

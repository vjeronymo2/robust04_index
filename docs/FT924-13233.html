			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Eggar sets out sell-off dates: Minister sees 'long road' to privatisation THE GOVERNMENT will press ahead with plans to privatise British Coal in spite of the mounting furore over the decision to close more than half of its pits. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday that he hoped to present legislation late next month or by Christmas at the latest. But he said there would be 'a long road' to privatisation, and he did not expect the shape and form of the sale to be completed until next July at the earliest. Meanwhile, he said, 'no irrevocable decisions have been taken on issues of concern to those involved in the privatisation'. Mr Eggar, addressing an Institute of Energy conference, said that four issues would be taken into account: The safety and health of mineworkers in a newly privatised industry must be paramount. The reduced energy costs resulting from the cuts at British Coal must be passed to consumers by the generators. The mining and marketing of coal should be kept separate from the leasing and licensing of exploration and production. There would be a new licensing authority which would have no conflict of interest in awarding licences. The pensions and concessionary fuel entitlements of past and present employees must be safeguarded. Mr Eggar also repeated a commitment to give management and staff the opportunity to have a stake in the business. He stressed that no decisions had yet been taken on whether there should be a trade sale, an issue of shares or a management/employee buy-out.</p>

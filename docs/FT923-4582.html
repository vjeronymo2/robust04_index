			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Travel: A rich folk's cruise on the Saone - Michael Thompson-Noel enjoys a restorative (but expensive) experience on a Burgundian waterway THE MV Napoleon is a river cruiser that generally plies its trade on the River Rhone, in France, between Lyon and Arles, or vice versa. It is 129ft long and 16 1/2 ft wide, and was converted from the hull of a freight-carrying barge built in Belgium in 1963. Sounds like a plodder? Not at all, for the purchase and transformation of the Napoleon from barge to luxury passenger vessel cost Dollars 1.5m. As a result, its owners are confident that it is the most comfortable small river cruiser operating in Europe. Which means that it isn't cheap. In the current high season (until mid-October), eight days and seven nights on the Napoleon cost Pounds 2,566 per person, with an extra charge for single passengers of Pounds 1,183 (total: Pounds 3,749). Even at low-season rates (October 21-November 11), eight days and seven nights on the Napoleon are priced at Pounds 2,196 per person (single supplement: Pounds 1,011). I was aboard the Napoleon recently, not as a fare-paying passenger, I needlessly add, but as a non-paying guest accompanied by Miss Lee, my assistant. The only other passengers were a travel writer from The Daily Telegraph and her assistant. None of us was paying. It was all buckshee. Which made me wonder, as we gaily cruised along, whether a venture like the Napoleon - a maximum of 12 passengers in six luxurious double cabins, en suite marble bathrooms, TV and video, air-conditioning, a palatial main-deck lounge, an 800 sq ft sun-deck with a six-person Jacuzzi, perfectly decent food, flexible itinerary and a seven-strong crew of impeccable disposition - was inspired or foolhardy. Inspired, I greatly hope, for cruising on the Napoleon must be one of the most engaging and relaxing ways of seeing France yet devised. The vessel mainly cruises on the Rhone, though my trip was on the Saone, a gentle Rhone tributary, pottering from Vienne to Seurre, near Dijon, a distance of 280km, via Lyon, Trevoux, Macon, Tournus and Chalon-sur-Saone. Nothing could have been more soothing. The Saone cruise is particularly aimed at those interested in Burgundy's wine, architecture and pre-history. At Pounds 367 per night, the cruise is restorative and healing, with plenty of side-excursions. The Napoleon's first season was last year, when business was sabotaged by war and recession. This year, Charterbarge, the company that owns it, is hoping for an occupancy rate of 70 per cent, of whom many will be Americans. The president of Charterbarge is an Englishman, Gerard Morgan-Grenville, who lives in Normandy. Morgan-Grenville says that one of his life-long hobbies has been landscape painting. He bought a barge, the Virginia Anne, as a floating studio, and it was this that turned him into a waterway freak with an interest in the liquid history of Europe's rivers and canals. The Virginia Anne, newly refitted, now takes private parties of four or less on the Nivernais canal in Burgundy. The complete voyage, usually nine nights, runs from Auxerre to Chitry-les-Mines. A third vessel, the Fleur de Lys, is described by Charterbarge as a 'large, floating Champs Elysees apartment accommodating up to seven guests in unmeasured comfort.' The Fleur de Lys was launched in 1986, has three staterooms, carries a maximum of seven guests, has a small heated swimming pool on her foredeck and dreams along the Marne-to-Saone canal, also in Burgundy, through countryside virtually unchanged since the canal was built in 1863. A party of six chartering it for six nights in high season would pay Pounds 3,000 each; 13 nights: Pounds 5,334 each. If there were only two of you, the charge would be Pounds 9,000 for six nights, Pounds 16,000 for 13. Most canal and river passenger boats in France are British-crewed and -run. The Napoleon is lucky in its crew, six of whom are British, led by skipper Mike Gardner-Roberts, 34, whose wife Lesley also works on board. The only Frenchman is pilot Thierry Martin, 27, son of a long line of bargees, who has worked on the Rhone for 13 years. It must be pleasant to cruise the Rhone, which is France's fastest, most powerful river, second only to the Loire in length. In olden days, flat-bottomed wooden barges, often lashed together eight at a time, were pulled up-river by teams of 80-100 horses. By 1829, the journey down-stream, Lyon to Arles, could be done in 14 hours - much quicker than today, because of the monster locks with which the modern-day Rhone has been tamed, and slower current. The return journey took 88 hours. On the Napoleon, meals are informal, dress casual. You can always discuss menus with the cook. A visit to a Michelin three-star restaurant for lunch or dinner is included in the itinerary. The tour prices quoted here include airfares from London, all meals, drinks and excursions. The company states: 'Our staff do not expect gratuities as a matter of course. However, if you consider that you have been well looked after and would appreciate a guideline on tipping, we would suggest approximately 5 per cent of the ticket price as a suitable gesture.' I consulted long and hard with the Telegraph - 5 per cent of two ticket prices indicated a recommended gratuity of Pounds 256.60 per couple. 'We're not rich,' I told the Telegraph. 'Even the tip would cripple us.' In the end, we left Pounds 50 per couple.

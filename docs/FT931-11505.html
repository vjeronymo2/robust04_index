			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: SE criticised over plan to close USM PRICE Waterhouse yesterday criticised the Stock Exchange's proposal to close the Unlisted Securities Market and warned that as the economy recovers 'the case for a second market will re-emerge'. In a survey on the future of USM companies the firm said recovery would revive demand for smaller companies. 'The USM itself was the product of an expanding economy,' the report states. 'The Stock Exchange's proposal . . . comes at a low point in the USM's 12 year history.' It was regrettable, the report continues, that the Exchange had rejected proposals to relaunch the USM 'with sufficient distinction and identity to provide an alternative market'. Some 53 per cent of the 95 companies which responded to the survey - out of a total of 278 - were concerned about the potential closure of the USM. About 40 per cent said they welcomed the changes. Price Waterhouse noted, however, that those which welcomed the changes were largely longer-established USM companies. This suggested they had possibly outlived the USM and were more prepared for a main market listing. Most companies were in favour of a second market - 55 per cent as opposed to 45 per cent against. Price Waterhouse said that experience had shown a main market listing would not necessarily answer problems of marketability. The report also noted the concern of smaller companies about the possible loss of Inheritance Tax benefits in any transition to the Official List. More than 70 per cent considered the loss of such tax relief to be a significant obstacle. 'This situation is clearly unsatisfactory,' the report stated.</p>

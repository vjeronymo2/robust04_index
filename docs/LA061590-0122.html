			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> FROM GERMANY, WITH LOVE TO BALBOA  </P> <P> Southern California is one of the greatest places to live. I'm making this  observation as an exchange student from Essen, West Germany, participating in  the AFS International program.  </P> <P> The Ralph Rodheim family have been my hosts since August in their home on  Balboa Island. I remember very well how excited I got when their address  arrived at my home in Essen. I tried very hard to locate Balboa Island on a  map. After a while, I was able to pinpoint it on a special road map.  </P> <P> I feel very lucky not just to be in California, but on the island of Balboa,  surrounded by beaches and beautiful living areas.  </P> <P> I am a senior at Corona del Mar High School, together with three other AFS  foreign exchange students. This school's outstanding AFS chapter, supported by  many students and their parents, has been able to host a great number of  exchange students annually. Because of this program, my integration into the  American lifestyle was made so much easier.  </P> <P> I became interested in an exchange year when I was 13. My older brother in  Germany was considering such a program, and although he ended up not going, I  had already made my decision to go when I was old enough.  </P> <P> I chose the United States as my host country because of the language and my  curiosity about what America really looks like . . . fast food all the time,  the TV continually running and kind of a Disneyland-like style all over the  place.  </P> <P> Luckily, those expectations didn't come true.  </P> <P> On the way from Germany to the United States, I talked to a Californian at an  airport in New York, and he told me, "If you like surfing, the beach and nice  people, you will love Newport Beach."  </P> <P> That sounded good to me, and I found out he was right.  </P> <P> I have found that high school here is not just a place to study, but also a  very social place with lots of activities.  </P> <P> Before coming to America, I had never worn a tuxedo. But during this year, I  have worn a tux four times and have also been chauffeured around in sunroofed  limos twice. Although it was not the cheapest experience to attend a prom, it  was a fun time. Dances like that were a totally new experience for me.  </P> <P> The hardest difference in the academics of school, is the switch from "Queen's  English," which is generally taught throughout Europe, to "American English,"  with all its slang . . . "dude."  </P> <P> Another difference between school in Corona del Mar and Essen are the hallways  -- they don't exist here. I enjoy that very much -- to be outside all the time,  in between classes and on breaks.  </P> <P> I also experienced the "big deal" of high school athletics as a member of the  school's volleyball team.  </P> <P> Long workouts every day took up most of my time during those three months. I  was used to playing volleyball in Germany, but only two times per week in a  club. Generally, most of the athletic achievements take place as club sports in  Germany, not at school. But even then it is not carried out like here. A few  evenings or afternoons during the week, and that's it.  </P> <P> Although I did not reach the varsity level, I still profited a lot from this  experience, seeing athletics from a totally new viewpoint.  </P> <P> During this year I also experienced my first Halloween, complete with shaving  cream fights, and Thanksgiving, with lots of turkey. Now I am looking forward  to the experience of Fourth of July before heading back to Germany.  </P> <P> Traveling throughout the United States, I have found how special California is  and especially Newport Beach, with its close access to the snowy mountains,  great ski areas like Mammoth, as well as desert resorts and beautiful national  parks like Yosemite.  </P> <P> Let's not forget the warm and sunny beaches, where I enjoyed spending most of  my spare time playing volleyball, trying to surf or just laying back in the  sun. Weather is never a problem!  </P> <P> In my city of Essen, I have the forest with a big lake close to my house and  downtown not far, either. The coast atmosphere is the biggest difference  between the green of Essen and the sandy environment of here. I like both very  much, and I hope to come back to Newport Beach frequently on vacation.  </P> <P> On a trip to Denver, I realized the size of the United States. While driving  from Los Angeles to Colorado, you could have passed through all of Germany, and  almost all of Europe.  </P> <P> Speaking of drives, one of the main differences between our countries is the  importance of the car as a means of transportation.  </P> <P> I remember very well when I went shopping with my friend from Sweden, who is  also an AFS exchange student. Since we are not allowed to drive in our host  countries, we walked 10 minutes to the store. On the way back it was remarkable  that people driving by looked at us astonishingly as we carried shopping bags.  The sidewalks seem to have the wrong name in this country. On the other hand, I  enjoyed asking nice girls to give me rides home after school.  </P> <P> Going back to Germany in the middle of July, I will have to readjust to  different habits.  </P> <P> I will live as an only child, because my older brother is going off to college  after I return. Here, I had the experience of having a sister who became one of  my closest friends. Megan helped me adapt to my host community. On the first  day of school, she showed me around and introduced me to her friends.  </P> <P> It has also been exciting to see with what interest the Americans are following  the changes in all of Europe, especially Germany. I have found that, generally,  a reunified Germany is favored here.  </P> <P> The opening of the inner German border in November is considered a historical  moment, and I am personally delighted about that development. It is a strange  feeling to leave Germany and observe one of the most dramatic times in its  history from another country, and then, after 11 months, return to a changed  homeland.  </P> <P> I will be able to share a great time spent in the United States with my family  and friends. It is interesting to meet people from different countries, and it  is also very important to establish international friendships.  </P></p>

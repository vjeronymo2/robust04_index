			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 22, 1991, EPA notified the State of Arizona that EPA had not received by the May 15, 1991 deadline all required VOC rule corrections under section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. The finding letter identified that the Division had failed to submit required rule corrections. The official finding notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554). The Division's Rule 353 was listed in that finding notice. As a result, the Division had 18 months to submit those rules to EPA before a sanction would be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 29, 1992, in 57 FR 44718, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed conditional approval of the following Division rules into the Arizona SIP: Dry Cleaning, and (3) Rule 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The conditional approval proposed for the rules was based on the State's commitment to correct deficiencies identified in the rules by EPA. The corrected rules were submitted before EPA finalized the conditional approval and were submitted to fulfill the State's commitment to correct the deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Division's Rules 332, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning and 100, General Provisions and Definitions, were also proposed for conditional approval in the NPR. EPA is not taking action on Rule 332 at this time because EPA has developed regulations for perchloroethylene under Title III of the CAA. The Division is revising Rule 100 and EPA will act on that version after it is submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Arizona submitted several revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on June 29, August 10, and November 13, 1992 including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for the Division's Rule 331, Solvent Cleaning; Rule 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning (both adopted by the Division on June 22, 1992); Rule 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt (adopted September 21, 1992); and Rule 353, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks (adopted April 6, 1992). These submitted rules were found to be complete on September 3, 1992 (Rule 353), September 16, 1992, (Rule 340), and December 2, 1992 (Rules 331 and 333) pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. The finding of completeness stopped the sanctions clock that had been started for Rule 353 on October 22, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rules 331, 333, 340, and 353 are rules that control VOC emissions from the cleaning (degreasing) of parts, from dry cleaning operations using petroleum solvents, from asphalt used for roadways, and from the filling of tanks with gasoline. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The original rules which were the subject of the proposed conditional approval were submitted in response to EPA's SIP-Calls and the CAA requirement that nonattainment areas to fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. The current rules were submitted in fulfillment of the Division's commitment to fix remaining deficiencies identified in EPA's proposed conditional approval or in response the EPA's finding of nonsubmittal. The rules were adopted as part of the Division's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

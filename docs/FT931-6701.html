			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / How to Spend It: Relax, life is getting looser SO JUST what do you wear for all this new age exercise? Now that it is all meant to be fun not penance, clothes are following suit - they look less as if they are designed only for serious work-outs, and more like general casual-wear. Hot news from the West Coast of the US (whence most such fashions come) is that body-hugging, muscle-revealing, neon-bright scraps of elasticated fabrics are on the way out. It's bye-bye to the tight, show-off, constricting garb that reveals every flabby inch and hello to loose, comfortable, relaxed, shorts or sweat pants. Bye-bye, too, (and not a minute too soon as far as I am concerned) to the eyeball-searing colours and hello to nice, soft, understated grey, navy and black and white. All the up-to-the-minute sports chains such as Cobra, Champion, Sports Locker and the shops at the smartest clubs are selling this new relaxed gear. If you want a look that is wonderfully comfortable and yet has proper gym-cred then, according to Graham Haines of Sports Locker (17 Floral Street, London WC2 and 53 Pembridge Road, London W11), what you should go for, working from the top down, is a reverse-weave Champion sweat-shirt (Pounds 34.99, in lots of colours). Underneath that you should don a loose Russell Athletic pocket T-shirt, then some cotton-lycra knee-length pants (Pounds 34.99, smartest in strongly-striped black and grey), and on your feet chunky cotton socks by E G Smith (Pounds 10.99) which should be worn slouch-style - in other words, rumpled round the ankles. These are clothes 'with no gender barrier,' according to Graham Haines. 'Some 80 per cent of our merchandise is made for men but 40 per cent of it is worn by women. These are clothes that you could wear to the gym, on the street, or relaxing at home.' At Cobra, (mail order from 75 Great Eastern Street, London EC2, 071-613-1776) they report, too, that it is 'wear what you want time.' People are training in army trousers. Baggy light cotton training pants and baggy tops with loose necklines are all the rage. The tops are worn over baggy vests, the sleeves and trousers are rolled up. Training shoes, it seems, are being swapped for training boots. Big belts and crop tops are optional extras. Lots of customers, though, wear the baggy look OVER a tight lycra outfit - those who have sweated for the body beautiful and having got it are not about to keep it entirely covered up. What all this means, of course, for the rest of us still hoping to get there, is that now that we can trundle around in nice bulge-concealing gear there is even less of an excuse for not taking those self-same bulges off to the gym . . .</p>

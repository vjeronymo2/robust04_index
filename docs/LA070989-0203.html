			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAINING HIKE BY MARINE RESERVISTS  </P> <P> Regarding the article concerning Marine Corps reservists' 10-mile training hike  through Irvine and Newport Beach (June 27), the story was so embellished with  terrifying adverbs and adjectives that it appeared the march route was  populated with people whose mental capacity to comprehend is open to question.  </P> <P> The article was filled with terms such as "startles suburbanites," "quite  intimidating" to onlookers, "startled some civilians," "worried" residents, got  "strange looks" from drivers, "surprised" people, made people "uneasy at  first," individuals thought "we were getting into trouble" and "surprised and  scared" other persons.  </P> <P> Lord spare us if the people quoted are indicative of the home front in case of  actual conflict.  </P> <P> L.P. JONES, USMC (ret.)  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P></p>

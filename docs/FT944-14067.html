			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Observer: Unlocking the Key Why did Derek Keys resign as South Africa's finance minister after such a short time? His departure was botched and damaged investor confidence in South Africa at a particularly sensitive time. Keys says he stood down for 'personal reasons', but beyond that the question has never been adequately answered. There was speculation that he did it partly because he wanted to spend more time with a wife who did not like politics. Any suggestion that he quit because he was fed up with South Africa's new political regime has been stoutly denied. Hence the news that Keys is to move to London as executive chairman of Billiton, a subsidiary of the South African mining house he used to chair, only adds to the mystery over the real reasons for his departure. The sight of a respected former finance minister going back to work for one of his former employees and basing himself mainly overseas is not the most reassuring message for foreign investors in the new South Africa.</p>

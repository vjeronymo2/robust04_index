			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The mass media has spread reports about Vladislav  Ardzinba's radio address. According to these reports, Ardzinba  said he is rather skeptical about Georgian-Abkhaz consultations  set for 11 January. In this connection, the Georgian Foreign  Ministry has issued a statement which says, in particular:    Ardzinba's radio address shows not only his skepticism, but  is also an attempt to poison the atmosphere in advance of the  forthcoming [Geneva] talks and, if possible, to wreck them. His  judgements are a testimony of this. He says Abkhazia is no  longer part of Georgia, that Abkhazia has won the war, that  conditions are set by the winners, and that it is only possible  to talk about a treaty between Abkhazia and Georgia as two equal  entities.    The history of the conflict in Abkhazia has many examples  proving that Ardzinba and his supporters are used to trampling  on and scrapping agreements they have signed themselves. It is  enough to mention the fate of the Moscow and Sochi agreements.  Such perfidy has become for them an effective and common means  of carrying out their intentions.    In his New Year address to Abkhazians, Georgian head of  state  Eduard Shevardnadze said:    The democratic Georgian state is giving you not only a  guarantee of preserving your national identity but also a  guarantee of development and improvement, as well as appropriate  political, economic, and other guarantees. We promise this to  these people, as we do to anybody else who lives in Georgia. We  promise them freedom, civil rights guarantees, and anything else  which is accepted in the modern civilized world.    This was part of the statement by the Georgian Foreign  Ministry, the full text of which will be published in the press.</p>

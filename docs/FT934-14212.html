			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Syndicated loan volume ahead of 1992 total THE volume of loan syndications in the first nine months of this year has beaten last year's total by Dollars 40bn, in spite of a fall in volume in the third quarter. However, the rise in volume has not generated a similar rise in earnings for the banks. 'Healthy bank balance sheets juxtaposed with a dearth of deals have driven pricing and fees down to record lows, to the dismay of lenders,' said Investment Dealers' Digest and Bank Loan Report. Loan syndications volume for the first nine months of 1993 stood at Dollars 388.3bn, compared with Dollars 348.5bn last year. Third-quarter volume fell 14 per cent to Dollars 141.3bn from Dollars 164.3bn in the second quarter, but the third-quarter figure represented a 46.7 per cent rise over the same period in 1992. Chemical Bank remained at the top of the global loan syndications rankings at the end of the third quarter, with more than Dollars 38bn in syndications volume. Citicorp also retained its second position, with Dollars 33bn, while JP Morgan rose from 11th position to third position, with nearly Dollars 22bn.</p>

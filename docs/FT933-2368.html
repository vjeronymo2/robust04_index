			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Dozy days ahead: Country note THE DAY my wife wrecked her car was a good one for dormice. In no time the recently vacated car-port was taken over by three large cages and I was licensed as a keeper in the dormouse captive breeding and release scheme. Dormice are mouse-sized rodents, ginger in colour with furry tails, which hibernate for more than half the year and emerge during darkness to feed high in the trees. It is hardly surprising that their numbers had become severely depleted before anyone noticed. It was not always thus. The hazel dormouse tends to live in areas of hazel coppice where the spreading limbs of the older trees provide it with aerial routes essential for its arboreal lifestyle. Rich hazelnuts enable it to almost double its weight before hibernation. In the past, coppicing was a major industry in the countryside and hazel was an important component of the rural scene, providing material for hurdles, thatching pegs, tool handles and fuel for charcoal. Woodsmen often came across dormice and they were kept as pets by children. In 1882, Theodore Compton, in his book on the Mendip Hills, wrote: 'The pretty dormouse, more squirrel than mouse, is sometimes caught by our village boys who call it the seven sleeper.' The dormouse often sleeps for seven months of the year. This long hibernation is matched in the summer by periods of torpor, when the weather is poor or food is scarce, from which the dormouse can take up to 15 minutes to awaken. The disappearance of hazel coppice and hedgerows has not only deprived dormice of their habitat but also their means to move from one wood to another, for they rarely come down to the ground unless to hibernate. Many coppice woodlands have been reclaimed for agriculture while others have been felled and replanted with conifers. Even those purchased by conservation organisations generally have been managed to encourage woodland flora. Such regimes are rarely sympathetic to the needs of the dormouse. It is to emphasise the plight of this elusive and secretive mammal that English Nature, as part of its Species Recovery Programme, has declared eight days next month, October 27 to November 3, National Dormouse Week. Information will be available on the threat to dormice and their habitat, guidance on the special needs of dormice will be given to woodland owners and managers, and everyone will be invited to take part in the Great Nut Hunt. Dormice extract the nut kernels from hazel shells in a characteristic way and, by searching for such shells and sending them to a centre, members of the public can help English Nature to improve its knowledge of the status and distribution of these mammals. Dormice are thought to have disappeared completely from a number of northern and eastern counties of Britain. Only recently, for instance, were they discovered in a Northumberland wood and none is believed to exist in Scotland. The Great Nut Hunt will continue into 1994 and it is hoped that as many people as possible, especially children, will take part. An increasing number of woodlands are being found which, possibly because of benign neglect over the years, have all the right ingredients to supply the needs of dormice yet lack the animals themselves. The captive breeding scheme aims to put dormice back into these woods by controlled releases of dormice bred in captivity. The parents of the released animals are taken from the wild in the autumn if, on November 1, they weigh less than 14g (half an ounce). Late litters do not have time to amass enough fat to keep them ticking over during hibernation. Under normal circumstances they would die. Instead, they are taken into captivity and fed throughout the winter. Their young are released into the wild using special release cages. These contain food so the dormice can return at night to supplement their diet until they have learned enough to fend for themselves. Several animals were released last spring using this method, into a secret woodland location in the eastern counties. These dormice bred during the summer and four litters have been recorded. Now they have to find suitable places to hibernate and survive the winter - the most dangerous part of any hibernator's life. But then sleeping seems to be what dormice do best.

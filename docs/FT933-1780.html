			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare hit by property losses CRESTACARE, the nursing home operator that appointed a new chief executive in March and raised Pounds 31.6m through a placing in July, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.39m in the half year to June 30, compared with a profit of Pounds 60,000. However, Mr Andrew Taee, the chief executive, said that operating profits from the nursing home business had risen 39 per cent to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover up 26 per cent at Pounds 10.4m. The interim dividend is raised from 0.1p to 0.25p. The shares fell 5p to 37p. The losses were caused by non-recurring debits of Pounds 2.67m, including Pounds 2.29m of losses, realised or anticipated, on sales of non-core properties. These were valued at Pounds 9.43m in the end 1992 balance sheet. Most have been sold or were under contract for sale, and CrestaCare expected to find buyers for the remaining Pounds 500,000-worth over the next year. The remaining Pounds 380,000 largely related to compensation for Mr John McAllister, the former chief executive, who had been on a three year rolling contract at Pounds 100,000 a year. Mr Brian O'Connor, who resigned as chairman in July, did not receive any compensation. Mr Taee has a three-year, fixed-term contract at Pounds 150,000 a year. By the end of the half-year the group operated 1,625 beds (1,425) in 26 homes, with 20 owned by CrestaCare. With the placing proceeds, it bought eight homes with 515 beds for Pounds 14.1m. These are expected to be re-registered by October 1 making a contribution in the final quarter. After that acquisition net debt was Pounds 5m, for gearing of 8 per cent. Mr Graeme Hart, chairman, said the homes' occupancy rate was more than 92 per cent after a slowing of referrals when the new community care legislation came into force in April. This was lower than the group had planned. He said there was pressure on weekly fee rates and CrestaCare expected 'no overall increase for the next 18 months'. Group turnover was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 15.9m) and interest charges took Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.66m). There was a loss per share of 2p (nil). See People</p>

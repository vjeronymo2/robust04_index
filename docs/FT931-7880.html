			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (3): It's time to be more selective - Christopher Price considers whether exhibitors get good value from their shows HOW effective are exhibitions? The latest industry statistics suggest that as the recession has bitten, companies on both sides of the exhibit stand are becoming more selective. A recent survey by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) found that the amount spent by British companies on trade, technical and consumer exhibitions declined from Pounds 549m to Pounds 539m in 1992, the first fall in the 20 years the survey has been conducted. Examples of the contraction include the oil services industry which has seen the number of exhibitions directed at the sector fall from five to three in the same period. The machine tool business has seen around a third less exhibitions, according to one industry executive, while the ISBA survey suggests expenditure on agricultural shows showed a slide of 32 per cent last year. However, the cutbacks are largely welcomed by exhibition industry watchers. 'In the past, British exhibition organisers have not been particularly forthcoming with detailed information about their event,' says Mr Reg Best, a director of ISBA. 'The result has been disappointment among both exhibitors and delegates and ultimately in sales. Now it is the well- organised and rewarding exhibitions that are surviving and prospering.' Despite the downturn, companies still rate exhibitions as value for money. The ISBA survey found that 82 per cent of its members considered it as a cost-effective promotional medium. This echoes a similar survey by the Exhibition Marketing Group the previous year. This found exhibitions came second only to the trade press when considering a new product launch, with 24 per cent of those surveyed against 38 per cent preferring it, ahead of direct mail (8 per cent), and newspapers and public relations (7 per cent each). But as the most effective medium for quality sales leads, trade exhibitions came first - with 24 per cent - followed by the trade press (23 per cent), sales reps (14 per cent) and direct mail (12 per cent). And as the best medium for corporate image and public relations purposes, exhibitions trailed the trade press by 24 per cent to 28 per cent. Mr Alan Bowers, finance director of Fairline Boats, the listed boat builder, is positive about the value of exhibitions. He says that in an industry where it is difficult to compare homogeneous high-value products, the exhibition situation is a good medium. 'A high proportion of our turnover is geared to our exhibitions, with the London Boat Show still the main draw,' he says. In addition, there are several other shows in the out-of-season period. He estimates that around one-third of the group's marketing budget is invested in exhibitions. While the audience for industries like boat-building can be fairly easily identified, other sectors are not so easily served. New technology industries are rightly recognised by exhibition organisers as growth areas but unfortunately these industries are prone to fail to target their potential buyers. Mr Derek Brown, managing director of Target Automation, an electronics services group, says: 'We have literally dozens of potential exhibitions that would possibly be the right ones for our products, as well as several relevant trade magazines - but only a limited promotional budget.' A former regular exhibitor at around a dozen UK events and two overseas, he now uses just five and has opted to use more direct mail. 'I now know the exhibitions I need to use,' he says. Target's dilemma is echoed by Mr Peter Reed, marketing manager of Forster Engineering, a Yorkshire-based precision tools maker. 'We have grown more selective in our choice of media, and now look very carefully at the exhibitions we go to,' he says. 'The right ones can generate very healthy sales.' But how do companies recognise 'the right ones'? The ISBA says there are hopeful signs. Organisers are providing more detailed information, particularly when pushed, although more still needs to be done. Organisers are reluctant to be too specific over the scope of an exhibition which might restrict attendance. Before attending an exhibition, the association recommends the following procedure: 1. Make sure that the exhibition is independently audited. This will ensure that the information on the previous year's event should be accurate and relevant. 2. Insist on an exhibitor and attendance profile. 3. Make sure the timing and the venue meet requirements. 4. If exhibiting, ensure all staff are properly trained. One of the most common complaints concerns undertrained sales staff. Another industry development over the past two years is that exhibitions no longer go on for so long. The Exhibition Industry Federation estimates that the average length of events has declined from 3.7 to 3.4 days. Exhibitors are also hiring less stand space, so that they are not spending as much. Average expenditure per exhibitor has fallen 15 per cent in real terms over the past two years. Perhaps in line with the economic situation, the more selective approach to events is likely to accelerate before it levels off. Up to 1989, the ISBA survey reported that all companies expected to increase their annual exhibition expenditure. However, last year nearly 20 per cent expected to reduce their outlay. This year a further 10 per cent say they plan cuts. Nearly 80 per cent expect their budgets to remain the same, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVALS;  </P> <P> IN SEARCH OF GEMUTLICHKEIT? JOURNEY TO OLD WORLD OKTOBERFEST  </P> <P> As September flows into October, beer-drinking enthusiasts around the world  dust off their steins, work up a thirst and set their sights toward Germany in  anticipation of Oktoberfest. But for Southern Californians, Munich isn't the  only place to enjoy authentic Oktoberfest festivities.  </P> <P> An annual celebration at Old World Village in Huntington Beach this year begins  Saturday, Sept. 29, and runs through Nov. 4.  </P> <P> The 176-year-old tradition, which began in Munich as a celebration of a royal  wedding, was instituted at Old World Village about 13 years ago by the Bischoff  family, owners of the restaurant complex. "We visited the Oktoberfest in Munich  in 1970 and thought it would be fun and successful in Huntington Beach," said  Dolores Bischoff. "The whole festival is about being together. Old and young  alike can participate and it's a great way to meet strangers in a relaxed  atmosphere."  </P> <P> Old World Village's cobblestone streets and the bucolic murals adorning its  restaurant walls create an appropriate and convivial setting for Oktoberfest  activities. The oom-pah-pah sound of Landshut, Germany's Lustigen Vilstaler  Musikanten band -- making its U.S. debut at this year's festival -- will echo  from Festival Hall, which serves as the focal point for the celebration. The  food will include traditional specialties such as bratwurst, knackwurst,  sauerkraut and apple strudel. There will be beers from around the world,  including two from East Germany and a non-alcoholic option.  </P> <P> And if you're in the mood to engage in the "Chicken Dance," this is your  celebration. "The music really livens you up," said Bischoff, demonstrating the  arm-flapping, foot-stomping dance that is a popular and cherished tradition at  beer halls around the globe. For those more interested in observing, the  Gypsies Folkloric Dance Ensemble will perform a traditional dance show  throughout the festival.  </P> <P> Official opening of this year's Old World Oktoberfest comes on Sunday, Sept.  30, at 2 p.m., when a parade will wind through the Old World streets. The  procession will include the Gypsies Folkloric Dance Ensemble and the Lustigen  Vilstaler Musikanten band, all dressed in traditional costume. The band will  continue to play until 9 p.m. in the Festival Hall.  </P> <P> Participants in Oktoberfest strive to achieve what the Germans call  Gemutlichkeit, a harmony of tolerance, freedom and well-being. Bischoff feels  that some may find it at the Old World Village celebration.  </P> <P> "We don't see people go out with a sad face," she said. "In fact, they usually  dance out."  </P> <P> What: The Old World Oktoberfest.  </P> <P> When: Saturday, Sept. 29, through Nov. 4, daily except Mondays and Tuesdays.  </P> <P> Where: The Old World German Village and Restaurant, 7561 Center Ave.,  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take the San Diego Freeway to Beach Boulevard, South Huntington  Beach exit. Right on Center Avenue.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: Admission to the Festival Hall is $5, free on Wednesdays and  Thursdays. You must be at least 21 to participate in the Friday and Saturday  night festivities.  </P> <P> Where To Call: (714) 897-1470.  </P></p>

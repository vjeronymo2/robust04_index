			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bid for William Hill still under consideration BANKS OWED Pounds 350m by the William Hill betting shop chain, owned by Brent Walker, are still considering a possible Pounds 360m bid from a consortium of institutional investors put together by SG Warburg. Sir Keith Bright, chairman of the troubled property and leisure group since January, is understood to believe William Hill is worth significantly more than Pounds 360m, and that the bid is not in the interests of all creditor banks, owed over Pounds 1.3bn. A sale at that price would require another balance sheet write off for Brent Walker, and further reduce its chances of servicing other debt. However, the William Hill banks have a right to pursue the bid and could see loans repaid in full if it was accepted. The banks looked at an outline bid at an otherwise routine meeting last Friday called to discuss options for the refinancing of William Hill, which must go through by March 1 William Hill's loans are 'ring-fenced' from Brent Walker. The Warburg bid, on behalf of investors Mercury Asset Management, Electra, Morgan Grenfell and Midland Montagu, is far from being finalised. Under the William Hill loan agreement the company is bound to pursue any serious offer made. The banks have the right to vote on such an offer. If a vote goes against a bid, any banks which were in favour of accepting gain a higher security ranking for their loans than those voting against. This would effectively make their loans safe. But a higher sale price - perhaps through a flotation - would generate surplus cash for Brent Walker. There is a conflict since banks which have lent to Brent Walker represent 57 per cent of the loans to William Hill. Therefore, those banks which are in both syndicates could block the bid, but if they did the other William Hill banks' debt would gain security over theirs. Brent Walker's advisers believe a flotation, taking advantage of the current strength of the new issue market, could raise more for William Hill, although suggestions of a Pounds 500m value are regarded as 'optimistic' by some. Another attraction of a flotation would be that Brent Walker could retain a stake in William Hill which would be worth more in future years if its profits recover as expected.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / EC wants Swedish defence pledge SWEDEN should agree to join in an eventual common European defence as the price for entering the EC, the European Commission said yesterday. This was the only seriously contentious issue raised by the Commission in what Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, called a 'perfectly positive' opinion on Swedish membership. A year ago Sweden followed Austria in applying for membership, prompting similar action from Finland and Switzerland, and possibly from Norway this autumn. The EC has said it is ready to start formal accession negotiations with these countries from the European Free Trade Association (Efta), once future Community financing has been agreed and the Maastricht union treaty ratified. The difficulty of ratifying Maastricht, after it was rejected two months ago by Denmark, still places a certain question mark over admission of new EC members. Sweden has convinced the EC that it will accept a common foreign and security policy. But it still has reservations, the Commission noted, on Maastricht's provisions on defence. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, has repeatedly stressed Sweden's desire to conduct its own immediate defence itself. Anxious lest incoming Efta neutrals prevent the Community from developing a common defence one day, President Jacques Delors persuaded his Commission colleagues that Sweden should, during its accession negotiations, be made to give 'specific and binding assurances' that it will accept whatever emerges from Maastricht in this area. The Commission is likely to recommend the same in its opinions on Finland and Switzerland later this year. By contrast, Sweden should find it relative plain sailing to adapt its relatively successful economy to Community requirements, though the Commission signalled likely difficulties for Sweden's farmers who will have to accept lower support prices, and abolition and modification of the country's alcohol monopoly. Mr Andriessen suggested that, once accession talks started, the Community might agree to Sweden's request for formal membership of the European Monetary System. Last year it linked the krona to the Ecu.</p>

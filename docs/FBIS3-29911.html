The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said the  Russian diplomats left between July and December. He said the  spies had been discovered during an investigation by ASIO, the  Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Senator Evans  said the espionage did not constitute a security crisis of any  kind or any significant rupture in relations with Russia.    [Begin Evans recording] The kind of role they might have had  in the past is not one that's appropriate to the new Russia,  after the end of the Cold War. And there has of course been a  very significant downgrading of the Russian espionage  establishment since the end of the Cold War, and I think there's  still a diplomatic purging of that kind of presence in embassies  around the world: Australia's been no exception. But I repeat,  we don't want to make any kind of major issue of this with the  Russian Government, they are very cooperative. Once it was drawn  to their attention as a result of the ASIO investigation that  some inappropriate activities were occurring, then the issue was  responsibly and satisfactorily resolved.

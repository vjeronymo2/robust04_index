			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Coats Viyella raises Tootal offer from Pounds 194m to Pounds 252m COATS VIYELLA, Europe's largest textile group, yesterday fired the latest salvo in its increasingly bitter bid battle for the Tootal textile group by raising its offer from Pounds 194m to Pounds 252m. Tootal, which responded by rejecting the new offer, plans next week to mount new arguments for its defence in which it will criticise what Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, called Coats' 'appalling' commercial record and its 'imprudent' accountancy practices. Coats yesterday also mounted a dawn raid on Tootal's shares. It instructed its brokers - Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Cazenove - to buy up to 65m Tootal shares for 83.05p, just below the new cash and shares offer of 83.3p. Stock market speculation suggested that Coats, which already owned 29.4 per cent of Tootal, managed to buy at least 7m shares during the day. Tootal's shares rose 5p to 84p and Coats' fell 3p to 138p. The new Coats bid offers 23 of its new shares and Pounds 51.02 in cash for every 100 Tootal shares. Tootal's investors will be entitled to receive the net final dividend of 3.05p proposed for the 1990/91 financial year. Coats also offered its cash alternative of 83.05p. Tootal's shareholders are allowed to receive a higher proportion of the offer in Coats' new shares or in loan notes. The battle between Coats and Tootal, two of the largest players in UK textiles with significant interests in the international sewing thread market, began in March when Coats unveiled its Pounds 194m hostile bid. Two years ago Coats and Tootal agreed terms for a merger. But that was put on ice when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission began an investigation into the proposal. Tootal has fought fiercely against the hostile bid arguing that it should remain independent to implement the new strategy developed by Mr Habgood, who was promoted to chief executive earlier this year. A main theme of its defence is that the benefits of merger would be less than Coats has forecast. Tootal claims the combined group would be so large it could lose market share in international thread and UK clothing. Coats has dimissed this criticism. Lex, Page 20</p>

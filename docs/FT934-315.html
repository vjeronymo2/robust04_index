			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Vauxhall suffers 17% profit fall Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, has suffered a fall in pre-tax profits of about 17 per cent this year but has remained the most profitable carmaker in Britain. Pre-tax profit is understood to have fallen to about Pounds 185m in 1993 from Pounds 223.7m a year ago. Its share of the UK car market reached a record of just over 17 per cent in 1993, but production has fallen 19 per cent due to a drop in exports to depressed continental European markets. Ford's share has been eroded to 22 per cent. Vauxhall's two British assembly plants have worked at 82 per cent of capacity this year, and the workforce has been cut by about 8 per cent to 9,900. Vauxhall's operating profits declined more heavily than the pre-tax line, dropping by about a third. Pre-tax performance in 1992 was depressed by a Pounds 28.8m charge for the write-down of a stake in Cilva Holdings, the holding company for Avis Europe, the car rental group. Vauxhall has remained strongly in profit throughout the UK recession in contrast to Ford and Rover, its two biggest rivals, which both fell into loss. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, returned to profit in the second half, however. GM's strong performance in the UK has been reinforced by IBC Vehicles, its 60-40 joint venture with Isuzu of Japan, which produces the Vauxhall/Opel Frontera four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicle. IBC Vehicles has achieved the best financial performance in the six years since it was formed from GM's chronically loss-making Bedford van operations. It has quadrupled net profits to about Pounds 20m and production increased to a record of close to 50,000. GM's performance in the UK contrasts to its fortunes in other European markets. Opel, its German subsidiary, has warned of a full-year loss. Production of cars and car-derived vans at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port and Luton assembly plants has fallen by 19 per cent to 244,500 from the record 301,800 in 1992. Luton was forced to halt production for a total of nearly 13 weeks. Exports dropped 59.3 per cent to 45,398 and accounted for only 19 per cent of output against 37 per cent a year ago. In the UK it increased sales 13.5 per cent to 302,000 in a market that has grown by about 11 per cent.</p>

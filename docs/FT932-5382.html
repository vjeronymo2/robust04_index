			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Serbian move to ban opposition SERBIAN authorities yesterday moved against the country's democratic opposition, seeking a ban on the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Mr Vuk Draskovic. The Belgrade prosecutor asked the constitutional court to ban the SPO, on the grounds that it had 'violently instigated the overthrow of constitutional order'. The request, coming two days after police forcibly broke up an anti-government demonstration, signalled that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, intends to clamp down heavily on the opposition. Earlier in the day Mr Draskovic, the SPO leader, was taken from police headquarters to a Belgrade prison. A party spokesman said that lawyers had been unable to contact Mr Draskovic, who was badly beaten after being arrested on Wednesday. His wife, Danitsa, was also detained. However, 20 other members of his Serbian Renewal Movement, also arrested when police broke into the party's headquarters, were released. Mr Draskovic was leading a demonstration protesting at the dismissal of Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president, in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Mr Cosic broke his silence after the demonstration, accusing President Milosevic, his former political ally, of 'tyrannical behaviour.' He said Mr Milosevic had distorted an account of a routine meeting with the army leadership. Mr Cosic was accused in parliament by members of Mr Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Party of planning to overthrow the government.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO HOSTS U.N. DAY FESTIVITIES  </P> <P> During a celebration of the United Nations' 45th anniversary, Mission Viejo  Mayor Christian W. Keena said Sunday that protection of the environment is a  matter of worldwide, and thus U.N., concern.  </P> <P> "I think the United Nations is really in focus now, especially with the Persian  Gulf situation," Keena said. "The Persian Gulf situation has shown that nations  can come together in matters of common concern, and I think a matter of common  concern in the world now is the environment.  </P> <P> "The water and the air we depend on know no boundaries. And we're all trustees  of this planet. We all have the same duties. Be it the United States, be it  Brazil, be it Japan -- we all have the same duties to preserve this planet, not  only for the generation that is here, but for future generations."  </P> <P> Keena spoke at ceremonies at Mount of Olives Lutheran Church in Mission Viejo.  United Nations Day celebrations also were held Sunday in Laguna Beach and  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> U.N. Day in Mission Viejo focused on the topic "Saving the Environment." During  a press conference, Keena and Jerry Yudelson, a director of the statewide Clean  Air Coalition, predicted that protecting the world from environmental ruin will  become an increasing concern of the United Nations.  </P> <P> At the press conference, Yudelson, of Garden Grove, also said he would be  urging the audience to support Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green"  environmental initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> "I'm pushing very strongly for this measure to pass because it addresses so  many of the global environmental issues, particularly the greenhouse effect and  preserving the oceans," Yudelson said. "It's always about a generation between  the time a problem is first identified and the time that effective action takes  place."  </P> <P> Students from Mission Viejo High School presented a mock U.N. session during  Sunday's program. The discussion topic was environmental concern, and the  students represented various countries, giving speeches about those nations'  points of view.  </P> <P> The first speaker, Joe Farrell, a junior, represented Ethiopia. "Think about  your children's children," he said. "Let's give them a world to live in."  </P> <P> Frans Edward Nelson, president of the Coastline chapter of the U.N. Assn., said  the U.N. Day celebration bridges all age groups. "This is a unique event in  which youth and adults are brought together to discuss issues and take action,"  he said. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

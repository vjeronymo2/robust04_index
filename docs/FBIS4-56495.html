			<p>BFN     [Text] Any solution to the crisis lies in the  implementation of Article 149, according to statements by  Professor Hubert de Ronceray who rose up again on 3 May against  the latest statement of the White House, which does not even  rule out a military intervention in Haiti. De Ronceray thinks  if Article 149 is implemented, all conflicts and all threats  will end.    [Begin De Ronceray recording, in French] As long as the  United States of America and the international community refuse  to understand that the true enemies of democracy are illiteracy,  hunger, unemployment, the lack of road and energy  infrastructures, they will have no other alternative than the  physical destruction of the Haitian people. As for those who  deny us the right to resort to Article 149 of our fundamental  charter to solve an internal political problem which is a matter  of concern within our sovereign competence, we want to ask them:  Since when have the Governors Island agreement and the New York  pact taken the place of the 1987 Constitution? Facing this  watershed, heavy with ordeals and humiliation for the black  Haitian nation, the Mobilization for National Development [MDN]  calls on all genuine sons and daughters of our country to keep  cool and to serenely resist the new challenges of the  international giants. [end recording]    This was a statement by Prof. Hubert De Ronceray, leader of  MDN.</p>

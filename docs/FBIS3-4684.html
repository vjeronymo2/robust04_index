			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "High Hopes Pinned on Visit by Defense </F> Facilities Administration Agency Director General To the United  States"]    [Text] Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the Defense  Facilities Administration Agency, an official charged with  handling problems involving U.S. military bases in Japan, left  Japan on 26 February for the United States to discuss with  American officials the issue of streamlining and scaling down  U.S. military bases on Okinawa. Mr. Yoneyama is due to meet  with high-ranking U.S. Government officials in charge of  overseas American military bases and leaders of the U.S.  military. So far, working-level officials have visited  Washington to discuss the issue with their American  counterparts, but this is the first time that a top Japanese  Government official in charge of handling the issue of  streamlining and scaling down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa  visits the United States to discuss the issue with American  officials.    Everyone acknowledges that the key stumbling block impeding  Okinawa's development is the existence of huge U.S. military  bases on the island. Nobody can argue against the  acknowledgement. The Okinawan people have thus far persistently  pleaded for the streamlining and scaling down of the huge U.S.  military bases on Okinawa. In response to this plea, however,  the Japanese Government has not tried to work aggressively to  resolve the issue. Although 22 years have passed since  Okinawa's reversion to the Japanese rule, the return of Naha  military port, which has been agreed upon between Japan and the  United States, has yet to be materialized and the huge U.S.  military bases still remain as they have been on Okinawa.    Upon Leaving Japan for Washington, Director General Yoneyama  indicated that three issues -- the return of Naha military port  and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and a halt to live-firing  exercise by U.S. forces across National Highway No. 14 -- will  be important objectives of his visit to the United States. Now  that the director general specifically mentioned his intention  to discuss those issues with American officials, we believe that  he left Japan for Washington with a firm resolve. We hope that  the visit by Director General Yoneyama to Washington will make a  major headway in resolving the issue of streamlining and scaling  down the U.S. military bases on Okinawa.    On 25 February when Director General Yoneyama held a news  conference prior to his visit to the Untied States, a "liaison  meeting on various problems at the U.S. facilities and their  areas on Okinawa" (the liaison meeting attended by officials  from the Okinawa Development Agency, the Foreign Ministry, and  the Defense Facilities Administration Agency) was held.    During the meeting, Okinawa Development Agency Director  General Uehara strongly asked that the liaison meeting not only  exchange views on the three issues -- the return of Naha  military port and Yomitan auxiliary airfield and halt to the  live-firing exercises by U.S. forces across National Highway No.  14 -- but discuss specific ways to resolve them.    The discussion of working-level officials alone cannot  fundamentally resolve the issue of U.S. military bases on  Okinawa. If government officials say they will "study," this  means that they will do nothing. The discussion of working-level  officials cannot resolve the issue fundamentally, but "they can  only discuss how to build soundproof walls." The discussion of  working-level officials will leave the issue of U.S. military  bases on Okinawa unresolved forever.    Now that 50 years have passed since the end of World War II,  the Japanese Government has perhaps begun to think seriously of  ways to resolve the issue. Some are asserting that Japan should  make international contributions while others are saying it is  an economic power. They, however, cannot say so in a situation  where more than 1 million of their compatriots have been  hindered by huge foreign military bases to develop their economy  and society and have suffered great inconvenience in their daily  lives.    Fifty years have passed since the end of World War II. The  time has come to resolve fundamentally the issue of U.S.  military bases on Okinawa.</p>

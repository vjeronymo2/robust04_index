			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trade and service mark options Sir, Although I was pleased to read Robert Rice's report on November 19 ('Registration to be simplified', November 19) to the effect that the long-awaited Trade Marks Bill is to be introduced in the current parliamentary session, I should like to draw your attention to two slight errors. First, I am afraid that the Queen's Speech was too late to influence the choice of location for the European Trade Marks Office, which (it was decided at the EU summit at the end of October) is to be located in Spain. London has accordingly missed the boat. Second, the proposed ratification of the Madrid protocol for the registration of international trade marks through the medium of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is independent of the EU Directive of December 1988, which merely instructs member states to harmonise their local trade mark laws. By 1995, companies will have the option of applying for three alternative forms of trade or service mark: a. In the UK, under the new Trade Marks Act. b. Internationally, through the medium of WIPO in Geneva. c. In Europe, through the medium of the Community Trade Mark Office in Alicante. Robert A Hurst, D J Freeman, solicitors, 43 Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1NA</p>

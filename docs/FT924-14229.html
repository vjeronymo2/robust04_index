			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: The Braden way to heaven - Patrick Harverson learns new tricks from a US ski guru YOU ARE cold, frustrated and angry. Anyone who has taken ski lessons in Europe will know the feeling. Cold, because you have been standing around on the mountain watching other people fall over. Frustrated, because the instructor keeps shouting 'bend zee knees' and you are still not getting any better, either at bending zee knees or at skiing. Angry, because you have paid good money for an archaic Alpine form of public humiliation. Instead of locking you into unusually-shaped pieces of wood and throwing snow at you, they lock you into unusually-shaped pieces of wood and throw you at the snow. In America, thankfully, they do it differently. Take the Vic Braden Ski College in Aspen, Colorado, where they take the 'school' part of 'ski school' seriously. When I signed up for the five-day skiing course I received an introductory video, a recommended reading list, assigned exercises, and warnings about what to wear and how to avoid altitude sickness. I watched the video, read the book list (but none of the books), skipped the exercises (more fool me) but packed the longjohns and extra sweater. The brains behind the Vic Braden Ski College, not surprisingly, belong to Vic Braden. A licensed psychologist and US tennis coach, Braden is known for his offbeat approach to sports teaching and the college is a response to what he found when he tried to learn skiing: that the quality of teaching varies widely, and that skiers rarely receive the attention they deserve from instructors. On our arrival Braden was not there to welcome us in person, but he did appear on video to provide cheery encouragement at the orientation meeting, which opened like a group therapy session - 20 people seated in a semi-circle, nervously providing a brief resume of their skiing experience and hopes for the week. The first day at any school is tough, but a few in the group were alumni and offered some words of comfort. George from Connecticut attended the college a year ago: 'Last time I got my legs and arms. I'm back to find the rest of my body.' Fear was our common denominator. Fear of difficult blue runs, steep black runs, moguls, ice. Some were scared of going too fast, others of going too slow. Fear reached other areas, too. Should longjohns go inside, or outside, socks? There to answer these questions, and ask some of their own, were John, Muriel, Owen, Chris and Mary, the college's coaches. Their questions were tougher than ours. How do balance movements relate to skiing? How do you edge the ski? What happens to skis when you turn? This is where the school part came into its own. The coaches conducted part of each lesson in the classroom. Using flip sheets, videos and various platforms and devices to simulate skiing, they explained the physical relationship between hips, knees, ankles, feet, boots, skis and snow. Making sense of it all on the slopes was another matter. The challenge was to blend skills that on their own appear simple, but when applied together can produce mental and physical overload. After the theory, it was time for the practical. We headed for the well-groomed slopes of Tiehack/Buttermilk mountain, which sits wedged between Ajax, Aspen Highlands and Snowmass in the four-mountain ski area of Aspen. The group had been divided according to ability, and the coach assigned to our class of five was Muriel Frei, a delightful Swiss instructor. Muriel trained in Switzerland as a physical education teacher and brought something of the schoolmistress to her ski classes, asking questions which quickly made us realise that we had no idea what were doing - right or wrong - when we skied. Under Muriel's persistent probing, our control and technique improved. Each day ended with discussion of the skills we had worked on and an opportunity to watch ourselves on video, a sometimes painful experience that yielded at least one important lesson: I needed a new ski suit. The coaches also introduced some innovative concepts, such as 'centering', a technique borrowed from the martial art, aikido. Centering involves discovering your 'one-point' - the physical centre of your body. In most cases, this is somewhere near the belly button. By focusing our minds on the spot while we skied, we would have better control over our balance. That was the theory, and although it was easy to find your one-point in the classroom, it was trickier to think of your belly button while bouncing down a mogul field. There were also breathing exercises (it is astonishing how many people hold their breath when skiing difficult slopes). Each coach had their own style; moguls were a case in point. One coach taught his nervous charges to think of the moguls as 'turn enhancers'. Another recommended growling at them on the way down, while Muriel took a more conciliatory approach, suggesting we treat the moguls as 'our friends'. The week passed quickly and by Thursday most of us were showing signs of real improvement. George from Connecticut had finally found his body, although we were not sure if he knew where his head was. On the penultimate day Vic Braden arrived to give us a pep talk. This is a man who knows his pep, and he delivered a boisterous account of his teaching philosophy, which can be distilled in a single slogan: 'Laugh and learn.' Braden finished with a favourite quote from Charlie Chaplin: 'A day without laughter is a day wasted.' After a week spent learning to dance with the mountain, love my belly button and make friends with a mogul, not a day went to waste. Patrick Harverson flew to Colorado with Continental Airlines and stayed at the Inn at Aspen in Buttermilk (tel: 303 925 1500). The fee for a five-day course at the Vic Braden Ski College is Dollars 695 (Pounds 390) which includes lift tickets. For information ring: 303 920 0784.</p>

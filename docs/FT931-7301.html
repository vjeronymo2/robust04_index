			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / BBC 'could sell channel' to cut licence fee ONE OF the BBC's two national television channels could be sold to reduce the burden of the licence fee, a London conference was told yesterday. Mr Adam Singer, vice-president (international) for Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator, said the released channel could be used to start a UK version of Canal Plus, the French sports and subscription film channel which is broadcast over conventional transmitters. Mr Singer, whose father Mr Aubrey Singer is a former managing director of BBC Television, said such an auction was just one example of radical options for the future of the corporation. Speaking at the FT Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Conference, he said: 'There has been a singular absence of radical thinking and questioning of not just the BBC's function and purpose, but the justifiable scope of its activities.' Mr Singer said the technical forces facing the BBC, particularly new channels, would make it redundant in its present form. His Denver-based company TCI plans to introduce more than 400 channels of television in its cable systems over the next three years, using digital technology. In the UK 6.5m homes are expected to have access to multi-channel television by the year 2000 - about a third of the total. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable and satellite at the Independent Television Commission, yesterday released the latest cable television statistics, covering up to the start of this year. They show that modern cable systems have 440,162 subscribers, an increase of 65 per cent during the year. From July to December there was an average net increase of 18,000 cable subscribers every month. Mr Davey said he believed there were a number of big new cable deals in the pipeline. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television, said he would be making an announcement soon about bringing a new satellite channel to the UK using the Astra satellite. It would be one of a growing number of satellite channels. None of them on their own would threaten the dominance of ITV. 'But there comes a point at which all of them, taken together, achieve a critical mass of penetration, of viewers' time, and of advertising revenue, so that their economic base is large enough for them to have real buying power,' Mr Dunn said. He predicted that critical mass would be reached this year or next.</p>

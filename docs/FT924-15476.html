			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods' shares suspended CLARKE FOODS, the UK's second largest ice-cream maker and owner of Lyons Maid, is facing a severe cash crisis which yesterday resulted in the suspension of its USM-quoted shares at 8p. The company is seeking an urgent capital injection which would buy time for the arrangement of a rights issue or some other form of equity finance. The shares have fallen rapidly from their peak of 163p just four months ago, as Clarke encountered problems with the installation of equipment. As a result, the company missed the two hottest months of the summer and achieved only 25 per cent of planned ice-cream sales. A Pounds 4m advertising campaign was virtually wasted as many consumers were unable to find the product in shops. Last month Clarke recalled the interim dividend and announced it was in discussions with National Westminster about an overdraft facility. However, NatWest has demanded proof of a capital injection before agreeing to provide short-term working capital. The company is believed to be in talks with Hillsdown Holdings, which holds more than 20 per cent of Clarke, about a possible solution. Any injection is likely to result in changes to the board, of which Mr Henry Clarke, the inspiration and driving force behind Clarke Foods, is chairman. The Clarke family holding is also likely to be diluted from its current 25 per cent. Mr Clarke's ice-cream pedigree goes back several years, to his promotion of the Klondike bar, America's best selling novelty ice-cream, in the 1970s. He has also had a volatile history, having been ousted from two separate companies. Mr Clarke came out of a brief retirement to enter the UK ice-cream market through the USM-quoted investment vehicle, Yelverton Investments, which was transformed into Clarke Foods. The company owns the Fiesta, Horton and Lewis brands, purchased from Hillsdown Holdings in 1991, and Lyons Maid, bought in January from Allied-Lyons.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Price Waterhouse appointed linchpin at core of government's North America Now campaign PRICE WATERHOUSE, the accountancy and management consultancy group, has been appointed the linchpin in the 'strategic alliances' initiative at the core of the government's North America Now campaign. Its task will be to work with about 50 medium-sized UK companies a year with the aim of introducing them to up to three prospective US partners. The objective over the three-year campaign will be to forge 10 to 15 successful partnerships each year, generating earnings towards the UK balance of payments amounting to Pounds 30m. 'These companies will not be beginners,' said Mr Ian Guthrie, partner at Price Waterhouse responsible for the project. 'They should have between 100 and 500 staff, a turnover of Pounds 10m-Pounds 50m, and a good foothold in the US market already. They will be companies that have put serious time into export promotion as part of a clear business plan. 'The main challenge is to try to bring to the middle-sized company the type of services that would normally be available only to larger companies. Without these rigorous support services, company initiatives often fade out because smaller firms lack the internal dynamic to bring them through.' Price Waterhouse has 46 professionals based in the US, with offices in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago providing platforms from which to begin the search for partners.</p>

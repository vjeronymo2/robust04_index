			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Battle lines emerge on derivatives law Debate is intensifying over a US government study of derivatives trading that could play a central role in congressional deliberations on whether to impose tighter regulations on the sector. The study by the General Accounting Office, the government audit agency, warned of gaps in the regulatory framework that threatened severe damage to the financial system, and recommended new legislation to bring federal oversight to unregulated subsidiaries of securities firms and insurance companies dealing in derivatives. These are sometimes complex financial instruments whose yields are tied to other securities or indices. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a grouping of big dealers, attacked the GAO report as 'good facts' but 'bad conclusions'. 'Anecdote, conjecture and surmise are not sufficient bases for imposing restrictions on an essential risk management tool,' ISDA said last week. The GAO has issued an unusual rebuttal of the ISDA document, challenging its criticisms and insisting its own recommendations, issued last month, would neither increase costs nor reduce the availability of derivatives. Mr James Blothwell, GAO's director of financial institutions and market issues, challenged ISDA's view that derivatives raise little risk of 'domino' failures through the linkages they create between separate financial markets. 'The potential for derivatives linkages to hasten the spread and expand the scope of problems during any financial system crises is a sound reason for federal oversight of derivatives,' Mr Blothwell said in testimony to a House of Representatives subcommittee. Congressman Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been one of the loudest voices calling for more regulation, has asked the GAO to expand its original survey by studying dealers' sales practices, to make sure they are selling only to customers able to understand the product's complexity. Some express scepticism at the prospect of riding to the rescue of banks, multinational corporations and international fund managers, who are the largest customers, but concern remains over whether derivatives are being sold to relatively unsophisticated local government treasurers. Senior congressional leaders do not share Mr Markey's haste, and have decided not to push for derivatives legislation this year. The Clinton administration continues to argue there is no immediate need to change the law. 'The Treasury has not concluded that other legislation concerning over-the-counter derivatives is necessary or appropriate at this time,' said Ms Darcy Bradbury, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance at the Treasury.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. JOINS HUGHES WHISTLE-BLOWER SUIT  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Justice joined a whistle-blower lawsuit against Hughes  Aircraft Co. on Thursday, alleging that the company overcharged the government  by $5 million during the early 1980s by switching charges among contracts for  radar systems.  </P> <P> The suit, brought under the federal False Claims Act, was originally filed in  May, 1989, by John N. Perron Jr., who continues to work at Hughes' radar  systems group in El Segundo, said Perron's attorney, Dean Francis Pace.  </P> <P> A Hughes spokesman denied the allegations and said the case was unwarranted. It  is the first time the Justice Department has entered a whistle-blower case  against Hughes. Of three prior False Claims suits against Hughes, one has been  dropped, one is expected to be dropped and the third is continuing without  Justice Department participation, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Perron alleges in his suit that from 1981 through 1985, the firm's  environmental test laboratory in El Segundo falsified employee time records and  concealed a fraudulent charging scheme in which costs that should have been  billed to a fixed-price contract were instead billed to a cost-plus contract.  By that means, the government was forced to bear the excess costs, the suit  alleges.  </P> <P> The fixed price contracts were for the F-14, F-15 and F-18 radar systems. The  cost-plus contract was for the Roland missile system.  </P> <P> The suit claims that the company destroyed time cards prepared by employees,  altered other time cards and demanded employees sign blank time cards that were  later used to make false entries.  </P> <P> In a second allegation, Perron said the company continued to submit charges for  the four programs at a time in 1986 when the Air Force had refused to accept  deliveries of missiles from Hughes and there was a suspension of production.  </P></p>

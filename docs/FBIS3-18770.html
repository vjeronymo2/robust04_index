The debate revealed that  Finland may be first among the Nordic countries to hold its own  EU referendum, reports Kimmo Henriksson from the conference:    [Henriksson] Representing the Swedish Government, Social  Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg of the Liberal Party was most  vociferous here in Stockholm in questioning the possibility of  organizing Sweden's EU referendum as early as June. Westerberg  thought the referendum would be postponed until November, after  the Swedish elections. The Swedish Social Democrats have  similar ideas. They fear that their supporters will, under a  Conservative government, vote no simply to oppose Prime Minister  Carl Bildt's policy. Bildt, himself, did not want to comment on  the matter, but he, too, has suggested a summer or autumn  referendum and may well have to give in to the latter.    The Swedish decision would naturally mean that Finland would  have to hold its referendum as the first of the Nordic countries  because Norway, if it reaches a negotiation result, is of course  in no hurry. The order [in holding referendums] would then be  the same as the EU recommended to the applicant countries. In  Finland support for EU membership is clearly more extensive than  in Sweden and Norway, so the example may be significant.    Opponents of EU membership have also let their voices be  heard in Stockholm. Speeches by the opponents above all have  expressed fear that Sweden's and Finland's policy of neutrality  will disappear with EU membership. [Prime Minister] Esko Aho of  Finland had to explain Finland's nonalignment to (?Joerleis  Borgottansen) of the Icelandic left-wing party, who pointed out  that only a few years ago Finland announced to the Nordic  Council that its neutrality would be preserved. Lars Werner of  the Swedish Party of the Left, for his part, wanted to discuss  the possibility of Nordic security cooperation, even including  military cooperation, as a counterbalance to EU membership. The  proposal failed, of course, to please the Swedish Government.  Carl Bildt had to walk to the rostrum several times to say that  times had changed and consequently neutrality concepts also had  changed. This is Kimmo Henriksson in Stockholm.</p>

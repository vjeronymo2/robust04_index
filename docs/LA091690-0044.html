MEL 27046  (two compact discs).  </P> <P>  The reissue of the classic De los Angeles "Manon" on CD, lovingly conducted by  Monteux, is especially welcome. In 1955 the soprano's voice was in its  refulgent prime, warm and voluptuous in its middle and lower ranges, secure  enough at the top to manage a D-flat with little effort. The haunting color  changes she was able to ring in such set pieces as "Voyons, Manon" and "Adieu,  notre petite table," remind us how much the Met lost when she left in 1961. Her  French, though gently accented, coexists comfortably with that of her genuinely  Gallic colleagues. Legay is an elegant if somewhat wispy Des Grieux, Dens a  stylish Lescaut and Borthayre a sumptuous Comte. The ensemble work coaxed from  all participants by Monteux, then 89, is exemplary. A dividend on the final CD  is Chausson's "Poeme de l'Amour et de la Mer," luxuriantly recorded by De los  Angeles in 1969.  </P> <P> A striking contrast and worthy curio is the 1969 broadcast from Scala in  Italian. It may not be exactly Massenet's masterpiece, but it shows strong  evidence of two of the loveliest lyric voices around at the time, Freni and  Pavarotti, before they began taking on heavier parts, losing some of their  freshness and flexibility in the process. Both were singers of gratifying  sensitivity, especially Freni in "Addio, o nostro picciol desco" and Pavarotti  in the Dream Aria, but they pull out all the Italianate stops in a thrilling  Saint-Sulpice duet. The Cours-la-Reine is cut, but Manon's Gavotte is inserted  in the gambling scene.  </P> <P> Panerai is a smooth, cynical Lescaut. Maag often can't resist Pucciniesque  climaxes, but otherwise gives excellent support. Walter Price  </P></p>

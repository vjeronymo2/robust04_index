			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higher death rate helps Plantsbrook advance 33% A significant rise in the fourth-quarter death rate helped to boost 1993 pre-tax profits by almost 33 per cent at Plantsbrook Group, the funeral services group. They rose from Pounds 9.05m to a record Pounds 12m. Total turnover rose from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 52m, including a contribution of Pounds 800,000 from acquisitions. Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, said the overall rise of 4 per cent in the death rate for 1993 was to some extent owing to flu towards the end of the year. He expected the rate to fall back this year. The result was also helped by a reduction in net interest payable from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 586,000. This reflected lower rates; the repayment of Pounds 3.3m of fixed rate hire purchase debt; a reduction in total borrowings from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 7m; and the benefit of a Pounds 2m private placing of 2.99m ordinary shares last June. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose from 7.03p to 7.77p. In addition to the June placing, 25.9m shares were issued in October and November following the conversion of the unlisted 1997 preference shares. There are now 106.5m ordinary shares in issue. The group made five acquisitions in the year, paying Pounds 2.4m, and has opened seven new branches. So far this year it has acquired two more businesses for Pounds 4.2m cash. Further acquisitions were likely, said Mr Hindley. The group was also looking at ways of returning to the crematorium market. Dignity, the pre-paid funeral business had performed satisfactorily, said Mr Hindley, generating Pounds 1.5m of turnover. An autumn advertising campaign had resulted in a 42 per cent increase in sales in the second half. Gearing at the end of the year was 28 per cent, compared with 54 per cent in 1992. A final dividend of 2.3p (2p) is proposed, giving a total of 3.4p for the year (3p). COMMENT While the unexpected rise in last year's mortality rate provided a boost to profits, the achievements of the present management in restoring Plantsbrook to a strongly cash generative business should not be overlooked. However, profits this year are likely to remain static unless the death rate rises again. The group's 9 per cent market share of funerals looks mature. It is way behind market leader Great Southern in the pre-paid funeral business. Tough new environmental legislation on crematoriums could lead to local authority privatisation or operating contracts, but it would be expensive to build new ones. At yesterday's close of 109p and a prospective p/e of 13.5p the shares look a hold - but keep an eye on the deaths column.</p>

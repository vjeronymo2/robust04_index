			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Scots aim to boost enterprise SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body for Scotland, yesterday launched a strategy aimed at improving the poor rate at which Scotland generates new businesses. The initiative, which follows research into the causes of Scotland's low business birth rate, is designed to bring Scotland's rate of new company formation up to the UK average by the end of the decade. That would mean creating 25,000 businesses. Scottish Enterprise will redirect its own activities to focus more closely on new business generation. The initiative, in which banks, finance houses and other organisations are already involved, is the brainchild of Mr Crawford Beveridge, Scottish Enterprise's chief executive. He has been perplexed by the lack of dynamism of Scots in their home country compared with those abroad, since returning to Scotland from Sun Microsystems in the US. Between 1978 and 1990, Scotland created 77 companies employing more than 50 people per 1m of population, compared with 86 in the west Midlands and 116 in the south-east of England. Mr Beveridge said yesterday that the three main reasons for the low Scottish business birth rate were: difficulties in getting access to finance, with would-be entrepreneurs and financiers often 'not speaking the same language'; a lack of networking with people unwilling to discuss their ideas; and would-be entrepreneurs being afraid both of failing and of syucceeding. The strategy involves the setting up of business forums in which people will present their business projects to a panel of entrepreneurs, financiers and business advisers. Scottish Enterprise and its local enterprise companies are also encouraging the creation of private-sector-led seed capital funds to invest in pre-start and start-up projects. It will try to persuade Scottish schools to make the idea of business more acceptable to their pupils, and to ask the Scottish media to consider ways of portraying business in a more attractive light.</p>

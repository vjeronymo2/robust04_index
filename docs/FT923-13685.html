			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Iraq starts oil pipeline IRAQ is pursuing plans for a pipeline through Jordan to export crude oil from the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea once it returns fully to the oil market, according to a report to be published on Monday in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW), the leading oil industry newsletter, Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent, writes. The report says talks between Iraq and Jordan were concluded in the spring and that the Iraq State Company for Oil Projects began digging on its side of the border a month ago. The pipeline, with 1m b/d capacity, would stretch 900km from Iraq's pump station at Haditha.</p>

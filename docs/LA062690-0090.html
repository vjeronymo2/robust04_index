			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 7,000 PENGUINS DIE IN MYSTERY STAMPEDE  </P> <P> More than 7,000 King penguins, most of them chicks, were crushed to death on a  remote Tasmanian island south of Australia in an apparent mass panic, wildlife  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The officials said they are still unsure about the cause of the incident, which  occurred about two weeks ago on Macquarie Island, a 67-square-mile nature  reserve. The dead birds were piled up four deep when found a few days ago by  wildlife officials, who likened the stampede to a crowd at a sports stadium.  </P></p>

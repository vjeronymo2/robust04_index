			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Spain to discuss Seat aid with VW: Madrid unwilling to help if it means distorting competition The Spanish government faces tough new talks this week with the management of Volkswagen over the scope of state aid for the German group's loss-making Seat subsidiary. The Industry Ministry said it was prepared to provide investment backing but not to make a special case of Seat by subsidising restructuring costs in a way that would distort competition in the car market. VW is seeking aid of DM820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish central and regional authorities to cover compensation for early retirement by 4,600 Seat workers, reducing the workforce to about 9,500. The issue is expected to surface in a two-day meeting starting today in Schwerin between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister. Promises of assistance for Seat provoked sharp reactions last week from other multinational motor groups which manufacture in Spain, including Ford and General Motors. 'You cannot help one without helping all,' said Mr Arnaud de David-Beauregard, managing director of Citroen Hispania, part of the French PSA group. Mr Juan Antonio Moral, chairman of the Renault subsidiary FASA-Renault, said aid for job reductions at Seat was 'not acceptable'. However, Mr Juan Llorens, Seat chairman, said the company was not comparable to others since it had its own models and technical centre. The ministry said it was prepared to support new investments at Seat based on the same criteria as other motor companies. The cutting of 9,000 jobs at Seat announced last year would already result in a cost to the Spanish taxpayer of Pta30bn (Pounds 146m), it said. This was in addition to an estimated Pta400bn spent on restructuring the formerly state-controlled company in readiness for sale to VW in a phased operation that began in 1986.</p>

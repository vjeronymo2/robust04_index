			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURROGATE CASE DRAWS FIRE FROM THOSE SICK AT HEART, SICK OF SUITS  </P> <P> I am sick at heart for Anna Johnson, and outraged by the decision handed down  by Judge Parslow. Crispina Calvert's claim to the baby is no stronger than the  traditional paternity suit made by a man not living with the birth mother of a  child.  </P> <P> If he could prove he had a genetic link to the child, he would be entitled to  visitation rights. Physical custody of the infant would be granted to the birth  mother.  </P> <P> Judge Parslow clearly considered the case on a purely intellectual basis. We  are talking about a baby here, not the sale of some commodity! He obviously has  no understanding of the physical and emotional bonds that develop between a  mother and her baby during pregnancy. To be physically one with another human  being for nine months, to feed and care for it and, finally, to go through the  birth experience with it creates an attachment unlike anything he has ever  experienced.  </P> <P> Having your heart ripped out would be the closest thing I can think of to what  it would feel like to lose a child at this point. The Calverts have an  intellectual interest in the baby; Anna has the physical and emotional bond of  a mother.  </P> <P> Why would Judge Parslow have concluded that the contribution of an egg in this  case is any greater than the male's contribution of sperm, which has  historically entitled the father to visitation rights, not physical custody of  the infant!  </P> <P> SUSAN LIECHTY, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

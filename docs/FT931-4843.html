			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Accor close to Hungarian hotel chain deal ACCOR, the French hotel group, has entered the final stage of talks with Hungary's privatisation authorities for the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Pannonia, the country's main mid-market hotel chain. Accor's bid, which topped an offer by a private group of investors, is understood to value Pannonia at well in excess of Ft8.9bn (Dollars 103m), the company's last reported book value. Precise terms were not disclosed and the finalisation of a formal agreement remains subject to achieving financing arrangements. Pannonia has interests in 27 hotels, including the Budapest Novotel, which the Hungarian company owned and managed under franchise from Accor's Novotel unit. Accor is also looking to Pannonia to be its vehicle for future expansion in neighbouring countries. The French group, Europe's largest hotel group, has been among the most active in the region, managing or investing in 13 hotels in Poland, Russia, Bulgaria and Hungary. Accor is also involved in hotel developments in Romania and the Czech Republic and has set itself a target of 50 hotels in the region. The privatisation authorities plan to float the state's remaining shareholding in the chain. The attractions of eastern Europe for Accor and other investors in the hotel sector have been low labour costs, consequently high margins and the large potential for growth. Financing has, however, been a problem because the hotel market is depressed internationally and investors are wary of political and economic risks, and uncertainty over title to property in eastern Europe. Legal problems held back financing of the acquisition by Marriott, the US hotel operator, of Budapest's Duna Intercontinental hotel. Marriott, backed by a financial consortium led by GiroCredit of Austria, last week finally agreed to pay Dollars 53m for the state-owned hotel after breaking numerous payment deadlines. Advisers to the Hungarian government were confident yesterday that there would be relatively healthy institutional appetite for Pannonia and that financing would be possible.</p>

Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said the Indian people  support the proposal for reunifying the country by confederacy  formula without the interference of outside forces which was put  forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the  struggle of the Korean people to achieve a peaceful  reunification of the country.    The Indian people, he noted, pay deep attention to the great  achievements made by the Korean people in all domains of social  life including the economy, and to the development of the  situation on the Korean peninsula.    Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, prime minister of the government of the  Republic of Mali, expressed support and solidarity for the  Korean people in their struggle to realize the proposal for  reunification by confederacy formula reiterated by respected  President Kim Il-song in his New Year address, saying it is the  only just proposal conforming to the reality of Korea.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved  only through DPRK-U.S. negotiations, he noted.    The general secretary of the Independent Liberal Party of  Nicaragua, Virgilio Godoy, fully supported the policy for  reunifying the country in the form of confederation on the three  principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great  national unity, stating it is a most realistic and fair policy.</p>

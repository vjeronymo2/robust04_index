			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fall in autumn sales hits Tay PROFITS BEFORE tax at Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, fell 43 per cent to Pounds 1.03m in the half year to December 31 1992 following a slump in autumn sales. A rise in unit sales from 357 to 409 early in the period pushed turnover up 7 per cent, from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 27.2m. However, Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said demand collapsed in the period covering October to December to as low as an average of 10 unit sales a week. January sales picked up to average levels of 38 per week, before faltering around the beginning of March. However, figures had again picked up in the past week. A brighter outlook for the rest of the year, fuelled by low interest rates and stabilising house prices, was undermined by continued narrow margins as housebuilders maintained discount schemes to entice buyers. The company, which in January issued a profits warning for the full year to June 30 1993, said it did not anticipate a significant improvement in conditions until its 1993-94 trading year. Analysts' original profits forecasts of up to Pounds 6m pre-tax in the current year have since been downgraded to about Pounds 3.5m. The company said it had 4,000 plots in hand at an overall cost per plot of about 15 per cent of present selling prices. It said this should allow it to increase volumes and margins whenever an upturn came. Earnings per share were down from 5.5p to 3.04p. The interim dividend is held at 1.2p.</p>

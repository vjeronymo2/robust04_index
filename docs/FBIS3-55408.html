This is the first meeting the  head of the Russian cabinet has had with such a representative  group of journalists since he became prime minister a year ago.    The meeting may untie the complex knot of problems which has  risen since the government's 25 November decision to reassess  the basic assets of national economy enterprises. Media chiefs  believe that the increase in the value of the basic assets of  printing enterprises will lead to a six-fold increase in the  cost of typographical services. The critical situation which  has emerged has thus far all but led, like all journalists'  protests, to a suspension of the publication of a number of  publications from 10 January.    Opening the meeting, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that the  Russian Government is looking closely at the journalists'  problems, but he expressed the opinion that the journalists, who  from the outset have favored market reform, have today become  fully integrated into market conditions.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / PepsiCo in Cadbury Schweppes drink deal SALES OF Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks in eastern Europe are set to rise sharply as a result of a franchise deal with PepsiCo of the US, which may lead to further co-operation between the two companies in the region. The deal is the first between the two companies since the mid-1980s, when Cadbury Schweppes abruptly ended a bottling agreement with Pepsi in the UK and placed all its British soft drinks businesses in a joint venture with Coca-Cola, Pepsi's arch-rival. Pepsi will bottle and distribute Cadbury Schweppes brands, including Schweppes and Canada Dry, in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Initial annual output will exceed 10m cases and is expected at least to double in five years. The companies plan to explore similar arrangements in other parts of eastern Europe, where Pepsi has operations in every country except Albania. It has operated in the former Soviet Union since the early 1970s and is investing Dollars 150m (Pounds 98m) in Ukraine. Until now, Hungary and Bulgaria have been the only eastern European countries in which Cadbury soft drinks have been sold. Some observers believe yesterday's agreement could lead to a much closer partnership, which could eventually extend to other parts of the world. 'It is a very important development in terms of what may lie ahead,' said Mr Jessie Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest, a US publication which monitors the soft drinks industry, 'This is a tryst which could turn into a date and maybe even marriage.' Two years ago, Pepsi ended a bottling franchise with Cadbury in Spain. Cadbury still bottles Pepsi products in southern Spain and France, while Pepsi has long distributed Cadbury drinks in parts of the US. The eastern Europe deal will help strengthen Pepsi's product range in the face of increased competition in eastern Europe from Coca-Cola. Although Pepsi claims three times Coke's sales in the region, Coke is investing more than Dollars 1bn there in an effort to catch up. Soft drink consumption per head in eastern Europe is less than a tenth of US levels and about a quarter of that in western Europe.</p>

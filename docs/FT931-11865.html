			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Economics: Focus turns to German pay talks THE focus turns to Germany this week where a run of important economic figures are expected and the third round of public sector wage talks begins. The Bundesbank will only be prepared to ease monetary conditions if the outcome of the pay round is 'moderate' and according to Ms Alison Cottrell, economist at Midland Global Markets, substantial progress has already been made in the west. However, negotiations are not going so smoothly in the east, where planned wage convergence is still posing a threat to economic and social stab-ility. German industrial production figures are forecast to show another month-on-month fall which would translate into a quarter on quarter decline of around 3 per cent. 'There appears to be no slowdown in the rate of decline for the first quarter given the ever weakening state of demand,' says Mr Michael Lewis, economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment house. Further signs of recession are likely to be reflected in the unemployment figures. Unadjusted unemployment passed the two million mark in December, and a number of economists are expecting the seasonally adjusted total to go the same way in January. In the US, attention will turn to the non-farm pay roll figures on Friday for further evidence of robust economic growth. They rose by 64,000 in December and are forecast to have grown by 100,000 in January. The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the week.

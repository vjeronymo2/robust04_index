			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Political setback sparks downturn in Argentina - But the sharp drop in July has made share prices look interesting once again The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange had little to celebrate on its 138th birthday yesterday. Prices have fallen sharply over the past six weeks, abruptly ending one of South America's more impressive bull runs. After decades in the doldrums, the stock market exploded to life in 1991 with a world record-breaking 396 per cent increase. But so far this year, share prices have fallen by 11.2 per cent. In July alone, equities lost one-third of their value, bringing the market's capitalisation down to Dollars 23.35bn, from a peak of Dollars 32.13bn in mid-June. Mr Eugenio Reynal, head of equities at Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos Aires investment house, says: 'The market over-reacted on the way up and it over-reacted on the way down. It showed that the market lacks professionalism.' He expects prices to recover, but not to the heights of late last year. At first sight there was no clear reason for the decline. The economy is performing well, with growth forecast at 6 per cent. Government finances are sound and inflation is low. Business investment is picking up slowly, in spite of uncertainty about the strength of the consumer-led boom that began 18 months ago. However, foreign investors are angry at the cheating by some local brokers and dishonest accounting practices. Insider trading and front-running are rife, but the government's equity watchdog has done little to impose discipline. It recently fined one company the equivalent of Dollars 7,917 for deceiving the market, the maximum legal penalty. It seems that profit-taking and a political setback for the government when it failed to win a Buenos Aires by-election in June sparked the downturn. Once the retreat gathered pace, nothing could stop it, especially after leveraged buyers began to abandon the market. Many punters had borrowed in March to buy Dollars 1.2bn worth of equity sold by the government in Telecom, one of Argentina's two privatised telephone companies. About Dollars 240m to Dollars 300m worth of Telecom shares were financed by banks, which were left holding the stock when an increasing number of clients refused to make margin calls. Telecom shares were offered to the public at Dollars 4.20 each; now they are worth a little more than Dollars 3. The Telecom flop, as well as a setback for punters, may make it harder for the government to unload a further Dollars 5bn worth of privatisation stocks in the future. Furthermore, the Telecom issue was heavily geared towards individual investors, who now have little incentive to return to the market. Mr Juan Carlos Sanchez Arnau, privatisations under-secretary, says there is no need for concern, but warns that the 'public must be more realistic and learn to pay the correct price, reducing substantially the margin for speculation'. He may be right, but his advice will sound cynical to investors tempted into the market by the government. After the bloodbath of recent weeks, the outlook for Argentine equities now looks brighter since the plunge has made prices look interesting once again. Merchant Bankers Asociados now estimates the prospective price/earnings ratio for steelmaker Acindar at 13, against its previous estimate of 29. Its p/e for footwear company Alpargatas is down to 17 from 34. The slide in the overall market index hides interesting shifts in individual stocks. Renault, the French carmaker's local subsidiary which has 28 per cent of its equity on the market, has soared 285 per cent this year. Smaller, less liquid stocks have outperformed the blue chips. Second-tier equities have risen 71 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Optimists point to the expected creation in 1993 of Argentina's first private pension funds. If legislation clears Congress in time, they are expected to invest Dollars 7bn to Dollars 8bn of contributions every year, making them a potentially captive market for new equity issues.</p>

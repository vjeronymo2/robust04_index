			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / EC's fate may hinge on vote in French overseas territories A CHILLING thought is sweeping through the foreign ministries of Europe as the world waits for tomorrow's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The future of European union may be decided not in the suburbs of Paris or familiar Mediterranean departements but in a group of exotic territories sprinkled around the Caribbean, South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and North Atlantic. With opinion polls still pointing to a perilously close race, the British Foreign Office  - responsible because of the European Community presidency for drawing up elaborate contingency plans for any outcome - fears that the voters in France's overseas territories and domains could hold the key. The so-called Domtoms  - departements d'outre mer and territoires d'outre mer  - account for more than 1m voters, or 2.6 per cent of the 38m French electorate, in places such as Martinique, Reunion, French Guiana and New Caledonia. If the French electorate is finely divided, votes from these far-flung locations could be crucial. The trouble is no one quite knows what their opinion is. The pollsters who busily questioned everyone and anyone in Lille or Marseilles apparently did not get around to them. Worse, the leisurely pace of the count in far-away places like the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte (population 94,410 in 1991) and the islets of St Pierre and Miquelon (6,392) off the coast of Newfoundland could severely disrupt plans for orchestrated displays of relief or unity by EC governments. While the outcome in mainland France will be known by tomorrow evening, the Domtom returns will not be collated until Monday afternoon. French government officials reckon that, if anything, the Domtom vote will may slightly strengthen the Yes vote  - though for the most perverse possible reasons. The turnout will be very low because there is almost no interest in the EC. In one or two places, independence parties have urged voters to send in blank ballot slips to protest against French rule. But there have apparently been few appeals for a No vote. One official has concluded that the proportion of Domtom residents voting Yes could be up to 10 percentage points above that in mainland France.</p>

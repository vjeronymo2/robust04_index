			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Solace is discovered on distant shores: Jurek Martin finds President Clinton enjoying foreign policy success - for now Not for the first time, a US president in domestic trouble has found temporary solace in foreign policy. For Mr Bill Clinton, the change may be bittersweet, but the sudden absence of serious criticism about his conduct of external affairs is worth savouring when his social reform programme at home lies in partial ruins. On Monday night, he was able to go on national television and to exude confidence and resolve on two difficult fronts. Iraq's 'reckless provocation' in the Gulf would be faced down by US military might and Haiti's military regime would keep its commitment not only to relinquish power but also to go into exile. Mr Clinton was careful also to note the recent successful visits to the US by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa. He could well have added the announcement in Washington last week of progress in negotiations between Israel and Jordan, and the current mission of his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, to Syria. If he had felt very bold, or mischievous, the president might also have mentioned the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland in the wake of US initiatives. He could even have taken satisfaction in the defusing of trade conflict with Japan. Mr Clinton himself, who had cancelled a Monday campaign trip to New Jersey to tend to the Gulf, was able to leave for Michigan yesterday to raise funds for Democratic party candidates. But the word from the White House - with Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, now more firmly in control - was to keep talk of any political benefit in the mid-term US elections early next month to a minimum. 'We'll leave that to the pundits,' one anonymous official said. That caution is probably well advised. The current public mood does not look kindly on foreign entanglements, though President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is enough of a popular villain after the 1991 Gulf war to be considered a special case. There may be admiration for the role by US troops in Haiti, but the US occupation is still viewed at home with much scepticism. History also suggests, as Mr Kevin Phillips pointed out in a recent edition of his newsletter, American Political Report, that, although foreign 'October surprises' may influence presidential elections, they have much less impact on the mid-term contests. The only clear exception was the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis in late October 1962, which cut projected heavy Democratic losses to only four seats in the House of Representatives, offset by a gain of two in the Senate. Mr Clinton would give his political eye-teeth for such an outcome on November 8. More telling: the Camp David agreement on the Middle East, in September 1978, lifted President Jimmy Carter's standing in the opinion polls by 10-16 points, but most of that had faded by the following November, when the Democrats incurred losses. The US troop build-up in the Gulf in the autumn of 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was, to the US electorate, both controversial at the time and, in any case, overshadowed by poor economic news. However, Mr Clinton and the Democrats can take momentary consolation from the fact that the Republican party assault on the foreign policy front has been silenced, for now. Former officials of the Bush administration, including Mr Laurence Eagleburger, once a caustic secretary of state, have commended the president's resolve in the Gulf. Mr Dick Cheney, ex-defence secretary, merely added the barb that it did not look likely that Mr Clinton would have to send Mr Carter to Baghdad to negotiate. Criticism has emanated from the wilder shores. Mr Ross Perot, the 1992 independent presidential candidate who is urging his supporters to vote Republican on November 8, naturally thought the Gulf confrontation a put-up job to save Mr Clinton's skin. Mr Oliver North, Republican candidate for the US senate in Virginia, announced that Mr Clinton was not 'my commander-in-chief', and charged that he had eviscerated US defence capability and thus encouraged Saddam Hussein. This caused embarrassment to Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas, who was at Mr North's side. Local pundits thought he might have made his first serious campaign mistake thereby. He certainly provided scope yesterday for Vice-President Al Gore, who called Mr North's statements 'unpatriotic and despicable', and said he was 'giving aid and comfort to a foreign dictator'. The irony of Mr Clinton as an international tough guy, a role he did not come to office intent on playing, is not lost on the US public, but the transformation has won grudging approval in Washington. Both the state and defence departments, the object of much virulent criticism for nearly two years, suddenly seem in much surer hands, with rumours of more changes at the top quiet for now. During one month, Mr Clinton has twice dispatched substantial US military contingents overseas. In Haiti, this may have been the only available alternative after much agony over policy - and at least the occupation was achieved with few guns blazing - but in the Gulf the second thoughts that have often seemed to paralyse his administration have not been in evidence. Both missions could yet become messy, as happened in Somalia. The Gulf engagement, in particular, raises longer-term problems about how best to contain Mr Saddam if the Iraqis themselves cannot dispose of him. Still, for a beleaguered president, these may seem manageable after what happened to his ambitious domestic programmes.</p>

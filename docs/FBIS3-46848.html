			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Naohiro Yashiro, Sophia University professor and </F> senior researcher for the Japan Economic Research Center: "The  Cost and Benefits of Stable Employment"]    [Text] A unique characteristic at this point in the  current prolonged economic slump is that adjustments in  employment are not matching the extent to which production has  fallen. And there is no guarantee that this will continue into  the future. Meanwhile, looking to the mid to long term,  employment stability which is based on Japanese-style employment  practices must change as it now stands.    The pressing employment issue is intertwined with complex  elements involving short-, mid-, and long-term aspects.    First, there is great fear that the prolonged slump will  relegate into the ranks of the unemployed a great number of  still employed but surplus workers through massive employment  adjustments.    Furthermore, the difference between foreign and domestic  wages as viewed from a dollar base in concert with the sharply  higher yen is growing ever larger. As a result, there is  accelerated investment in overseas manufacturing, which has  given rise to anxiety over the gap between production and  employment.    Finally, with the solid trend toward an aging population and  work force, a long-term task is to reconsider Japanese-style  employment practices and management system.  <H5>  The Current Situation of Employment Stability </H5>   The current business recession, which started at the  beginning of 1991 and then apparently having hit bottom at the  beginning of 1993 but followed by the emergence of the high yen,  again continues. With the possibility that the economic growth  rate during fiscal 1993 will be still lower than the less than  one percent growth rate of the preceding year, the lowest since  the latter half of the seventies, the result is the fear that  this will be the longest recession since the end of World War II.    One major and unique characteristic of the current business  recession is the stability of employment compared to the  previous high yen slump. Despite an average 6.3 percent drop in  manufacturing production during fiscal 1992, the number of  regularly employed people compared to the preceding year  remained stable and for the first half of 1993 dropped to a  level just 0.7 percent below the preceding year and stayed  there. This is the major difference compared to the previous  high yen slump where the drop in production and employment  stayed roughly in the same range.    Against this background are the following two major factors.  First is the steep adjustment in work hours which occurred this  time as part of the process of reducing production activity.  With the reduction in prescribed work hours and the spread of  the five-day work week, there was a steep reduction of slightly  more than 3 percent (during the high yen slump it was slightly  less than 1 percent) in the total work hour base.    The heightened demand for a subrogated work force in concert  with this short-term development is a major factor in the  avoidance of a steep decline in regular employment. The total  committed work base, comprised of hours, was lower than for the  previous high yen slump.    Furthermore, the wage adjustment mechanism worked more  effectively this time. During the previous high yen slump, the  cost of real wages (deflation in wholesale prices) rose to a  remarkably high level due to the high yen and the steep drop in  the price of oil and despite a slump in production activity.  This time, in contrast, the gentle rate of increase in the cost  of real wages for 1992 was slightly more than 2 percent, given  the fact that the drop in the price of manufactured goods was  trifling.    In this way, real wages and the adjustment in work hours  were  effectively accomplished. In terms of this recession, despite a  steep drop in work productivity accompanying the drop in  production activity, the rate of increase for companies in unit  work cost (the cost of real wages divided by work productivity)  remained at about the same level as for the previous peak.  <H5>  A "Myth" To Be Tested </H5>   However, it is doubtful that employment stability will  continue in the latter half of fiscal 1993 as it has up to now.    First, there is little room for a further reduction in work  hours, which have already reached a remarkably low level.  Furthermore, we are in a situation where wholesale prices have  dropped 3 percent over last year under the continued high yen,  with little room remaining for adjustments in real wages if the  solidification of nominal wages in the downward direction is any  precedent. This is one basis for the "wage reduction argument"  which would involve the lowering of the nominal wage base during  the spring labor offensive.    There is exceedingly little possibility that such a "wage  reduction" will occur. Rather, should production activity be  fully restored in fiscal 1993, the level of unit work cost will  be higher still and will be a major factor in putting additional  pressure on company earnings.    Were we to mechanically calculate the amount of necessary  reduction in employment because unit work costs for  manufacturing at the beginning of fiscal 1993 remained at a par  with the preceding year, we would get a 10-percent reduction  (about 800,000 people) over the preceding year and from the  viewpoint of manufacturing costs would become an appropriate  standard in establishing surplus employment in companies. On the  other hand, should most of this be absorbed by the market, the  unemployment rate would be 3 percent.    Furthermore, the pressure for adjustments in employment is  particularly striking for the management ranks. As a result of  reduced operations which were vigorously implemented during the  first half of the eighties, the number of people employed  professionally as managers dropped despite economic growth.  However, since 1986 the tide turned once again to rapid  additions in staff and, compared to the trend (based on the GNP  price elasticity) for 1991, the base for all industries now  shows a surplus of nearly 170,000 people.    This is based on accelerating growth in the number of  employees as a whole and a 20-percent increase during the past  six years in the number of professional managers. What made this  possible was excessive creation of subsidiaries by major  companies caused by latent profits in real estate during the  bubble economy. In this sense, to the degree that adjustments  were not made during the previous high yen slump, the pressure  for reducing the number of management positions has increased  during this business recession.    The guarantee of stable employment during business  recessions  has been accepted up to this point as a tacit contract arising  from the Japanese-style employment system. There are those who  question the responsibility of management vis-a-vis implementing  of forced employment reductions by major companies. However, it  is not that major Japanese companies have never adopted  reductions in force in the past, rather they have delayed them  as much as a year and a half when compared to U.S. firms.    The conditions that made this possible were the work hours  and the heightened adjustment force of real wages. Furthermore,  during those periods the brevity of the business recession  always pointed to a business recovery. With the latter half of  fiscal 1993 indicating a strong possibility that these  conditions will not be met at all, this may become the time when  the myth that "big business equals stable employment" will be  questioned.  <H5>  The High Yen and the Hollowing Out of Industry </H5>   The continuing high yen, a major factor in the lengthening  of  the current recession, has rekindled the risk of a hollowed-out  industry, which had been trumpeted during the previous high yen  slump. The high yen, which has climbed to nearly 100 to the  dollar, is only one-fourth what it was during the 1985-87 period  in terms of rate of increase.    A major factor for the serious acceptance of the current  high  yen has been the inability to shift smoothly from external to  internal demand, eliminating other factors of the earlier high  yen period such as: 1) correction of the overly cheap yen during  first half of the eighties; 2) improvement in trade as a result  of the steep drop in crude oil prices; and 3) financial  deregulation and increased corporate earnings bolstered by  skyrocketing asset values.    That is to say, the current high yen, facing a time of  corporate strength weakened by a steep business recession and  the explosive drop in asset values, is having a greater impact  than would appear on the surface.    Furthermore, from the fact that the automobile and  electronics industries, which were eagerly making direct  overseas investments during the previous high yen time and  simultaneously investing aggressively in plants and equipment  domestically, the hollowed-out production argument results in  needless fear. However, if we look back in terms of the current  state of things, another factor was that the chief export  industries, primarily automobiles and electronics, in  simultaneously making broad domestic and direct overseas  investments, created a surplus of plants and equipment,  prolonging the inventory adjustment period.    The response to the high yen by Japanese companies who have  learned this lesson will be different this time. Furthermore, it  is significant that many businesses already producing in earnest  overseas have made few investments compared to the previous high  yen period. In this alone there is the strong possibility that  companies are responding with care to the differences between  foreign and domestic production costs. In the future this will  strengthen the trend for still higher production overseas as  opposed to domestic production.    However, on the other hand, judging by questionnaires of  most  companies, the view that 120 yen to the dollar is an appropriate  exchange rate and that export industries will be dealt a major  blow should the yen go any higher than this, raises many doubts.    Although the five-year average exchange rate preceding the  high yen from the beginning of this fiscal year was stable at  about 134 yen to the dollar, the difference in the inflation  rate between the United States and Japan during that time was on  the average close to 3 percent in terms of wholesale prices and  the real base in the yen versus the dollar means that for this  period the yen was almost 15 percent cheaper. This is to say, in  terms of the nominal base, the stability of the exchange rate  for Japan, which has had a remarkably low inflation rate among  advanced nations, means depreciation in terms of the real base.  The high yen this time signifies this kind of adjustment in the  direction of a cheaper yen.    The high yen provides an opportunity to increase the  pressure  for restructuring domestic industry, which has been protected by  the system, including agriculture, through the growing foreign  and domestic price differential. Although productivity in some  areas of manufacturing in Japan is extremely high, productivity  for industry as a whole in 1991 compared to the United States  and the chief countries of Europe was 20 percent lower (from a  base of purchasing parity).    Facilitating movement of workers from areas of low  productivity to highly productive ones through deregulation is a  fundamental strategy for linking increased demand for high yen  profits and for avoiding a hollowing out of employment.  <H5>  Changing Japanese-Style Employment </H5>   The fact that Japanese companies, which have been facing a  business recession, did not immediately resort to layoffs as is  done in the United States but instead sustained surplus  employment by sacrificing corporate profits has been taken as a  manifestation of their sense of social responsibility.    Consequently, fear is widespread that, should the underlying  relationship of trust between employer and employee collapse  through a large-scale employment adjustment, in particular  through the dismissal of midcareer and senior employees with  many years of service, companies will lose the industriousness  of the worker and over the long term the vitality of the  Japanese economy will be weakened.    However, Japanese-style employment, which is based on the  seniority system and employment stability, must undergo wide  ranging alteration, whether we like it or not, brought on by a  major change in the external environment, the long-term aging of  Japan's population.    The percentage of aged will double in the next 30 years and,  furthermore, the rate of increase in the supply of workers in  the 1990's will be half that of the 1980's, which means that we  will once again be facing reductions as we enter the 21st  century. It is a very different situation where up to now Japan  has been supported by a high-quality, abundant work force.    The elements that will sustain the greatest impact from this  are the seniority system and the wage scales that are based on  age and reflect seniority. Wage scales that provide increases in  the average wage based on current age have in general been  accepted as subsistence supplement [seikatsu kyu] based on a  worker's need to provide for increased educational fees for his  children.    However, perhaps these major Japanese companies been  practicing something akin to the communist principle of "from  each according to his ability, to each according to his need."    Rather, a better explanation is that wages increase on the  basis of age and years of continuous service rather than  stemming from an economic theory that a portion of the profits  from the investment in human capital which communicate  discipline within the company are restored in the form of wages  based on years of service in order to keep an employee with the  company. In this case, a wage system based on years of service  is a factor in that the average white collar worker can bear the  burden of raising and educating his children, except that this  is not the outcome.    If the wage system is not paternalism by business but is the  result of corporate policy toward the investment of human  capital in a pyramidal age structure reflecting the population  and Japan's high growth rate since World War II, the increasing  average age of the work force and a lower average economic  growth rate could weaken the corporate will toward investment in  human capital and actually work toward lowering the slope of the  wage profile.    Furthermore, should the situation develop that stockholders,  and chiefly institutional investors, more and more be unwilling  to accept excess employment and the sacrificing of company  profits during business recessions as has been the case up to  now, companies all the more will move toward the curtailment of  employees who are subject to entrenched personnel practices.    Should this materialize, the incentive for an employee to  remain with one company as has been the case to this point will  diminish. Furthermore, the chronic need for labor and the  inadequate labor force will work to heighten the trend toward  increased unemployment along with increased employment  opportunities at midcareer.    This situation was already strikingly evident at some  companies during the last stage of the Heisei recession. Should  the behavior of employees become fluid and not fit into the  framework of a specific company, employment practices more and  more will have to change regarding this.  <H5>  Compensations for Employment Stability </H5>   Up to this point the embracing of an surplus work force by  Japanese companies during business recessions has been highly  praised as a demonstration of their social responsibility.  However, the Japanese worker is forced to make many sacrifices  in return for employment stability.    First is the chronically long work week. In an employment  system which adds long overtime hours to the normal day,  reducing work hours during business recessions can regulate the  amount of work invested. Indeed, this is a system that exists in  order to use precious human capital to the maximum. For U.S. and  European companies that lack this kind of overtime buffer, a  drop in production activity must immediately be tied to layoffs.    Second are the frequent transfers and temporary assignments  to affiliated companies. Japanese employees are obliged to do  what the company orders in return for guaranteed employment. As  a result, the reshuffling of office and production workers among  business activities during recessions is everyday fare. In going  beyond the basic need for this, many companies attempt this as a  kind of "shock treatment" in order to generate a sense of crisis  in the employee. However, the psychological suffering is  incalculable for older workers who are dispatched to unfamiliar  jobs.    Third is the 30 percent of white-collar workers in their  forties who make unaccompanied transfers caused by reshuffling  stemming from transfers effected without regard to business  conditions. To attribute this to the issue of a worker's family  and his children's education is myopic. For example, even were  this not the issue, moving a family from a town to which they  are accustomed to unknown territory for the convenience of the  company is totally unacceptable in European and U.S. societies.    Finally, the fixed employment system of large companies is a  major factor in the substantial differences in wages. This is to  say, the fact that women who must work for the sake of their  homes and their children are actually excluded from the  seniority system is the reason why the average difference in  wages between men and women is the largest in Japan among  advanced nations.    Furthermore, an aged-based system, which uniformly makes  retirement compulsory despite differences in individual ability  at a particular age, sanctions "age discrimination" which is  prohibited by law in the United States.    Moreover, whenever a male employee 40 or older tries to  change jobs to seek new opportunities, he faces the disadvantage  that the amount of retirement he will receive is severely  reduced because he is interrupting his years of continuous  service. This factor prevents the effective employment of  precious human talent which could benefit another company.    It is true that working conditions have improved drastically  in the development of the postwar Japanese economy with the  promotion of wage increases and shorter work weeks. However,  companies dictate repeated shuffling of personnel, and older  employees, who have skills useful only to a specific company,  also face compulsory retirement and are forced to transfer to  job sites with extremely poor working conditions. Moreover, it  is also true that those in management are coerced into early  retirement or are put on temporary retirement transfers to  subsidiaries in advance of their formal retirement age.  <H5>  Improving Employment Policies </H5>   There is a surplus work force, the time when employment  stability was the greatest concern is gone, the inadequacy of  the aging work force is becoming universal, and the negotiating  strength of the worker is increasing. The coming issue,  therefore, is not simply one of employment stability, but of  having a choice in work content.    Should that happen, it will often be more advantageous for a  company to keep common specialized technologies on hand than to  focus simply on management positions.    For the worker there are more fundamental advantages with an  inadequate work force than for the company. The prerequisite is  to create a society in which one can choose one's retirement and  have individual choice in work content.    The chief aim of Japanese employment policy until now has  been to reduce unemployment by underwriting entrenched  employment practices. However, the entrenched employment  practices are a major cause of the sharp differences in working  conditions for senior workers above retirement age and married  women, not to mention the cost of job shuffling, frequent  transfers, and chronic overtime.    The limitations in the supply of the work force will  intensify as we enter the 21st century. Moreover, as the ratio  of older workers and women grows, the social cost of entrenched  employment practices will steadily increase. The current  "lifetime employment system" is already changing and in the  future adjustments to employment centering on management  positions will steadily strengthen.    Given this situation, support to entrenched corporate  employment practices through subsidies as government policy may  be unavoidable in the short term. However, policies will be  needed for the long term which give mobility to workers  broadening the range of choices he can make beyond of dependency  on one particular company.    To this end, it will be necessary to abolish the  preferential  tax system which does not allow an employee to defer pay into a  retirement fund, and in its place establish a government policy  such as for welfare payments that make it possible to move to an  accounting system for company retirements that is not  disadvantageous to transfers between companies.    Furthermore, employment mobility will stimulate the need for  a shift toward practical life experience over the university  education which primarily fulfills the function of qualitative  selection for entry into major companies. Furthermore, the  possibility exists that the non-productive behavior of working  any number of years in order to enter a famous university will  be reduced should midcareer employment opportunities with major  companies expand.    Reform of the Japanese educational system will be  indispensable for improving the labor market, which will be the  way out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy by </F> Mykola Motornyy; place and date not given: "We Will Fulfill Our  Duty To Defend Ukraine!"]    [Text] [Motornyy] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, in a few days,  Ukraine will celebrate the 49th anniversary of the victory over  the fascist invaders. You were born at the end of the war. Do  you remember your first Victory Day?    [Radetskyy] I remember how mother was preparing for this  holiday. She baked patties and laid a festive table. The  entire family was assembled. They remembered the strenuous war  years. As a matter of fact, 9 May has become sanctified. So  much blood was shed, so many people died, and so much property  was burned down! Almost every Ukrainian family suffered. At  that time nobody asked who did what during the war -- everybody  did everything for the common cause and defended his fatherland.  Besides, my father, a participant in the war, told much about  the fighting at the front. His elder brother commanded a  regiment. Our family has always held this day in esteem.    I am sure that the present changes in Ukraine must not  change  the attitude toward veterans and toward the heroic deeds on all  the fronts against the fascists. The people fought against an  enemy who had come to enslave us. Today our veterans deserve  more attention from the state and a better life. I have  instructed deputy defense ministers, chiefs of central  administrations, and commanders of the armed services and of  Ukraine's Armed Forces districts to take care of communal graves  and monuments and to greet the veterans. Let us be frank, we  have not created suitable conditions for their lives. This is  our common holiday, a day that we tried to bring nearer as much  as we could.    [Motornyy] How will the holiday be marked by the troops.    [Radetskyy] On 9 May, we will hold solemn ceremonies,  evening roll-calls, we will march with songs and bands, and, of  course, fire the salute.    This year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of  Ukraine's liberation and next May the 50th anniversary of  victory. A special badge to mark the 50th anniversary of  Ukraine's liberation has been designed. There will also be a  medal. At present, our administration for personnel and  mobilization must compile lists of veterans. We must do  everything in order not to overlook anyone. Our ministry is  trying to see to it that the veterans get their pensions on  time. I will personally greet all the Heroes of the Soviet  Union and holders of the three grades of glory. Incidentally, in  the capital alone, there reside more than 150 Heroes. An order  has already been issued for Ukraine's Armed Forces servicemen to  visit the hospitals. Young soldiers will visit and greet  veterans -- soldiers and officers.    [Motornyy] What is your attitude toward the Soviet Army's  combat and military patriotic traditions?    [Radetskyy] Whether we want it or not, there exists the  history of the former USSR, no matter how hard some people try  to erase it. We have actually grown out of that history. It is  the history of our fathers, grandfathers, and great  grandfathers. Not everything was bad there. We must know about  this and draw conclusions from that history. People have become  used to extremes. First the monuments are erected, and now we  want to destroy them right away. Leave them alone, so that they  can remind us of those who made mistakes or committed crimes  against their people. So that they will never be repeated.    We must now have great respect for those who fought for  Ukraine's independence in the ranks of the Soviet Army and for  those who liberated the homeland in the ranks of the Ukrainian  Insurrection Army. In my opinion, it is still difficult to  assess the events that happened half a century ago. We must  find out who did what and where during the war and after it. We  must thoroughly study history and the archives. Today we must  pay tribute to those people who fought for the liberation and  independence of the Ukrainian state. It is up to history to sort  out on whose side and how they did it. Time is the best teacher.    Now about traditions. We must look upon them in a somewhat  broader way -- not only during the times of the former USSR. We  will go back to the Bohdan Khmelnytskyy period. Patriotism was  always appreciated, and the defender-warrior was held in esteem.  Thus, everything that was good must be taken on by the Ukrainian  Army and everything positive must be used, multiplied, and  developed. Everything negative must serve as a lesson for the  future. We must not repeat the mistakes of previous  generations. We must change the people's mentality. Take  [writer Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn. He asserts in IZVESTIYA that  Ukraine and Belarus cannot exist separately and that they must  be within Russia. However, the United States and Canada can  peacefully coexist. Why can we not coexist with Russia, Poland,  Belarus, or Moldova?    [Motornyy] At this stage of building the Ukrainian State, we  are in very bad need of modern armed forces that can defend the  Ukrainian people. What are the components of our army's combat  readiness?    [Radetskyy] From the former Soviet Union, we inherited  three military districts, the fleet, the Air Force, and the air  defense. Earlier, it was fashionable to reform the army  [allusion to former defense minister Morozov]. Namely, reduce  or increase the amount of military technology or personnel. At  present, we must not engage in reforms, but build our Armed  Forces with a view to the future. Not a single state can exist  without an institution of armed forces. It is one of the major  guarantees of security for every country.    Two important issues were discussed at a recent committee of  the Defense Ministry. The first concerned the plan for building  the Armed Forces for the period between 1994 and 2010. The  second dealt with the training of personnel, in particular,  officers. The thing is that, during the transitional period, we  not only sustained material losses; there also were shortcomings  in the training of personnel and specialists, and in methods.    I believe that modern Ukrainian Armed Forces must not be  large, but must be mobile, flexible, and equipped with  up-to-date combat technology. They must be led by well-trained  specialists. At present, we are raising the question of a mixed  principle of bringing the army up to strength -- compulsory  regular service and service on a contractual basis. This is  cheaper for the state. It is better to deal with specialists  who are in perfect command of tanks, launchers, or radar  stations, than with young people who have just come from  institutes of higher learning, collective farms, or factories.  For a year and a half to two years, the soldier will only just  master the complex technology. When will he actually serve?!    Of course, in order to build a contemporary army, we need a  strong economy. It is precisely the economy that determines  everything, and in particular the combat readiness of the Armed  Forces.    [Motornyy] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, despite our poverty, do the  Armed Forces get proper attention?    [Radetskyy] Despite the difficult economic situation in  Ukraine, we feel concern about our defender-warriors. It is  pleasant to realize that the president, the government, and the  main thing -- the Ukrainian people, simple laborers --  understand this. The numerical strength of our personnel has  been specified. Ukraine's Armed Forces have three armed services  -- ground, marine, and airborne defense. Of course, we do not  receive funds and fuel in the way that we would like to, the way  that it was done before, when gasoline flowed like a river and  there was enough money. However, fuel and uniforms are being  supplied in sufficient amounts, there is decent medical care,  and officers are getting their salaries. Unfortunately,  sometimes there are delays. There occur problems that do not  even depend upon the minister of defense or upon the Cabinet of  Ministers.    Our army now has well-trained units and formations capable  of  defending sovereign Ukraine. It is precisely for that purpose  that the Ukrainian Army exists. Of course, it would be better  to have an army that would even today be perfectly well equipped  with weapons and technology on full combat readiness....    On the eve of Victory Day, I want to report to the Ukrainian  people that we are doing everything for the army to be able to  do its direct duty -- the defense of Ukraine. Incidentally the  Ukrainian Army enjoys a high rating among the population -- only  the church is ahead of us. This has been confirmed by  independent studies. Therefore, that tasks that the army is  facing will be carried out with dignity.    I have become convinced that the army needs strong,  courageous, and tough people, who are well trained both morally  and physically. Sports occupy a leading position in it. Quite  soon, soldiers will be examined for the winter term. In  particular, everybody will be examined for physical fitness --  from soldiers to the defense minister. We will examine all the  soldiers, the warrant officers, the officers, and the generals.    [Motornyy] What is your personal attitude toward sports  activities?    [Radetskyy] In the past, I went in for boxing and the  military triathlon. The minister of defense starts his working  day at 0730 in the morning and finishes at 2100 or 2200. That  is an everyday practice. I also work on Saturdays. I sometimes  even go to work on Sundays. Not because I fail to complete my  work on weekdays. Simply, it is quieter on days-off -- nobody  calls you to various meetings. With such a workload, one simply  cannot survive without sports.    [Motornyy] Among the readers of MOLOD UKRAYINY, there are  many veterans of the great Patriotic War, the Ukrainian  Insurrection Army, soldiers of the Armed Forces, and future  defenders. What would you like to wish them on the eve of  Victory Day?    [Radetskyy] We have always been MOLOD UKRAYINY's  well-wishers (I am not saying this because its correspondent is  sitting in my office). Your newspaper has always been loyal and  understanding with regard to Ukraine's Armed Forces. It has  never relished the shortcomings that we have, but perceived them  as the concern of the entire society. I am very grateful to  journalists for their support of the army. Of course, we must  be criticized, but in a just manner. Taking this opportunity, I  want to express my personal gratitude, as well as that of the  military board and the entire officers' corps for their concern  about the Ukrainian Army. I wish journalists and readers of  MOLOD UKRAYINY lasting health and success in the building of  Ukraine! I congratulate you on Victory Day!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: ``The South Korean Puppets' </F> Maneuver To Develop Nuclear Weapons Has Reached a Grave Stage'']    [Text] Realizing denuclearization on the Korean peninsula  today is a consistent demand of the people at home and abroad.  Denuclearization in Northeast Asia cannot be realized if the  Korean peninsula does not become a nuclear-free zone, and if  Northeast Asia does not realize denuclearization, we cannot  expect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.    Therefore, realizing the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula is a grave task of the times. Nevertheless, while  running counter to the intention and demand of the times, the  South Korean puppets today are conspiring with outside forces to  all the more heatedly develop nuclear weapons.    A concrete example of this is the fact that the South Korean  puppets are promoting to develop a fast-breeding reactor. A  fast-breeding reactor is an atomic reactor that produces  high-purity plutonium, which is raw material for producing  nuclear weapons.    The South Korean puppets have promoted the development of  the  fast-breeding reactor for a long time. Since the 1980's the  South Korean puppets had started the development of the  fast-breeding reactor and it has currently reached a very grave  stage. In 1984, the South Korean puppets concluded an agreement  with a European country, which possesses the most advanced  technology in the world in developing the fast-breeding reactor,  to introduce the high-breeding reactor. It thus started to  introduce its core technology, design, and experimental reactor  facilities. In the late 1980's, it completed various  technological preparations and experiments necessary to develop  positive reactors. Also in the 1990's, after going through the  experimental stage, it started to develop it on a full-scale.    According to nuclear experts, the conceptional and budgetary  design of the positive reactors has already been completed in  South Korea, and the overall amount that has been invested is  118.3 billion won.    Currently, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is receiving  support and recognition from the world's social circles on  developing the fast-breeder reactor, and is carrying out  diplomatic activities by bustling about here and there to  demonstrate a legitimate justification.    The puppets are not only all the more producing plutonium  within South Korea, but they are also bringing more of it in  from other countries and are appropriately maintaining the  production process itself to reprocess it.    The so-called chairman of the Foreign Affairs and  Unification  Committee of the South Korea National Assembly said that we  cannot transfer other countries' nuclear fuel. This clearly  shows how much the South Korean puppets are persistently  clinging to nuclear development.    Regardless of all the facts, in an interview with THE LOS  ANGELES TIMES, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that they do not have  any intention at all to independently develop nuclear weapons.  This is a poor excuse to avoid criticism from the world  community, which is leaning toward them. This shows how much he  is filled with falsehood and hypocrisy.    Papers of various countries, including the United States and  Great Britain, view that plutonium already stored by South Korea  amounts to 10 tonnes and that it will increase to 24 tonnes in  the year 2000. As such, even though the South Korean puppets  are acting as the shock brigade for their nuclear development,  they are trying to mislead the world as if we have some kind of  a nuclear problem.    On 4 May, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that during the past one  year we have continued nuclear development and that North Korean  nuclear development must be restrained in whatever way. Such a  remark by traitor Kim Yong-sam is aimed at completing their goal  of being armed with nuclear weapons by accelerating the  development of their nuclear weapons under the protection of the  U.S. nuclear umbrella by making it so that the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula cannot reach a package settlement at the  DPRK-U.S. talks in whatever way.    Nevertheless, nothing will be gained regardless of how the  South Korean puppets plot to harm us with the nuclear issue.  The world's people who treasure justice and truth and love  peace have a clear insight of the true nature of the scheme  being carried out by the South Korean puppets.    The more the Kim Yong-sam ring accelerates their nuclear  development by finding fault with our so-called nuclear  suspicions, the more their true nature will be revealed before  the world's people. The South Korean puppets must correctly  know that their reckless maneuver to develop nuclear weapons  will only bring about a result of digging their own graves.  They must immediately stop the play of putting the calamity of  a nuclear disaster on the heads of the fellow countrymen.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> THE 4-POWER ACCORD ON BERLIN: KEY POINTS  </P> <P> The four-power agreement on Berlin was signed in the city on Sept. 3, 1971, by  the U.S., British and French ambassadors to West Germany and the Soviet  ambassador to East Germany. It went into effect June 3, 1972. Here are its key  provisions:  </P> <P> Road, rail and waterway traffic between West Germany and West Berlin would be  unimpeded and facilitated.  </P> <P> West Berliners would be able to visit East Berlin and East Germany on the same  terms as West Germans.  </P> <P> Commercial cargo in transit between West Germany and West Berlin would be  sealed and inspection limited to seals and documents.  </P> <P> Private travelers would only be identified, not searched, except in suspected  cases of "misuse" of the transit routes.  </P> <P> West Germany would pay East Germany an annual sum for use of the transit  routes.  </P> <P> Ties between West Berlin and West Germany would be developed, taking into  account that West Berlin continued "not to be a constituent part of the Federal  Republic of Germany and not to be governed by it."  </P> <P> The West German president, government and Parliament could not perform  "constitutional or official acts" in West Berlin.  </P> <P> West Germany could represent West Berlin at international organizations and  conferences, and perform consular services, but the United States, Britain and  France retained responsibility for its security and status.  </P> <P> A Soviet consulate-general was authorized in West Berlin.  </P></p>

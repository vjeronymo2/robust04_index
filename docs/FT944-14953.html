			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Genentech ahead 116% at Dollars 33.6m Genentech, the US bio-technology company, bucked the trend of bad news from its sector with a 116 per cent rise in net income in the third quarter to Dollars 33.6m, or 28 cents a share. The company attributed much of the growth to its latest product, Pulmozyne, which treats cystic fibrosis. On Monday, shares in two smaller biotech companies, Gensia Pharmaceuticals and ProCyte, more than halved on the news that new products had failed in clinical trials. However, Mr Kirk Raab, Genentech chairman, said: 'Important clinical development progress during the quarter should help us maintain our rate of growth.' The company said sales of Pulmozyne, in its third quarter on the market, had been Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 18.7m in the second quarter. The drug was launched in France and Germany in the quarter, and sells in 18 countries. Sales of Activase, used to dissolve blood clots, were Dollars 65.1m, against Dollars 63.5m. However, sales of Genentech's two human growth hormone products, Protropin and Nutropin, were down to Dollars 54.6m from Dollars 55.4m. Group revenues in the quarter were Dollars 193.8m, an increase of 17 per cent. Research and development expenditure was Dollars 73.2m, against Dollars 72.3m, or 38 per cent of revenue.</p>

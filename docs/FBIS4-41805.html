			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Crimean Deputy Prime Minister </F> Yevgeniy Saburov and presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy;  place and date not given]    [Text] The fewer the reforms in Ukraine, the more  separatist the sentiment in the Crimea; this is what Crimean  Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov said on 23 June at a  meeting with presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy. Yevgeniy  Saburov outlined the current socioeconomic situation on the  peninsula: plants sitting idle, most of the workers being paid  meager wages, the average salary reaching no more than 200,000  karbovantsi. There are no efficient leverages for managing and  regulating the economy -- the tax and statistics services did  not receive financial aid from official Kiev; neither did the  Republic's economy in general. The last hope is placed on the  creation of a favorable climate for investments in the Crimea  and firm guarantees for entrepreneurship in the sphere of  financial and credit policies. "The fewer the reforms there are  in Ukraine, the more separatist the sentiments there are in the  Crimea," the deputy prime minister summed up.    Saburov sees no obstacles for developing political relations  with the official Kiev, and would like to see constructive and  balanced approaches to resolving problems. "We have no fear of  any possible confrontation," he declared. "There is nothing to  fear when the people are on the brink of utmost destitution and  half-starved subsistence."    Asked by our correspondent about his attitude toward  Kravchuk's statement that the foundation for the market economy  has already been laid in Ukraine, Saburov snapped: "Maybe. But  where? Show me the place. In the basement? Those who did not  go down there will never learn about it." As for the statement  by Ukrainian legislative speaker Oleksandr Moroz that if elected  president, he would do his best to protect people from  misimplemented market reforms, Saburov commented as follows:  "That statement does not explain whom he had in mind. To  protect against whom? Against the state policies that have  nothing to do with market reforms or against state regulation of  the market economy? The latter is promised in his election  platform." Whatever the case, Saburov said, we are ready for  cooperation. The fact that in spite of his busy schedule,  Saburov devoted almost an hour and a half to talks with  presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy shows that the head of  the Crimean Government has made his choice.</p>

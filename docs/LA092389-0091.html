			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC TO RELOCATE MERGED CREDIT-CARD UNITS  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp. said Friday that it will combine its three credit-card  processing facilities, including one in Glendale, and move them to a new site  in Arizona.  </P> <P> The Glendale credit-card operation is the largest of the Los Angeles banking  company's three centers, employing 420 people. Security Pacific has another in  Seattle, which employs 200 people. The smallest one employs 61 people in  Phoenix.  </P> <P> A Security Pacific spokeswoman said all of the current employees will be  offered jobs at the Phoenix center. She added that an effort will be made to  find jobs elsewhere in the company for Glendale and Seattle employees who  choose not to move. If other jobs cannot be found, she said, employees will  receive severance benefits.  </P> <P> The credit-card facilities operate 24 hours a day, processing transactions for  purchases made with MasterCard and Visa credit cards issued by Security  Pacific. The three facilities combined handle 1.5 million accounts with total  balances of more than $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> Security Pacific, parent of Security Pacific National Bank, disclosed in April  that it was considering combining the three facilities into one as a major  cost-saving measure. Security Pacific now has three centers because it acquired  banks in Arizona and Washington that had their own processing facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Start by Year-End  </P> <P> Security Pacific said it also considered sites in California, Oregon, Nevada  and Washington. It said Arizona was selected because workers are plentiful,  operating costs are expected to be lower and because various laws and  regulations there are less strict than in some other states, such as  California.  </P> <P> The banking company said it expects to start consolidating the facilities by  the end of the year.  </P></p>

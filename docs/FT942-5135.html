German-Spanish consultations take place in the north German town of Schwerin. Germany's chancellor Helmut Kohl will no doubt be seeking support from Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez for the candidacy of Jean Luc Dehaene as president of the European Commission.

The markets expect to see that GDP rose by 0.5 per cent, after falling by 0.7 per cent in the last quarter of 1993.

Russia's government signs a co-operation agreement with the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that should promote the flow of western economic expertise. Also parliament is expected to examine the 1994 budget for final approval after much delay and strident demands from many deputies for big increases in defence spending. UK economy: The release of UK industrial production figures today are expected to show that UK output bounced back in April, after weakening slightly in March.

Additionally, the score polled by anti-Maastricht protest parties - particularly in Germany and France - will be closely watched. UK by-elections: Five by-elections are timed to coincide with voting for the European parliament. Four are in safe Labour seats in East London and Bradford, but the Liberal Democrats are expected to win Eastleigh, Hampshire, from the Conservative government. Nato and Russia Nato foreign ministers begin a two-day meeting in Istanbul to consider Moscow's request for a formal statement that would acknowledge Russia's political and military importance.

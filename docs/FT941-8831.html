			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Latin America reflects flow of funds Latin America has been benefiting over recent weeks from a general movement of institutional money out of Asia. This is clearly indicated by a 20 per cent rise in dollar terms since the start of the year, compared to an 11 per cent fall in Asia. The European markets have been hit even harder, dropping by some 20 per cent since January, although here the story has been influenced by a steep decline in Turkey. On a summary inspection, Brazil stands out as the clear leader in Latin America this year. But, says Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson in London, since last November all of the markets in the region have performed in a broadly similar manner, with rises of between 42 to 52 per cent in dollar terms. While investors have been encouraged by progress in balancing the Brazilian budget, it is still too early, says Mr Palmer, to view the country's economic difficulties as all but solved. A lot depends on whether the introduction of a new index designed to tackle inflation will make a significant impression. He takes the view that this is far from certain, especially because of the fluid political situation, with elections due later this year. Sri Lanka has been showing solid performance in south Asia, with investors attracted by its relative cheapness, compared with India. Ms Susan Murphy of Smith New Court comments that the launch of new country funds has helped.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Dollar terms                      No. of      Feb 11   % Change    % Change Market               stocks        1994  over week  on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (25)    1,105.86       -2.6       +11.2 Brazil                 (57)      373.11      +15.9       +60.3 Chile                  (25)      647.33       -6.9       +17.3 Colombia1              (11)      875.80      +11.5       +35.8 Mexico                 (70)    1,101.31       -0.3       +10.1 Peru2                  (11)      151.15       -3.8       +25.0 Venezuela3             (11)      789.94       -2.0       +33.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia China4                 (18)      127.02       +0.0       -14.9 South Korea5          (156)      127.19       -4.7        +7.6 Philippines            (18)      300.19       +1.7       -11.8 Taiwan, China6         (90)      140.59       +0.0        +4.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia India7                 (77)      134.64       +0.0       +15.6 Indonesia8             (37)      124.21       -2.9        -0.4 Malaysia              (105)      284.12       -2.9       -16.2 Pakistan9              (15)      399.72       +2.2        +0.5 Sri Lanka10             (5)      214.86       +4.2       +21.2 Thailand               (55)      397.46       -2.4       -16.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East Greece                 (25)      258.21       -4.5       +13.4 Hungary11               (5)      239.68       -7.3       +43.8 Jordan                 (13)      170.33       -1.2        +2.9 Poland12               (12)    1,109.95      +15.4       +35.7 Portugal               (25)      130.33       -0.3       +14.5 Turkey13               (40)      126.11      -23.4       -40.7 Zimbabwe14              (5)      223.60       +9.3       +10.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Local currency terms                      Feb 11    % Change     % Change Market                 1994   over week   on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina        678,586.31        -2.6        +11.2 Brazil        275,451,838.1       +27.2       +171.1 Chile              1,108.00        -7.3        +16.2 Colombia1          1,268.65       +11.5        +36.8 Mexico             1,474.92        -0.3         +9.9 Peru2                200.56        -3.8        +26.1 Venezuela3         1,977.57        -2.0        +39.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia China4              139.60         +0.0        -14.9 South Korea5        135.19         -4.6         +7.7 Philippines         394.45         +1.7        -11.2 Taiwan, China6      139.45         +0.0         +4.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia India7              148.90         +0.0        +15.6 Indonesia8          142.66         -2.9         +0.2 Malaysia            289.60         -3.1        -14.1 Pakistan9           533.26         +2.2         +1.0 Sri Lanka10         231.35         +4.7        +21.2 Thailand            401.96         -2.4        -16.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East Greece              441.81         -4.9        +14.9 Hungary11           295.02         -7.0        +46.1 Jordan              247.38         -1.2         +3.3 Poland12          1,546.89        +16.9        +40.0 Portugal            157.89         -0.5        +14.3 Turkey13          1,051.51        -22.0        -27.7 Zimbabwe14          274.98         +7.6        +28.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

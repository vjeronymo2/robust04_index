			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> When ex-sportscaster Ronald (Dutch) Reagan heads home from Washington next  week, he'll have a $100,000, one-year contract offer from KZLA-FM (93.9) and  KLAC-AM (570) to consider. The stations made the offer to the President in a  letter delivered to the White House on Thursday. "We got to talking about this  guy who used to do sports years ago in Iowa before he got sidetracked doing  movies and TV and politics for awhile," KLAC General Manager Norman Epstein  said Thursday. "I brought up the fact that he'd be out of work soon." Half a  century ago, Reagan launched his broadcast career as a play-by-play announcer  and sportscaster for WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa. Epstein said that while the  pay would be less than half Reagan's government salary, the hours would be  easier, and the station is willing to install a studio in his home. "As  President, he made $200,000, but this job isn't quite as important as that one,  so I think the offer is a fair one," he said. The White House told Epstein that  the President would make no decisions on his future employment until after  Inauguration Day, but Epstein remains optimistic.  </P></p>

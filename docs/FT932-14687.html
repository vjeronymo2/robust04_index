			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Tax adviser in court over deception totalling Pounds 330,896 THE FORMER owner of an accountancy firm and former chairman of Nottingham Forest Football Club yesterday admitted obtaining a total of Pounds 330,896 by deception. Mr Julian Baughan QC, prosecuting, said Mr Maurice Roworth, 63, from Lowdham, Nottingham, had posed as a taxation expert and offered to invest clients' money although he had no qualifications and was not registered to carry out any kind of investment business. He had started work at the Nottingham accountancy firm of White and Co as a clerk in 1949 and worked his way up to managing director, eventually owning the firm outright and conducting a tax-advice business. Birmingham Crown Court heard that through the firm he took up to Pounds 750,000 from friends and business associates, telling them he was investing their money in the Isle of Man. He used the cash to pay off personal bank overdrafts while assuring friends their money was safe. It was alleged that the deception was carried out between 1982 and 1991. He was arrested in March last year. Mr Baughan said: 'Over a nine-year period he received a total of 34 payments from clients, but none were invested in the Isle of Man or anywhere else. They all went to credit his two NatWest bank accounts and had the effect of reducing his overdrafts. 'Despite substantial payments into his bank he was still overdrawn by Pounds 450,000 at the time of his arrest and has since been declared bankrupt. There are no funds available to compensate the losers.' Mr Roworth pleaded guilty to eight specimen charges of obtaining money by deception. Flanked by two prison officers, he sat perfectly still as the prosecution outlined the case against him. He was remanded in custody to await sentence in four to six weeks, when mitigation arguments will also be heard.</p>

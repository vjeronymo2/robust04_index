The higher  bid was endorsed by the company and appeared to give the U.S. bidders an edge  in the contest against rival Isosceles PLC, a British investor group that has  bid $3.60 a share. Wasserstein Perella and West German-controlled Great  Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. offered to pay $3.70 a share for Gateway. If  successful, the deal, worth more than $3 billion, would be Europe's biggest  leveraged buyout.  </P></p>

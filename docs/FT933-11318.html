			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / US markets shrug off GDP figures: Economy grew more slowly than expected in quarter THE US economy grew far more sluggishly in the second quarter than economists had expected, but the financial markets found a silver lining to the superficially gloomy report. The Commerce Department said US gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent last quarter, after the weak 0.7 per cent growth of the opening period. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said there were encouraging signs in the report, but 'while we are clearly out of a recession, these figures reflect anaemic growth that will not produce the jobs we need'. The Commerce Department said strong rises in personal spending, business investment and exports were offset by a sharp slowdown in inventory building by businesses, which subtracted Dollars 25.3bn (Pounds 16.9bn) from growth in the second quarter, after adding Dollars 23.7bn in the first quarter. Personal consumption rose at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the second period, led by purchases of durable goods, while non-residential fixed investment rose at 13.3 per cent and exports at 6.7 per cent. This left real final sales, which exclude the inventory effect, growing at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent, after contracting at a rate of 1.2 per cent in the first quarter. 'If you look at the guts of the report, it tells you the economy is doing fine,' said Mr Bill Dudley, an economist with Goldman Sachs. 'The combination of final sales growth at 3.7 per cent and the slowdown in inventory growth is a reason to be less worried about a very sluggish number,' added Mr Jason Benderly, of Benderly Economic Associates, a Colorado research company. This interpretation of the figures sent bond prices up sharply yesterday, pushing yields to record lows, while share prices soared. At the close the Dow Jones industrial average was up 13.97 at 3,567.42. The weak GDP figure came only a week after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had confidently predicted second quarter growth would reach 2.5-3 per cent. Members of Congress were last week perturbed by Mr Greenspan's signal that the next move for US rates was likely to be upwards. However, economists said the weak overall growth figure seemed likely to delay plans to raise rates.</p>

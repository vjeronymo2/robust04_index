			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Further probe for N-waste plan PLANNERS are to seek more information from British Nuclear Fuels about the radiological and environ-mental implications of its proposal for storage facilities for nuclear waste at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. BNFL has offered Copeland Borough Council the company's first 'planning gain' deal. 'Planning gain' occurs when a developer offers to fund projects beneficial to the local community in return for permission to build. BNFL has told the council that, if allowed to build the stores, it would spend about Pounds 4m in West Cumbria on training, technological and heritage developments intended to enhance the local economy. Approval for one store was given on Tuesday at a meeting of the council. BNFL said the store was needed to house radioactive material from an encapsulated waste plant which is soon to become operational. But the meeting decided an environmental statement from BNFL did not give adequate information on the potential radiological effect on employees and surrounding communities of proposals to build further stores. Permission was sought for five stores for intermediate-level waste, three stores for boxed decommissioned waste and one store for plutonium-contaminated material. Permission to extend a waste packing plant and the store for used graphite rods was also sought. Council planners are to seek the advice of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Pollution Inspectorate before a decision is taken. The council's approval for one store means BNFL does not face any immediate problems. Any long delay in approving other stores would cause difficulties, and it says at least three further stores are needed before 2005.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Sabena confirms strike Sabena, the Belgian airline, confirmed a cabin crew strike had delayed a number of flights but denied it was limiting to 100 the number of passengers on its flights, Reuter reports from Brussels. A union official earlier said Sabena was allowing a maximum of 100 passengers on every flight for safety reasons. He said several flights were delayed by more than half an hour and one intercontinental flight was held up for almost two hours. Sabena confirmed that nine out of 113 had been delayed yesterday. The unions are protesting mainly against a cut in compensation days for intercontinental flights and fewer crew for shorter flights.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> The spraying of malathion, whether necessary or not, is a continuing hardship  to millions of Southern California residents. The confinement to our houses,  the ruining of our organic gardens, the unremunerated costs of tarpaulins and  car washings are only a few of the trials supposedly inconsiderately placed  upon us all by the governor and his agricultural specialists.  </P> <P> We are to take solace in the fact that we are sacrificing for the future of  California agriculture; this is all well and good, but we would like to know  that California agriculture appreciates our sacrifices in turn.  </P> <P> I suggest a once only drastic cut in fruit prices in our area. It should last  the entire summer and be confined to Los Angeles and Orange counties. This  would certainly prove to us all that California agribusiness sympathizes with  our plight.  </P> <P> VIRGIL B. STROHMEYER  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

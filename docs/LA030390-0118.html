			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE: NEXT: BUYER PROTECTION FOR PURCHASES BY CHECK  </P> <P> Buyer protection plans, a big hit on credit card accounts, may soon become a  popular new attraction with checking accounts as well.  </P> <P> Although the plans -- a form of insurance that will replace lost, stolen or  damaged goods purchased by check -- are nice additions, various limitations  make them not quite as sexy as they first seem.  </P> <P> Phoenix-based Valley National Bank in late January became the first savings  institution to offer such a plan, and dozens of banks are expected to follow.  Valley National's Shoppers Assurance plan, likely to become typical, will  replace certain merchandise bought by check that is damaged, lost or stolen,  for 90 days after purchase and up to $50,000 a year. The plan will also double  manufacturers' U.S. warranties, up to one additional year.  </P> <P> So if you accidentally drop and break that new crystal vase or camcorder, or  spill coffee on that new silk blouse, you'll be covered if the items were  purchased by check.  </P> <P> Similar buyer protection plans, offered to holders of American Express credit  cards and then to holders of premium Visas and MasterCards, have become so  popular and inexpensive to offer that holders of non-premium credit cards can  get them as well.  </P> <P> For checking accounts, such protection offers advantages to account holders as  well as the bank or savings and loan. For account holders, it provides  insurance protection at low or no cost; although institutions may require  higher account balances, Valley National does not charge extra fees for the  protection because the insurance costs them very little.  </P> <P> For banks and S&amp;Ls, the plans offer a strong marketing tool and could  induce account holders to maintain higher balances. "It sets us apart from  anybody else," says Steve House, the bank's vice president and advertising  manager.  </P> <P> Consequently, the plans could become one of the most popular new enhancements  to hit the checking account scene in years.  </P> <P> "This certainly adds some promotional pizazz to a bank's advertising campaign,"  says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Advertising News, a newsletter in North  Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> But before jumping for joy, you should realize that such plans -- like their  sister versions with credit cards -- carry some important limitations.  </P> <P> For one, they aren't likely to cover all purchases. Valley National's plan, for  example, excludes such items as motor vehicles, foods or other perishables, and  live animals, House says.  </P> <P> Also, the coverage will often expire by the time you'll want to make a claim;  many things don't break until after 90 days.  </P> <P> More important, the plans will cover only those losses that aren't covered by  homeowner's insurance or other policies. So if your television set and stereo  are stolen from your home, your homeowner's insurance must kick in first. And  when making a claim, you may have to prove that you've exhausted all other  sources of insurance first -- that could be a major paper work headache.  </P> <P> These plans may primarily be good to cover the deductibles on your home or auto  insurance. Indeed, the premiums that credit card issuers have paid for the  protection plans is low because only a small percentage of cardholders actually  make claims.  </P> <P> "The plans do have value, but not as much as promoted," says Robert B.  McKinley, publisher and editor of RAM Research Bankcard Update, a Frederick,  Md., service that tracks credit card services.  </P> <P> Consequently, the availability of such a plan shouldn't be the overriding  factor in picking a checking account.  </P> <P> Look first at other basics, such as interest rates, minimum balances, monthly  fees, per-check charges and other expenses.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot personally answer letters and phone calls.

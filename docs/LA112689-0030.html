			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX AND IQ  </P> <P> Joan Siegel, in her Nov. 12 letter, not only missed the message in the first  episode of television's "L.A. Law" but also misinterpreted its thrust.  </P> <P> The characters Benny and Alice were not encouraged to have children. In the  last scene, they both echoed what had been stated earlier -- they didn't think  they should have children and listed myriad reasons why.  </P> <P> The message was that care takers, even if a parent, do not have the right to  have their mentally retarded charges sterilized arbitrarily.  </P> <P> I felt that the writers did an outstanding job in showing that the father is  very caring and felt that he was acting in Alice's best interests in deciding  that she be sterilized. However, that decision was shown to be extremely  questionable at best and morally wrong.  </P> <P> I applaud "L.A. Law" for showing all aspects of what could be described as a  "delicate issue."  </P> <P> GENE YAFFEE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

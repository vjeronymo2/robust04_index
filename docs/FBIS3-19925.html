			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Two of Cyprus's Greek language dailies  on 20 March 1994 carry columns reacting to U.S. Ambassador  Richard Boucher's remarks at the Turkish Cypriot Rotary Club.    KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of the communist party AKEL  [Restorative  Party of the Working People] comments in a 175-word column on  page five entitled "Forward, Not Backward," under the general  banner "Aggressively." The writer says: "The U.S. ambassador  was right in what he said to the Turkish Cypriot Rotary Club.  This continuous recall of the past by the Turkish Cypriot  leadership and the arguments such as the one that the Greek  Cypriots seek union with Greece, or plan to exterminate the  Turkish Cypriots, is a deceitful argument to justify the policy  of division and the unacceptable status quo. The new  negotiating effort seeks the reunification of our homeland  through a federated system for the establishment of a better  future that would allow the civilized cohabitation of all its  citizens. Life goes on, though, and as sweeping changes take  place throughout the world, Cyprus cannot live in the past. For  this place to move ahead, it needs leaders with vision and  goodwill. It needs leaders who look forward, not backward."    Right-wing nationalist I MAKHI carries on page three a  150-word column entitled "No, Mr. Boucher," under the general  banner "Struggling Comments." The writer says: "Speaking in  the occupied area, U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher claimed that  the Greek Cypriots no longer see their future in their  dependence on Greece, but in their accession to the European  Union. We think that Mr. Boucher does not interpret correctly  the feelings of Cyprus' Hellenism. That is because he does not  know how much the Hellenism of this victimized place is  connected and dependent on Mother Greece. The U.S. ambassador  and his government and all other foreign diplomats and their  governments should know that this place, which has been Greek  throughout the centuries, will not, under any circumstances,  break off from the national stem. It will not betray its  origin, neither its roots nor its ideals and principles.    It will, of course, continue its efforts for the accession  of  Cyprus to the European Union, but this is a different subject.  Cyprus' bonds with Greece will never be broken because Greece is  the source of light for Cypriot Hellenism's hopes and  expectations. This Cypriot Hellenism replies to the U.S.  ambassador: No, Mr. Boucher, you have not understood correctly  the Greek Cypriot's heartbeat for Mother Greece."</p>

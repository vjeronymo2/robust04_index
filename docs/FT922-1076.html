			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Post prices frozen to year-end: Record pre-tax profit of Pounds 247m will not save PO from more competition POSTAGE PRICES for first and second class mail will be frozen until at least the end of the year as the Post Office announced a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 247m for the year to March 29. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman, said the Post Office's increased productivity and cost reductions could make it harder for the government to deregulate the market - although he made it clear he was not afraid of more competition. Sir Bryan said people had put it to him that increasing the Post Office's profitability had made it harder for potential new competitors to enter a deregulated market. Last year the government announced plans to end the Post Office's monopoly on sending letters priced under Pounds 1. A government official yesterday said: 'We are still committed to introducing more competition and will do so in the next parliament, notwithstanding the Post Office's good results.' For the first time since the government announced its decision to establish a national lottery, Sir Bryan revealed that the corporation had made a formal bid to run the lottery with another company, through its network of 20,000 Post Office counter shops. This year's Pounds 247m profit compares with a 1990-91 figure of Pounds 153m before Pounds 106m of exceptional items relating to reorganisation of Royal Mail, the letters division, and of Parcelforce, the parcels division. Group turnover for the group increased from Pounds 4.7bn to Pounds 5.1bn. Royal Mail's profits before tax and exceptional items increased from Pounds 171m to Pounds 266m. Post Office Counters' pre-tax profits fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 26m. Parcelforce continues to lose money. It made a loss of Pounds 24m, before tax and exceptional items, compared with a Pounds 75m loss in 1990-91. It shed 550 administrative jobs and closed more of the division's operational centres in a move designed to make the parcels division break even. Sir Bryan said he continued to hope that it would make a profit by next year. Mr Tom Corrigan, chairman of the Post Office Users' National Council, said: 'Parcelforce has lost Pounds 131m in the past two years and had it not been for the efforts of Royal Mail, the Post Office would clearly have failed to meet the mandatory financial targets imposed on it by government.' Sir Bryan's pay increased by 14 per cent from Pounds 149,195 to Pounds 170,471, reflecting performance-related bonuses. The annual accounts also disclosed that four other Post Office board members were paid between Pounds 135,000 and Pounds 150,000. The Post Office was again able to waive its contribution to the main employee pension fund because it was in surplus for the second year running.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The South Lake Tahoe City Council has voted to replace former council member  and mayor Terry Trupp by appointment, rather than by a special election. Trupp,  who resigned July 31 after his arrest on cocaine trafficking and money  laundering charges, is being held without bail in Sacramento County Jail. City  Council members agreed to accept applications from people interested in the  position until 5 p.m. July 28. All applicants will be interviewed and the  original list will be trimmed to a group of finalists, from which the successor  will be appointed. Trupp's council term runs through June of next year. His  tenure as mayor automatically expired at the end of last month. Trupp, 46, was  among about 20 people arrested after a 20-month investigation by federal, state  and local agents called "Operation Deep Snow."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agreement With Abu Dhabi Finalized"] </F>   [Text] Transportation Minister Viktor Klima formally  finalized the participation of Abu Dhabi's state-owned  International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) in the  Austrian Petroleum Corporation (OeMV) in Abu Dhabi at the  weekend. IPIC has bought 19.56 percent of the basic capital of  the petroleum company (2.7 billion schillings).    Beyond specific cooperation, Austria is viewed as an "ideal  partner state in Europe" by the United Arab Emirates, the  transportation minister told APA after his brief visit to Abu  Dhabi. Sales cooperation thus applies to Central Europe as a  whole. However, OeMV will continue to operate independently.    Also, there is "neither an obligation nor the intention" on  the part of the Arab partner to introduce its own gasoline brand  into Central Europe. Klima also ruled out splitting the  department responsible for natural gas deals from the concern.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: WHEN YOU HEAR THE BEEP;  </P> <P> MODERN TOOLS OF COMMUNICATION MAY SIGNAL THE END OF HUMAN CONVERSATION  </P> <P> SOME TIME AGO a reader wrote that he was in a fast-food restaurant when it  closed because the computer had broken down. None of the employees knew how to  make change.  </P> <P> Whether that actually happened, I don't know, but it is entirely possible. When  you order a cheeseburger, a Diet Pepsi and fries, the counter person taps in  the order on the computer, which not only sends the order directly to the  kitchen but also makes the correct change, to the penny, and probably goes on  to delete the items ordered from the inventory, so that the inventory is up to  date at every second.  </P> <P> Of course this technology makes the transaction faster, so why should the  customer complain? Nevertheless, something is lost. There is no time for human  contact. The counter person hardly has time to say, "Have a nice day."  </P> <P> He or she has had to make no calculations, has had to make no conversation.  Like the customer, the counter person has become merely a function of the  computers. In time, like the computer, he or she will be unable to laugh or  cry. Whether computers can actually think remains to be seen.  </P> <P> Now, I read, it has gone a step further. Instead of being labeled  "CHEESEBURGER," the proper key has a picture of a cheeseburger, making it  absolutely unnecessary for the counter person to know how to read. That is  merely the penultimate step. No doubt soon the customer will be asked to speak  his or her order into a microphone, and the computer will translate the sound.  The counter person's only function then will be to move the completed order  from the cook to the customer.  </P> <P> If anything is said at all between customer and employee, it will be limited to  "Thank you" and "Have a nice day."  </P> <P> I suppose computers are used in such situations to save money. The fewer  calculations the employee has to make, the less money he or she will have to be  paid, and the more customers can be served during a given amount of time.  </P> <P> Harold Sriro, a dentist, summarizes his recent experience: "First, I was  standing in line waiting for a clerk to ring up the sale on his megabyte  computer, so that not only was the sale being recorded, but the entire store  was probably being re-inventoried, a current profit-and-loss sheet updated and  a cash-flow summary produced. All this while we stood around cooling our heels,  wondering whatever happened to the 'grease pencil on the side of the brown  paper bag' era. That technique was accurate and fast and, if nothing else, at  least involved some continuous human mental and physical moves so that all  concerned felt they were still a part of the transaction."  </P> <P> There is no use wanting to go back to grease pencils and brown paper bags. The  computer is here to stay. Strangely, though, in what is called the era of  communication, communication is hand-led more and more by computers, and people  are communicating less.  </P> <P> We last remodeled our house at a time when use of the telephone-answering  machine was becoming widespread. Throughout the remodeling ordeal, my  contractor and I communicated almost entirely by answering machine. He would  call me and get my answering machine, and I would call him and get his  answering machine. One afternoon we actually managed to meet in person in my  living room, and we spent the entire afternoon drinking beer and becoming quite  incompetent. I think we were caught up in the emotional effect of actually  talking in person.  </P> <P> Of course, the last straw is the computerized telephone pitch, where some real  estate company calls you and gives you a computerized message. They don't even  pay you the courtesy of spending a minute of human contact on you. I wouldn't  respond to one of those messages if they offered me a free trip to the  Caribbean, no strings attached.  </P> <P> I have rather adapted to the fax machine my wife bought me for Christmas. At  first I was angry with her. It seemed too much money to spend for something I  would never use.  </P> <P> I must admit, though, that it has come in handy. Several times I have had The  Times send me copies of articles I needed. I have received copies of documents  I needed, thus saving two or three days' mailing time. Once, though, I received  an ad from a fax company. How did it know my number? If my number gets out, I'm  in real trouble.  </P> <P> Then the other day I walked into my room to see about five yards of paper that  had emerged from the machine and coiled in a mass on the floor. I scooped it up  and scanned through it. It was a complete blank. Not a word. The little status  window in the machine said "Paper empty." My worst fears were realized. It was  like hearing from a ghost.  </P> <P> Is this the age of communication or what?  </P></p>

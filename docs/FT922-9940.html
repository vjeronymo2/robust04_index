			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK and Singapore attract buyers INSTITUTIONAL buying was detected in several Pacific markets yesterday. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday and will remain shut today. HONG KONG reached another record high as strong institutional buying pushed the Hang Seng index up by 129.57 or 2.4 per cent to 5,613.78. Turnover soared to HKDollars 4.8bn from HKDollars 3.6bn. Favourable political developments in China and a half-point cut in interest rates have helped to lift prices. SINGAPORE rose on institutional buying and the Straits Times Industrial index jumped 2.3 per cent or 33.02 to 1,498.97. Volume rose to 97.1m shares from 76.7m on Thursday. Malayan Credit, the target of a hostile takeover bid, rose 4 cents to SDollars 2.22, but was still short of Cycle and Carriage's offer price of SDollars 2.25. KUALA LUMPUR also attracted institutional buying. The composite index gained 5.84 to 597.47 in volume of 34.9m shares against 39.6m. Tobacco shares were sought following a rise in cigarette prices, with Rothmans gaining 80 cents to MDollars 13. AUSTRALIA lost early gains on news of a worse-than-expected March current account deficit. But dealers remained confident that the Reserve Bank would cut rates by one point to 6.5 per cent today. The All Ordinaries index ended 0.8 lower at 1,664.4 in turnover of ADollars 165.1m. NEW ZEALAND recovered from a poor opening to close slightly higher, buoyed up by good demand for leading stocks. The NZSE 40 index rose 6.94 to 1,467.54. MANILA rose in reaction to last week's lifting of a 5 per cent import tax. The composite index rose 6.81 to 1,245.83 in combined turnover of 370.7m pesos from 301.1m pesos. TAIWAN traded in a narrow range, as the weighted index rose 6.94 to 4,539.47, in turnover of TDollars 17.3bn.</p>

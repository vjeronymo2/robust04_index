			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Hafnia turns in DKr1.65bn loss HAFNIA HOLDING, the Danish insurance-based financial services group, suffered a first quarter loss of about DKr1.65bn (Dollars 264m) and its equity capital was cut from DKr3.12bn at the end of 1991 to DKr1.45bn, the company said yesterday. The main reason for the deficit were adjustments for the value of its shareholdings in domestic rival Baltica and Sweden's Skandia. Before the adjustments, the loss came out at about DKr70m compared with a profit of DKr30m in the corresponding period last year. Following a board decision at the end of April to reject a takeover offer by Skandia, Hafnia shareholders will be asked at the annual meeting on June 2 to approve a new share issue raising about DKr1.5bn. The issue will be made in the second half of June with preferential rights for existing shareholders, who will be asked to subscribe to three new shares for every two held at a price of DKr105 per share with a par value of DKr100. The statement from the embattled group said the final results for 1992 will be crucially dependent on the price at which its Baltica and Skandia shareholdings can be sold. Hafnia has a 13.5 per cent stake in Skandia, 33.5 per cent in Baltica Holding and about 11 per cent in Baltica Insurance. These holdings could, in a favourable market, be sold at a price exceeding the quoted price, said the statement. It also said that in addition to the book value of its equity capital, there is additional goodwill value in the Danish and UK life assurance businesses and in the Danish and Swedish general insurance businesses of DKr2bn-DKr3bn.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: Minister has not dealt with many problems of contracting out Sir, May I add a few points to your balanced and thoughtful editorial on the 'Long road to Whitehall reform' (June 3), without falling into the category of 'the reservations so skilfully expressed in Whitehall'? Representing almost 80 per cent of the senior civil servants in Whitehall, the FDA welcomes minister of public service William Waldegrave's support in our campaign for greater openness which we have pursued since 1986, often in opposition to the government and Conservative backbenchers. But Mr Waldegrave did not deal with many of the serious problems underlying the contracting out of central government services. For example, the issue of impartiality. We are not told whether each part of the civil service to be contracted out will have its own 'watch-dog' body, but an enormous proliferation of such regulators can be anticipated if public confidence in impartiality is to be maintained. Or confidentiality. How will the private sector guarantee confidentiality when it is dealing with our tax affairs? How many businesses in the commercial arena want their business competitors to be fully conversant with their financial affairs? Then there is the risk of conflicts of interest. For example, a legal firm may be in difficulty when dealing with a customer in a manner which is prejudicial to the public interest, while at the same time retaining a contract for government work. Finally, at senior levels, those in the private sector are consistently very much better paid and more expensive than their civil service counterparts. Barristers' advice in the civil service costs about Pounds 60,000 a year whereas the private sector pays well over double that figure. Sadly we lack a real public debate. The contracting out of individual parts of the civil service will need no parliamentary debate, so the necessity of an independent assessment of real value for money will become vitally important. We have suggested to William Waldegrave that all tenders for contracting out work should be referred to the comptroller and auditor general. We hope our suggestion, which is designed to be helpful, will receive a fair hearing. Elizabeth Symons, general secretary, FDA, 2 Caxton Street, London SW1H 0QH</p>

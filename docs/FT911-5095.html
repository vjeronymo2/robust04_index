			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Yeltsin offers olive branch to Gorbachev MR BORIS YELTSIN, leader of the Russian Federation, said yesterday he would be prepared to work with President Mikhail Gorbachev to avoid a disaster for democracy in the Soviet Union. But at the same time, he urged Mr Gorbachev not to 'turn his back on the process started in our country six or seven years ago.' Mr Yeltsin was speaking to Socialist members of the European parliament. He was criticised by some MEPs for his apparent opposition to Mr Gorbachev, but he rejected suggestions that there was any animosity between the two men. He went on to warn that 'the right is preparing disasters for democracy (in the Soviet Union). . . We have to act to avoid that - to prevent the right from advancing - and in that struggle we are always prepared to co-operate with President Gorbachev.' The Russian leader said hardline Communists rather than Mr Gorbachev could be to blame for strikes and falling living standards. 'It isn't necessarily his fault.' Mr Yeltsin again backed the idea of 'round table' talks with all political sides, including the unions, which he said could develop into a form of coalition government.</p>

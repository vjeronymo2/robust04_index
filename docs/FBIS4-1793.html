			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of Public  Security issued a circular the other day on residence  registration of people returning home after studying abroad.    The circular notes: Since China started implementing the  policy of reform and opening up, exchanges with the outside  world have increased and more and more people are going abroad  to pursue their studies, either on government or their own  expense. This has had a positive impact in promoting domestic  economic development and advancing China's cultural, scientific,  and technological exchanges with countries of the world. To  broaden the appeal to skilled personnel and promote rational  mobility, the circular urges public security departments to  simplify procedures for people returning home from studies  abroad to file for residence registration.    The circular provides that when a person returning home from  study abroad applies to have his residence restored in the  location where he formerly kept residence registration, the  police station should, upon examining his passport, restore his  canceled residence registration. Where a person files for  residence registration with another police station within the  same city or county, the police station in the location where  the person wants to move in should accept his application after  examining his passport and a residence registration cancellation  certificate issued by the police station in the locality where  the person used to live. Where a person needs to settle down  and work in another city or county, he should -- with documents  issued by the State Education Commission and the Ministry of  Personnel -- file for residence registration with the police  station in the location where his employing unit resides. A  person who has obtained a doctoral degree, or has been assigned  to a key state project, to a state-owned large- or medium-sized  enterprise, or to remote border region where conditions are  tough, should have relevant documents issued by a personnel  department at the provincial level or higher and a certificate  on change of household registration; he may also apply for  change of residence for his family members and under-age  children. The circular also readjusts the time limit for  canceling residence registration. Students who go abroad for  studies for less than one year need only complete their exit  registration, and do not need to cancel their residence  registration.</p>

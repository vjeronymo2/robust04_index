			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Raul Gonzalez, an  expert in Peruvian terrorist violence, stressed the split in the  Shining Path is what confirms this Maoist group's "total  defeat." The expert indicated that the split in this group,  which took up arms in 1980, has been demonstrated by Shining  Path documents, some of which have been delivered to Peruvian  media.    The expert noted that according to these documents the  faction headed by Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman supports  Guzman's peace talks with the government, whereas another  faction rejects them and declares it will pursue the Shining  Path war against Peruvian democracy.    Gonzalez said Shining Path had experienced hard military  blows in the past two years, after Guzman's capture, "but was  able to resist and remain active thanks to its main political  capital, namely party unity." The expert emphasized: "The  Shining Path was monolithic while it kept this unity. Therefore,  the Shining Path split, from a political viewpoint, may be  comparable to Guzman's capture from a military viewpoint." He  added: "The organization created by Abimael Guzman has not been  entirely quashed. Nevertheless, after its split, Shining Path  has experienced its worst political reversal and is going  through a situation of overall defeat."    Today, the opposition newspaper LA REPUBLICA published a  police report that confirms the group's split. The newspaper  reports that the faction opposing Guzman held a meeting in March  in the Huanta Province mountains in southern Peru. During the  meeting, this faction agreed to disregard Guzman's peace  proposal.    The report also indicates that during this meeting a new  Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this  "central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who  remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as  "traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old  revisionists." According to the report, the new "committee" is  headed by Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias  "Comrade Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders.    Today, former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining  Path activities, stressed that "Shining Path no longer  represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type  of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army]  in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain."  Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the terrorist  organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social processes  that have been brewing for so long may not end overnight, and  some time is required for their extinction."</p>

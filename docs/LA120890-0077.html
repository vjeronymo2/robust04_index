			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> IS CENTER STRAWBERRY'S FIELD?  </P> <P> The exchange centered on the ability of Darryl Strawberry to play center field  and was the liveliest of baseball's winter meetings.  </P> <P> Bud Harrelson, the New York Mets' manager, and Joe McIlvaine, the former vice  president of the Mets and now general manager of the San Diego Padres,  expressed doubt. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda supported the concept and did it  with some emotion.  </P> <P> The bottom line was that despite Lasorda's defense and the Dodgers' desire to  test the offensive potential of an outfield that would have Kal Daniels in  left, Strawberry in center and Hubie Brooks in right, it is known that the club  is shopping Daniels for a pitcher and/or a second baseman.  </P> <P> The departure of Daniels would put Strawberry back at his natural position in  right field, move Brooks to left and leave Stan Javier or a player still to be  acquired in center.  </P> <P> As for stationing former Met Strawberry in center, a top Dodger scout who  demanded anonymity said: "It's a last resort."  </P> <P> Said Harrelson: "I'll believe it when I see it. I still don't believe he's  going to be their center fielder. That's a position where you better get a good  jump all the time. If you have a weakness, it'll show up real fast there.  </P> <P> "I mean, wanting it is one thing, doing it another. Darryl doesn't get a good  jump. He's more suited to right field."  </P> <P> Lasorda tried to digest the statements, then said: "Does Bud Harrelson know  everything there is to know about baseball? Is he willing to stake his  reputation on all that?  </P> <P> "It's like when we were converting Bill Russell from center field to shortstop.  Five or six scouts told me he would never play shortstop in the big leagues.  Hell, all he did is play it for 17 years.  </P> <P> "I mean, I agree. Darryl is a better right fielder, but that's only because  it's what he's been playing. I can't say he's going to be a good center  fielder, but we're going to find out."  </P> <P> Lasorda outlined a rigid spring training plan for Strawberry and said it is  often forgotten that center field is the easiest outfield position because the  ball isn't hooking and slicing and is easier to see coming off the bat.  </P> <P> "If Bud Harrelson is an authority on center field, he should have mentioned  that," Lasorda said.  </P> <P> McIlvaine pointed out that Mark Carreon of the Mets made the switch from left  field to center and was suddenly an improved player.  </P> <P> "You see the ball much better there," McIlvaine said, "but where Darryl is weak  is in his positioning. He doesn't study hitters and position himself  accordingly. He's going to need help there.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, he has the range, the speed and he certainly can reach. He played  center field for us in the minors after he signed in 1980 and '81, but he  hasn't been there in a long time. He needs to take a hundred fly balls a day."  </P> <P> Does he have that kind of work ethic?  </P> <P> "Depends what day it is," McIlvaine said. "Some yes, some no."  </P> <P> Make of It What You Will Dept.: The Toronto Blue Jays, who tap into the  Dominican market maybe more than any other team, seem to be moving in another  direction. Sixteen of the last 24 players they have traded, released or allowed  to leave as free agents are Dominicans.  </P> <P> A feud is flowering between the American League and the National League  regarding expansion income, and the ultimate pawn may be Florida.  </P> <P> There is growing speculation that the NL, which will add two teams in 1993,  wants to put both in Florida -- the choices being St. Petersburg and Miami.  </P> <P> Any National League move, however, needs at least majority approval by American  League owners, and the AL is unlikely to hand over that booming state without  the NL sharing the $190 million -- $95 million per new team -- in expansion  fees.  </P> <P> The AL first proposed supplying half of the expansion players for half of the  expansion income. It has since reduced the proposal by a half, but according to  NL expansion committee chairman Douglas Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the  NL is adamantly against sharing any revenue with the AL.  </P> <P> American League President Bobby Brown argued that when his league expanded in  1977 it provided the NL with 1/26th of the expansion income, even though the NL  did not contribute any players.  </P> <P> He said there was also a gentlemen's agreement that the NL would share income  when it next expanded.  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent may have to resolve the current conflict, Brown said.  In the meantime, the NL is expected to announce a "short list" of prospective  owners and cities before Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs, having invested more than $20 million in free agents Danny  Jackson and George Bell, must now attempt to re-sign shortstop Shawon Dunston,  who is eligible for free agency after the 1991 season.  </P> <P> "I'm gone. . . . How are they going to pay $30 million for the three of us?"  Dunston asked reporters in Chicago, meaning he thinks the Cubs will trade him.  </P> <P> The Cub payroll also includes the following 1991 commitments: $3.3 million to  Andre Dawson, $2.2 million to Ryne Sandberg and $2 million to Rick Sutcliffe.  </P> <P> Said deputy commissioner Steve Greenberg: "The current system is a prescription  for disaster. Whether it's around the corner or 10 years ahead, I don't know."  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner may be gone, but confusion continues to grip the New York  Yankees' front office. Who's in charge? New Managing Partner Robert  Nederlander? General Manager Gene Michael? Director of baseball operations  George Bradley?  </P> <P> Agent Bill Goodstein said he was shuffled from one to the other and back in a  futile attempt to have the Yankees negotiate on re-signing reliever Dave  Righetti, who ultimately agreed to a four-year, $10-million contract with the  San Francisco Giants on the same day that the Yankees were agreeing to extend  the contract of second baseman Steve Sax for four years and $12.4 million.  </P> <P> Reflecting on those seemingly conflicting Yankee decisions as he prepared to  leave the winter meetings, Michael had a similar response to each. "I'm not  sure we did the right thing," he said.  </P> <P> Said Bradley, who negotiated the Sax contract with little or no input from  Michael: "Steve wanted to remain a Yankee, and we decided we wanted to keep  him. The market is going to escalate way out of proportion. While the contract  may appear a little high now, it won't later. His leverage was not that good,  but we escape arbitration (after the '91 season) this way."  </P> <P> Asked why some of that money couldn't have gone to Righetti, Bradley said:  "There was no tie-in between the two. It's just an organizational policy not to  go more than three years for a pitcher."  </P> <P> That, of course, may make it impossible for the Yankees to stay in the bidding  for free-agent pitcher Bob Welch, who is already said to have received  four-year offers from the Chicago White Sox, Boston and Oakland.  </P> <P> Attorney Dick Moss said Giant President Al Rosen "panicked" and overreacted to  Brett Butler's four-year, $15-million contract request.  </P> <P> Rosen pointed Butler toward the door and promptly signed free agent Willie  McGee to replace him at $13 million for four years.  </P> <P> Moss said he had only one conversation with Rosen and never received the chance  to amend the opening proposal.  </P> <P> "I've never known Al to react like that," Moss said. "I think it's obvious that  he had no intention of re-signing Brett, that he wanted to sign Willie McGee  all along."  </P></p>

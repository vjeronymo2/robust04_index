			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Prince may sell Citicorp shares PRINCE Alwaleed Bin Talal, the largest individual shareholder in Citicorp, has said he might sell up to 12.8m shares in the bank over the next three months, agencies report. The plan, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, comes two years after the Saudi Arabian businessman made a Dollars 590m injection into Citicorp, the largest US commercial bank. Before the capital injection, Prince Alwaleed had accumulated a significant stake via market share purchases. He is likely to show a healthy profit on his investment, since Citicorp's share price has more than doubled since the injection.</p>

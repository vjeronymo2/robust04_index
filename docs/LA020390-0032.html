			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICY ON CHINA  </P> <P> I don't know about you, but I was outraged when Bush called the country's  indignation over his veto of the bill that will allow Chinese students to  remain in this country after their visas expire "overly emotional." Considering  the fact that his brother is employed at the New York firm which is selling  millions of dollars in communications satellites to the totalitarian  authorities there, one wonders if the President considers greed to be a better  emotion.  </P> <P> After the slaughter in Tian An Men Square, Mr. "Kinder Gentler" Bush pledged to  stand behind the people who stood in front of the tanks. Obviously, he forgot  to tell them that behind his own back he carries a gun; and that it's the same  one the Chinese authorities have used to kill the other students who dared  speak up for their freedom.  </P> <P> CHRISTY SCHULLER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Mexico stock market surges Mexico's stock market has surged by 14.9 per cent over the past two weeks, with investors increasingly confident that the ruling party will win a comfortable and transparent victory in the August 21 presidential election, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The main index has climbed from 2301 on July 22 to 2643 at Friday's close. The market has recovered all of its peso losses of the year, although is still slightly down in dollar terms. It is now trading at about 12.8 times 1995 projected earnings, according to Baring Securities. Investors have been reassured by a stream of national opinion polls that show the Institutional Revolutionary Party at least 15 percentage points ahead of the centre-right opposition. Mr Vicente Licona, who runs the reputable polling agency Indemec/Louis Harris reckons the PRI will obtain between 52 per cent and 45 per cent in the vote on election day, against 37 per cent to 28 per cent for the opposition National Action Party. The expectation that the governing party will win the election has led to a sharp fall in interest rates in recent weeks, which should stimulate economic growth. Last Wednesday 28-day interest rates fell to 15.8 per cent, against 17.66 per cent on July 20. Over the same period the peso has strengthened against the dollar and is below the trading limit. Second-quarter results turned out to be better than generally expected, giving the market a further fillip. Baring Securities calculates that operating profits of the 42 companies it tracks grew by an average of 16 per cent in the second quarter against 12 per cent in the first. Real sales were up by 8 per cent in the second quarter against 6 per cent in the first quarter.</p>

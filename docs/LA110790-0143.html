			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> VASQUEZ TO BE GUEST IN FRENCH PROGRAM  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez leaves Friday for an all-expense-paid  trip to France, where he will spend two weeks, courtesy of the French  government, participating in a new cultural exchange program.  </P> <P> Vasquez is one of no more than 10 Americans who will participate in France's  Invitational Cultural Exchange Programme, begun last year.  </P> <P> Participants are chosen because they "show promise of a brilliant future" in  their careers within their own countries, according to the French Consulate.  </P> <P> Vasquez chose his own subjects to study while in France: local and regional  government, public transit, national health care and environmental policies.  </P> <P> He said he expects to gain "invaluable insight into French custom and  governmental operations."  </P> <P> The French government began the program to teach Americans about France "beyond  the traditional cliches," according to the consulate.  </P> <P> Vasquez will meet with Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, a senator and the son of the  former French President Charles de Gaulle.  </P></p>

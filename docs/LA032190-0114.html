			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> OIL COMPANIES MUST FOLLOW STRICTER CODE  </P> <P> Moving to de-emphasize the city's image as an oil town, the Huntington Beach  City Council this week adopted a new oil and gas production code with new  environmental and aesthetic requirements.  </P> <P> The code changes, approved unanimously, are intended to improve oil companies'  accident response and prevention procedures, improve the appearance of oil  fields and wells, and speed the removal of aging wells.  </P> <P> The move represents the latest effort to make Huntington Beach "more of a  residential community and less of an oil town," Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. Green  said.  </P> <P> Under the new code, oil companies will be required to eliminate old wells  producing less than 90 barrels every three months, rather than the current  minimum standard of 20 barrels.  </P> <P> "If the wells are going to be out there, we want them producing," said Mark  Bodenbender, the city's oil field specialist. "We don't want a situation where  there is just a well on the land and they're letting it go."  </P> <P> The changes, devised by a committee of city staff and oil-industry officials,  also include a ban on future use of internal-combustion motor engines to power  oil pumps near developed areas. They are to be replaced by electric pumps,  which are quieter and non-polluting.  </P> <P> Other code changes include requiring more landscaping and fencing around oil  wells and additional steps to improve appearances and prevent pollution.

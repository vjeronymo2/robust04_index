			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: A TASTE OF 'GOOD OLD DAYS'  </P> <P> Just imagine for a moment that each of you has a time capsule attached to your  body. Contained within it is a memory of something that reflects the world in  which you lived, something you want to remember. What do you think it would be?  </P> <P> According to a limited, non-scientific sampling of readers throughout the  years, the answer is "food." Man's fondest memories have revolved around it.  How it tasted. How it smelled. It has been the one thing that has changed the  most dramatically.  </P> <P> The slightest mention of the "good old days" (30 years prior to wherever you  are now) triggers stories of "juicy white corn on the cob with butter dripping  off your elbow" . . . "sweet strawberries as big as your fist" . . . and those  wonderful tender fryers that tasted like real chicken.  </P> <P> Roy Anderson of Tularosa, N.M., asks, "Why is it all a memory?" Specifically,  he remembers watermelons (some weighing more than 50 pounds) being chilled in  the ice house, awaiting the next day when the knife would reveal deep ravines  of red, dotted with black seeds for spitting. "Watermelons are not bred for  flavor anymore. They are bred for shipping. The test is to throw a ripe melon  to the ground from the roof of the barn. If it bounces without breaking the  skin, save the seeds!  </P> <P> "Opening a watermelon today is about like getting at a coconut that has just  fallen from the tree," he complains. "One needs a heavy-duty knife. (A machete  is adequate.) Lay the edge of the blade to the melon and rap soundly on the  backside of the knife with a four-pound hammer. If a crack appears in the  melon, insert a log-splitting wedge and whack again. The last two melons we  bought at the grocery had the consistency of winter squash, the color of  chicken lungs and tasted like cucumbers. We took them next door and gave them  to the neighbor's chickens."  </P> <P> I have to agree. I don't remember my mother's chicken dressed in a caftan of  fat that you could peel off in one piece. Or fresh peaches that taste a lot  like the back of a postage stamp.  </P> <P> Food today is like a highway under construction: You travel at your own risk.  Add some oats, take out the salt, lower the fat, compress the nutrients, spray  for disease, inject for longevity, corral the calories, remove the seeds, alter  the color, and slap a label on it to let people know what it is supposed to be.  Dispensing food is a matter of keeping it alive long enough to execute it. It's  downright inhumane.  </P> <P> There's a lot that was bad about the "good old days." No one denies that. But  I'd trade the beeper, the electric salad shooter, the stress tapes, the  electric gum massager and my bifocal mirror for one large beefsteak tomato that  oozes flavor and runs down your chin when you bite into it.  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ready for some tough pounding - Ralph Atkins begins a series, continued on Monday, which looks at options for departments in the firing line / Public Spending Review THE normally-unflapp-able Tory MP from a south coast seat was worried as he stood in the Commons' lobby. A flood of letters was bound to come from his many elderly constituents wanting reassurance about the basic state pension. What was he to tell them? The answer is not simple. The government has started the most fundamental review of public spending for a decade. The unthinkable will be thought in a bid to stem the inexorable rise of public borrowing. Beyond manifesto commitments for this parliament, nothing can be guaranteed. But to many Conservative MPs, the idea of fighting the next election apparently prepared to dismantle the welfare state is inconceivable. In its mechanics, the review differs little from the annual public expenditure round. It will deploy the same Treasury officials who monitor each department for the annual public expenditure. At the departments it will be finance divisions, perhaps reinforced with extra personnel, who will respond. There is no Royal Commission, official inquiry, or even task force. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury and the review's architect, has already held bilateral talks at three out of the four departments subject to review first - Mrs Virginia Bottomley, at the health department, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr John Patten, education secretary. He will meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, soon. Further bilaterals are likely, particularly as summer approaches and the first results are expected. Rather than taking existing spending programmes and deciding which will rise or fall, each item of spending will be studied to see whether it should be the state's responsibility, if waste can be squeezed or the private sector brought in. Ideas will come from departmental policy divisions and ministers  -but also crucially from outsiders. So far, Mr Portillo has made only a tentative start. He had not expected to make an announcement so soon. Monday's Commons statement was brought forward because of the press speculation about its scope. Cabinet ministers had to be briefed hurriedly over the weekend. To be truly radical, traditional Whitehall culture needs to be reversed. Spending departments usually defend programmes. The Treasury, if offered an inch, generally looks for a mile. Free-thinking could become constrained by the need to plan tactics. Mr Lilley and Mr Portillo are politically like-minded, unafraid of turning large parts of the state's responsibilities over to the private sector. But the three others are closer to Mr John Major's social market Conservatism. None will resist Mr Portillo's overtures and all will welcome the search for efficiency savings or more private sector involvement. But Mr Clarke is a political bruiser who will give ground slowly to the Treasury. Mr Patten and Mrs Bottomley believe in excellence in state schools and hospitals. The Conservative 1992 manifesto tied the government to annual increases in 'the level of real resources committed to the NHS' and to savings through greater efficiency being ploughed back into the service. Around Westminster, there is no shortage of ideas or strong words on scrutinising public spending but less appreciation of current political realities - that the government has a majority of just 21, is already wrestling with internal strife over coal, Maastricht and short-term economic policy. Economic recovery could rapidly dissipate any sense of urgency and temper future manifesto pledges. No specific target has been set for cutting expenditure. So Mr Portillo is right to emphasise that it is a long term review. His hopes are to start a debate - fuelled by fears over excessive borrowing and tax rises - about Conservative priorities in the next century. But tangible results, in terms of agreement on changes, are far off. Mrs Judith Chaplin, MP for Newbury and John Major's former political secretary, says: 'The whole point of such a review, which is going to take a long time, is that it can look at all aspects of the problem and decide whether money is being spent in the way that most benefits whoever you are trying to help. 'If you do that, then it is perfectly possible to get agreement within the party.'</p>

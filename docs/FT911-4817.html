			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: The real thing returns to India  -Gita Piramel on Coca-Cola's move into a market of 860m consumers For parched Coca-Cola aficionados in India deprived of the real thing, happy days may be on the horizon. Talks aimed at reintroducing the fizzy drink into India are under way between Coke and Britannia Brands, an Asia-Pacific snack food processor with annual sales of Dollars 400m. 'Yes, it is true that talks are going on, but it is too early to make a comment,' said Mr Rajan Pillai, UK-based head of Britannia Brands. His reluctance to talk to the media is understandable given the project's political sensitivity. In fact, this is the US group's third recent attempt to get back to a market it walked away from in 1977 following an Indian requirement that most foreign companies reduce their equity holdings in subsidiaries to 40 per cent. Both Coke and IBM immediately pulled out of India. But since PepsiCo, Coke's rival, acquired a toehold in India, one of the fastest growing soft drink markets in the world, Coke quickly modified its scruples. At the time Coke 20m cases. Last year, sales bubbled up to more than 110m cases, according to industry specialists. To breach the heavily-fortified market, the US multinational shopped around for allies. Once it became known that Coke was looking out for an Indian partner, a fiery fight broke out among local businessmen. Godrej (India's biggest privately-controlled business house), Parle (the biggest soft drink manufacturer with 70 per cent of the local market) and Pure Drinks (Coke's pre-1977 distributor) were among the keenest contenders. It appears that Mr Pillai won on two points: his contacts in Delhi's political corridors; and Britannia's far-flung snack food empire with manufacturing facilities in six Asian and Pacific countries. Britannia, in fact, is probably a rare Indian group which can tailor its application in line with Indian government regulations with their heavy export commitment clauses. In return for permission to bottle and sell Coke in India, Mr Pillai has guaranteed export sales of Rs8bn (Dollars 400m) spread over 10 years. This will be done by moving an extruded potato crisp plant from Singapore to India, probably in a high priority-investment area in Maharashtra. 'This plant is already selling Rs300m worth of crisps worldwide. So we are offering real production and sure exports, not pie in the sky,' said Mr Pillai. However, it may be some time before Coke arrives on the shelves of Indian stores. With Indian elections scheduled for May 23, neither businessmen, politicians nor bureaucrats want to pick up more hot potatoes than they have to. Even if and when production starts, success is shaky. Its been a long time - more than 13 years - since the Indian population of 860m had access to Coke. Now there is a whole new generation bred on the taste of rival brands. Can Coke's world-famous brand wean the new jean generation away from the highly popular Indian brands? Going by Pepsi's latest experience (in a venture with the Tatas and the Punjab state government, the company launched Lehar-Pepsi across India last year), this is going to be a big problem for foreign colas. Last month PepsiCo's Indian operation reported a 1990 loss of Rs130m. Nonetheless, the Indian soft drinks market is worth Rs10bn a year and is growing.</p>

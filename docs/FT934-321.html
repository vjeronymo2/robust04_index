			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Flotations reach a five-year record Activity in the new issues market in 1993 reached a five-year high with 165 flotations, according to KPMG Corporate Finance. The 165 total falls some 22 short of the level reached in 1988, which itself saw slightly fewer than in the previous two years. However, this year's flotations have raised the largest amount of new capital at Pounds 5.1bn since KPMG's records began in 1984. KPMG, which worked on 33 flotations in 1993, said 70 companies floated in 1992. Its figures exclude privatisations. The flood of flotations, more than 40 per cent of which fell in the fourth quarter of 1993, has prompted some concern. The fear is that the UK's soaring equity market has attracted some less-than-likely 'wannabe' public companies. The most chilling tale to emerge from the new issues market this year is that of a new and used car dealership called Swithland Group, which last month collapsed into receivership less than two weeks after its bid to float was thwarted by prescient City worries about its soundness. Others issued profits warnings within months of floating. Drew Scientific, for example, the diagnostic medical kits maker, floated in May and warned of losses less than six months later in October. Holliday Chemicals, the industrial dyes and specialty chemicals maker, floated in March. In November it issued a warning about profits for the full year, following a slight drop in the interim figures. The sheer volume of new stock has forced investors to become highly selective, leaving some issues to flail in lacklustre demand. Some companies saw their share prices slip to a discount to the issue prices in early trading. Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator is one example. Lilliput Group, the maker of hand-painted miniature ornamental cottages, is another - it floated at 135p in November but closed at 115p on Christmas Eve. 'In general companies coming to the market are much better prepared and set up for life as public companies than was the case in the late 1980s,' says Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG Corporate Finance. He expects the new issues market to remain strong in 1994.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / ABC owner joins Spielberg group in TV studio venture Capital Cities/ABC, owner of the US television network ABC, is to join forces with the newly formed Hollywood trio of Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen to create a TV studio. The joint venture, in which the two sides will initially invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 60.9m) apiece, aims to produce and syndicate a broad range of TV programmes. The venture puts ABC in the vanguard of a general move by the US TV networks into producing their own material, from which they were largely barred by government regulation until last year. It is also expected to increase the level of competition with the Hollywood studios, some of which plan to set up their own TV networks in retaliation. The partnership between the film maker Steven Spielberg, former Disney production chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and the recording impresario David Geffen was set up in October to produce films, music, cartoons and interactive entertainment as well as TV programmes. The trio's original intention to strike a deal with the Hollywood studio MCA has been thwarted by uncertainties over the relationship between MCA and its parent, Matsushita of Japan. Mr Katzenberg, whose recent resignation from Walt Disney was seen as a blow to the company, said: 'As the entertainment industry looks to the future, it is clear that one of the most important considerations will be the ever-evolving relationship between the Hollywood studios and the broadcast community. When David, Steven and I formed our company, one of our initial goals was to build a strategic alliance with a broadcast power.' An ABC executive said the initial Dollars 200m investment was merely a start-up figure. 'If it is working well and needs more, we'll be willing to invest more,' she said. While ABC had invested in its own production facilities and in other joint projects, this would be its largest production venture. The partners said the new venture would produce programmes for TV networks and cable TV, and would also syndicate its material. Under government regulation, the US networks are barred from domestic syndication until November 1995, although they are permitted to syndicate abroad. Mr Spielberg said later that the first programmes from the venture would appear in the second half of next year. The studio will be managed as a separate entity, with operations controlled by a senior executive yet to be appointed. All parties are committed for seven years. The venture illustrates a growing trend in the US whereby the explosion in communications media has created a large appetite for entertainment material. Lex, Page 22</p>

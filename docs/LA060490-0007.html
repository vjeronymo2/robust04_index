			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIL BUSH  </P> <P> In response to "Bush's Son Defends Role at S &amp; L," front page, May 24:  </P> <P> Neil Bush is a chip off the old block. His responses to congressional committee  questions set a new family standard for rhetorical obfuscation.  </P> <P> Q: How do you explain the gift of $100,000 from Kenneth Good? A: It wasn't a  gift. It was a loan "that was never meant to be repaid."  </P> <P> Q: Why is that not a conflict of interest? A: "It just isn't."  </P> <P> Q: Did you have any financial interest in any of Bill Walters' business? A: No.  "He was a partner in my business, but I wasn't a partner in any of his  businesses."  </P> <P> Q: Why did you not mention the loan from Kenneth Good on a conflict-of-interest  form required of directors? A: Because "it sounds a little fishy."  </P> <P> Read my lips, Neil. It smells a little fishy too.  </P> <P> HERBERT L. WEINBERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO DECIDE THE BATTLE OF SYLVAN FRYMAN CANYON  </P> <P> Seen from an overlook on Mulholland Drive, Fryman Canyon appears as a small  island of green amid a vast sprawl of single-family homes and asphalt streets.  But the solitude that can be found in the steep ravine belies its location in  the heart of a crowded city.  </P> <P> The contradiction helps explain why this narrow slice of land has become the  focus of an unusually heated battle between developer Fred Sahadi, who plans to  build 26 luxury homes in Fryman Canyon, and neighboring residents, who want it  preserved in its natural state.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to vote today on whether half of the  canyon's 63 acres should be declared a city landmark, a designation that could  halt construction for a year and lower the value of the land.  </P> <P> Sahadi argues that the land is not worthy of cultural-historic monument status  because there is nothing that distinguishes it from other undeveloped land in  the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> "I think all the Santa Monica Mountains are special," the San Jose-based  developer said. "I believe it with every ounce of everything in me. It's an  incredibly beautiful mountain range, but putting 26 more homes on 63 acres does  not in any way defile the land or compromise the beauty."  </P> <P> Canyon users counter that the tiny ravine has a long history of offering easy  refuge from the chaos of urban life, and thus qualifies for cultural landmark  status.  </P> <P> "What makes it so nice is that you feel like you are out of the city  completely," said Eric McFadden, 34, an attorney who lives in Laurel Canyon and  jogs on the wooded trail every day.  </P> <P> While the debate over Fryman Canyon has engaged a predictable cast of  developers, residents, environmentalists and politicians, the land itself  offers important testimony -- both for and against its preservation.  </P> <P> It takes 30 minutes to walk down the canyon from the Mulholland overlook to the  housing tract nestled below. Hikers follow a wooded, zig-zagging trail down the  steep side of the hill, then go through a narrow poison oak-filled gully to a  dark forest.  </P> <P> The deep, sheltered ravine is packed with a wide variety of plant life, and  early morning joggers say they encounter deer, coyotes, rattlesnakes,  squirrels, rabbits and lizards along the trail.  </P> <P> "It's the only place in the whole big city where you feel close to nature,"  said Abbie Jaye, 30, of Sherman Oaks, who brings her two dogs to the canyon  every day.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley below the canyon is blocked from view by California  walnut trees and expansive bushes as high as 12 feet. The growth forms a  protective canopy, sheltering hikers from the sun; in other places, the trees  cluster so tightly that they seem to form a natural wall.  </P> <P> Yet, reminders of the city are never far away. Ten minutes down the canyon  trail, a stream intersects. There, six cars are half-buried in dirt and leaves,  decaying and covered with graffiti.  </P> <P> Authorities say the rusting vehicles -- some so badly deteriorated that their  original colors cannot be determined -- were probably stolen, stripped for  parts, then pushed into the canyon from Mulholland. Beer bottles, cups and auto  parts litter the spot.  </P> <P> The ravine also acts as an echo chamber, amplifying sounds from the residential  neighborhood below and construction projects above. On a recent morning, the  canyon reverberated with the sounds of a bulldozer, a gardener's leaf-blower, a  crying child and the drone of an ascending airplane.  </P> <P> Intermingled with the urban noise, though, the astute listener can discern bird  calls, the rustle of leaves in the wind, even the gurgle of water trickling  over rocks.  </P> <P> In an effort to save their haven, canyon users have waged a fierce campaign in  the boardrooms of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the chambers of  City Hall. In May, a coalition of environmentalists and area residents  persuaded the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission to declare half the site  a city cultural monument, a designation which the City Council is scheduled to  consider today.  </P> <P> Since then, Sahadi has said he would sell the property for a park. A week ago,  the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy voted to offer $8.7 million to purchase  it.  </P> <P> But Sahadi estimates that the land -- in Studio City just west of Laurel Canyon  -- is worth about $13.7 million, forcing city officials to scurry to locate  funds to supplement the conservancy's offer for the prime real estate. As of  late Monday, they still were looking for a source of the extra $5 million.  </P> <P> "Let them pay for it if they want it," Sahadi said.  </P> <P> "It's pure economics. We've spent a whole lot of money earning the right to  develop it."  </P> <P> If Sahadi is allowed to build, his houses will occupy about half the canyon  toward the bottom and will not effect the hiking trail. The houses, however,  would interfere with one of the ravine's most popular features -- a sliver of a  brook that cuts down through the canyon.  </P> <P> The hiker who wants to follow the noise of the brook must branch off the trail  and follow a narrow little gully, which leads down to the bottom of the canyon  to the oak forest -- and houses -- below.  </P> <P> The brook seems to carry barely as much as a garden hose at full volume. But  slated for destruction by the housing project, the brook has become the subject  of intense debate.  </P> <P> Environmentalists say the water is a perennial stream -- a permanent stream  that is protected state law -- and have appealed to the state Department of  Fish and Game to save it. Sahadi says the highly touted "stream" is merely  runoff from the residential neighborhoods above the canyon.  </P> <P> As water slides down the stair-like rock formations and settles in stagnant  pools, it is difficult to tell whether it springs from the earth or is backwash  from a swimming pool. What is obvious is that the water nourishes lots of trees  and plants. And bugs.  </P> <P> It is difficult climb down the gully, which is about 10 feet wide at some  points but narrows to less than three feet at others.  </P> <P> Even while heat and smog suffocate the San Fernando Valley, the gully -- shaded  by ash, oak, and Sycamore trees -- is cool. The air smells sweet and fresh,  like the air inside a plant-filled greenhouse.  </P> <P> Finally, the walls of the gully flatten out and the stream abruptly disappears  underground, where it nurtures a dark grove of century-old oak trees.  </P> <P> Alan Teel, one of the members of the Urban Wilderness Coalition, the group that  has taken the lead in trying to protect the canyon, fears that even if the  canyon survives, the quiet of the land could be destroyed by new waves of  visitors.  </P> <P> "One of the best parts about it now is that you can really not run into anyone  there," Teel said. "But if our dreams our realized, from the publicity it will  get, a lot more people will start to go."  </P></p>

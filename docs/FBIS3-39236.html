These old  rituals are not the right answers to high German unemployment.  Despite the 3 million jobs that were created in the old laender  in the course of the 1980's, all of Germany is now some 5  million competitive jobs short, the chancellor admitted at the  beginning of a two-day forum on Germany as economic center in  Petersberg near Bonn. In his address to eminent business and  trade union representatives, who are participating in the forum  that has been sponsored by the Economics Ministry, Kohl demanded  that, in their negotiations, both sides of industry are focusing  more strongly on the objective of jobs than in the past.    The conclusion of the agreement in the chemical industry is  a  right signal, Kohl said. Flexible corridors for working hours  and special initial wages were taking the differing  effectiveness of enterprises and employees into account. This  would make the new employment of people easier, the chancellor  noted. This example should be copied by other industries. The  forum on Germany as industrial center was basically intended to  deal with securing Germany's future, particularly the people's  readiness to change their way of thinking, and also to  facilitate the transformation process in the new laender. Kohl  called for "general inventory of our society." The recession  has bottomed out. It is not least the machine construction  industry that signals the beginning of an upswing that is  sustained by exports.    Kohl strongly appealed to the members of the mediating  committee to reach an acceptable solution for nursing care  insurance now. Even now, there are as many as 1.8 million acute  cases of people that need nursing, which emphasizes the  increasing urgency of such an insurance. Despite all  differences of opinion regarding the details of the insurance,  the Federal Government continues to reject any increase of the  burden for the enterprises.    The forum is to continue on the basis of working groups,  with  special emphasis being placed on the reduction of bureaucracy  and privatization, labor and social affairs, finances and taxes,  and research and education. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt,  of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], intends to  present the results of the closed meeting at a news conference  on Wednesday.</p>

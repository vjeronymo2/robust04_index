			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Prison staff face ban on jobs action THE GOVERNMENT plans to raise the stakes in a confrontation with the Prison Officers' Association today by seeking a High Court injunction banning the traditionally militant union from taking industrial action. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that as prison officers hold the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract is outside employment law. If the court endorses this view the union will be prevented from taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management. A ballot of the union's members approved action short of an all-out strike over the government's market testing programme, which will extend private management. The union is also protesting over the transfer of work to support staff, as well as prison violence and overcrowding. Industrial action started last week. There has been little disruption of the service so far but the union plans to refuse to accept most new admissions to prisons on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000 prisoners having to be held in police cells as an emergency measure. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, said the action could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice system and law and order'. The home secretary will seek the injunction this afternoon unless the union executive calls off the proposed disruption by midday. This appears unlikely, however. Mr Lewis said prison officers shared some rights of detention with police officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice, this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by the act, and the union did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment, Mr Lewis said. The union's leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr John Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'.</p>

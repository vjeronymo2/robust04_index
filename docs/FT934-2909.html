			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Little enthusiasm for Mr Delors' big idea - FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels Mr Jacques Delors' idea of pulling Europe out of recession with large borrowings to finance infrastructure projects yesterday turned out to have the firepower of a damp squib. If Mr Delors banked on heads of government giving his financing plan the go-ahead before it had been properly examined by their finance ministers, then the gamble clearly failed. He seems to have underestimated the desire of many governments to show the financial markets that they are exercising the utmost fiscal rectitude in reducing their big budget deficits. Mr Delors' borrowing proposals were yesterday backed by France, Denmark, Spain and Portugal, but Germany, the Netherlands and the UK all voiced objections. Italy - which is making an exceptional effort to promote budgetary rigour after decades of overspending - offered less than wholehearted endorsement of the financing plan, even though an Italian spokesman gave the overall White Paper an effusive welcome. Britain's well-advertised opposition to the plan for extra borrowing was if anything toned down. In view of Germany's political and financial weight, of far greater importance than Mr Major's reaction was the German move to cast doubt on the EU borrowing plan. At the opening session of the summit, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was careful not to reject outright the idea of extra borrowing for 'trans-European networks'  -above all, transport and energy projects. He did, however, voice doubts about the suggested mechanism under which the EU would issue Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a year in 'Union Bonds'. Mr Kohl suggested that the EU's financing arm, the European Investment Bank, should at first complete the programme of Ecu8bn of extra lending agreed in December 1992 and June this year. Only about Ecu4bn of this has so far been committed. Using words almost identical to Mr Major's, Mr Kohl offered polite criticism that Mr Delors had published his proposals only two days before the summit, giving ministers inadequate time to study them. Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said Bonn showed 'concern' about plans to make extra demands on already tight credit markets when governments throughout Europe were trying to rein back borrowing. This was not the time to give the European Commission extra responsibility in borrowing, he said, especially when the EIB had more 'technical competence' in such matters. Bonn officials made clear their anxiety that large-scale borrowing by the EU for pan-European projects was a way of channelling individual governments' fund-raising outside normal budgetary channels. The German reservations were echoed by the Netherlands, the only country apart from Germany to maintain full-scale 'hard currency' status after the August collapse of the narrow-band ERM. Mr Ruud Lubbers, prime minister, spoke in favour of continuing to channel EU infrastructure lending through the EIB. Mr Pieter Dankert, state secretary of the Dutch Foreign Ministry, said his government was 'open-minded' about borrowing for transport and energy projects. But he said EU fundraising on its own account would be acceptable only if borrowing by national governments were reduced by an equivalent amount. If met, Mr Dankert's condition would deprive Mr Delors' plan of any macroeconomic significance. After this barrage of scepticism from some of the EU's heavyweights, by the end of the first day of the summit Mr Delors' big idea was looking a lot smaller.</p>

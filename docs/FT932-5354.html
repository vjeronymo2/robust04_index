			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / BA pilots vote for stoppages PILOTS AT British Airways have voted by a five-to-one majority in a secret postal ballot to take strike action. The ballot is a further blow to the company which last night was facing the prospect of a 24-hour strike today by its 17,000 cabin crew and ground staff worldwide. In a 92 per cent turnout, the pilots voted 2,152 in favour with only 402 against. If the pilots strike all BA's 207 long- and short-haul craft would be grounded. Balpa, the pilots' union, estimates that BA would suffer Pounds 16m in lost fares for each strike day. Mr Chris Darke, the union's general-secretary, said last night the ballot result showed 'the depth of ill-feeling among our members'. Mr Darke added: 'The massive response and overwhelming majority for strike action indicates pilots are deeply dissatisfaction with the way BA are seeking to impose changes without agreement.' Mr Darke said he had written to Mr Robert Ayling, BA's chief executive, demanding an immediate resumption of talks with the company over the pilots' worries. The union is concerned at what it sees as the company's attempt to divide pilots by introducing separate contracts of employment in its Gatwick subsidiary, which was set up last November after BA's takeover of Dan Air. Pilots in the subsidiary are paid 30 per cent less than those elsewhere in British Airways. At Gatwick, 90 pilots voted for strike action and only seven were against. Negotiations were continuing yesterday evening between BA and the TGWU transport union to try to avert a 24-hour strike by cabin crew and ground staff due to start at midnight over the alleged cut in pay and fringe benefits in BA's subsidiaries. BA's 250 white-collar supervisory, clerical and passenger service staff are also due to strike at Gatwick airport today.</p>

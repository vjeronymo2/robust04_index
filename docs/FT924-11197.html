			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / British Steel to cut production by 20% BRITISH STEEL is to cut production by up to 20 per cent in the current quarter, underlining the disarray in the recession-hit European steel industry. The announcement yesterday led to a 10 per cent fall in British Steel shares to 56p - against 125p at privatisation in 1988 - and raised fears that the company would make further job cuts. British Steel, already one of Europe's most efficient steel-makers, would not say how it planned to achieve the reduction in its 'liquid steel-make', which it blamed on a further deterioration in the demand for steel products in recent weeks, both in the UK and export markets. It denied a report immediately after the announcement that the reduction would definitely lead to short-time working, but admitted job cuts could not be ruled out. Production in the final quarter of British Steel's fiscal year - the first three months of 1993 - will be reviewed in the light of market conditions prevailing at the time, the company said. British Steel has a number of options for achieving the production cut short of outright job reductions. It could introduce short-time working at smaller plants, while shift patterns could be altered at the larger plants, most of which operate on a continuing basis. This would mean that individuals would work fewer shifts each week. The company said in June that employment would be below 42,000 by the end of the fiscal year, compared with 44,800 at the end of March. Following the closure in June of the Ravenscraig plant, employment is currently 41,500. Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy picture emerging from the European steel industry, which earlier this year had begun to believe the recession was ending as prices started rising after a steep two-year decline. But prices have slipped back again in recent weeks, owing partly to the political and economic crisis in the UK, and to broader economic factors in Europe which have dented customers' confidence. On top of that, relatively small quantities of allegedly unfairly-subsidised eastern European imports have further depressed prices. British Steel is among the 15 big European Community steelmakers which earlier this month asked the European Commission for financial aid to cover 50,000 redundancies planned over the next three to four years. They also want 'guidelines' on production, consumption, exports and imports, and swift action against unfair competition from outside the EC.

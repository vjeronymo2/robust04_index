			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Manley leads Cuba talks for C&amp;W: Castro regime relaxing stance on investments Mr Michael Manley, the former Jamaican prime minister, has been recruited by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, to lead negotiations with the Cuban government about possible C&amp;W involvement in modernising Cuba's telephone network. The talks signal a further relaxation by the Castro regime in its attitude to foreign investment. Earlier this year it went some way towards legalising use of the dollar in Cuba, and has promised further currency liberalisation. The Cuban government is believed to be talking to at least two other telecommunications operators besides C&amp;W, including Telefonica, the Spanish state operator which has significant interests in Latin America. No US telecoms company appears to be involved. C&amp;W, whose interests centre on the UK and past and present UK dependencies, operates in 18 territories across the Caribbean region. It owns 80 per cent of Telecommunications of Jamaica, and has significant operations in Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago. Mr Manley, who resigned his premiership in March 1992, said he had already visited Cuba on C&amp;W's behalf and had met President Fidel Castro and other leading government officials. He said he told them that C&amp;W had invested heavily in Jamaica to improve the island's telecommunications, concentrating on building networks in rural areas. Mr John Carrington, C&amp;W's Caribbean director, said talks were at a 'very preliminary' stage, but the company was 'very keen' to operate in Cuba if it could be arranged without offending US sensibilities. Cuba's state telecommunications company already has a joint venture with a private Mexican company to operate a cellular mobile network. However, the antiquated fixed-line network is a state monopoly, offering lines to only a tiny fraction of the 11m population. In July the US State Department relaxed restrictions on telecommunications companies seeking to provide phone links to Cuba, letting Cuba receive half of future telephone revenues for international calls. Demand for telephone links among the Cuban exile community in the US is high. Even before the limited AT&amp;T microwave link with Cuba was destroyed by a hurricane last year, AT&amp;T was able to connect only around 500,000 calls out of 60m attempted each year.</p>

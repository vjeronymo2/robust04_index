			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Airlines fight US call for deregulation AIRLINES from the less developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America yesterday united in a fierce attack on US calls for total deregulation of the world's airline market. Air Botswana called the strategy 'a thug's charter,' and Royal Air Maroc, the Moroccan flag carrier, said it was a US attempt to boost its own airline industry's profitability at the expense of other countries' national interests. The attack came at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Dallas as airlines responded to US calls for an 'open skies' policy allowing unfettered competition between the world's airlines. Mr Rubel Thomas, chairman and chef eecutive of Varig Brazilian Airlines, said deregulation in the US had caused the demise of carriers such as Pan Am and Eastern and had brought combined industry losses surpassing Dollars 10bn in the last three years.</p>

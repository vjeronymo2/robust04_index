			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE VERIFIES TOXIC WASTES IN SOIL OF DUNES PROJECT  </P> <P> Recent tests by the state Department of Health Services at an Oxnard  subdivision have confirmed the presence of petroleum-based contaminants in the  soil, officials said this week.  </P> <P> However, the tests would not have been necessary had the department not lost  portions of data from tests conducted in 1986, they said.  </P> <P> Jim Marxen, a department spokesman, said the loss could possibly be blamed on  frequent changes in the department staff testing for toxic wastes at the Dunes  subdivision, which was built in an area used as an oil field dump in the late  1950s and '60s.  </P> <P> Only one member of the department's staff -- toxicologist Lou Levy -- has been  on the project for more than a year, Marxen said. In the past year, the project  manager has changed three times, with a fourth project supervisor to assume the  post next week.  </P> <P> Without the lost information, which details how the soil samples were collected  and treated, results from the 1986 tests were not considered scientifically  valid, said Tim Miles, who will be replaced as project manager by Pauline  Bararseh.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem Corrected  </P> <P> "There was no way to tell if samples taken by us and the county of Ventura were  valid," Miles said. The most recent soil samples have corrected the problem, he  said.  </P> <P> The revelation is unlikely to boost the confidence of Dunes residents, who have  complained that government officials have been slow to respond to their  concerns about petroleum-based contaminants first detected in 1985 by a  building contractor.  </P> <P> "This is a good example of why it's taken them three years to do nothing," said  Paul Dolan, a leader in a lawsuit by Dunes residents against the state, the  city of Oxnard, the oil companies that used the dump, several real estate  agents and the company that developed the subdivision.  </P> <P> Marxen admitted that the loss was "sloppy." But neither he nor Miles would  characterize the recent tests as superfluous.  </P> <P> The recent soil samples, which were collected Jan. 18 and 24, were valuable in  confirming what was already known about the site, they said. The tests detected  most of the same contaminants that were previously found. However, they did not  find benzene, the only known carcinogen detected so far at the subdivision of  about 100 lots.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Official Release  </P> <P> Geological surveys conducted last week and in December were also consistent  with past research, Miles said in advance of a community meeting Wednesday at  which the department's conclusions would officially be released.  </P> <P> The surveys, in which scientists used radar and electromagnetic equipment to  map the boundaries of the waste, found that soil contamination has been  confined to an area known to have been occupied by three oil sumps, Miles said.  The area covers about 20 lots or portions of lots.  </P> <P> The soil tests found metal, barium and several petroleum-related compounds, but  preliminary research has not found any contaminants in the air or in pipes  carrying water into Dunes homes.  </P> <P> "There's no way for this to hurt people as long as they aren't digging into  it," he said.  </P> <P> But Dolan complained that the department issued the same assurances three years  ago. "We deserve a more conclusive response," he said. "We're talking about the  lives of people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full Investigation  </P> <P> Department officials say they will pursue a full site investigation, which is  expected to cost between $500,000 and $600,000 and would begin as soon as  funding is available.  </P> <P> They said $100 million from a 1984 bond measure to clean up toxic waste  statewide has been depleted, adding that they are trying to persuade  legislators to earmark additional money.  </P> <P> However, funds set aside for administrative expenses might be used for part of  the Dunes investigation, Deputy Director David Willis said Tuesday.  </P> <P> State health officials had expected to complete the investigation by January,  1990, but now believe that it may be delayed by "months or a year," Marxen  said.  </P> <P> The investigation would determine whether the contaminants, which are from 1  1/2 to 8 feet below the surface in 4- to 5-inch-thick bands, have leached into  ground water or vaporized into homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Air Samples  </P> <P> Two previous air samples have not detected vaporized contaminants at levels of  concern, Miles said. In one test of 25 homes, for instance, the highest level  of gas detected was at one-third of the amount that would result from lighting  a gas range, he said.  </P> <P> Department officials plan to use more sensitive equipment in the future.  </P> <P> Also in an attempt to improve their investigation at the Dunes, the department  plans to employ a team approach, in which the eight staff members at the site  share information.  </P> <P> In the past, only the project manager has had an overview of the department's  efforts in the area, and the project managers either have either been promoted  from the Dunes post or, in Miles' case, left to travel.  </P> <P> "We're trying to compile the information so that there's some sense of history  to the site," Marxen said. "In the past, there was no continuity."  </P></p>

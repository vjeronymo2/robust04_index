			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian tin factory closure ESTANBRAS, the Brazilian tin group, is closing its Minas Gerais factory because the government has forbidden the company to export its product. The factory, which went into operation last year, was capable of producing 100 tonnes of tin each month. Since domestic demand is very small, the prohibition on exports soon left the group with few customers. In an attempt to push Brazil's small-time miners out of the country's tin reserves, the government last December prohibited the export of tin taken from illegal mines. Estanbras purchases its tin from 'garimpeiros' who do not possess mining rights. 'The prohibition of exports by companies without mining rights means big groups like Paranapanema may soon hold a monopoly on the sector,' said Jose Nivaldo Gomes Cordeiro, director of Estanbras. The group has sent away its 80 employees. Thousands contracted are out of work. Mr Cordeiro said there is hope that Estanbras will re-open the plant, if it succeeds in negotiations with the government to obtain mining rights for the area.</p>

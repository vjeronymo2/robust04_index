			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / More Japanese companies fail JAPANESE companies which went bankrupt in the year to March left debts of Y3,500bn, (Pounds 14.4bn) the third highest annual total on record, according to a report by the Teikoku Data Bank, a research agency. Teikoku Data Bank said 7,157 companies failed in the year to March, up 7.6 per cent on the previous year. Their liabilities were three times higher than in 1989-90. High interest rates, falling prices in the stock and land markets and labour shortages contributed to the failures. Bankers fear that this year's total could be much higher, as banks withdraw support from increasing numbers of over-borrowed companies.</p>

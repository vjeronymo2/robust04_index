			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / French ports paralysed by 48-hour strike MOST French ports were paralysed yesterday by a 48-hour strike, Reuter reports from Paris. The stoppage was the fourth since November, when the government proposed a dock reorganisation involving the loss of 1,760 jobs. Cargo movement was halted at Marseille, France's largest port, and at the country's main grain port of Rouen on the Seine River. However, in Brittany's ports of Saint Nazaire and Brest, dockers were working as usual. The government wants to replace the current dock labour system with one under which dockers would become monthly-paid employees. It is ready to pour FFr2bn (Pounds 200m) into making the ports more competitive. The dockers' leaders are expected to present a counter-proposal next week.</p>

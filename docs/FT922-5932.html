			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Judging by yesterday's improved durable goods orders for April, the US economy could yet ride to the rescue of Mr George Bush's hopes for re-election. The figures add to the broadening range of evidence that the US recession ended shortly after Christmas. Granted, the series is volatile, and the headline 1.4 per cent monthly increase can be variously adjusted for defence and transport orders to paint a less impressive picture. Indeed, non-defence capital goods orders fell slightly. But the trend looks clear enough: the economy has been making a steady, if unspectacular, recovery. Hence, perhaps, the refusal by both bond and equity markets to react decisively. The fundamentals apparently preclude a re-run of last year's abortive recovery, not least because interest rates are so much lower, but no-one is expecting the economy to forge ahead. There will have to be something unexpected among next week's rush of data if Wall Street is to be jolted from its present mood of restrained optimism. As for the bond market, it may have brushed off yesterday's figures, but it had already fallen on Tuesday's confidence indicator and is unwilling to break out of its present trading range. In marking the dollar up yesterday, the foreign exchange market was probably right to think that the Federal Reserve will find it difficult to cut interest rates further, especially as the rising oil price implies new inflationary pressure. Equally, the Fed is unlikely to risk strangling recovery by raising rates in advance of the election. Interest rate differentials with Germany are unlikely to be very different a few months from now.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 2 Jun (AE) -- The vice presidential  candidate for the Popular Brazil Front, Senator Jose Paulo Bisol  (PSB-RS) [Brazilian Socialist Party, Rio Grande do Sul] today  reasserted that violence to protect oneself from violence is  currently guaranteed in the Penal and Civil Codes. Overwhelmed  with the misery he found on the outskirts of Brasilia, Bisol  said yesterday during a meeting with the people of Santa Maria  that violence is justified when it is used to resist violence  for which the government is directly responsible.    As a retired appellate judge, Bisol recalled that he has  spent years judging cases of legitimate and illegitimate  violence. "The people have the right to take the law into their  own hands when the government cannot guarantee justice," he  said. According to Bisol, this norm is included in any modern  study of the general theory of law. He said that with the  increase of violence and insecurity in the cities, the rich are  protecting themselves, equip their houses with alarms, and even  buy weapons with which to defend themselves. "The poor do not  have police protection or weapons with which to defend  themselves," he said.    According to Bisol, his statements in defense of the  revolution, which were widely covered by the newspapers, were  originated following a meeting he had with two women in the  satellite city of Santa Maria. They complained about the lack  of security, and told him their daughters had been raped as a  consequence of the lack of police protection in one of the most  violent areas of the Federal District. The senator's statements  were interpreted on the following day as a speech in defense of  violence. "Anyone can defend his possessions with violence,"  Bisol clarified today. He said that as a candidate for vice  president he is worried that his statements during the election  campaign are being taken "out of context."    He said that some days ago he referred to the presidential  candidate for the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party],  Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as a sociologist, noting that  sometimes people show wisdom in one field and ignorance in  another, as for example in the juridical field. Bisol said:  "On the following day a newspaper published that I had called  Cardoso ignorant." This is why the senator announced that he  intends in the next few days to speak with the attorney general,  and suggest to him a meeting among politicians and journalists  to carry out a campaign focused on "more substantial issues."  Bisol said that if the current trend continues, the candidates  will have to spend most of their time justifying their  statements.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Not so Super 301 after all - A once feared and loathed US trade weapon Super 301, the most feared weapon in the US trade expansion armoury, was always a bit of a fraud. It was written into the 1988 US Trade law at the behest of congressional 'trade hawks' who felt that barriers to US exports were not being adequately addressed by multilateral rules. The Super 301 provision required the US trade representative to make a list of 'priority foreign countries' and their most protectionist trade practices. The USTR was then expected to negotiate away the offending trade practice while holding the threat of retaliation as a sword of Damocles over the offending country. As it turned out, that sword never dropped on any country's head and the Super 301 provision expired in 1990. A recent book on US trade laws, Reciprocity and Retaliation in US Trade Policy, released by the Institute for International Economics, says Super 301 was viewed as 'an extension of US unilateralism in which the US set itself up as judge, jury and executioner without regard for international trade rules'. Trade hawks saw it as a means of addressing those Japanese trade barriers not subject to challenge in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was not enough that the executive branch had all the authority it needed to retaliate against 'unfair trade practices' under Section 301 of the act. They saw Super 301 as a bigger, more powerful weapon. Mr Thomas Bayard, one of the IIE authors, says the difference between Super 301 and Section 301 was the attention the former generated. Both provisions gave the USTR a year to negotiate away trade barriers but sanctions at the end of the line were not mandatory. Mrs Carla Hills, the former USTR, complained about the rigidity of Super 301 but used it reluctantly as 'a tool' to open markets. In 1989, the first year of its existence, Taiwan and Korea rushed to the bargaining table to make deals to avoid being put on the Super 301 list. Japan was named for its trade barriers against supercomputers, satellites and wood products. To avoid embarrassing Japan by have it as the only country on the list, Brazil was added for its import licensing restrictions and India for its investment and insurance regimes. The result, according to Mr Bayard's book, would have been at most Dollars 1.6bn in increased annual exports, if the agreements had been fully implemented. But they were not. The satellite deal appears to be working, but the wood agreement awaits tariff cuts promised in the Uruguay Round and the Japanese government appears to be dictating individual purchases of US supercomputers. India never agreed to talk under Super 301 and was never punished. Brazil changed its trade policies because a new government brought in new policies. In his campaign to become US president in 1992, Mr Bill Clinton promised to resurrect Super 301. But once in office, his interagency trade policy team devised a more sophisticated strategy under which the US-Japan economic relationship would be organised. All bilateral concerns would be brought under a broad negotiating 'framework' which combined the elements of previous sectoral negotiations and the Bush Administration's initiative to root out Japan's 'structural impediments' to trade. It would encompass macroeconomic measures to reduce Japan's multilateral trade surplus and indicators by which to measure success. When Japan agreed to the new approach in June 1993, there seemed to be no need for a Super 301. But two Japanese prime ministers later - at a summit in Washington between prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Clinton  -the two sides fell out. It was then the administration rediscovered Super 301. Whether by design or by chance, Mr Mickey Kantor, the current USTR has used it skilfully to ratchet up the pressure on Japan for a deal under the framework. With Congress threatening to renew Super 301, he headed off new legislation by renewing the provision administratively, but in a milder form: instead of listing erring countries he would list trade practices which pose obstacles to trade. This was considered less insulting. Instead of releasing a Super 301 list in April, Mr Kantor moved the deadline to September 30. This gave Japan nearly seven months to resolve its political problems and negotiate under the framework. To add to the pressure on Japan, Congressman Richard Gephardt introduced new and tougher market opening legislation. Mr Kantor warned Japan publically that US-Japanese ties were 'in serious disrepair'. When fear of trade war caused the dollar to tumble, and the yen to soar, Japan was ready to resume the framework talks. This time, the pressure of the newly designed Super 301 came into play, with September 30 as the deadline for a framework deal. September 30 also became the final deadline for agreement on procurement and Mr Kantor warned that if no agreement was reached, the sanctions process would begin immediately. With all the pressure in play, five deals were reached at the weekend under the framework. When the Super 301 list was released three days late on Monday, the Clinton administration declined to list even 'priority' trade practices, saying they were all being negotiated in other arenas. The 'kinder, gentler' Super 301 will remain on the books - it is contained in the implimenting legislation for the Uruguay Round - but nothing forces an administration to use it.</p>

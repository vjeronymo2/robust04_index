			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 5 Mar (CAMNEWS/PANA) -- Invoking a military  defense pact, Cameroon said Saturday [5 March] that the French  military presence in the west African country was aimed at  assessing "the situation" on island in the Bakassi Peninsula  claimed by Cameroon and Nigeria.    Cameroon State Minister for Communications Kontchou Augustin  Kouomegni said Saturday at a press conference in Yaounde, the  capital, that heightened French military and diplomatic activity  was aimed at averting the possibility of a war between the two  African neighbors. Kontchou said Cameroon can only go to war if  it was imposed on her. "We are fully committed to solve all our  problems peacefully and we call on Nigeria to do the same," he  said.    Dismissing Nigeria's claim to the oil rich peninsula,  Kontchou said Cameroon had allowed Nigerian settlers on the  islands to continue living there out of good neighborliness,"but  this does not mean that the land belongs to Nigeria." In a  letter to the United Nations Security Council dated 28 February  requesting a debate on the matter, Cameroon alleged that Nigeria  violated its territorial integrity by attacking its troops  stationed in the peninsula on 18 February. Cameroon said also  that Nigeria annexed two villages in the disputed area on 31  December 1993.    Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema met Camerooonian  President Paul Biya and Nigerian leader Sani Abacha on Thursday  in efforts to resolve the dispute.    Cameroon bases its claim to the peninsula on a 1913  agreement  between Britain and Germany. It said former Cameroonian  President Ahmadou Ahidjo and Nigerian leader Yakubu Gowon signed  an accord which reinforced Cameroon's ownership.    Nigeria said the Gowon-Ahidjo Agreement was not binding  because it was not ratified by the Supreme Military Council, the  then ruling body in Nigeria.</p>

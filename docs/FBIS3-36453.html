He informed journalists  and lawyers that the court had dismissed his client's appeal for  a mistrial and for the trial to be make public. In the lawyer's  words, the court questioned witness Nikishin, after which the  defendant "considered it possible for him to answer questions  from participants in the trial".    At the same time, ITAR-TASS has learned from sources close  to  the Russian president that Boris Yeltsin tends to believe that  the trial of the scientist is unconstitutional, and he may soon  use his influence as guarantor of the Constitution to stop the  Mirzayanov trial.</p>

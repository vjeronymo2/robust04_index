			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed Davis Service advances 21% to Pounds 17.5m DAVIS SERVICE Group, the business services company, yesterday announced a 21 per cent advance, from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 17.5m, in profits before tax for 12 months to December 31 1992. Group turnover declined by 20 per cent at Pounds 247m (Pounds 309m), reflecting the disposal in April of its Godfrey Davis contract vehicle hire business and the subsequent disposal of two of the company's three Ford dealerships. A provision of Pounds 1.5m was made for losses on the last remaining dealership which Davis is set to withdraw from this year. However, the combination into one division of the linen hire and laundry units with workwear services produced benefits which saw sales in textile maintenance rising to Pounds 112.8m (Pounds 107m) and operating profits moving up from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 13.2m. Support services, which includes office, hospital and military centre cleaning, also moved ahead, returning sales of Pounds 53.3m (Pounds 44.5m) and profits of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 2.5m). Site services were held back by recession in the construction industry, but managed a rise in turnover to Pounds 46m (Pounds 44m), although profits were flat at Pounds 3.42m (3.4m). Mr John Ivey, chief executive, said he was looking for no more than a modest improvement in trading conditions this year. 'We are not factoring in a recovery,' he said. Adjusted earnings per share improved from 12.96p to 15p. The proposed final dividend is 5.25p, making an unchanged total for the year of 7.98p. Net debt at the year end was reduced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 77.8m). COMMENT Davis has weathered the recession well. It reversed out of vehicle hire and car sales at the bottom of the cycle but may not regret missing the coming upturn there. It has focused instead on three core areas covering linen and workwear rental and laundry; cleaning and other labour support services; and the manufacture, sale and hire of portable buildings mainly for building sites and schools. These businesses look ominously vulnerable in a recession. But Davis has kept its head well above water by, for example, merging its workwear services with linen and laundry operations to improve efficiency in its textile services division. If and when the economy improves, it should be well placed with pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.5m forecast for this year. The shares reflect the optimism, trading on a prospective p/e of 15.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREEDERS' CUP;  </P> <P> THREE GET UNLUCK OF THE DRAW;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: FAVORITES BAYAKOA, ZILZAL AND EL SENOR MUST TRY TO OVERCOME  UNFAVORABLE POST POSITIONS IN SATURDAY'S RACES.  </P> <P> Three of the seven favorites in Saturday's $10-million Breeders' Cup races will  have to overcome unfavorable post positions on Gulfstream Park's peculiar  course.  </P> <P> A total of 89 horses were entered Wednesday in the sixth annual Breeders' Cup.  Three horses each in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and Turf Stakes are on the  also-eligible list, because fields are limited to 14 starters, so it's likely  that only 83 horses will run.  </P> <P> The morning-line favorites are Easy Goer at 6-5 in the Classic, El Senor at 3-1  in the Turf, Zilzal at 9-5 in the Mile, Bayakoa at 6-5 in the Distaff, On the  Line at 7-2 in the Sprint, the entry of Adjudicating and Rhythm at 5-2 in the  Juvenile, and Stella Madrid at 5-2 in the Juvenile Fillies. The races are worth  $1 million apiece, except for the $3-million Classic and the $2-million Turf.  </P> <P> Favorites that will have to be at their very best because of the luck of the  draw include Bayakoa, considered the best filly or mare in the country; Zilzal,  undefeated and given the best chance of winning among the European entries, and  El Senor, who has had traffic problems and wide trips in several of his  non-winning races.  </P> <P> Bayakoa drew post No. 1 in the 10-horse Distaff; Zilzal will break from No. 10  in the 13-horse Mile, and El Senor is on the outside in the Turf, which has a  capacity of 14 starters.  </P> <P> The two horse-of-the-year candidates that will account for most of the betting  in the Classic will be as far away from each other as they can be at the start  of the race, with Easy Goer coming out of the No. 1 stall and Sunday Silence  breaking from No. 8. California-based Sunday Silence, who beat Easy Goer in the  Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and then ran second to his New York rival in  the Belmont Stakes, is listed as the 2-1 second choice in the Classic.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence likes to be close early, and Easy Goer prefers putting in a late  run. It would seem that Easy Goer might suffer from the inside post, where  there is always the chance of getting shuffled back for the run down the  backstretch, but the Classic has a relatively small field, and Shug McGaughey,  who trains the colt, said he is happy with the position.  </P> <P> Jimmy Croll, who is starting Arlington Lassie winner Trumpet's Blare in the  Juvenile Fillies, has trained horses at Gulfstream for more than 25 years and  is familiar with the track, which has tight turns, an unbanked grass course and  a new dirt racing surface that concerned trainers last week. The main track got  better by the weekend but may change again if the predicted scattered  thundershowers occur today and Friday. Gulfstream's main track is a mile in  circumference, and the turf course is seventh-eighths of a mile.  </P> <P> "Post positions are important in mile races on grass and mile-and-sixteenth  races on dirt here," Croll said. "If you draw outside, you can lose a lot of  ground around the first turn."  </P> <P> Both of the 2-year-old races -- the Juvenile and the Juvenile fillies -- are at  1 1/16 miles.  </P> <P> The reason a No. 1 post might be all right for Easy Goer in the 1 1/4-mile  Classic and not for Bayakoa in the 1 1/8-mile Distaff is that Bayakoa is a  front-running mare. Outside her will be other speed horses -- Highest Glory,  Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and Winning Colors -- all of whom are capable  of crowding Bayakoa going into the first turn. If Bayakoa is not a factor in  the early pace, the victory chances improve for the late-running Open Mind, the  best 3-year-old filly in the country, and Goodbye Halo.  </P> <P> The hot-blooded Bayakoa has lost only twice in 10 starts this year. In one  loss, she broke from the No. 2 post and was unable to get rolling early; in the  other, she was in the first stall and broke through the gate while waiting for  the other horses to load.  </P> <P> Wayne Lukas, who trains Highest Glory, Colonial Waters, Wonders Delight and  Open Mind, has 11 Breeders' Cup starters and is happy with all of the post  positions they drew.  </P> <P> Lukas' Steinlen, the 4-1 second choice behind Zilzal in the Mile, has a chance  to win the national grass title for males with a victory Saturday. Steinlen,  who will break from the No. 2 post, has six wins, three seconds and one third  in 10 starts during a most consistent year, and has won races at distances  ranging from a mile to 1 1/4 miles.  </P> <P> Zilzal, a Kentucky-bred, English-raced son of Nureyev who was bought for  $750,000 as a yearling by Sheik Mana al Maktoum, has never lost, winning three  races at seven furlongs and two at a mile. The 3-year-old colt's smallest  margin of victory has been three lengths and he has won by as many as 10  lengths.  </P> <P> "I've seen this horse's record," Lukas said. "But this will be the first time  he has raced around a course with left-handed turns, and he won't be used to  the dead-flat grass surface that they have here."  </P> <P> The Sprint, which hasn't been won by a favorite since Eillo took the inaugural  running at Hollywood Park in 1984, was won last year by Lukas' Gulch, and the  trainer with a record nine Breeders' Cup victories is shooting for another win  in the six-furlong race with On the Line. The Sprint is so unpredictable that  On the Line has been made the favorite even though he has finished behind  Dispersal, Sewickley and Sam Who -- other starters Saturday -- in recent races.  </P> <P> Sam Who won five consecutive sprints in California in midyear, breaking the  track record for six furlongs at Hollywood Park. On the Line avenged one defeat  with a victory in the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del Mar, where Sam Who stumbled  at the start and finished fourth, but in the Ancient Title Handicap at Santa  Anita on Oct. 18, Sam Who was a four-length winner, in the same time of 1:08  that he registered at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Sam Who, the 4-1 second choice in the Sprint, drew the No. 13 post. The horse  outside him is Safely Kept, the only filly in the field and undefeated in eight  starts this year.  </P> <P> Because 19 horses were pre-entered in the Sprint a week ago, there was some  question whether Sam Who would get in the race. When fields are oversubscribed,  a point system based on high 1989 finishes determines nine of the starters, and  a panel of racing officials picks the otherfive.  </P> <P> "No. 13 is supposed to be superstitious," said Henry Moreno, Sam Who's trainer.  "But I'm not superstitious. I'm just glad to be in the race. Good horses should  win no matter where they start."  </P></p>

Hubert De Ronceray is  still in favor of the application of Article 149 of the  Constitution to solve the political crisis. The leader of MDN  [Mobilization for National Development] warns against what he  calls the newborn national conference industry. Professor De  Ronceray who reviewed news highlights for the month of January,  stopped on three facts:    First, the congress at the national theater. Second, the  decision of Haitian employers to shut down commerce and industry  from 28 January to 9 February. Third, the new industry of  national conferences.    Hubert De Ronceray expressed his concern that certain  initiatives have the effect of surgery that immediately kills  the patient instead of saving him. While condemning the embargo  which, according to MDN, has wrecked the economic and social  institutions and is forcing 5 million people to despair or  revolt, Hubert De Ronceray has urged the country's powerful  forces to remain vigilant around Article 149 of the 1987  Constitution and avoid the false path born of confusion and  despair.</p>

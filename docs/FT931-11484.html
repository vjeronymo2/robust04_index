			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BBL French unit loses FFr540m BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's biggest banks, revealed yesterday that its French subsidiary lost FFr540m (Dollars 100.74m) in 1992. BBL said the loss was principally related to provisions made against French property loans. The French banking sector is under pressure because of the economic slowdown and the squeeze on the French property market. As part of a restructuring, the Belgian group is planning to cut 139 jobs out of 462 at BBL France, and relocate to rented premises in the Defense commercial area of Paris. BBL has ploughed some FFr700m into its French subsidiary over the last year to help meet solvency ratios through a capital increase in April. The Belgian bank said it had anticipated the losses at its French subsidiary. In November, BBL announced non-consolidated group profits for the 12 months to end-September of BFr2.8bn (Dollars 84m), sharply lower than the equivalent period. Consolidated figures for the 15 months to the end of 1992 will be announced early next month. French property prices have been falling for the past three years. Average rentals in Paris, the worst affected area, have declined by 20 per cent over that period. The problems are most acute in the commercial sector. There is now estimated to be two years of commercial property stock on the Paris market.</p>

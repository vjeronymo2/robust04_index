			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEATING OIL PRICES UP AGAIN  </P> <P> The price of heating oil jumped again Wednesday as bitterly cold weather  continued to hover over much of the country, giving rise to concerns about  transport problems and dwindling supplies.  </P> <P> But oil traders said they saw signs that the rally was starting to weaken.  </P> <P> Heating oil for January finished up a sharp 7.23 cents at 99.71 cents a gallon  on the New York Mercantile Exchange after retreating from a session high of 100  cents. The contract had surged 13% Tuesday, the first day of trading since a  Christmas Eve explosion at an Exxon refinery in Louisiana.  </P> <P> The February contract rose its expanded 3-cent daily limit to 73.89 cents on  the Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Most futures contracts have daily price limits to prevent panic buying or  selling. After the February contract rose its 2-cent limit on Tuesday, the  exchange expanded the range for Wednesday's session.  </P> <P> The freezing weather not only raised demand for heating oil, but it also made  it difficult to distribute supplies as barges became stranded in rivers that  iced over.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, elected officials from states in the Northeast have asked the  federal government to investigate skyrocketing home heating oil prices,  including possible price manipulation.  </P> <P> The price for a gallon of home heating oil has risen to as high as $1.62 from  about 85 cents two weeks ago. As record cold gripped New England, prices in the  region were routinely jumping 5 cents per gallon per day; in one instance, the  jump was 12 cents.  </P></p>

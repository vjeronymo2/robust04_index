			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward downturn Pre-tax profits at Appleby Westward Group, the grocery distributor, dropped from Pounds 730,000 to Pounds 146,000 for the 28 weeks to September 10. The result included Pounds 90,000 profit on the disposal of the USM-quoted company's commercial vehicle repair business. Although turnover improved from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 45.1m, operating profits tumbled from Pounds 707,000 to Pounds 62,000. The reduction in profit was largely because of a Pounds 520,000 sub-contract commission payment, the company said, as well as a small decline in gross margins in the core food distribution business. The shopfitting operation incurred a small loss. Mr Roger Harvey, chairman, said Appleby had decided to meet competition by increasing its company-owned and operated stores. Earnings per share were down to 1.7p (8.5p). However, the 3.2p interim dividend is maintained.</p>

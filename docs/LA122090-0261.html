			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CHER HAS HER EYE ON A REVEALING ROLE: GYPSY ROSE LEE  </P> <P> THE FABULOUS Cher won an Oscar for "Moonstruck," but she still has a child's  delight in taking on roles that afford the chance to dress up and carry on like  a mad thing. (Catch Cher in "Mermaids," and you'll see what I mean.)  </P> <P> But now the star has optioned a work that will afford the opportunity to  "undress" and carry on. Cher is interested in portraying Gypsy Rose Lee, the  legendary stripper of the '40s. No, she won't do a remake of the musical  "Gypsy," but Cher has her eye on the Eric Preminger book "Gypsy and Me," a  true-to-life, Auntie Mameish-type tale of a boy and his mother.  </P> <P> Eric is the son of the late Gypsy and movie director Otto Preminger. He was  born out of wedlock when such a detail could kill a career.  </P> <P> Nobody has ever done total justice to the totality that grew to be Gypsy Rose  Lee -- stripper, philosopher, socialite, writer, painter, actress and sister to  another great talent, June Havoc. This is a role Cher should really be able to  sink into -- up to her hips.  </P> <P> KIM BASINGER doesn't have warm and cuddly memories of making "Batman." She  tells Lawrence Grobel in Movieline that "Jack Nicholson made money.  Peters-Guber, they made money. And Warner Bros., of course, made money. But  none of the rest of us made anything. We got raped; everybody did. It was a  rape deal; it really was."  </P> <P> Kim says she wasn't just another pretty face in "Batman." She claims to have  made contributions to the script: "I saw what was missing from 'Batman.' I saw  the reconstruction work that should be done . . . so I just rewrote a lot of  this crap." (Take that, screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren.)  </P> <P> Kim isn't entirely dour and serious in this interview. She talks of her sexy  public appearances and how she selects what she wears -- low-cut, transparent,  split up the front items. "I dress mostly for me. And I find myself dressing  for the fans, because they have fun. What does the word movie STAR mean,  anyway? It's not a medical student. It's a movie star, right?"  </P></p>

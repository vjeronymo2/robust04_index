			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 28 (XINHUA)--An engineering center,  set up by a Chinese company and an American transnational  corporation, went into operation today in northern China's  Tianjin Free Trade Zone.    The joint venture of Sinopec Honeywell Company Ltd. was set  up with efforts from Honeywell Inc. of the United States and the  China Petrochemical Corporation.    It will deal with large-scale engineering control systems,  installing and testing of relevant equipment and other hardware  and software, as well as technical training and consulting.    The American firm is able to produce advanced aeronautical,  industrial and office automatic meters. About 75 percent of the  meters used on Boeing planes and 50 percent of the meters on  McDonnell Douglas planes come from the firm.    Since its establishment in May 1991, the Tianjin Free Trade  Zone has attracted well-known international firms from Japan,  the United States, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Germany and  other Western European countries.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Mortgage lending sinks Total mortgage lending fell sharply last month compared with August, emphasising the fragile nature of the housing market recovery, Barclays Bank said yesterday. The bank said in a survey that solicitors' home-loan transactions indicated that gross new mortgage advances in England fell 7 per cent last month compared with August. The figures reflected the completion of loans negotiated in early and mid-summer before last month's rise of half a percentage point in interest rates. Mr Garry Skelton, head of Barclays mortgage lending, said: 'It is too early to judge the impact of the rate rise, but it does not augur well for October lending. For most people increases in monthly mortgage repayments have yet to take effect.' He said the bank had seen a sharp increase in demand for fixed-rate mortgages since the rise, but mortgage applications overall last month were about the same level as in August. 'Traditionally we would expect mortgage applications to increase in September and October but, for one reason or another, this has not happened during the past few years,' said Mr Skelton. Barclays blamed uncertainty about job prospects and the economy as well as tax and fixed-rate mortgage rises earlier in the year for the decline in mortgage completions since August - even though completions last month were 9 per cent higher than September last year. The biggest fall was in Greater London where mortgage lending fell 10.6 per cent compared with August and 7.6 per cent compared with September last year. Only the south-west region saw an increase in lending - of 5.6 per cent compared with August. 'Overall housing market activity appears largely to be concentrated among first-time buyers, new properties and at the upper end of the market,' said Mr Skelton. House prices have remained static since the third quarter of last year according to a survey published today by Halifax Building Society. Regions showing the strongest growth in prices over the period were Northern Ireland (+9 per cent), Scotland (+3.4 per cent), Greater London (+1.8 per cent) and south-east England (+1.6 per cent).  ---------------------------------------------------------              HOUSE PRICES UP IN MOST REGIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------               Percentage changes are based                 on regional standardised                  indices of house prices  --------------------------------------------------------- 1.

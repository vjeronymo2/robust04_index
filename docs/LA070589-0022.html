			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WALL OF SILENCE'  </P> <P> The front-page picture (June 20) of "The Wall of Silence" (at the Great Wall in  China) provokes vivid images of contrast in my mind.  </P> <P> Two days prior to martial law being declared in Beijing. My husband, Norm, and  I stood on the Great Wall of China. In the midst of a crush if tourists we  stopped to take pictures of three preschool-aged Chinese children, their  father, and an elderly Chinese couple who were making that incredibly difficult  climb. Their excitement and animated countenances belied any impending peril or  violence in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> These images are deeply ingrained in our minds. Everywhere we went the  middle-school children, their teachers and supporters were making and bearing  the red flag of freedom in support. They were bused and trucked throughout  Beijing in great numbers. Everywhere we went there was great enthusiasm -- our  tour guides talked excitedly about their hopes for freedom, and listened to  Chinese broadcasts wherever we were.  </P> <P> However, the great masses of workers pedaled by noiselessly and disinterestedly  on their endless treadmill.  </P> <P> DENISE WIEME  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

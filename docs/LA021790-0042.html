			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BLAKE BABIES' SWEET LOOKS AND TURBULENT TUNES  </P> <P> "This is a song about the benefits of shrapnel," singer Juliana Hatfield  announced during the Blake Babies' show at Club Lingerie on Thursday.  </P> <P> Emotional debris is what she was talking about.  </P> <P> The Boston trio's turbulent little tunes are charged with incidents of  betrayal, rejection, rage, conflict, spite, remorse. . . .  </P> <P> Not an unusual menu for an "alternative" rock band these days, but the Blake  Babies (who also play Bogart's on Sunday) make it more memorable than most --  partly because of Hatfield's impelling, little-girl yowl, partly because they  look way too young and sweet to have gotten into such messes. Playing to a  thinned-out Lingerie audience following unrelated sets by L.A. roots-rockers  James Intveld and Rosie Flores, the threesome looked as if they had burst into  song while down in the dorm laundry room.  </P> <P> Their minimalist rock moved along pretty briskly on Hatfield's bass and Freda  Boner's drums, while John Strohm kept finding real hooks in his thick, grungy  guitar work. The effect was one of sweetness trying to escape the muck. RICHARD  CROMELIN  </P></p>

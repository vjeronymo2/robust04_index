			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Mr Absent without leave: Political and economic reform are being jeopardised by the semi-detached state of Yeltsin The Russian president appears to have played little part in the governing of the country for some weeks. This fact is causing comment in Russia and concern abroad: the more so since on him depends the setting of a strategic course for the government, the lineaments of a relationship with the parliament and a clarification of foreign policy - all areas where unanswered questions multiply anxiously. His decision to delay until next Thursday the critical state-of-the-nation speech, scheduled for yesterday, was the most overt sign of Mr Boris Yeltsin's semi-detached state. The delay was said to be due to a bad cold: indeed, one of his press secretaries, Mr Anatoly Krasikov, went so far as to urge correspondents to look for themselves at Mr Yeltsin on television that day, to see how ill he looked. Unfortunately for this proposition, Mr Yeltsin - appearing with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, at a press conference - did not look particularly ill. He spent well over two hours talking to Mr Major, took a press conference (standing) for about half an hour, had a meeting with the president of the Republic of Tatarstan to sign a treaty and in the evening hosted a Kremlin dinner. British diplomats insist that the president was in complete charge of his brief, took the initiative, made jokes. Thus to plead a cold as reason to cancel a vital speech three days away seems transparent as an excuse. It comes on top of a string of broken or refused gatherings with foreigners, the non-acceptance for three days last week of a telephone call from US President Bill Clinton and a profile so low that Mr Sergei Parkhomenko of Sevodnya newspaper dubbed him 'Mr Absent' in a recent article. Other vital dates are being put off: the cabinet session to discuss the budget was put back from this Thursday to the coming week; potentially more seriously, the local elections set for spring may also be delayed until summer or autumn because - according to Mr Sergei Filatov, the presidential chief of staff, in an Izvestiya interview - 'people will be afraid to make the wrong choice'. What is going on? The rumours of heavy drinking, always recycled at times like these, are - say US sources - not a cause for real concern. But Mr Yeltsin is often a man in pain, the legacy of two crashes - in a car in Moscow and in an aircraft in Spain. He needs both treatment and drugs to allow him to work. How far that is a factor now is not known and will not be revealed. Information about the president has become scanty. The Moscow political world has discounted illness as an explanation. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko political grouping, a presidential challenger and according to the polls the most popular politician in Russia, believes that 'he is simply invisible because he does not know what to do. There is no concept of how to go ahead in the economy or in the society. The parliament has no one with whom to relate - and its mood is not very hostile to the president, it just wants to know how to work with him.' The other proffered explanation is a more charitable one. Mr Alexander Meshchersky, deputy editor of the mass-circulation Argumenty i Fakti and close to presidential circles, said yesterday that he believed Mr Yeltsin was now in one of these periods of 'withdrawal and reflection' - the kind seen after the August 1991 putsch, and again at the beginning of last year. There is much to withdraw and think about, for Russia stands at the beginning of a period in which the choices of its president are critical to the further progress of political and economic reform. First, there is a soup where an economic policy should be: Mr Yegor Gaidar the former first deputy prime minister, said yesterday that 'there are very many contradictory features in what the government is trying to do'. Mr Alexander Shokhin, now economy minister, seems to be trying to do everything at once: gathering together academicians of the late Gorbachev period to draw up plans for him; appointing such radical Gaidarites as Mr Sergei Vasiliev as his deputy minister; and confirming that he, not the academicians, are in charge of drawing up an economic reform plan. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and the second most powerful man in the country, is in the grip of an economic nightmare. In losing Mr Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for finance, he has lost men on whom he could pin the blame for the consequences of reform. 'Really,' says Mr Gaidar, 'the choices that must be made now are very, very difficult, the most difficult perhaps in the last two years.' Mr Chernomyrdin is wrestling with inflation already running at about 20 per cent a month, and a vast budget deficit is staring him in the face for the first quarter. Yet everyone is pounding him to give them more money. 'Chernomyrdin is being pursued by three lobbies,' says Mr Yavlinsky, 'the military industrial, the agricultural and the energy. And they all claim to be starving.' If the prime minister is to construct a defence against their demands, he needs a direction. Only the president can supply this - though he may be unwilling to do so, since he will not wish to be seen to be dictating a pace of change which is unpopular. Manoeuvring between these two men, who met for some time yesterday, is one reason for the delay. Second, there is a gap where a constitutional framework should be. The deputies in the new parliament have begun a programme of work and, for the moment, appear in no mood for confrontation. The ultra-nationalist party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to whose great success in the December elections so much attention has been paid, is clearly undergoing internal convulsions as its deputies struggle to distinguish themselves from their threat-a-minute leader. The Communists and the Agrarians on the left stress constitutionality and adhesion to democratic ways. But they have no president with whom to co-operate or whom to oppose, no presidential programme to fufil or to amend. The most significant constitutional move in the new year has been the conclusion of a treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, its largest autonomous republic, right in the centre of Russia. Tatarstan had declared virtual independence with its own constitution. Now a treaty has, it is said, brought it back within the federation and stands as a model for other, difficult republics and regions. But the deputies yesterday would have none of the treaty: 'We were not able to see the six detailed agreements which went with the treaty, so how could we vote on it?' asked Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian communists. From the vague wording of the treaty, it is possible that Tatarstan has been ceded effective powers over all taxes and other areas normally at least the co-responsibility of the centre in any federal state. Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedayev, the former first deputy foreign minister, said earlier this week that the Russian ministers negotiating the treaty 'looked for vaguely worded formulas in the negotiations with Tatarstan which won't fool anyone but may lead to the break-up of the federation'. Mr Yeltsin, the guarantor of the integrity of the federation, a task he has made as 'sacred' as Mr Mikhail Gorbachev made the retention of the Soviet Union, signed the treaty with Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the Tatar president, and talked of a new era in relationships. But can he mean it? Third, there is a puzzle where foreign policy should be. 'We do not have a foreign policy, we have foreign reactions,' says Mr Andranik Migranyan, a presidential adviser. Russia, which scored a rare diplomatic success this week in getting agreement from the Bosnian Serbs to pull back their artillery, was only stung into action by the unilateral declaration by Nato that it would stage air strikes against the Serbs' positions unless they withdrew. A treaty with neighbouring Belarus is approaching completion, which would merge the two countries' economies and make Belarus a province of Russia in all but name. The radicals like Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov see it as a grave threat to Russia's finances. But majority political opinion welcomes it as a sign that at least one state cannot live without Russia. The Belorussians, in the main, seem to belive they have no choice. Throughout the former Soviet republics, there is a shuffling of feet and a turning back to Moscow by leaders who in some cases had called down curses upon the 'imperial centre' and now, exhausted by wars or economic collapse or both, seem again willing to have Moscow make the central decisions in their countries' lives. But in this movement there is a wide choice - between what many in the west fear is a neo-imperialist impulse (frankly espoused by Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats) and an eastern version of the European Community. Only Mr Yeltsin can define the strategic direction of a fledgling foreign policy: and he does not seem to have done so.</p>

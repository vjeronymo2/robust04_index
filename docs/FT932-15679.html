			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / The Long View: Selling the truth TRUTH attracts a good press but, often, it fails to get an enthusiastic reception out there in the market-place. It is human nature to like to be told a story, even a little white lie. This is a roundabout way of getting into the debate over the accountants who are creating a stir by improving the quality of financial reporting. Their proposed new accounting standard, FRS3, has caused certain (but by no means all) company finance directors, City investment analysts and even financial editors to agonise over the loss of their simple, and supposedly reliable, earnings-per-share numbers. The Accounting Standards Board also is attacking the lax approaches to off-balance sheet reporting (now you see the debts, now you don't) and takeover accounting which created a rich field for 1980s' financial manipulators. But it has still to prove that truth will be popular. The accountants, in their role as company auditors, supposedly developed an answer to the problem of financial reporting years ago. It was called the 'true and fair view,' Fortunately for the commercial prosperity of the accountancy profession, the view did not live up to its name. To achieve high fees, providers of corporate services such as lawyers and accountants must be efficient at facilitating the ambitions of their clients. They are rewarded for telling their clients how to do something, not that a particular deal or profit target is impossible. But when, in the end, a string of apparently healthy companies such as Coloroll and Parkfield Group suddenly disappeared in puffs of smoke, the position of the auditing profession became impossible. The clean-up began. If you detect a whiff of cynicism, I plead extenuating circumstances on the ground that I endured a 10-year debate on inflation accounting, starting in the 1970s. Quite early on, the profession produced a perfectly decent, if rough-and-ready, inflation accounting standard that would have served investors' interests perfectly well. But government and industry opposed it, and later proposals became more complex without becoming more popular. Simply, most listed companies did not want to publish inflation-adjusted profit figures that were lower than the conventional historical cost version. To some extent, the stock market realised there was a problem, which is why the average price-earnings ratio was about 7 or 8 late in the 1970s compared with near 20 in today's conditions of low inflation; the difference reflects largely the poor quality of 1970s' earnings. But many companies appeared to take a wholly exploitative approach. Thus, British Gas published current cost/profit figures (nice low numbers) while it was a public corporation seeking to avoid price curbs, but majored on substantially higher historical cost numbers as soon as privatisation loomed and it wanted to maximise its share price. The same cosmetic approach was applied to takeovers. When one company acquires another, often there are heavy extra costs. If there are measures to rationalise the operations of the two companies, disruption will follow and the benefits, if any, usually will not be achieved for several years. So, you would think the obstacles to takeovers would be formidable, and that takeovers would be rare. The problems were solved by accountants, though. Costs disappeared, provisions were written back and profits rose smoothly - to the extent that it was argued sometimes during the takeover boom that such and such a company needed another acquisition soon if it was to maintain its profits growth. Years later, however, many acquisitive companies like Burton and Storehouse ran into big trouble. The truth will come out one day, but who is in a hurry? Investors prefer companies that deliver steady growth in earnings and dividends, and companies that fit such a description go to a premium. In the real world, profits move erratically up and down in a way which accentuates the risks. So, accountants and lawyers have been brought into play to create techniques and structures to generate the required image. Risk-averse institutional investors, reluctant to commit money to highly cyclical makers of building materials or engineering components, tend to prefer the likes of Hanson or BTR (or, perhaps these days, some of their less geriatric emulators). Do such rambling conglomerates become so large because they provide brilliant industrial management, or because they re-package industry into a form assimilable by the stock market? Part of the problem is one of corporate governance: that auditors are too much under the thumb of managements, and have only a minimal relationship with the shareholders to whom they are supposed to be responsible. A strong and independent audit committee might help, but such committees rarely are strong and independent in the companies where they really need to be. More fundamentally, my experiences in the inflation accounting debate led me to conclude that shareholders did not really want to know the truth. During the 1980s, the complacency seemed almost to develop into a kind of conspiracy of optimism. Who wanted to expose the realities of Polly Peck? Managers and shareholders and stockbrokers all wanted a high share price. A successful and growing company would generate high fees for the City of London. The important thing was not to be left stranded when the game ended. Now, we have to watch the investors and analysts as the anti-cosmetic Accounting Standards Board scrapes the make-up from company accounts. What remains might not always be a pretty sight: bumpy where you thought it was smooth and hard to recognise and understand. Perhaps the rouge and the mascara are being rejected forever. But human nature does not change, and the search will be on for a different kind of face-lift.</p>

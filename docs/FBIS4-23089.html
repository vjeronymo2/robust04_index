			<p>Europe      Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 20, 02 June  1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Latin America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most  recent sources available to FBIS.     Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Lat in America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications.     The EER is published in two editions, one for West Europe (also  including media coverage of Canada and Turkey), and the other for  East Europe.  Drawing primarily from domestic media sources of these  countries but also using other foreign media where appropriate, the  EER focuses on national and regional economic issues, such as  economic competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic  reforms and other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade  and investment.     FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

The study,  carried out by the Institute of the German Economy (IW), advocates a  long-term shift to wage increases which reflect only productivity  growth rather than additional, political considerations such as a  desire to redistribute income.  It specifically rejects a policy of  short-term wage restraint as inadequate and even advocates holding  wage increases below the rate of productivity growth "for a certain  time" to ameliorate the EU's current "situation of structural  underemployment."  This approach would allow European companies to  improve their profitability, which would in turn stimulate  investment and create jobs.     According to the study, increased international competitive  pressures and the constraints of the EMU economic convergence  process also imply an end to wage increases which exceed the growth  of productivity.  The study argues that such increases, coupled with  unfavorable changes in international currency exchange rates, have  hurt the competitiveness of European firms in relation to their U.S.  and Japanese counterparts, especially since 1985.  In 1992, for  example, the unit cost of EU industrial products was almost 14  percent higher than the unit cost of comparable U.S. and Japanese  goods.  Meanwhile, as the EMU target dates for the convergence of  the European economies approach, the tools traditionally used to  compensate for excessive wage hikes will be increasingly  unavailable:  monetary policy will have to follow a strict anti-  inflationary course, fiscal policy will be geared toward budgetary  consolidation, and currency devaluation will cease to be a  politically viable option.

The current Social Democratic Party (SDP)-led  coalition government launched the initiative last year as a three-  year experiment to relieve official unemployment.  Parliament will  have to decide the initiative's future by 1996.  Some 50,000  individuals have already entered the program and are receiving  government allowances to withdraw from the labor market for up to  one year in order to study, care for a child or elderly family  member, or take a skills-enhancing sabbatical.  With the country  entering the "unofficial" campaign for a parliamentary election,  which must be held this fall, the issue is receiving attention in  party platforms and public discussion.     On 8 May, the Radical Liberal Party, a junior party in the  governing coalition, adopted its official position.  As summarized  by Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE business section reporter Jakob  Elkjaer on 9 May, that party's ruling council pledged support for  continuing the program, while indicating it wanted to see some  changes.  The council came out unequivocally, however, in favor of  leave for training and education.  It also backed the government's  plan to ease the burden on the treasury by requiring contributions  from workers and employers based on the principle of "collective  insurance."     As expected, the Social Democrats greeted this announcement with  enthusiasm, Elkjaer continued.  Reaffirming her own party's stand,  SDP Labor Minister Jytte Andersen declared that "the leave  arrangements should be made permanent.  The success which the  program has enjoyed shows that people want to become more qualified,  take care of their children...  This is part of a modern labor  market policy."  Acknowledging complaints of high costs and  disincentives to get a job, Andersen said the government planned to  cut the present education allotment.  The current payment, equaling  the maximum level of unemployment compensation, would be reduced to  80 percent of that amount.     The Employers Confederation (DA) also used the occasion to  reiterate its stand.  Elkjaer reported that its director, Jens  Andersen, stated that the DA opposes continuing leave for child-care  and sabbaticals, suggesting it puts too great a burden on business.  While the group supports leave for training and education, it  opposes universal contributions from employers, asserting that only  those firms directly benefiting from training or retraining should  have to pay contributions.  Dansk Industri, the association  representing heavy industry, also stated cautious approval for  funding training leaves but adamantly opposes leave for care of the  elderly and for skill-boosting sabbaticals.     The stand taken by the Christian Party, another partner in the  ruling coalition, was summarized in an article in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  on 2 May by Erik Bjorn Moller.  At its just-completed convention,  that party also announced its support for extending the program.  The Christian Party denounced the attack on the program by the  Liberal and Conservative Parties, saying it could not consider  cooperating with them in the campaign or in a subsequent coalition  unless they halted their opposition.  The two parties--the largest  in the nonsocialist camp--immediately rejected this condition.

The  government further pledged that if buyers demonstrate strong demand  for the initial offering, it will place up to 1 million of its  remaining shares on the market.  If the first offering is completely  sold, the state's ownership share will drop from 73 to 61 percent.  If both offerings are completely sold, the figure will drop to 59  percent.  There is some reason for optimism, the article claims,  judging from the steady upswing on the Helsinki stock market and  enthusiasm for Finnish shares elsewhere.  The firm will use  projected stock sale proceeds of about 700 million markkas to  improve its high debt-equity ratio, which resulted from the collapse  of the Soviet market and the European recession.  Furthermore,  the  article notes that, like the Finnish export sector as a whole,  Valmet has recently experienced a strong recovery in foreign demand  for its products, most notably papermaking machinery.  One year ago,  the company's total foreign and domestic orders amounted to 5.4  billion markkas; they now are worth almost 6.2 billion markkas.

Deger claims rumors  have circulated according to which the preparatory committee of the  World Trade Organization (WT0), over which Peter Sutherland  presides, intends to establish "a negotiating group" on the social  clause.  However, Deger notes that an unnamed "official source" in  Paris indicated that such a group would only be useful if it focused  on the social clause within the context of the current environment.  On the other hand, this official was cited as saying, "France is  interested in horizontal discussions so that the social clause can  be the object of consultations in all negotiating groups." (Dian I.  x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 24 May 94 p 6)     FRANCE FINDS ALLY IN JAPAN IN SHIPBUILDING--Philippe Moreau,  writing in LES ECHOS, notes that French shipbuilders, who reacted  violently" to the U.S. position on subsidies for the shipbuilding  industry and felt themselves isolated in their fight against a U. S.  strategy they deemed the "most protectionist on earth," have found  an ally in Japan.  Because Japan also has protested the U.S.  position, the French Government has "suddenly" found a new reason to  intensify its resistance to the U.S. stance, Moreau claims.  He  cites Prime Minster Edouard Balladur as saying that the U.S. effort  to protect its shipbuilding industry is "a step backward in regard  to the initial objectives of the negotiation and is contrary to  French interests."  Subsequently Balladur stated that the French  Government would make diplomatic demarches to the EU requesting the  latter to reject the U.S. position.     However, French shipbuilders fear that the French Government will  be handed a fait accompli by the European Commission, which is  sensitive to the fact that Denmark, Germany, and Italy are eager to  conclude an agreement with the United States.  In that case, French  shipbuilders will not only ask that a "process of ratification be  acted on in advance but that national compensatory measures be  prepared" as well.  The shipbuilders would like to reinstate a  system of "interest advantages" (bonification d'interet) for  shipping fleets so that "shipping companies can again buy ships in  France."  (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 19 May 94 p 7)     TRADE VERSUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIEWED--Commenting on President Bill  Clinton's anticipated decision to renew China's Most Favored Nation  status, Jean-Francois Revel writes in the Paris weekly LE POINT that  the position generally adopted by democratic leaders who must choose  between human rights and trade is usually the result of "blackmail"  by those countries such as China and Vietnam that abuse human  rights.  Ravel contends that China "ordered" France to cease trading  with Taiwan, and China is threatening the United States with  reprisals if its Most Favored Nation status is revoked.  Neither  Chinese nor Vietnamese concessions, he writes, comprise a solution,  since authorities in these countries concede to releasing political  prisoners only to reincarcerate them later to show that they do not  bow to foreign pressure.     In this ongoing "blackmail," Revel argues, democracies should not  be reproached for defending their interests but for not defending  them enough.  While Clinton may "give in" to Ghina's blackmail, it  is actually China that is in the more vulnerable position of the  two, exporting $30 billion annually to the United States compared  with the $8.8 billion it imports. (Rosa N. x36287) (Paris LE POINT  in French 21 May 94 p 45)     JAPAN-U.S. TRADE ACCORD DEEMED GOOD FOR EU--Marc Deger, writing  in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, cites unnamed sources at the European  Commission as saying that "any U.S.-Japan trade agreement which  opens the Japanese market is good for Europe."  Deger notes that any  such agreement should respect the principal of Most Favored Nation,  the basis for GATT, and any market opening promised to the United  States by the Japanese should also apply to third parties, such as  the EU.  Deger also cites Peter Gulford, spokesman for Foreign Trade  Commissioner Leon Brittan, as having "categorically" stated that  both the United States and Japan have given the EU assurances that  they will not face discriminatory measures as a result of an  agreement.  In mid-May during a visit to Paris, Japan's Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata said that "Japan will never accept number  targets.  Any quantitative goal to reduce Japanese trade surplus in  relation to the United States would lead to managed trade contrary  to the principles of GATT.  The fact that the United States  renounced such number targets is positive for France."  Additionally, Deger contends that the trade negotiations between the  United States and Japan augur well for the resolution of issues left  in suspense by the Uruguay Round, especially the issue of financial  services.  A Japanese-U.S. agreement on this issue will profit  France, a major provider  of such services.     However, Deger points out that the effect of U.S.-Japanese market  opening negotiations on EU-Japanese trade is not certain.  On the  one hand, if there is no agreement and the U.S. market closes its  doors to Japanese trade, the EU will feel more pressure from  Japanese imports.  On the other hand, even if the Japanese  Government opens its market to everyone, it cannot control whose  imports Japanese businessmen will buy, "probably those of the United  States," according to unnamed sources in Paris cited by Deger. (Dian  I. x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 25 May 94 p 3)     COMMENTARY ON AGRICULTURE MARKET SHARE, GATT EFFECTS--A  commentary by Nadege Forestier in LE FIGARO states that to maintain  France's worldwide market share in agriculture despite the  constraints of GATT, the French Government should consider exporting  its agriculture "without restitution."  Forestier points out that  the importance of agriculture exports to France in large measure  prompted the turmoil over reduced export subsidies under the GATT  agreement.  However, Forestier counters that in reality, the impact  of these measures is less than it seems.  According to the  Agriculture Ministry's "Information Bulletin," the GATT accord only  directly involves 4 percent of the value of France's agriculture and  food processing production.  Moreover, only 20 percent of production  is exported and 70 percent of exports are for EU countries.     In Agricultural Minister Jean Puech's view, the GATT accords and  the lower export subsidies must not impede France from maintaining  and developing its market share.  To do so, two conditions must be  met, according to Puech.  First, certain Community rules must be  changed to be able to produce and export "without restitution and  without government aid."  Secondly, farmers must be able to work at  marginal cost."  Forestier explains that this means the cost of  farming must be paid for by sales of subsidized products in a way  which would allow supplementary quantities to be produced less  expensively.  These in turn would be able to be exported outside the  EU without restitution.  Grain growers, who are mainly involved,  would not be hostile to this, Puech believes, adding that the  government will debate this strategy at the beginning of this  summer.  (Dian I. X36286) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in  French 18 May 94 p II)     ALPHANDERY REVISES STATUTES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS--On 25 May  Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery presented to the Council of  Ministers a bill to revise several statutes governing financial  institutions in France.  The bill adheres to a EU directive which  will come into force in July 1995.  It will require all credit  establishments in France to provide a "guarantee system."  The  details of the system will be established by the banking regulatory  committee, which will set the threshold of guarantee  protection at  400,000 francs (Fr).  Additionally, in case of the bankruptcy and  liquidation of a credit establishment, the bill will give full  authority for management and direction of the failed company to the  administrator appointed by the Banking Commission in order to avoid  any conflict between him and the former directors.  The following  are other provisions of the bill:     -- The general directors of the Credit National bank will be  named by its board rather than the Council of Ministers.  Additionally, its governing statutes no longer need approval by the  Council of State.     -- Companies will be regulated by a specialized financial  institution, the Entrepreneurs Office, rather than a suboffice for  accounting.  Again, the president of the Entrepreneurs Office will  be selected by its board.     -- As part of the reform of the Bank of Deposits and  Consignments, its director general will be named for a duration of  five years rather than an unlimited term.  For the current director,  Philippe Lagayette, his two years as president will be taken into  count.     -- Banking statutes will redefine a mission for the small  business service, matched with a Fr50O-million share of Small and  Medium-Sized Business Equipment Credit (CEPME's) company's Fr1-  billion capital increase.  The bill will also establish a National  Forecast Office for the stock exchange.  It will also establish a  central office for savings banks.     -- The bill will reinforce protection for insurees and  depositors.  It intends to establish a mechanism to monitor  reinsurers and will monitor insurance groups on a consolidated  basis.  It will also provide reinforced protection for those insured  under group insurance contracts.  (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS  in French 26 May 94 p 4)     REACTION TO FEDERAL RESERVE INTEREST RATE HIKE--An article in the  Paris financial daily LES ECHOS on 18 May commented that the  reversal" in the position of the Clinton administration regarding  the advisability of raising the U.S. discount rate came as a result  of the pressure of a very strong correction in the U.S. bond market.  Previous rate hikes by the Federal Reserve had not stabilized the  financial markets because of statements by members of the  administration which pointed out the weak level of inflation or  minimized the rate of growth, according to the article.  In addition  to the Clinton administration's "poor understanding of the debt  market reactions" effect on the dollar, the administration further  affected the value of the dollar by its attempts to raise the value  of the yen in order to reduce Japanese trade surpluses.  The  turnabout by the White House on this issue was "spectacularly"  confirmed on 17 May by Clinton's main economic adviser, Laura Tyson,  who indicated in an interview with THE WASHINGTON POST that the  political situation in Japan could lead to loosening pressure in the  framework of negotiations on market opening.     Clinton's reversal and the Federal Reserve hike should have  increased the value of the dollar or at least stabilized it.  The  article explains that this did not happen because the market,  overheated by a year and a half of a policy which undermined the  credibility of the Federal Reserve, distrusted the White House's  recent policy conversion.  Alternatively, the article suggests that  the markets may have opted primarily for an economic reading of the  dollar-mark exchange rate course. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS  in French 18 May 94 p 28)     FRAMATOME PRIVATIZATION TO BE DELAYED--An article in LES ECHOS  reports that any privatization of the nuclear energy manufacturer  Framatome through an Alcatel-Alsthom buyout is not likely.  To  explain, the French Government has given the "pretext" that it wants  a fuller analysis of the possible social consequences of such a  buyout.  The article notes that the explanation seems paradoxical  since Framatome's privatization had been considered almost certain  after the current government majority fared well in legislative  elections last year, particularly since the Framatome buout was a  small operation.     Despite the government's explanation, the failure apparently was  caused by financial considerations.  The government wanted Alcatel-  Alsthom to acquire 51 percent of Framatome at market prices.  But  Alcatel-Alsthom President Pierre Suard was reticent to spend any  more than strictly necessary to purchase Credit Lyonnais and Atomic  Energy Commission (CEA), which in turn would allow him control of  Framatome.  Suard's reticence came from his view that Framatome was  a group with little prospect of increasing its profits in the  future.  However, there was little disagreement among the  negotiating parties that the government retain a right of veto over  Framatome's foreign operations, similar to that exercised within oil  companies Elf and Total.  With Framatome, this mechanism would apply  particularly to any exports of nuclear technology to countries  presenting security risks or converting civilian nuclear  CAPABILITIES TO MILITARY USE.  (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in  French 25 May 94 p 25)     COFACE TO RETAIN PUBLIC MISSION--According to Georges Quioc,  writing in LE FIGARO, France's main export trade credit insurer,  Coface, will continue to insure government export credits despite  having become privatized.  To resolve this apparent contradiction,  the government has just modified the insurance code, published in  the 15 May "Official Journal," to allow the government to retain  supervisory rights over Co face management as well as over the  nomination of its directors.  The modification decree has also  confirmed the appointment of two government commissioners who will  sit on Coface's board.  They will attend all board meetings and will  exercise the right of veto on the nominations of the president and  director general of COFACE.  (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LE FIGARO Le  Fig-Eco supplement in French 18 May 94 p VI)     ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE TO INTENSIFY--An article in the paris daily  liberation states that a report by former aerospatiale head henri  martre on economic espionage indicates this "neglected field" is on  the verge of "receiving a boost."  Martre, now in charge of the  general planning commissariat, stressed that this field has become  an essential lever to help competitiveness and employment."  Except  for those firms working in sensitive scientific and technical  industries, French business is not as well equipped to ferret out  information as its Japanese, U.S., or German competitors.     However, Martre stated that economic intelligence--now called  "technological monitoring"--is gaining ground.  As an example, the  Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP), an  affiliate of a U.S. company and an association whose members include  firms practicing economic intelligence, now has 80 members in  France.  Among them is the Elf Aquitaine oil company and Syntelabo,  the pharmaceutical lab of the L'0real group, which in 1989  established an 18-member office responsible for coordinating  information collected throughout the world.  This office not only  scans scientific magazines but garners important information from  seminars, where researchers are eager to disclose the result of  their research to prevent colleagues from claiming it for  themselves.  In addition to their own resources, companies  interested in economic intelligence often resort to private  investigative firms, which now number about 15 in France, the most  important of which is the SCRL (expansion unknown), an affiliate of  the French Foreign Trade Insurance-Credit Company (Coface) and the  Edmond de Rothschild financial company.  These companies have  bankers, chambers of commerce, and lawyers as clients and claim they  only seek information by legal means.  However, the present trend  for economic intelligence leans toward so-called "tactical  information" gathering, which is still in an "embryonic" stage and  more difficult because it is "more confidential."  Its confidential  nature may sometimes compel detectives or former intelligence  operatives seeking it to "use illegal means," the Martre report  stressed.  (Rosa M. x36287) (Paris LIBERATION in French 24 May 94 p  10)     GERMANY     BUNDESBANK REPORT REJECTS DEVALUATION--German industry suffered a  decline in competitiveness at the beginning of the 1990's but has  recently improved its performance, according to the Bundesbank's  latest monthly report.  The Bundesbank attributed this improvement  to smaller wage increases, progress in fighting inflation and  changes in currency exchange rates.  In the same report, the  Bundesbank rejected using interest rate reductions to devalue the  German mark and gain a relative price advantage over foreign  competitors.  The bank's view is that the competitiveness of any  economy ultimately depends on ''fundamental preconditions,'' such as  an  appropriate" wage policy, a tax policy oriented toward  competition, and the reduction of regulations and other bureaucratic  hindrances.  (Rick H. x36504) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  in German 19 May 94 p 16)     ABB HEAD ON INVESTMENT IN RUSSIA--Eberhard von Koerber, head of  German operations for the international conglomerate Asea Brown  Boveri (ABB), has noted the potential for increased German  investment in Russia in several sectors, countering a recent  internal Economics Ministry report which warned against investing in  Russia because of the economic downturn there.  Von Koerber  remarked, for example, that major projects were discussed during  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent visit to Germany, which  included the expansion of a high-quality rail line to Russia, a  high-speed rail line from St. Petersburg to Moscow, a highway from  Berlin to Moscow, a new natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany  via Belarus and Poland, an expanded telecommunications network, and  an effort to conserve energy in power plants.  According to a  separate Bundesbank report, German investment in Russia was 31  million German marks (DM) in 1993, while Russian investment in  Germany was DM153 million, a disparity Yeltsin cited as an  indication of the need for increased German investment.  (Charles W.  x365O7) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 16 May 94 p  15)     GREECE     NEW MINISTER OF ECONOMY VIEWED--In an article in the 6 May issue  of I KATHIMERINI, Andonis Karakousis writes that new Minister of  National Economy Yiannos Papandoniou is a "methodical Europeanist  with a good team, who is relatively acceptable to the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement (PASOK) and who maintains good connections with  the business world."  In addition, Karakousis continued, Papandoniou  is experienced in public finances and increasingly aware of the need  to reduce budget deficits by stamping out tax evasion and reducing  government spending.  Finally, Papandoniou's longtime experience in  foreign trade is expected to sharpen his interest in developing  trade and investment with the Balkans and, more generally, East  European countries.     However, Karakousis contended, Papandoniou has some obstacles to  overcome.  He lacks the clout and power of his predecessor, the late  Yiorgos Yennimatas, who was PASOK's number two man.  Papanoniou will  also have to contend with the increasing independence of the  Ministry of Finance, which will not willingly accept a Papandoniou  intervention in its policies.  However, Papandoniou has a sense of  diplomacy and he enjoys good relations with most government  officials which should make his task easier, Karakousis commented.  He added that Yennimatas's "old guard" is being replaced by a new  generation of technocrats with a strong pro-European tilt who will  show increased sensitivity to the need for economic policy  stabilization.     An article in the 8 May issue of I KATHIMERINI characterizes  those who entered the National Economy Ministry with Papandoniou as  technocrats who are between 30 and 40 and hold modern views on the  functioning of the economy. They include (full first names are  unknown):     -- Y. Kandhalepas, secretary general for international economic  relations who is expected to assume larger responsibilities.     -- I. Stournaras, a Bank of Greece official and member of the  council of economic experts, who is a specialist in monetary  affairs.     -- I. Tsamourkelis, in charge of plans for the partial  privatization of the Greek Telecommunications Organization (0TE).     -- K. Lambropoulos, a specialist in exports and trade with the  Balkans.     -- St. Avgouleas and I. Geivelis, advisers who are alternate  directors of the European Union (EU) office in Athens.     -- M. Papaioannou, secretary general of the ministry, a holdover  from the previous administration whose resignation Papandoniou  rejected to avoid creating the impression he is "purging"  Yennimatas's aides and changing policy.  (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens I  KATHIMERINI in Greek 8 May 94 p 46; 6 May 94 p 21)     DELAYS SEEN IN PRIVATIZATIONS--According to an article in TO VIMA  TIS KIRIAKIS, the privatization of government-owned companies is  turning into an intragovernmental controversy.  Although an  announcement is expected soon on the sale of 30 percent of the Greek  Telecommunications Organization (OTE) to the two foreign companies  chosen by the previous government, other sales are not going as  well.  In fact, even the sale of small, failing companies will be  "dangerously delayed."  Moreover, while certain government officials  are promoting plans for the sale of 10 percent of the Public  Petroleum Company, others are "dragging their feet" on the  Skaramangas shipyards' partial privatization, to which the Greek  Government has already obligated itself to the Community.  In  addition, the Bank of Greece clashed with the Ministry of Industry  over its continuing to inject new government capital into debt-  ridden government-owned companies. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens TO VIMA  TIS KIRIAKIS in Greek 15 May 94 p D1)     TRADE UNIONS LOSING GROUND--An article in TA NEA reports that  workers are leaving trade unions in droves, mainly in the private  sector, confirming the Greeks' disaffection toward trade union  activity.  According to polls conducted over a number of years, an  overwhelming majority of the workers believes that trade unions are  not taking workers' interests to heart and some 86 percent of the  workers think that trade unions have become too partisan.  Figures  show that of the 2 million private sector workers, only 350,000  belong to unions and that in the four-year period between 1989 and  1992, the number of workers participating in trade union elections  dropped 14.5 percent.  In contrast, civil service trade unions are  flourishing, with 85 to 90 percent of public workers unionized and  most of them participating in trade union elections.  (Rosa M.  x36287) (Athens TA NEA in Greek 3 May 94 p 51)     ITALY     REACTION TO FEDERAL RESERVE RATE INCREASE--Washington  correspondent Ennio Caretto, writing in the Milan daily CORRIERE  DELLA SERA on 18 May, characterized the Federal Reserve's rate  increase on 17 Nay as a "knockout punch" and as totally unexpected.  Caretto wrote that the Federal Reserve  tried to justify its  "historic change of position"--signalling the end of low-cost money  in the United States--with the necessity to control inflation and  strengthen economic expansion.  According to Caretto, President  Clinton sided with Federal Reserve Chairman Allen Greenspan "but  only formally."  In doing so, Caretto claimed Clinton was trying to  keep his policy disagreement with Greenspan from becoming public and  to dissipate the suspicion that the economy is entering a stagnant  phase.  However, Caretto added, future events may threaten to dispel  Clinton's "forced optimism" and expose the disagreement between the  two, who until now had worked together to reduce the deficit.  Since  Greenspan has frustrated Clinton's policy of lower interest rates,  Caretto said, pursuing the opposite strategy and pulling the whole  system along, Clinton, "finding himself with his back to the wall,  may decide to get rid of the 'friend/enemy' Greenspan."     An article in the Turin daily LA STAMPA on 19 May reported the  comments of new Treasury Minister Lamberto Dlni and others.  According to Dini, Italy and other European countries should not be  concerned about the recent Federal Reserve rate increase because it  was the right decision to control inflation.  The article pointed  out that for once industrialists, bankers, and economists are in  full accord.  Cesare Romiti, Fiat CEO, agrees the decision was  intended to control inflation, while Mario Sarcinelli, president of  the Banca Nazionle del Lavoro (BNL), stated that the rate increase  confirmed the distancing of U.S.'s monetary policy from that of  European central banks.     In Rome's daily LA REPUBBLICA on 18 May, Vincenzo Nigro commented  that not everything is working out as planned for U.S. monetary  policy.  Nigro stated that the Federal Reserve and especially the  Clinton administration have pondered long and hard over the  necessity of cooling off an inflation that does not yet exist.  Many  observers, however, have begun to think that Greenspan is "fighting  a ghost."  If Greenspan sees a ghost, Nigro said, there is not much  Clinton can do about it, despite the fact it may slow down the  economic recovery he was hoping would heat up and strengthen by the  1996 elections.  Since Clinton cannot use government spending to  stimulate the economy, some people believe the peace between him and  Greenspan is destined to be brief, Nigro notes.  He concluded, "This  can only create new problems for the U.S. economy.  It is a vicious  circle."  For this reason, Clinton and his advisers have let it  discreetly be known that they do not understand why Greenspan and  his aides believe interest rate increases are in order. (Anilla B.  x36283)     Arguments Against Government Economic Program--Maurizio  Valentini, writing in Rome's L'ESPRESSO, points out several reasons  why Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's economic program is doomed to  failure, since in Valentini's opinion, all of its provisions would  lead to inflation.  A major aim of the program is to replace  gradually direct taxes with indirect ones.  Experts at the National  Institute for the Study of the Economy (ISC0) say such a move would  cause inflation because each percentage point rise in indirect taxes  adds that percentage point to the price of consumer goods.  In  addition, switching from direct to indirect taxes would immediately  allow the wage earners more money to spend, increasing domestic  demand, which in turn would risk increasing prices.     According to Massimo Russo, head of the European Area of the  International Monetary Fund, "Italy's major economic risk comes from  government spending because budgetary maneuvering room to stimulate  the economy is absolutely nonexistent."  Valentini interprets this  to mean that the only thing Berlusconi can do is to follow the  program set out by the governments of his predecessors Giulio Amato  and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.  However, Valentini doubts Berlusconi can  follow such a rigid plan because the last interest rate drop, which  followed that of the German Bundesbank, will probably be the last  one for a long time, since higher U.S. interest rates will dictate  against another such move.     According to former Industry Minister Paolo Savona, a possible  Berlusconi intervention in the country's economy that was not  strictly tied to improved international competitiveness would only  increase the national debt, which would give the international  markets the "umpteenth proof" of Italian unreliability.  Valentini  stresses how disastrous this would be, after Italy's economic image  took an upswing in the past two years thanks to the policies of  Amato and Ciampi.  This improved international image has brought  foreign capital into the country, alleviating the national debt.  Reversing those policies now would have the opposite effect: less  and more expensive capital.  "In other words, Berlusconi cannot work  an Italian miracle," Valentini concludes, "because the biggest  miracle, that of restoring confidence in the Italian economy, has  already been provided by Amato and Ciampi."

Since the  lira left the EMS in September of 1992, a part of the Italian  economy has been able to export  "massively," with an  "extraordinary" price flexibility, to half of the world's markets,  while other European countries are struggling to export anything.  Although Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has said he is in no hurry  to rejoin the EMS, in a recent radio interview he stated that he was  thinking about it and that current foreign exchange market  conditions indicate it would be possible.  Such a statement, Taino  claims, strikes terror in the hearts of many businessmen and draws  the interest of speculators.     Those who have debated EMS reentry include:     -- Mario Monti, dean of the Bocconi University, who thinks the  lira could reenter on a central parity that would not undervalue it  and that would stimulate Italy's economic structure to become  competitive for its own merits and not thanks to favorable exchange  rates.     -- Innocenzo Cipolletta, director of Confindustria, is convinced  the lira, as it now stands, is compatible with economic and monetary  convergence with other European countries.  However, before  reentering the EMS, he believes Italy's interest rates should be in  line with those of the other member states and not higher, as is now  the case.     -- Bruno Rambaudi, owner of a major machine tool company, said  that leaving the EMS was the element which allowed Italian industry  to remain functional during the recession and to launch a recovery.  He said reentry would be possible if inflation and the cost of money  were realigned with those of other EMS members, the cost of labor  remained under control, and the fight against the deficit continued.     -- Gabriel Stein, an economist with London's Lombard Street  Research company, believes reentering the EMS would be foolish and  finds comfort in the fact that Foreign Minister Antonio Martini is  anti-EMS.  In Stein's opinion, the friction in the government  between the National Alliance and the Northern League could bring on  a crisis at any moment and being in the EMS under these conditions  could prove to be dangerous.  Besides, Stein questions the need to  reenter the EMS since the Italian economy is doing well.     -- Gilberto Gabrielli, a professor at Bocconi University and  manager of one of Milan's major securities houses, said that  Berlusconi's discussion of EMS reentry was more political than  economic.  Gabrielli said that before talking about the virtues of  Europe, he would like to see the economic results of the first half  year.

At  that time, fiscal management was "demoralized and discredited,"  budget deficits had surpassed the most pessimistic forecasts, and  companies used the recession as a pretext to stop their Social  Security contributions.  Additionally, convergence with the EU was  "seriously threatened" by an economic crisis that the former finance  minister had been "totally unable" to manage which resulted in an  "open war" between the ministry and the Bank of Portugal over the  bank's independence in setting monetary policy.     Azevedo comments that Catroga's willingness to acknowledge the  government's responsibility for the recession has earned good will  and that fiscal reform has increased revenues by 250 million contos  in the first quarter of this year.  Moreover, interest rates are  clearly on a downward trend and Catroga is studying various measures  to strengthen the capital market.  Azevedo contends that the "most  radical and obvious" solution is for Bank of Portugal Governor  Miguel Beleza, who has confided to close aides that he will resign  unless the situation improves, to define clearly his institution's  independence and reach a consensus with the government.     An article in the Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE maintains that  tensions continue in the Bank of Portugal between Beleza and those  members of the bank's administrative council appointed by the former  finance minister.  The article claims that Beleza intends to bring  the conflict to Prime Minister Anibel Cavaco Silva's arbitration.  Meanwhile, the bank and the government's forecasts for inflation and  economic growth do not agree; the bank believes inflation will be 6  percent by the end of the year and the government forecasts 4 to 5.5  percent.  Similarly, the Bank of Portugal expects GDP to grow by 1  percent this year while the government forecasts a 1- to 2-percent  growth.

In particular, the steel,  pharmaceuticals, construction, and furniture industries are favored  by the accord.  The eight products on which tariffs will be  completely eliminated (steel, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment,  construction material, farm machinery, furniture, beer, and liquor)  are all areas in which Sweden has a comparative advantage.  These  goods, plus chemicals (where tariffs will be lowered over a 10-year  period), account for 25 percent of Sweden's industrial exports.  The  pharmaceuticals industry, in fact, sells 90 percent of its  production abroad.  Pharmaceuticals exports, which have been hurt by  competition from cheap imitation drugs, will also benefit from new  patent and copyright rules.  Lindstrom also believes that the  Uruguay Round's stricter anti-dumping regulations and new mechanism  for settling disputes will also "make the situation brighter for  Swedish steel companies."  The new methods for resolving  disagreements will make it more difficult for large countries to  discriminate against smaller ones like Sweden, according to  Lindstrom.  Truck and stereo manufacturers and the paper industry  will also benefit from a one-third reduction of tariffs on other  manufactured goods.  (Wendy S. x365O6) (Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET  in Swedish 16 Apr 94 p 30)     STUDY FINDS BOTTLENECKS ENDANGERING RECOVERY--According to a  study by the Industry Association (SI), industrial cutbacks made  during 1990-93 have resulted in bottlenecks which now threaten  Sweden's ongoing economic recovery.  During the recent recession,  many Swedish firms, instead of letting machines lie idle,  disassembled them and sold them abroad, notably to China, Poland and  the Baltic states.  SI head Magnus Lemmel estimates that Sweden lost  about 15 percent of its industrial capacity this way.  As a result,  the percentage of Sweden's GDP contributed by industry has fallen to  about 18 percent--below the OECD requirement for an industrialized  country--and imports have risen drastically as production has moved  overseas.  Industrial investments are now increasing by about 20  percent, but the SI cautions that it may be too late: Even if this  rate of investment continues, it will take about a decade to recoup  the lost capacity.  (Wendy S. x36506) (Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET  in Swedish 4 May 94 p 27)     DANGER OF BRAIN DRAIN CITED--More highly educated Swedes are  being lured out of the country by higher-paying jobs and a greater  salary differential in job rankings.  The head of the Industrial  Research Institute, Gunnar Eliasson, claims that the Swedish wage  differential is too low and that the tax system equalizes income too  much.  According to a study by the consulting firm Human Resources  Services (HRS), a chief executive officer in Sweden makes nine times  as much as an industrial worker; in the United States and Asia this  ratio is 25 to 1.  Workers of the new generation, Eliasson points  out, are more mobile than their predecessors and the European  Economic Area (EEA) agreement will further internationalize the  labor market.  Eliasson predicts a crisis if only "1 percent of the  country's best-educated workers leave."  Anders Tapper of HRS does  not believe the situation is as serious as Eliasson maintains but  does foresee a risk "that companies such as Ericsson, Astra, and  Pharmacia will lose their best researchers."  Tapper also believes  there could be an immigration into Sweden of less-educated workers  willing to work for lower wages.

He noted that  BSEC, a private corporation established and primarily run by Turkey  with Turkish personnel, plays an important role in the country's  foreign policy and stated that the Foreign Ministry was ready to  cooperate and support any commercial efforts undertaken through the  BSEC.  Cetin pointed out that the Black Sea region has a market of  some $300 million with a need for all kinds of goods and with more  modest needs compared with the higher standards required by Western  markets.  He also claimed that the region has remarkable  infrastructure needs, such as harbors, roads, airports,  communication networks, energy systems, pipelines, dams, housing  construction, and tourism, providing Turkish companies with a  variety of business possibilities.

The denial notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation findings show that the workers produced jet aircraft engines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The union states that although imports of jet engines did not decrease absolutely they did increase relative to domestic shipments of jet engines. The union also stated that the production of parts for its jet engines are being manufactured offshore resulting in fewer jobs at Lynn's General Electric plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dominant cause for the downsizing at Lynn was the decrease in the Federal Government's defense budget for jet engines and fewer opportunities to break into the commercial airline business. Lynn's jet engine production was 90 percent military, 10 percent commercial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, less than 5 percent of the jet engine parts are outsourced overseas and this is a growing phenomenon with new orders for customers in other counties in order to sell them jet engines. The Lynn workers never produced the component parts for these new orders. Most of the outsourced component parts are not imported to the U.S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the Department's certifications for Babco Textron (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,716) and Walbar (TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,633) both worker groups met all the statutory criteria for a worker group certification. Both worker groups produce component parts for Lynn's GE engines. A substantial portion of their component work which was produced domestically was outsourced to firms in other countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, D.C., this 11th day of October 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Victor J.

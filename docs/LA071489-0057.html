			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR DROPS EFFORT TO BUY POKER CLUB IN GARDENA  </P> <P> An investor, whose application to the City of Gardena to buy the Horseshoe Club  had run into problems with both the city and with the state attorney general's  office, withdrew the application this week, signaling the demise of the city's  oldest poker club.  </P> <P> Herbert Stern, the former president of the Commerce Casino, asked city  officials Tuesday to withdraw his application for a transfer of the Horseshoe  Club's operating license issued by the city.  </P> <P> Stern declined Thursday to discuss why he requested the withdrawal, but in the  past had objected to conditions set by the city for the transfer.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed not only for myself but for a lot of the employees," Stern  said Thursday. The club had about 75 to 100 employees when it closed for  remodeling on May 23, down from a normal work force of about 250.  </P> <P> Horseshoe General Partner Milton Corwin said the 40-year-old club would not  reopen under the old ownership, and that the 4.4-acre site at Rosecrans and  Vermont Avenues was up for sale as commercial real estate.  </P> <P> City officials said they have received inquiries from potential buyers  interested in the Horseshoe property, a number of whom have expressed interest  in continuing to operate a club at the site.  </P> <P> "Under proper management I think it could be successful" as a club, Mayor  Donald Dear said. "I think it would be a choice corner for any kind of  business."  </P> <P> Corwin did not disclose the asking price for the property, but Stern and a  partner, Los Angeles attorney Leonard Baum, had proposed buying the club, if  the transfer of a city operating license had been approved, for about $4  million.  </P> <P> Corwin said selling the property for commercial development and not as an  operating card club diminishes the value of the property as well as the amount  of the return on the investments of the 91 shareholders, who have owned the  club since 1951.  </P> <P> The closing of the Horseshoe has not adversely affected card club revenues to  the city, said City Manager Kenneth Landau. In fact, card club revenues have  increased, from $308,817 in June, 1988, to $371,493 in June, 1989, city records  show.  </P> <P> City officials and card club players said the city's remaining two clubs, the  Eldorado Club and the Normandie Casino, have taken up the slack.  </P> <P> Lester Mindus, a Gardena psychologist who played at the Horseshoe nearly every  day for eight years, said he had joined other former Horseshoe customers who  now play across Rosecrans Avenue at the Normandie Casino.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Clubs Left  </P> <P> "I'm pretty happy where I am, but it's not the same," Mindus said.  </P> <P> The Normandie's bustling atmosphere is far different, he said, from the  relative emptiness at the Horseshoe during the months before it closed.  </P> <P> "It's sad there are only two clubs where there were once six," Mindus said.  </P> <P> Together in their heyday, Gardena's six poker clubs provided about a third of  the city's revenue.  </P> <P> The Horseshoe was once the most profitable of the casinos, said Tom Parks,  formerly a 25-year Horseshoe employee who is executive vice president of the  Gardena Valley Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "At one time we were the top club in town," Parks said. When Proposition 13  passed in 1978, however, other cities "were strapped for funds and started  looking at (clubs) as a potential revenue raiser."  </P> <P> Gardena's card clubs, after having a monopoly on the market in Los Angeles  County since 1938, began lagging behind newly opened clubs, which offered bars,  a greater variety of games and higher limits.  </P> <P> "Gardena (clubs) eventually did those things, but they were always following  behind what the other clubs were doing," Parks said.  </P> <P> City Councilman Mas Fukai, the council's most vocal critic of the Stern-Baum  buyout proposal, said he was sorry to see the club closed.  </P> <P> "I don't blame anybody except the present management of the Horseshoe Club,"  Fukai said. "They let it run down."  </P> <P> Fukai said the city had been justified in setting stringent financial  conditions for the transfer of the license because the city was protecting its  reputation for closely monitoring its poker clubs.  </P> <P> The plan by Stern and Baum to buy the club encountered problems soon after it  was proposed in March.  </P> <P> In May, the council tabled the application after Stern and Baum balked at  meeting five city demands for the license transfer, including obtaining a $6  million letter of credit and setting up a $180,000 escrow account to cover  employees' pay for four weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Background Investigation  </P> <P> The council tabled the proposal again in June after an investigation of Stern's  background by the city's Police Department revealed discrepancies with Stern's  written application.  </P> <P> Stern said on the application that he had never been a party to a lawsuit, but  the city found that he had been involved in at least two lawsuits. One, filed  in 1984, alleged financial misconduct against the management of the Commerce  Club. He was the president. The suit was later settled out of court.  </P> <P> Baum, who is also Stern's attorney, told the council that the omission of the  lawsuit from the application was an oversight.  </P> <P> Also in June, the state attorney general's office informed city and club  officials that the gaming registration certificates of the club's shareholders  was to expire July 1 and could not be renewed because the club was closed.  </P> <P> Baum told the city council that club officials planned to renew all 91  certificates, but Corwin said Thursday that the shareholders have since been  informed that that plan has been scrapped.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- More than 80 percent of  large and small Japanese firms have set a mandatory retirement  age at 60, reflecting growing corporate willingness to retain  employees for longer periods, according to a government survey  released Sunday [5 June].    The poll by the Management and Coordination Agency, however,  also revealed many companies still resist government  recommendations for post-retirement employment for those willing  to work beyond 60 years of age.    The survey of 40,085 companies with more than 50 workers in  Tokyo, Hokkaido and 15 other prefectures in 1992 shows that 83  percent set the mandatory retirement age at 60, up sharply from  65 percent in 1989, 73 percent in 1990 and 77 percent in 1991.    By size, 95 percent of firms with over 1,000 employees  maintain the policy, compared with 88 percent having 300 to 499  employees and 78 percent for those with 50 to 99 employees, the  survey said.    Of the responding companies, 82 percent have established  post-retirement employment policies, but only 30 percent hire  those workers wishing to stay on past 60.    The survey shows 36 percent of companies with 50 to 99  employees keep all workers wishing to stay on the payroll. The  comparable figure for big firms is only 9 percent.</p>

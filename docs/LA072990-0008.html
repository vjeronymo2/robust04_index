			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTING TARGET HOLLYWWOD;  </P> <P> THE ETHICS OF EXPOSING CELEBRITIES' SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS  </P> <P> What we as gay people are fighting is invisibility. Recently, ABC bowed to  pressure from its sponsors (including Pillsbury and Toys 'R' Us) and will not  rerun the episode of "thirtysomething" that includes a humanly dimensioned gay  character.  </P> <P> This is the kind of attempt at rendering us invisible that created a need for  outing in the first place.  </P> <P> Ultimately, perhaps just getting people to recognize that a lot of the people  around them, including their movie, TV and sports idols might be gay will help  to break down prejudices and we can all get on with the important things, like  fighting AIDS instead of each other.  </P> <P> THOMAS SIEGEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Television adverts for children defended A ban on television advertisements during children's programmes would be an 'unwarranted curtailment of freedom' as well as removing funding for such programmes, a report warns today The study was commissioned by the Advertising Association and conducted by Professor Patrick Barwise of the London Business School. It was commissioned after a call last year from the National Food Alliance for the government to consider an advertising ban during children's television. The alliance - a research and lobbying group supported by, among others, the British Dental Association, trade unions, the Institute of Child Health, and the National Farmers' Union - said it was concerned about the effect of TV advertisements on children's diet. The alliance said advertisements for children were dominated by sugary and fatty foods, such as pre-sweetened cereals, confectionery, fast foods and soft drinks 'which neither encourage healthy choices nor promote a varied and healthy diet'. Prof Barwise's report accuses the alliance of publishing a 'poorly researched and one-sided' document. He rejects its claim that advertising is a strong influence on children's consumption of particular types of food and drink. 'What advertisers try to do is encourage people to choose their brand. This has little or no effect on total category sales.' Ms Sue Dibb, author of the alliance's report, said of the Advertising Association's study: 'I've heard the arguments many times before - they tend to be trotted out when the advertisers are under attack.'

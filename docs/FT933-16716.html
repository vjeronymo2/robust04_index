			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Export bankers settle interest-rate row A LONG-STANDING row between the government and British export bankers was defused yesterday. The row has concerned proposed cuts in the interest support intended to compensate export bankers for the cost of arranging financing packages for overseas projects. The banks are to receive reduced support, but believe higher levels of export activity will make up for the loss. News of a deal came in an answer to a parliamentary question by Mr Richard Needham, minister for trade. At issue have been proposed cuts in the margins of fixed- rate export finance - called Frefs by bankers. These were cut sharply five years ago in the wake of criticisms by the comptroller and auditor general that they were not necessary to secure overseas contracts, and were not of benefit to the economy. As the government has pressed for further cuts as part of its spending cuts, bankers have argued the last round of cuts had already prompted a steady withdrawal of bank support for exporters. Also, large exporters have expressed concern about the 'dwindling band' of banks able to support their export efforts. New Fref rates will range from just under 0.5 of a percentage point to 0.7, depending on the life of a loan and the currency it is denominated in. This amounts to a cut of just over  1/8 of a point, though bankers were quick to point out yesterday that the lion's share of the cut had been made possible at no cost to themselves because the government had abandoned a 1/8 of a point margin for potential mismatches between sterling, and loans raised in foreign currencies. Mr Philip Hills, managing director of Samuel Montagu Export and Project Finance, said: 'We generally agree that we have a fair deal. There have been some very good things the Department of Trade has been able to achieve in terms of enhanced export credit cover, and adjustments to premium rates. The banks took the view there would be higher volumes of business to compensate for lower margins.' The new five-year agreement is expected to start on Monday.</p>

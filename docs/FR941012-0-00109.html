			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e)(1) deals with general requirements for all hand and portable powered tools. At paragraph (e)(1)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to assure that each hand and portable powered tool is maintained in serviceable condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the tool is provided by the employer or employee. This paragraph adopts the proposed provision. All State logging standards contain similar requirements about the maintenance of logging tools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66). These commenters supported the need for tools to be properly maintained. One commenter said that lack of proper maintenance of chain saws contributes to a number of accidents (Ex. 5&hyph;35). However, most of the commenters stated that the maintenance of tools that are supplied by employees should be the employees' responsibility (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;66).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We feel that it is not reasonable and it is burdensome to logging companies to have to be responsible for the condition and safety of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> employee's own tools. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  We feel very strongly that there should be a recognition of one's individual responsibility in this area. A more general statement might be appropriate in this item simply stating that ``tools shall be properly maintained so as to assure safe operation and shall be used only for their intended purpose and design'' (Ex. 5&hyph;39). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA does not agree with these commenters. OSHA believes that the Agency's reasoning in including a maintenance provision in the PPE section applies here as well (See summary and explanation of paragraph (d)(1)(i)). The requirement for employers to assure that tools are maintained in a serviceable condition does not prohibit the employer from allowing an employee to inspect, maintain and repair tools he provides. The employer's responsibilities for compliance with standards and for safe working conditions that the OSH Act imposes, applies even if the employee provides the tools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph is meant to be viewed in conjunction with paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that requires inspection of tools before they are used in each workshift. As discussed above, ``serviceable condition'' is the state or ability of a tool to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(1)(ii), OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is inspected before initial use during each work shift. This paragraph also specifies the minimum elements to be inspected, such as chain brakes, handles, guards, and controls, to assure that the tools are functioning properly. In the proposed standard, OSHA specified that hand tools be checked during use to ensure continued serviceability. The proposed rule also required chain saws to be ``frequently'' inspected. The proposed rule also contained elements that must be included in hand tool inspections. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required periodic inspection of tools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received comments on these provisions. Some commenters recommended that OSHA establish the frequency that tools, such as chain saws, should be inspected (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53). One commenter objected to inspection of chain saws: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for chain saws to be ``frequently inspected'' should be clarified further. How often is frequently and who would be responsible for the inspections? (Ex. 5&hyph;39). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns. First, OSHA explicitly identifies the required frequency for inspection of tools. Second, nothing in the final rule prohibits the employer from allowing the tool user or operator to conduct the workshift inspection, provided that such inspection and the required content of the inspection are accomplished in the manner and time frame specified by OSHA. Finally, the standard specifies the minimum elements that must be covered by the inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is used only for purposes for which it has been designed. OSHA has adopted the provision from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. OSHA received only one comment on this provision that supported its inclusion (Ex. 5&hyph;39).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Japan tackles growing drugs bill: Attempts to control a big part of rising healthcare costs Japan's ministry of health and welfare has been afflicted by the global epidemic of rising healthcare costs. The problem this makes for budgets is particularly acute in Japan which has an ageing population and falling tax receipts. Whereas in 1990 only 11.7 per cent of the population was over 65 - the lowest proportion among the world's seven richest countries - by 2025 that figure will have more than doubled to nearly 24 per cent. This ageing population and medical inflation running at about 7 per cent a year would be less serious if the Japanese economy was growing. But the exchequer is suffering from wilting tax receipts during the worst recession since the second world war. 'We don't know exactly what the ministry is going to do,' says Ms Teruko Onoda, drugs analyst at Merrill Lynch, says. 'But whatever it is will have to be drastic.' Japan's health and welfare ministry, like those elsewhere, has found the drugs bill a tempting target for savings. Medicines represent a particularly large target in Japan. Although pharmaceuticals account for 1.5 per cent of gross national product, they represent about 30 per cent of healthcare spending, far more than in western countries. The ministry has adopted a two-prong strategy against the drugs bill, attacking both prices and demand. The ministry's long-term aim is to reduce spending on medicines from about 28 per cent of the Y24,340bn (Pounds 146bn) health bill to only 20 per cent, according to the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The ministry is continuing its policy of cutting prices every two years. But this year it has added 'special' cuts for fast-growing products. Initial fears that the price of some drugs could be cut by as much as 30 per cent have not been realised, but these new cuts have nonetheless drawn an angry response from the industry. Mr Jacques Racloz, president of Sandoz Yakuhin, the subsidiary of the Swiss group, said: 'The special price cuts were an emotional reaction, triggered by politics. It's worrying because they're not based on the existing system and appears arbitrary. There's also a danger they could represent a precedent - each time a drug becomes successful, it could be hammered.' Under the every-other-year price cutting scheme introduced two years ago, drugs judged innovative would be allowed a premium over existing therapies of up to 30 per cent, while less innovative but still novel compounds would receive premiums of between 1.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. The industry was dismayed to discover the ministry's criteria were so strict that over the last decade only four or five drugs would have qualified for the full premium. 'We have to have more flexibility,' said Mr Bryan Wright, Japan representative of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. 'There needs to be something between 30 per cent and the lower band. Otherwise there's little incentive to develop innovative products.' While the price cuts and controls on new products are designed to have an immediate impact, in the longer term, the ministry is trying to control demand for medicines. So far, the main methods, which have not proved particularly successful, are: Separating the prescribing and dispensing of medicines. A substantial proportion of hospitals' income comes through dispensing. Doctors negotiate discounts from wholesalers, but are reimbursed by the government at the full price. The more doctors prescribe, the higher their income. Between a third and a quarter of doctors' earnings depend on prescribing. Discounts ending up in doctors' pockets may account for an astonishing Y1,000bn a year, according to one analyst. So far the ministry's efforts have made little impression. Only 15 per cent of hospitals have separated prescribing from dispensing of medicines and many of these are cheating by setting up new pharmacies next door. Fixed price contracts for chronic care of the elderly. Hospitals are paid a fixed amount for treating certain conditions. The hospitals' margins therefore depend on keeping down costs. Some analysts believe this could lead to a large increase in the prescribing of cheap generic, non-patented, drugs. However, only 5 per cent of hospitals have adopted this system. Switching responsibility for negotiating discounts from the drugs manufacturers to the wholesalers. The theory is that wholesalers will be less inclined than pharmaceuticals companies to discount products. This should reduce doctors' margins on prescribing and so reduce volumes. The Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association estimates discounts narrowed from 23 per cent to 18 per cent, but have now risen back to about 20 per cent. Even though the demand-side controls are yet to be fully effective, the ministry's efforts appear to be bearing fruit. By the middle of last year, data from IMS Japan, the market research group, showed growth of the drugs market over a 12-month moving period was only 3 per cent. Nevertheless, the ministry's continuing battle to control spending is likely to intensify, slowing the growth of the Japanese drugs market further. For manufacturers the consequent pain may be hard to bear. Most analysts are predicting rationalisation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The court has handed down sentences in three of the  fives cases of copyright violation under the 1978 Copyright Law.  The cases are being watched by the United States as criteria to  judge whether or not Thailand should be removed from the U.S.  Priority Watch List.    Reporting on the matter, Deputy Commerce Minister Chulin  Laksanawisit said the five cases of copyright violation are of  great interests to foreigners. He said the court so far had  ruled on three cases. The Macalpine Company is subjected to a  fine of 80,000 baht and one-year probation pending a jail term  of eight months. The three defendants in the Robot case were  subjected to a fine of 35,000 baht each, but the sum was reduced  to half because they all confessed. The Sky Company was  subjected to a fine of 200,000 baht and one-year probation  pending a prison term of one year. Two other cases, the Super  Peacock and the MBK cases, are still under the hearing of  plaintiff witnesses.    The five cases, in addition to the copyright bill which is  to  be approved by the parliament, are being used by the United  States as conditions to decide whether to remove Thailand from  the Priority Watch List.</p>

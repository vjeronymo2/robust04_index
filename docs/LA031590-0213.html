			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: THE NEWS CHALLENGE: L.A.'S NEW ETHNIC MIX;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: NO STATION HAS AS YET BECOME THE MAINSTREAM VOICE OF MINORITIES,  SUCH AS LATINOS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND BLACKS, WHO ARE RAPIDLY TURNING INTO THE  MAJORITY.  </P> <P> It had to be embarrassing.  </P> <P> From 10 to 11 p.m. Monday, KCAL Channel 9's ballyhooed, $30-million news  operation and its $1-million anchor, Jerry Dunphy, averaged less than a 1  rating, according to the A.C. Nielsen research firm.  </P> <P> To be exact, it scored a 0.6 rating, which means only about 30,000 TV homes in  the Greater Los Angeles area watched the final third of KCAL's nightly,  three-hour prime-time newscast.  </P> <P> KCAL's share of the audience for that final hour averaged 1%, which meant that  only one out of every 100 homes with the TV on was watching Channel 9.  </P> <P> And on Tuesday, there was further embarrassment in the same hour. While the  numbers were up slightly to a 1.2 rating and 2% share, the last quarter hour  sank to a 0.2 and a zero share in the Arbitron statistics -- suggesting  strongly that virtually nobody in L.A. was tuned in.  </P> <P> By contrast, KTLA Channel 5's regular 10 to 11 p.m. news on Monday, anchored by  Hal Fishman, scored a 6.3 Nielsen rating, which translates to about 300,000 TV  homes -- 10 times the audience of the new, Disney-owned KCAL operation. On  Tuesday, KTLA pulled a 5.6.  </P> <P> What to do if you're KCAL? Throw up your hands? Of course not. The 11-day-old  newscast is simply getting an ultra-fast lesson in the killer competition of  L.A.'s television market, which is increasingly mercurial. As many people move  farther and farther from the city's core, viewing priorities change. In  addition, a new multi-ethnic influx has dramatically altered the makeup of the  Southland audience.  </P> <P> It's a challenge to all of L.A.'s TV stations as their overall ratings slide.  And while they promise to increase coverage in outlying areas, none has really  taken the bold step of breaking from the pack and becoming the definitive  mainstream TV station of the new Los Angeles -- where minorities such as  Latino, Asian-Americans and blacks are turning into the majority.  </P> <P> The 1990 census figures, when they eventually come out, may cause significant  changes in local TV coverage because the new population trends will be  officially confirmed and established, a solid advertising base and a reason for  editorial adjustments.  </P> <P> Curiously, KCAL, despite its expected rough start -- and if Disney stands  behind it -- may well be in the best possible position to seize the initiative  in covering the new L.A. because it is not locked into the formats and  traditions of the past. If it's going to get whipped -- and it will -- while  growing, it might as well put its money on the future of L.A. with a nightly  newscast that simply looks different from the past.  </P> <P> "We're looking at the diversity and richness of this entire area," says KCAL  News Director Bob Henry.  </P> <P> And, though a fledgling on the L.A. scene, KCAL nonetheless debuted with an  utterly wonderful report that epitomized exactly the direction the station  should be taking -- a story of Vietnamese, which had to be moving not only to  those who came here from their homeland, but also to all of us. For the new  L.A. is changing our daily experiences.  </P> <P> KCAL's Vietnamese report was extraordinary for what it promised, perhaps  accidentally. Launching a five-part series, it offered a 7-minute report --  ideal for the roomy, three-hour format -- that included emotional scenes of  Vietnamese children talking through tears in their own language. The stroke of  genius was letting them go on and on, without translation. Kids sound the same  in any language, reporter David Jackson said wisely.  </P> <P> If you were Vietnamese and living in L.A., you might well have been thinking:  This is a station I must look at again. And if you were an old-time Angeleno,  trying to keep up with the new L.A., you couldn't help feel a bit more plugged  in.  </P> <P> Of course, there are countless TV reports of L.A.'s so-called Third World  melting pot, often dealing with its problems. Television stations are adept at  focusing on gangs, drugs and misery -- only the faces change.  </P> <P> But what is missing is the textured reporting that paints a day-in, day-out  portrait of what is happening around us, the less sensational but significant  developments that are remaking our city. What more perfect place for such  reporting than a three-hour prime-time newscast? What an opportunity for a TV  station to build a new audience -- a new constituency -- all its own.  </P> <P> No one's doing it, though, among the major stations. But there are signs of  awakening.  </P> <P> "I think the Hispanic community's a third of viewership in the whole viewing  area," says KCBS Channel 2 News Director Michael Singer. "We're about to do  Spanish simulcasts for our 5 and 6 p.m. news to begin with, in the next few  months. And we just hired Mike O'Connor, a former CBS reporter who's fluent in  Spanish and who'll cover immigrant life in Los Angeles on an ongoing basis, and  that doesn't exclude other groups such as Asians."  </P> <P> Singer adds that in-depth reports on the impact of L.A.'s growing ethnic scene  are "a good idea. We don't do enough of those stories in any neighborhood,  whether minority or not. Frankly, it's our loss that we don't. It diminishes  our newscasts. There's a kind of thinness. We don't have enough resources.  We're constantly doing the news stories of the day."  </P> <P> KCAL's Henry isn't certain about how much of a beat to make "the new L.A. But  we're looking for areas in town that are underreported or aren't often on  television. We would hope to give a richer profile, more texture, more depth.  We have the resources, the people."  </P> <P> Ratings figures on the minority viewing audience in the Greater Los Angeles  area are compelling. For Latinos, they range from 21% to 28% of TV homes in  various surveys, but some feel Singer's 33% estimate is closer to the truth and  that the 1990 census may indicate it is higher than imagined. A ratings survey  also says that blacks make up about 9% of TV homes.  </P> <P> Figures for the Asian-American TV audience also vary, mainly because there are  so many different communities with different languages. But statistics in a  1988 survey suggest the size of the potential audience by offering rough  estimates of some Asian-American groups in just Los Angeles County -- 350,000  Filipinos, at least 300,000 Koreans, 188,000 Japanese, 170,000 Chinese, 110,000  Thais, 60,000 Samoans, 50,000 Cambodians, 42,000 Vietnamese and 30,000  Laotians.  </P> <P> KTLA News Director Jeff Wald says, "We hired a planning editor not only for  advance stories but to look into areas where we were weak, and also ethnic  communities, the emerging L.A. We do a lot of marketing research and find there  are opportunities to increase our audience. When we have to cover a gang story  or tragedy, we try to cover two or three more positive things in the area."  </P> <P> TV coverage of L.A. minority communities has a history of inadequacy. In 1983,  a tornado that roared through South-Central L.A. got absurdly insufficient  attention from local stations; if it had hit Rodeo Drive, they would have  pulled programs for hours and been all over the story. To this day, inadequacy  remains; KCAL's Pat Harvey is the only regular weeknight anchor on a major L.A.  station who is black.  </P> <P> But some things are changing. KSCI Channel 18 has blossomed as a station that  caters to the area's exploding international population, especially  Asian-Americans. On Monday night at 9, for instance, it will offer a live  broadcast of the Jimmie Awards, which "acknowledge the depiction of  Asian/Pacific Americans in a balanced and realistic light."  </P> <P> In 1988, CBS made a far-sighted pilot for a TV drama series -- "Fort Figueroa,"  in which an Iowa family lost its farm and inherited an L.A. apartment building  with Vietnamese and Latino tenants. Directed by Luis Valdez and starring  Charles Haid, it had a wonderful script that caught the change that was in the  air here. Unfortunately, the show didn't sell, but it had vision.  </P> <P> And vision is the key to producing L.A.'s winning TV news coverage of the  1990s. All that's needed now is for a far-sighted station to see the future and  grab it, because it's already upon us.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS WANT CELIBACY AS SOLE AIDS LESSON  </P> <P> Angry parents who say sexual abstinence should be the sole method of AIDS  prevention taught to their children are challenging plans by the Los Angeles  school district to revamp AIDS education.  </P> <P> During a public hearing Monday, the parents voiced opposition to discussions of  safe sex or graphic descriptions of how the AIDS virus is transmitted. The  parents also complained that they are not adequately represented on a task  force that is charged with evaluating the curriculum and recommending changes.  </P> <P> Rachel Martinez of Pacoima, whose 13 grandchildren attend district schools,  said she was unaware until several weeks ago about some of the more explicit  sexual descriptions used to teach children about AIDS. The district should stop  treating parents like "a bunch of dummies" and leave sex education to parental  discretion, she said.  </P> <P> The task force, composed of parents, district administrators, medical experts,  health teachers, members of the gay community and others, is sifting through  mountains of information and is expected to make its recommendation to the  school board by January.  </P> <P> Alfred S. Moore, an assistant school superintendent and coordinator of the task  force, responded to the complaints by stressing that his group is collecting  information from a "full spectrum of divergent views" and has reached no  conclusions. Moore said abstinence is already stressed in the existing  curriculum.  </P> <P> AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases have been discussed in health  classes since 1986, when the district developed a model program that has been  adopted by other school systems, said Ruth Rich, the district's instructional  specialist for health education.  </P> <P> Students must obtain signed letters of parental consent before attending  classes in which they are taught how AIDS is transmitted and ways to prevent  infection. In addition, condoms are available to high school students at three  on-site health clinics run by the district, Erlich said.  </P> <P> Some of those at the hearing criticized the district for including the gay  community on its task force.  </P> <P> "Going to the gay and lesbian community and asking for input about sex  education is like going to a bar and asking a drunk how to stop drinking; it's  totally irresponsible," said Fabian Asensio, a citizen member of the task force  from Sherman Oaks. He urged that the district teach students to remain celibate  until marriage.  </P> <P> Another member of the task force defended the teaching of safe sex and AIDS  prevention. "We're not saying, 'Kids go out and have sex,' " she said.  </P> <P> "Abstinence . . . is always desired. (But) there's also the reality that not  all kids will follow that. Therefore . . . you try to give them some  guidelines."  </P></p>

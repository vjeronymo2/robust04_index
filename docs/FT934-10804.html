			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (7): New curbs concern foreign banks - Banking IT took just one well-intentioned directive from the UAE central bank to change the complexion of future business opportunities for Dubai's foreign banking community. Until October 16, there seemed no reason why loan assets, deposits and profits should not have increased over the next 15 months more or less as they had since the beginning of last year - for foreign banks as well as for the five locally-incorporated banks which originate and do most of their business in Dubai. But the five local banks - in common with the stronger local banks throughout the Emirates - are not affected by the central bank directive in anything like the same degree as their foreign counterparts. The bombshell for foreign banks came with the announcement of new rules setting a limit on loans to single borrowers or group of related borrowers at 7 per cent of a bank's capital base. A key clause of the central bank's directive identified a bank's capital base as the same as that used for capital adequacy purposes based on the 1988 ruling of the Basel committee of the Bank for International Settlements. This stipulated that banks worldwide had to have an adequacy of 8 per cent capital relative to risk assets, to ensure they had enough capital to cope with a crisis. The calculation of total advances to customers is graded according to the type of advance - a straightforward loan counts as a 100 per cent advance while a letter of credit counts for less. The UAE and other Gulf states except Saudi Arabia were listed as high risk country borrowers. And even though the UAE is claiming average capital adequacy among its banks of 10 per cent - 2 per cent higher than that required by the Basel Committee - it is not, yet, accepted by the Basel committee on a par with Saudi Arabia or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The latest UAE central bank restrictions follows a long list of regulations issued since 1985 when UAE banks paid the price for some poor-quality loan assets, and were either forcibly merged by emirate government decree or bailed out with an injection of fresh capital. In Dubai - as in Abu Dhabi - the combination of forced mergers and new capital enabled new management, with support from the emirate government, to start clawing back bad debts. Mr Sultan Al-Suweidi, the UAE central bank governor, probably has more experience of this kind of exercise than all the other UAE bank managing directors. Starting in 1982 with Abu Dhabi Investment Company, Mr Al-Suweidi went on to manage the Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank which had burned its fingers in Saudi Arabia; and finally to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank which inherited the problems left over from the three banks from which it was created. Even without the BCCI fiasco, it would be understandable, as foreign bankers in Dubai are the first to acknowledge, if Mr Al-Suweidi has a bee in his bonnet about the quality of loan assets. Ironically for Dubai, a city-state which prides itself on its laissez-faire approach, there now remains only one commercial bank out of five Dubai-registered banks which has no government shareholding. This is the Bank of Oman (renamed MashreqBank on October 1 for reasons of internal strategy. All the others - the National Bank of Dubai, Emirates Bank International (EBI), Middle East Bank (MEB), and Commercial Bank of Dubai - are either owned outright by the government or majority-owned by it. EBI is 80 per cent government-owned, and EBI in turn owns 98 per cent of Middle East Bank. None of these banks will have any serious problem with the central bank circular. Mr Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, MashreqBank's chief executive officer, pointed out his bank's capital adequacy was 17 per cent. After two years of planned restructuring leading up to the change in name, its 1992 return on assets was 2.1 per cent and 21 per cent on shareholders funds. Its liquidity ratio was also high at 41 per cent. Profits last year exceeded Dh200m, up more than 40 per cent from 1991. Eighty per cent of these derived from its home base, Dubai; the balance from its branches overseas in New York, London, Hong Kong and four other countries. EBI is itself the result of government intervention in three former local banks which were bailed out between 1983 and 1985. The bank, applying lessons learned from the past, has its own internal credit restrictions which, according to Mr Anis Al Jallaf, managing director and chief executive officer, confine lending to below central bank limits. However, with shareholders' funds of Dh1.17bn, the 7 per cent limit would still amount to Dh80m. Mr Al Jallaf is somewhat sympathetic to the position foreign banks now find themselves in. He says: 'UAE national banks abroad can lend according to the capital base of their group and work according to a country limit.' He and others interpret the central bank's directive as a warning shot across the bows of smaller, less viable banks to find more capital and merge. The dilemma for foreign banks is all the more acute in that much of their sizeable exposure is to contractors and traders dealing on a large scale. They require cash facilities, guarantees and letters of credit which can amount to one third or more of the value of a contract. If the credit limitation is not modified, they would have to go to a syndicate of banks rather than to one alone - much more expensive and time-consuming. One foreign banker's reaction to the central bank circular was blunt: 'If the central bank wants to get rid of foreign banks, it is going about it the right way.' Business prospects are favourable enough, however, and foreign banks are likely to stay even if between now and January 1, when the directive starts coming into force, they do everything they can to get the central bank to amend its directive. Most of the 13 larger foreign banks have branches or are based in Dubai. Their combined balance sheets for 1992 showed net profits soaring by some 32 per cent over 1991 to almost Dh300m. Loans and deposits were up 11.5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. British Bank of the Middle East reported profits up 17 per cent compared with 1991; Standard Chartered up 26 per cent; Citibank almost double the profits of the previous year. Official figures show that loans by foreign banks accounted for more than half their assets; those by local banks at 40 per cent. If the central bank would accept that foreign banks could use their head office or parent's global capital base as a yardstick, that, said one foreign banker, would solve their immediate problem. Another possible solution is for the bank's head office to increase capital funds allocated to the UAE central bank as an interest-free deposit. If neither of these two is acceptable to the central bank then one banker suggested larger loans would go onto the books of off-shore banks, away from UAE rules. The deadline for reporting large exposure is March 31 next year, but extensions can be granted until the end of 1995. If the UAE economy in general, and Dubai's in particular, remain buoyant, it is more than likely that foreign banks will stay for a slice of the business.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: Total share offer well oversubscribed THE FRENCH government's FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.8bn) sale of shares in the Total oil group, by far the biggest issue so far in France's partial privatisation programme, has been healthily oversubscribed. The finance ministry announced it received 27m applications for the 8m shares on offer to French investors and 14.9m applications from foreign investors, almost twice as many as the number of shares allocated to them. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, described the sale as 'a great success'. He said the response from investors reflected 'their positive views of Total's development'. When the issue is completed, the French government will have reduced its holding in Total - and that of state-controlled institutions - from 34 to 15 per cent. The state will directly hold 5 per cent of the group with the remaining public sector stake divided among such institutions as the Assurances Generales de France insurance group and the Credit Lyonnais bank. The healthy response to the domestic issue means the state will exercise its clawback powers by adding an extra 750,000 shares, originally earmarked for international investors, to the tranche reserved for the French. When the government first unveiled details of the Total sale it stressed it would only proceed if market conditions were favourable. Last year it was forced to postpone its planned sale of shares in the Elf Aquitaine energy group because of the weakness of the Paris stock market. Mr Sapin said the success of the Total issue justified his confidence in the market. The French government is now expected to proceed with the rest of its partial privatisation programme which will include the state-controlled insurance groups.</p>

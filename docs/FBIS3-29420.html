			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has raised objections to the United  States, which has made firm its plan to initiate procedures for  imposing sanctions against Japan on the issue of U.S. access to  Japan's market for automobile and portable telephones. The  government has complained that "since Japan has faithfully  complied with agreements made with the United States, it is hard  to understand why sanctions should be imposed," (as stated by an  official of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications).  Should the United States actually initiate sanctions against  Japan, the government plans to consider taking its case to the  GATT. However, to avoid an all-out confrontation, the  government also plans to promptly work out a "comprehensive  surplus-cutting and market opening program" (tentative name) to  accelerate market opening and reduction of Japan's current  account surplus.    On the afternoon of 15 February (early morning of 16  February, Japan time), the U.S. Government, in accordance with  Article 1377 of its Trade Act, ruled that "Japan has violated a  bilateral accord concluded in 1989" regarding Japan's market for  automobile and portable telephones. There has grown a strong  likelihood that the U.S. Government will subsequently initiate  procedures for imposing sanctions. Japan is "prepared to appeal  to the GATT should sanctions be initiated," (as stated by  Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese ambassador to the United States), by  the United States through such measures as levying punitive  tariffs on certain Japanese items.    The government is also determined to reject numerical  targets  the U.S. Government wants Japan to accept so that the U.S.  Motorola Inc.'s transmission system for mobile phones will  become more widespread in Japan. Whether this system, which is  handled by the Nippon Ido Tsushin Corporation (IDO), will become  popular is a question that would depend on business decisions  that private firms will make. Therefore, the government plans  to break the deadlocked situation on the basis of discussions  between private firms.    However, both Japan and the United States hope to avoid a  "battle of reciprocal sanctions," (as stated by U.S. President  Bill Clinton), at all costs because the entire Japanese economy  would be seriously affected, should the United States further  wave its "let-the-yen-rise negotiating card."    For this reason, the government plans to once again seek  U.S.  understanding of Japanese efforts by compiling a comprehensive  program to reduce its surplus and open its markets. At a  cabinet meeting held on the morning of 15 February, Tsutomu  Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister,  Chikara Sakaguchi, labor minister, and other ministers pointed  out the need for such a program. The government is considering  plans to announce this program as being undertaken at Japan's  own initiative.    Details of the program will now be worked out mainly by  relevant ministries. The program is expected to include such  plans as stricter application of the Antimonopoly Law and  further deregulation, in addition to the improvement in  procedures regarding government procurement -- on which  agreement has already been made at the Japan-U.S. framework  trade talks.    Since the United States is further pressuring Japan to open  its markets and reduce its surplus through a two-pronged  strategy of sanctions and encouragement of yen appreciation, it  seems Japan will have to work out its comprehensive program  before the July summit meeting of major industrialized nations  (Naples summit).</p>

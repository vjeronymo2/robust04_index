			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Presidential hopefuls resort to invective WHILE US voters hunt desperately for someone to lead them out of the economic slump, the candidates for both Republican and Democratic presidential nominations have set about proving that it is easier to attack what your opponent stands for than to say what you stand for yourself. Mr Patrick Buchanan, the former Nixon speechwriter who has honed his invective through years of practice as a pugnacious television commentator, has lifted his attack on President George Bush an octave higher in an effort to inflict further damage on the president in a series of southern states. Mr Buchanan countered a Bush campaign television advertisement challenging his opposition to the Gulf War with an onslaught on President Bush for allowing the federal government to finance 'pornographic and blasphemous art' through the National Endowment for the Arts - long a target for the Republican right. His challenge could seriously damage President Bush in the south, with polls suggesting that he could win 37 per cent of the Republican vote in Georgia on March 3, matching his score in New Hampshire last week. Among the Democrats, meanwhile, the campaign has become even more vindictive, as the current frontrunner, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, provides a target for his three main challengers. All the candidates are desperate for a win in one of the seven states, including Georgia, Maryland, Colorado and Minnesota, that are to cast their votes on Tuesday. They hope for a springboard to propel them into four more ballots next Saturday and the 11-state 'Super Tuesday' on March 10. Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa both challenged Mr Clinton's 'electability' because of the allegations of adultery and draft-dodging that have dogged his campaign. But it was Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost part of his leg in Vietnam, who led the charge with an assault on Mr Clinton's escape from the Vietnam war draft. Two weeks ago, Mr Kerrey said Mr Clinton's draft record should not be a campaign issue. His campaign advisers have now decided, however, that if they can damage Mr Clinton enough in Georgia and the South - where he has been expected to win overwhelmingly - Mr Kerrey will be left as the only credible nominee. In this year's campaign the candidates started to build their campaigns so late that all are short of funds and organisation. Desperate for an early victory to enable them to raise more money and stay in the race, they now appear ready to stoop lower than they might initially have hoped.</p>

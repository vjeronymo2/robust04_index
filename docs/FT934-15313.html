			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (12): Drive for investment  -Halle seeks to be self-sustaining AMONG the more pessimistic economists on eastern Germany, there is a school of thought which argues that the five new eastern states will be relegated to the status of Mezzogiorno. That is, their economies will be akin to southern Italy, or indeed the southern republics of the former Yugoslavia, devoid of an indigenous economic and industrial base, and completely dependent on the richer north to subsidise and sustain them. If this theory is applied to Halle in particular, or eastern Germany as a whole, then the conclusion is that there is no prospect of the region moving towards a self-sustaining economy. Don't tell that to the people of Halle. Not only because they would be deeply offended - and depressed. It is difficult enough, coming to terms with high unemployment. But they would point out that the Mezzogiorno theory should not have, and cannot have, any credibility in a region of eastern Germany so traditionally strong in finance, commerce, and the arts. A walk around the city explains why. Starting from Marktplatz, the city's old town square, you see fine, elegant town houses built in the 19th century, which were homes to the city's former business community. That community, specialising in industry, developed a local banking and trading system which used the Rathaus or city hall, to lobby their interests. Walk across the town square and you will see the Rathaus - just about. It is currently decked with scaffolding, undergoing a much-needed refurbishment. Go past the Rathaus and ramble down towards Number 5, George-Schumann-Platz. There you will come across the Industrie und Handelskammer, or IHK, the co-ordinating body for trade and commerce which has branches all over Germany. Halle's own IHK branch was originally established on this site more than a century ago. History interrupted its work. After the second world war, the local communist party used the IHK as its headquarters - despite the interior design, whose fine woodwork, engravings, and imperial emblems contrasted sharply with the party's hammer and sickle. Three years after unification, the IHK has regained its rightful place. It is now a thriving centre, set on promoting the city as a Standort, or location, for investment. 'Halle. Der Standort', may seem an ambitious slogan for the city's drive to attract investment. But then, apart from its old industrial base, it is easy to forget that one of the keys to western Germany's post-war economic success was the way in which the government forged close links between research institutes, universities and enterprises. These links, which earlier had helped forge Germany's own industrial revolution in the 1890s, were used for ideological purposes by the former eastern German communist regime. But once again they are playing a greater role in training a younger generation for the market economy. Mr Klaus Rauen, the mayor, is determined to link local industry with the centres of higher education. At his disposal he has the Martin-Luther University, the respected School for Art and Design at Giebichenstein, the Environment Research Centre, and the Institute for Economic Forecasting, one of the six economic think-tanks which advises Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But Halle is now only about commerce and the drive to restore its economy. Unbelievably for a city of 300,000 inhabitants, it has an opera house, four theatres, one concert hall, six museums, the great Gallery Moritzburg and a respected orchestra. You won't be bored in Halle. But there are two warnings. At rush hour, avoid driving into Halle on the motorway from Leipzig. The congestion is horrific. And, to avoid upsetting your hosts, don't ask if Halle is akin to the Mezzogiorno. The people of Halle have a long memory, and a 1,000 year-old history.</p>

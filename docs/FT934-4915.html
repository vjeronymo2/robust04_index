			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Extension to gift replacement - Tax relief The period for replacement of lifetime gifts of property qualifying for business or agricultural relief has been extended from one to three years for charges arising as a result of deaths on or after today. The Chancellor's intention is to bring the replacement period for business and agricultural relief into line with that for capital gains tax rollover relief. Where someone receives a lifetime gift of business or agricultural property, the property can be sold and, provided it is replaced within a year, business or agricultural relief will be available in the normal way. The extension to three years is in line with that for capital gains tax rollover relief. Sections 113 and 124 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 provide that when a lifetime gift of property qualifying for business or agricultural relief is made less than seven years before the donor's death, the donee loses relief if he or she sells the property within that period. However, relief is still available if the donee acquires a qualifying replacement property within one year of the sale. The new rules will give donees more time to do so. The Chancellor also proposes to make two improvements in the taxation rules affecting debts given up by creditors in the context of voluntary arrangements made under the 1986 Insolvency Act. The rules will be amended to make it easier for a creditor to obtain relief for trade debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement. For the debtor, the amount given up by a creditor will no longer be brought into charge to tax. The Chancellor's intention is to remove tax barriers to voluntary arrangements, which can allow businesses to continue to trade through a period of financial difficulty. The changes will take effect from today. First, the present rules governing the computation of taxable trading profits may sometimes prevent full relief being given for debts released by creditors in the context of a voluntary arrangement. In future, a trade creditor will not be denied relief solely because the creditor could have been expected to recover more of the debt by putting the debtor into liquidation or bankruptcy. The change will apply to debts released from today. Second, the effect of the present rules is that if a deduction for a debt has been given against a debtor's trading profits, and subsequently a creditor formally gives up all or part of that debt, the amount given up is added to the debtor's trading profits and is chargeable to tax. From today, debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act 1986 will not be brought into the charge to tax in this way. The cost of the two measures will depend on the number of debts given up under voluntary arrangements but is not expected to be large.</p>

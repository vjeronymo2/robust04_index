			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Shift to indirect tax tops G7 rivals The UK tax system underwent the largest shift among G7 countries from direct to indirect taxes in the years 1981 to 1991, figures from the Central Statistical Office show, Philip Coggan writes. In its latest issue of Economic Trends, the CSO shows that Britain was the most heavily reliant of G7 countries on value added tax, which accounted for 19 per cent of tax and social security contributions in 1991. This was a 7 percentage-point increase from 1981, the largest in the G7. Britain was the only country to see a significant decline in the proportion of tax and social security contributions as a percentage of GNP, thanks to a decline in direct taxes. However, the survey period starts from 1981, a tax-raising year in the UK, and ends before the recent tax increases.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Scharping makes jobs SPD's priority MR Rudolf Scharping, just five months in office as leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, yesterday challenged his party to seize the political middle ground, and prepare itself to become the future German government. In a keynote speech opening the four-day SPD party conference, Mr Scharping warned that the surge in unemployment was leading to rising crime and growth in support for parties of the extreme right. He called for a party policy focused above all on job creation, through modernisation of the German economy, a fair reform of the welfare state, and 'a more intelligent organisation of labour'. He urged delegates to end inner-party strife and to focus on a clear set of practical alternative policies before next year's election. Yet it was a message which met with a mixed reception from the delegates, who are concerned about any hint of diluting the benefits of the welfare state, or any suggestion of strictly linking wage increases to productivity. Instead, they agreed the blame for unemployment - now forecast to top 10 per cent, or more than 4m in the two halves of Germany next year - lay not with high wages, but other factors: the tough monetary policy of the German Bundesbank, the effective revaluation of the D-Mark, and the failure of both government and industry to promote more research and innovation. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the party and spokesman on the economy, launched a sharp attack on the Bundesbank for maintaining high interest rates, and thereby driving up the D-Mark. 'An exporting nation cannot behave like this with its monetary policy,' he said. And speakers from the floor claimed that more jobs had been destroyed in German industry because of the devaluation of sterling and the Italian lira than by any wage deals by trade unions. There was also widespread support for calls to reduce working hours as one way of tackling unemployment, by sharing out more widely the shrinking workload. Even before the conference began in the spa-town of Wiesbaden, the main resolution on economic policy had been amended to drop any suggestion that wages in east Germany must be linked to productivity, to protect jobs in that part of the country. Mr Scharping insisted it was not wages as such which were too high, but all the extra costs of labour, such as pensions' and unemployment insurance. He wants part of those costs shifted to direct taxation, above all to pay for the emergency labour market programmes of job creation and retraining in east Germany. He supported calls for shorter working hours as part of the solution to joblessness, but warned that workers must also accept wage cuts for less work. The trade unions knew that was inevitable, he said.</p>

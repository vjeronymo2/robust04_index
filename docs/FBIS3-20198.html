			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  declared that the results of the elections so far demonstrate  that they lag behind his party's aim to become the first party,  but they further intensify the political division in Turkey.  Yilmaz announced that there will not be any quest for a new  government and his party is definitely not a candidate for  partnership in the government. Yilmaz reiterated his demand for  early general elections.    Yilmaz held a news conference at the end of the ANAP  Chairmanship Council meeting. He noted that according to the  results of yesterday's elections, his party is the second  biggest party. Yilmaz explained that before the elections he  refrained from making statements with false claims and said that  the party may not receive the expected results because the  citizens are not fully aware of the economic problems.  Political division causes concern at a time when the country  most needs political stability, Yilmaz remarked. Given this  situation, he said, the proposal to implement an election system  with two rounds in smaller regions has become a necessity.    Yilmaz reiterated his demand to hold early general elections  and added:    [Begin recording] In these general elections, parties will  present themselves to the citizens not only with their polished  candidates, but with solutions to the basic problems currently  facing Turkey. We believe that Turkey needs such elections now.  Such an election will not only urge the citizens to choose in  connection with the local authorities, it will also display  their will regarding solutions to the main problems of the  country. I believe that if the necessary step is taken to hold  early elections and change the election system, it will be  possible to erase this excessively divided political picture.  [end recording]    Replying to questions during his news conference, Yilmaz  said  that the government must now implement economic stability  measures without any delay and the country must be led towards  early general elections in a reasonable time. Asked to comment  on Prime Minister Ciller's previous statement that his  leadership will be disputed if the party fails in the elections,  Yilmaz said that he does not take any note of this view. He  pointed out: There is no need for Mrs. Ciller to make such an  appeal. I would make this assessment myself.    Noting that he was elected ANAP leader through the will of  the party's grassroots, Yilmaz said: If I believe that there is  a person who will take the party further than myself, then I  would make every possible sacrifice for my party.    He expressed the belief that the coalition government will  remain in power, adding that under the circumstances there will  not be any quest for a new government and his party is not a  candidate for such a partnership.</p>

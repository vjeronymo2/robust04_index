			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Motorcyclist What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . Check a motorcyclist's fingernails before buying him or her anything for Christmas. Black, oily hands belong to bikers who spend most of their time building and rebuilding machines. Buy them spanners, sprockets and industrial strength hand-cleanser. Manicured motorcyclists are more difficult. They are likely to have almost everything they need and want, from leathers and waterproofs to luggage and sophisticated security equipment. They are unlikely, however, to have Ducati Passions, a compact disc featuring the exhaust sounds of 18 different Ducati motorcycles recorded by the Ducati Club of Sweden (Pounds 13.45 by mail order from the Road Racer catalogue, tel: 0477-544304). Each 'track' lasts less than a minute and the recording quality is splendid  -but only a total obsessive would find it a lasting pleasure. On the other hand, it has the virtue of novelty, and could be useful for encouraging overstaying supper guests to get on their bikes. In the same catalogue is a range of wonderful tin toy motorcycles, priced between Pounds 9.95 and Pounds 35. The originals upon which some of these are based sell for hundreds of pounds at auction, yet you would be pushed to tell the difference at a quick glance. Thinking bigger, my letter to Santa lists a single item: any one of the motorcycles made by Bimota of Italy. The models in this range are sport-style bikes and are as beautiful as pieces of working machinery can possibly be. The Biposto, Furano or the Tesi, any of them would do. Prices range from Pounds 10,750 for the YB9SR to Pounds 23,000 for the top-of-the-range high-tech Tesi. Contact Galleria Bimota on 0483-272707. As a stocking filler, go for earplugs (widely available). These are essential safety accessories to guard against hearing damage caused by wind noise when riding for long periods at speed. And if you are in danger of having to listen to repeated playing of Ducati Passions, then buy some for yourself as well.</p>

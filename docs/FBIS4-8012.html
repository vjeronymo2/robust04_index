			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Mustafa Beganovic, health minister </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Senada Cumurovic; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Cumurovic] World Health Day and the 70th  anniversary of the Health Protection Institute of  Bosnia-Herzegovina are being marked this year under grave living  conditions. Professor Beganovic, can you tell us about the  health situation of the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Beganovic] This situation is rather grave. There is  undernourishment. There are epidemics of infectious diseases,  although they have not been widely spread, they have not grown  into pandemics. For that, we can, above all, thank our people,  who know how to maintain hygiene even under such conditions and  also thank our medical staff who are making efforts and [words  indistinct] to help people as much as possible. [passage  omitted]    In this free part of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we  have about 70,000 seriously wounded people, a large number of  disabled, a large number of paraplegics, a large number of cases  of chronic diseases, a large number of cases of psychological  disorders, and, generally speaking, we were very rarely able to  help and do something for the improvement of health. We were  trying to save lives, we were saving elementary health so a  person would not die, would survive, and then, with time, we  shall try to return him to full health. [passage omitted]</p>

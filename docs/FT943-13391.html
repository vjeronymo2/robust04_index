			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Geneva beats Bonn in contest to host headquarters Geneva has won the contest with Bonn to host the World Trade Organisation, which takes over from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Mr Andras Szepesi of Hungary, who has been conducting the consultations with Gatt's 123 members, said yesterday that with over 90 per cent of opinions in, there was a 'rather strong majority' in Geneva's favour. He told trade diplomats that the basis was there for a consensus decision when the WTO preparatory committee meets on Friday. The German government is desperate to seek substitutes for the thousands of civil servants and diplomats who will move from Bonn when the German capital shifts to Berlin later this decade. Both Bonn and Geneva put up seductive cases for housing the future WTO - due to come into being in January 1995 - with offers of office accommodation, conference facilities and diplomatic perks worth millions of dollars. Mr Szepesi said that in terms of value and costs there was little to choose between them. However, two factors weighed heavily in the choice of Geneva: continuity with the present Gatt which has its headquarters in Geneva; and the proximity of key international organisations the WTO will have to work with.</p>

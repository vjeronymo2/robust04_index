			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POSSIBLE TAMPERING WITH WINE PROBED  </P> <P> Investigators were trying to determine this week whether a bottle of wine  purchased at a City of Industry supermarket had been tampered with.  </P> <P> Rosemarie Ramirez, 51, of Hacienda Heights told investigators that the thin  metal covering over the bottle's cork appeared to have been tampered with but  that she drank from the bottle because the cork seemed intact, Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said.  </P> <P> After consuming some of the wine, she complained of a burning sensation in her  throat and became extremely nauseated.  </P> <P> Paramedics found nothing wrong with Ramirez, but her husband took her to  Whittier Hospital Medical Center, where she was treated and released.  </P> <P> The woman bought the bottle of Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo Blush Chablis at a Vons  supermarket at 32221 Hacienda Blvd. on Sunday.  </P> <P> The store pulled all remaining bottles of the wine as a precaution.  </P></p>

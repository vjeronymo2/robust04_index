			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Runnicles opens with Mahler's 8th - Edinburgh Festival It seems to be a tradition that the Edinburgh Festival should open with a concert that has a strong Scottish content. There have been occasions in the past when this has looked like a duty to be performed as quickly as possible before the real festival gets underway, painless enough if washed down with a dram of whisky - but not this year. With evident delight at its good fortune, Edinburgh has awoken to the fact that it is the birthplace of one of the world's foremost younger conductors. For 15 years or so Donald Runnicles has learnt his craft in the opera houses of Europe, progressing from Freiburg to Vienna and Bayreuth, and from there to San Francisco, where he is now Music Director. With such a prestigious curriculum vitae he has certainly earned his place heading the opening night of his home city's international festival. Among the Scottish contingent, another body which has won a regular slot for itself is the Edinburgh Festival Chorus, so most opening nights are choral. This year's choice was Mahler's Eighth Symphony, conceived on such a massive scale that it can hardly fail to provide a suitably festive start. At the Usher Hall, neither the playing of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra nor the choral singing (including the RSNO Junior Chorus) was unfailingly tidy, but there was a thrilling overall arc to the performance. After Tennstedt's renowned Mahler's Eighth in London one came out feeling that one had penetrated some deep inner conviction of the composer, whereas here any time for communing was swept aside by elation and sheer excitement. Even the slow introduction to the Faust setting tingled with tension, as though Goethe's mountain wilderness was ready to explode with all the new emotions of the romantic era. Runnicles gave easily the most impulsive performance of the symphony that I have heard. Sometimes this meant making a quick dash for the next climax; more often long passages developed an undercurrent that swept the music irresistibly along, as in the rapturous solos of the baritone Pater Ecstaticus (the strong Gregory Yurisich) and tenor Doctor Marianus (a strained Peter Svensson, wrestling with the impossible). Among a decent band of soloists there were two fine mezzos in Catherine Keen and Patricia Bardon. Jane Eaglen continues to go from strength to strength, but Janice Watson's Soprano 1 sounded unexpectedly constricted. Susan Chilcott sang a heavenly Mater Gloriosa off-stage; Gwynne Howell lacked incisiveness as the bass. As the Scottish audience recognised, however, this was the conductor's evening. In everything Runnicles did here - the seething blend of textures, the irresistible flow of energy, the high-octane passion - I heard an inspiring future conductor of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Now that Edinburgh has a real opera-house, how about a festival production? Sponsored by Scottish and Newcastle</p>

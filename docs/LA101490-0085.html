			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN SHOT, WOUNDED AFTER FIRING AT POLICE  </P> <P> A Glendale man who was shot by police after he fired a gun at two officers was  in critical condition Saturday, Glendale police reported.  </P> <P> The man, who was not identified, was wounded several times in the upper torso  about 11:30 p.m. Friday, Lt. Mark Distaso said.  </P> <P> Police were called to the man's residence in southwest Glendale about 11:30  p.m. by paramedics because the man was waving a gun at them, Distaso said.  </P> <P> The paramedics were attempting to treat the man, who is in his mid-60s, for a  diabetes-related problem when he pulled a gun and threatened them, police said.  </P> <P> The two uniformed officers who went to the house were met by the man "who was  standing just inside the door to his home," Distaso said. "He was still holding  the gun."  </P> <P> The man had refused to heed "numerous orders" by police to drop the gun when he  fired once at the two officers, Distaso said.  </P> <P> "The officers returned fire and struck the suspect several times in the upper  torso area," he said.  </P> <P> Neither officer was injured. Their names were withheld pending an internal  Police Department investigation, Distaso said.  </P> <P> The wounded man was treated by paramedics at the scene, then taken to Glendale  Memorial Hospital, where he remained in critical condition. His name was not  released, because police said they were having difficulty notifying his  relatives.  </P> <P> "I don't even know if he has any family," Distaso said. "We're trying to find  somebody."  </P> <P> He said the man apparently was alone at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> Paramedics said they had treated the man for various medical problems several  times in the past.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Your editorial "It's Now or Never" (Dec. 25) and several of the letters from  readers on the same page are continuing evidence of the public's lack of  confidence in our federal, state and local governments and the elected  politicians in office. I certainly agree that such a lack of confidence exists  and is growing. However, I can't fault the politicians because if they acted  differently they probably wouldn't be in office. Our present system causes  politicians to have as their first three priorities: 1) reelection, 2) being  friendly to all constituents, and 3) doing what they can for the nation, after  fulfilling the first two priorities.  </P> <P> In my carefully considered opinion, substantial improvement can be made in our  governments rather simply -- always vote against incumbents in primary as well  as general elections. If only 25% of the voters did this I expect very  substantial benefits to result quickly. Most elective terms would be too short  for that system and I advocate lengthening them. Perhaps for the President and  senators, 8-year terms with one-eighth of the senators elected each year.  Congressmen should serve something like four years, with one-quarter being  elected each year, etc.  </P> <P> Such a change cannot be enacted into law as the opposition is much too  powerful. But no law on re-election is needed as support of this principle by  25% of the voters would be fully effective. After that the politicians would  quickly extend the terms. A utopian result is not claimed, but I am quite sure  that substantial benefits would result.  </P> <P> All major problems are controversial. Politicians concerned over their  reelection are, quite justifiably, afraid of offending groups of voters and so  avoid essential actions.  </P> <P> PAUL WHITMORE  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Psychological testing is not resented Sir, Alas, Mr Sturt's letter (January 13) in reply to Timothy Clark's study ('Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'', January 7) is yet another snare and delusion. Of course, headhunters have a role, but so too do objective means of assessing a candidate's suitability or potential for a job. Mr Sturt has fallen into the trap of misunderstanding the effects of random selection, or in his terms, 'introduction'. Headhunters will, simply by chance, identify candidates who are high performers in their new role. As a result they are not subsequently transferred or fired. The key point here, however, is that chance has come into play. For, at the same time, headhunters can and do 'introduce' executives who do not perform well. I wonder where his evidence comes from that this does not occur? Certainly my experience as an occupational psychologist is that I have often been retained by clients who wish to recover from a poor 'introduction'. Mr Sturt rightly asserts that psychological assessment is 'just one link in a chain', but then ruins his whole argument by adopting the elitist attitude that such assessment is only relevant to junior and middle management. Psychological assessment is not just about ability testing, although this is important even at the highest levels. A rigorous analysis of overall suitability is essential for all jobs, including board members. Why senior managers should feel 'insulted' by demonstrating their skills and abilities is a mystery to me. Finally, many companies which use psychological assessment alongside headhunters are more impressed by the hard evidence that has emerged from a plethora of research studies over the past 50 years than they are by the subjective data that Mr Sturt would have us take account of from telephone conversations, references and anecdotes from former colleagues.

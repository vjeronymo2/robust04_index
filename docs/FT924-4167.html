			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: More cuts in nickel production ANOTHER NICKEL producer, Western Mining Corporation of Australia, announced production cuts yesterday. However, analysts suggested the cuts would make no difference to present low prices and depressed market sentiment. Suggestions that there was another boat carrying more than 10,000 tonnes of nickel from the Commonwealth of Independent States waiting outside Rotterdam because there was not enough equipment yet available to cut it, were also weighing heavily on the market. Analysts estimated that WMC's moves, which include the closure of its Foster mine in Western Australia, would cut about 2,000 tonnes from its nickel output in the year to the end of June. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group, said London Metal Exchange nickel stocks, at nearly 64,000 tonnes, represented 10 per cent of western world annual consumption and 'it needs a big increase in demand to have an impact on that. But demand is still very weak, particularly in Japan'. There was no sign of a revival in demand for stainless steel, the biggest user of nickel, he pointed out. 'And stainless steel scrap prices - a lead indicator for nickel - are not moving.' Mr Bielski suggested, however, that nickel prices should move to a level representing the average world-wide cost of production - about USDollars 6,171 a tonne. Nickel closed at Dollars 5,622.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35, on the LME yesterday. WMC said its nickel division, which produced nearly 49,000 tonnes of metal in the year to the end of last June, was operating at a loss. It aimed to push production costs below Dollars 5,510. Analysts suggested WMC's announcement was mainly for the benefit of its domestic unions - contracts at its Kambalda nickel operations in Western Australia expire this month. WMC also announced that its Chibougamau copper-gold mine in Canada would close if it was not sold by January. The company has already written off ADollars 120m from the mine's value. Present low nickel prices are causing expansion projects to be deferred and this could result in production shortfalls from the mid-1990s, the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group, warns in its latest study. The same is true for aluminium, MMRS adds. Tin and lead prices have been depressed for even longer and this will hold back production capacity, 'leading to sharp price increases in 1995-96 (for those metals), perhaps sooner for tin'. In contrast, the relatively stronger performance of copper and zinc prices may have stimulated enough expansion to ensure that supplies keep pace with demand. MMRS predicts that between 1992 and 1997 nickel demand will rise by 22 per cent, aluminium's by 19.3 per cent, copper's by 18 per cent, zinc's by 17.4 per cent, lead's by 14.3 per cent and tin's by 12.5 per cent. This results in an aggregate rise for the LME-traded metals of 18 per cent or 3.4 per cent a year.

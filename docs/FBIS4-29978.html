			<p>BFN     [Summary] So Khun, state secretary of the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry, recently said that the ministry  plans to set up the first phase of a rural telecommunications  network in a number of districts in Battambang Province.    The plan is based on an aid of 5 millions German marks from  the German Government to the Royal Government of Cambodia to  develop telecommunications in rural areas. The plan is for a  wireless telecommunications network linking the provincial seat  and a number of districts. The modern network will be set up in  densely populated townships for use by the public for an  appropriate fee. If everything proceeds according to plans, this  network can be expanded by early 1995 to Mongkolborei District  in Banteay Meanchey Province.    The minister also said that this plan will be implemented by  the end of this year at the latest. Studies by German  technicians and those from the ministry were completed a few  months ago.</p>

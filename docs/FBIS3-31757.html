			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Drazen Vukov-Colic commentary: "The U.S. Diplomatic </F> Renaissance"]    [Text] They could hardly wait for it in Moscow, the  Europeans are delighted, and the conflicting sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must finally realize that, in this bloody  game, not everything can remain the same after all. This is a  short summary of the main reactions to the U.S. "diplomatic  renaissance," without which no progress could be expected,  regardless of the outcome of the Western military ultimatum.  Discussions and negotiations should be held both before and  after the bombs, and these possible bombs have also been taken  out of the last diplomatic safe: The Serbs are expected to make  the most concessions, and, after sanctions, they had to be  threatened with the largest stick. "Everybody agreed that the  final end to this war must be agreed upon at the negotiating  table," stated Peter Tarnoff, Warren Cristopher's assistant for  political issues, who, along with envoy Charles Redman, is, on  the U.S. side, in charge of a new gathering of the Western  allies and the restoration of the Bosnian negotiations.    Madelaine Albright talked of this as the main message of the  NATO ultimatum at the Security Council, in the evident attempt  to appease the Russians and encourage the Serbs who support a  peaceful solution. What is it that is real and new, since  everything sounds so familiar? Washington and Europe have  finally agreed upon a joint approach, and once the White House  gets into something with someone else, it has to lead. In this  list of immediate tasks, Europe and Moscow had to give up the  idea that a larger carrot (suspension of the sanctions) could  curb the Serb appetites, and Washington agreed -- at least  ostensibly -- to press its Muslim proteges. They must finally  be satisfied with "reasonable demands," instead of constantly  making the list of their wishes longer. Charles Redman  therefore quickly went to Sarajevo, so that it could be firmly  determined once and for all what kind of Bosnia and how much  Bosnia for themselves the Muslims support. Immediately  following these talks, the Serbs and Croats will be offered a  kind of final menu that will not be based on the blackmailing  principle of "take it or leave it," but would nevertheless be  something that it is almost impossible to refuse, since "they  would have to realize" -- says Tarnoff -- "that behind  everything this time lies the unity and the common purpose of  Europe and the United States."    What about Croatia? Even Peter Tarnoff admits that  Washington and Brussels have yet to agree upon a common approach  to this issue. Germany has reappeared on the stage as the  illegitimate foster parent of its naughty foundling, which it  long ago sent into punishment, but still opposes someone else  slapping it. In all this, Bonn can also expect new headaches at  the constant diplomatic carousel that, in the Croatian public,  turns Klaus Kinkel into a torturer at one moment and a savior at  another. In a somewhat more extensive answer to the question of  what this unachieved joint Western policy toward Croatia could  look like, Tarnoff answered cautiously, but still threateningly:  "We are aware of the need to resolve the issue of the Krajinas,  and we know that Croatia is playing a very important role in the  final (Bosnian) agreement. Croatia can profit a lot from the  agreement, taking into account its economic situation resulting  from a great number of war refugees. However, if it is not  capable of playing a useful role, it could be put under  pressure."    Everything Mario Nobilo said at the Security Council was  based on the attempt to make the world see that Croatia is more  yielding, peacemaking, and prepared for all negotiations.  Certain "elements" of the Croatian Army will be withdrawn.  Zagreb and Sarajevo jointly signed the request for the  international control of their borders, and soon a real  Croat-Muslim ceasefire can be expected. The Sarajevo Ambassador  Muhamed Sacirbey did not attack Zagreb at the Security Council  (he and Nobilo are even friends), which should show that it is  easier to breathe after Mate Boban. However, at the same time  all the media talk of great military successes of the HVO  [Croatian Defense Council], and some foreign sources claim that  the Croat forces -- aided by "elements" of the Croatian Army --  had started an unprecedented attack at Gornji Vakuf. Each  negotiation is thus first announced at the frontlines by  suicidal attempts to secure as strong territorial maps as  possible for the negotiating table, and in that case even Mario  Nobilo is not able to conceal the terrible reality by  well-formulated papers. Many will say that Peter Tarnoff spoke  in an unusually mild way about Croatia, but the best informed  still know that because of these attempts to retrieve at least  part of what was so irresponsibly lost in central Bosnia, Zagreb  could be forced to sacrifice part of the so crucial sea as early  as the following day. Because, with the Americans, everything  is both easier and more difficult at the same time.</p>

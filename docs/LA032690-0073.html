			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> CELEBRITY MUD WRESTLING COMES TO ATLANTIC CITY  </P> <P> Despite what you hear, the high rollers who play in Atlantic City, N.J., aren't  all flocking to the Taj Mahal casino-hotel, Donald Trump's soon-to-be-opened  monument to wretched excess. In fact, some of Atlantic City's heaviest action  involves the property next door to the Taj: Merv Griffin's Resorts  International casino-hotel.  </P> <P> But unfortunately for Merv, these players aren't throwing their money around in  the Resorts casino, where he could make a few bucks off them. Instead, these  guys are playing in the Resorts bankruptcy, where they're trying to make a few  bucks off Merv. Not to mention off each other.  </P> <P> Welcome to the adaptable world of Wall Street. A world in which mergers and  acquisitions action -- or M&amp;A, as it's known -- has all but collapsed. A  world in which the new game is to try to make money from failed M&amp;A deals  because there aren't enough new deals to feed everyone.  </P> <P> "A lot of the nervous energy that used to be put into M&amp;A has been directed  into this," quips Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., a bankruptcy veteran who is  advising Resorts' senior bondholders.  </P> <P> As a result, Resorts, which was supposed to be a tidy, "prepackaged"  bankruptcy, has turned into a four-way battle, pitting three big bondholders  against one another and against Merv:  </P> <P> * First Executive Corp., the giant Los Angeles insurance company top heavy with  junk bonds, which owns more than $100 million of Resorts' most senior bonds,  which total $325 million.  </P> <P> * Sabre Associates, a fund associated with the guys who put together Coniston  Partners but separately run, which controls $20 million to $30 million of  Resorts' $200 million of second-most-senior bonds.  </P> <P> * Jay Goldsmith and Harry Freund, two of the biggest talkers in the bankruptcy  world, who claim to control $150 million of Resorts' $400 million of  least-senior bonds and who seem to have painted themselves into a corner by  making threats they can't back up.  </P> <P> * Merv, who as the stockholder of Resorts is at the bottom of the pile but is  trying to climb out by putting $30 million of new money into the company.  </P> <P> And you thought that you needed mud to have mud wrestling.  </P> <P> None of this would be going on had it not been for Merv, the man who made  hundreds of millions of dollars by creating the "Wheel of Fortune" and  "Jeopardy" TV game shows but who has blown $60 million and his reputation as a  smart businessman on Resorts, now known as the Default Show.  </P> <P> Merv, you remember, "won" Resorts in late 1988 after a widely publicized  takeover battle with Trump but quickly ran into trouble, defaulted on Resorts'  bonds last August and put Resorts into bankruptcy in December.  </P> <P> That brought in the bankruptcy players, who live in a world in which you not  only want to make money but also to beat up the other guy.  </P> <P> In the Resorts battle, in which Merv is offering to fork over the $30 million,  78% of the stock and some new bonds, the idea is to make such a pest of  yourself that Merv or other bondholders will give you more than Merv's plan  calls for.  </P> <P> You do this by threatening to invoke bankruptcy rules, under which no one gets  anything until all the creditors above him have been paid in full.  Shareholders, who come below the creditors, are last in line.  </P> <P> In a so-called consensual plan, like this one, bondholders can take less than  full payment provided that half the bondholders in each class, owning  two-thirds of the bonds, give their consent. Thus, if you control one-third of  a class of bonds, you can break up a consensual plan.  </P> <P> The risk you run is that the original bankruptcy rules come back into play and  the bankrupt company may run out of assets before you get paid in full. That's  known as being crammed down.  </P> <P> One reason there's a compromise here is that, for arcane legal reasons, what  appear to be the most-senior Resorts bonds might not be senior at all. It could  take years to sort out.  </P> <P> This prospect, plus the fact that it would probably show a gain on its bonds if  the Griffin plan is approved, makes First Executive eager to settle. Merv, for  obvious reasons, also wants to cut a deal.  </P> <P> But Sabre and the Goldsmith-Freund team are making noises. Sabre, which  wouldn't talk to me, has told other people that it will cram down Goldsmith and  Freund, as well as Griffin, unless it gets a better settlement. Goldsmith and  Freund, who have a carefully cultivated mad-dog image, threaten to blow up the  whole plan. But, as one adviser to the Griffin forces says, "Harry and Jay are  being less rabid than usual."  </P> <P> Indeed, their position doesn't seem too good. They could get killed here, the  same way they got killed a few years ago when they tried to cram down the  stockholders of the bankrupt Global Marine Corp. but were themselves crammed  down by senior creditors. Goldsmith and Freund had an indicated 90% loss,  although they claim it was less.  </P> <P> Goldsmith and Freund wouldn't talk to me but sent a public relations man to  tell me that they have about as much invested in the senior Resorts bonds as  they do in the juniors -- a claim that provoked howls of laughter from everyone  I tried to confirm it with.  </P> <P> What will finally happen, probably, is that when the dust settles, something  like Griffin's plan will be approved. Until then, the Resorts bankruptcy will  be a better show than The Donald and the Taj. Stay tuned.  </P></p>

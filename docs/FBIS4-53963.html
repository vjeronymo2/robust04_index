			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States on Monday [23 May] hammered out a broad accord to resume  the stalled negotiations on a new bilateral trade framework,  Japanese sources said.    The sources said the results of the agreement, clinched  after  four days of negotiations, will be announced Tuesday morning.    The sources said the two sides agreed to spell out the goal  of each of the four priority areas covered by the framework  accord concluded in July last year.    Monday's agreement should allow the two countries to reopen  the framework talks, which have been ruptured since February.    The sources said the broad accord would not include any  reference to numerical targets or similar language that could be  misunderstood as such.    Details of the agreement are expected to be finalized at a  meeting to be held Monday night, the sources said.    Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill  Clinton have said they are eager to find a common basis for  resuming the framework talks before they meet at the Group of  Seven summit in Naples in early July.    Senior Japanese and U.S. officials, who began their latest  round of negotiations Thursday, met again Monday for four hours  at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) before  breaking up for further consultations among themselves.    "The Japanese responded to our...(proposals) in a very  positive way," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said  Monday morning.    As the two sides broke up for consultations in the late  afternoon, key members of Clinton's economic team were seen  heading into the USTR building.    Among them were Robert Rubin, director of the National  Economic Council, Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council  of Economic Advisers, and Undersecretary of State for Economic  Affairs Joan Spero.    U.S. officials said a news conference on the framework talks  is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday.    One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the  primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations  -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure the  progress in market access to Japan.    Japan has rejected U.S. demands for quantifiable "objective  criteria," saying that they may turn into "numerical targets"  for U.S. exports to Japan, which would be tantamount to managed  trade.    Clinton has denied that is the U.S. intention, a point  Kantor  reiterated Monday.    "We have never asked for numerical targets. We have never  asked for market share," Kantor said. "That is not part of the  discussion."    Among the industry sectors covered under the framework  accord  are Japanese Government procurements of medical and  telecommunications equipment.</p>

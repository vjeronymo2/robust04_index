			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ex-FT chief joins O'Reilly group Mr David Palmer, the former chief executive of the Financial Times Group, is to be managing director of Independent Newspapers (Ireland), the Irish publishing division of Mr Tony O'Reilly's expanding media group. As well as being responsible for the Dublin-based group's main Irish titles  -the Irish Independent, Evening Herald and Sunday Independent - Mr Palmer will join the main board. Mr Palmer, 53, spent 29 years with the FT as reporter, news editor and deputy editor before moving into newspaper management. When he left the FT abruptly in April 1993, Pearson, the paper's owners, cited 'differences in management style'. Mr O'Reilly, chairman of HJ Heinz as well as chairman of Independent Newspapers, has been talking to Mr Palmer for several months following the departure of the previous managing director, Mr Joe Hayes, in March to pursue other business interests. Mr Palmer, educated at Eton and Oxford, will move to Dublin to take up his new appointment. In the mid 1980s the former FT chief executive was in charge of a Pounds 75m investment plan to introduce photo-composition at the paper and build its new Docklands printing plant. Although Independent Newspapers has expanded into South Africa, France, Mexico, the UK and Australia, the core is still its main Irish newspapers. Last year pre-tax profits rose 81 per cent to IPounds 29m (Pounds 28.4m).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the  "This Week" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Following the  transformation of the regime, we have turned the offensive  Hungarian Army into a defensive one, Hungarian Defense Minister  Lajos Fur told the `This Week' program. [passage omitted]    Is it true that there were nuclear warheads in Hungary at  that time?    [Fur] Yes, it is true. For a long time a special situation  prevailed that even we, after the formation of the new  government, did not know about it until the Russians moved them  [the nuclear warheads] from Hungary. Even now we do not know at  exactly how many places these nuclear warheads were stored. We  certainly know one or two places, but, it is assumed that there  were nuclear warheads in several other places. [passage  omitted] There were no such things [nuclear warheads] in the  ownership or operation of the Hungarian Army. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What can be done regarding the  reorganization  [of the army] in four years?    [Fur] First and foremost, we have put an end to the Army's  offensive structure and the entire operations planning system.  The Army has to exclusively fulfill defensive functions. The  total strength of the Hungarian Army has dropped from 152,000 to  less than 100,000 within three years. The drop in the number of  professional soldiers over the past three years is almost the  same -- that is about 25 percent.    [Correspondent] Does the present state of the Army provide a  certain level of defense capability?    [Fur] The Army, too, reflects very precisely the country's  general social and economic state. That is to say, certain  social problems, or even social tensions evolve within this  army, as these pressing problems are present in society itself.  We have tried, as much as it was possible, to raise wages every  year. [passage omitted]    On the other hand, there were purchases in the seventies.  However, there have been no more serious purchases in this Army  from the beginning of the eighties. [passage omitted]    Let me say that we expect a lot from the setting up of a new  humane service [human szolgalat], to consist of officers who are  well-prepared and well-trained in social and psychological  issues.    [Correspondent] Let me note that there have been comments  that this is a kind of revival of the system of political  officers.    [Fur] It is very wrong, the two have nothing to do with each  other. That was a system of deputy commanders within the  Hungarian Army, and this will be a fully subordinated,  coordinated, special organization of the Hungarian Army, where  the work will be carried out by trained experts. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Is the present state of the Army good enough  to continue smooth operations in the event of a change of  government, for we cannot know the election results in advance?  Will it be able to operate without hitches, which may cause  problems either in international relations or at home?    [Fur] Although this army is under political direction, I am  certain that it is not committed to any party political program.  This army is in fact subordinated to the national cause, and it  is also now laid down in law that no one within the army can  engage in politics.    [Correspondent] Is it not a kind of pressure that the  minister of defense is one of the leaders of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], and may perhaps become its number one  leader?    [Fur] By no means. I am the one who usually protests in the  firmest manner against any move that perhaps the MDF would like  to take in connection with the Army.    [Correspondent] Has the basic transformation been  implemented, or can it only be regarded as implemented after  joining NATO?    [Fur] It is not only when we have joined NATO, but also when  internal tension has eased, which, in my view, requires at least  5-10 years. Then we can say that a full transformation has  indeed taken place. It will be a modernized army of national  character regarding its' every detail, its' way of thinking,  preparedness, organization, and battle order.</p>

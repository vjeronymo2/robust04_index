He called drafts proposed by the  previous government "historical documents," not suitable for  implementation. He also provided information on the demand of  the coalition parties for the dismissal of voivodes in a number  of voivodships, arguing that, in France, after each  parliamentary election, 60 percent of the prefects are changed.  To this, opposition politicians stated derisively in the halls  that the new government wants to introduce its own "apolitical"  people into the administration.    The 47-year-old Michal Strak is a political scientist and  Polish philologist by education. During the 1970's, he worked as  a journalist at WIES WSPOLCZESNA and ZIELONY SZTANDAR [both  newspapers dealing with rural and agricultural issues], and  later in the Ministry of Culture and Art. Beginning in 1989, for  three years he was the director of the Cabinet of the minister  of state at the Chancellery of President Wojciech Jaruzelski.  With Lech Walesa's presidency, he was dismissed from that  position by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.    Michal Strak began his political career in the Rural Youth  Union [ZMK]. He became a member of the United Peasant Party  [ZSL] in 1971 [predecessor of the PSL (Polish Peasant Party)].  He currently serves as deputy secretary of the Chief Executive  Committee of the PSL. He is considered to be the major  ideologist of the PSL and is the closest colleague and adviser  of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Following his advice,  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] deputies voted in favor of a vote  of no-confidence for the government of Hanna Suchocka [referring  to the December 1993 parliamentary refusal to grant absolutorium  to the Olszewski and Suchocka governments].    Strak is married and has two children.</p>

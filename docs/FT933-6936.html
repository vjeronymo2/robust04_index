			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / MPs serve up multi-million pound food bill A CROSS-PARTY committee of MPs is expected to recommend a multi-million pound facelift for catering and dining facilities in the Palace of Westminster to bring them up to acceptable safety and hygiene standards. The catering committee report, which is expected in November, follows the first ever strategic assessment of Westminster's venerable catering facilities. 'We are trying to deal with 50 to 100 years of botch,' according to Mr Colin Shepherd, Tory MP for Hereford and committee chairman. 'If it had been in the private sector, we would have been served with a notice,' he added. According to Mr Shepherd, a report by a firm of independent consultants into hygiene in Westminster's collection of kitchens and dining-rooms had been 'fairly devastating in technical terms'. The report is thought to have highlighted a wide range of defects in areas such as tiling, guttering, refrigeration (which has now been dealt with) and flow paths, where incoming food came into contact with prepared food. A report into health and safety aspects is thought to have pointed to inadequate passage space at a number of facilities. About four weeks ago Mr Anthony Steen, the Conservative MP for South Hams and a catering committee member, told MPs he understood they were to authorise spending 'about Pounds 19m' on updating the kitchens. This figure is thought to be on the high side. The Westminster facilities enjoy Crown immunity from prosecution under hygiene and health and safety statutes. The policy, however, is to comply with relevant legislation. The Commons refreshment department yesterday published its annual accounts for the year ended April 1, showing a 1 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 3.34m. Of this, Pounds 1.39m was attributed to House services, Pounds 1.3m to private banqueting and Pounds 0.65m to souvenir kiosks and shops.</p>

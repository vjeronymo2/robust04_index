			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Patten presses on without China deal BRITAIN and China have failed to agree a basis for talks about Hong Kong's political future, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, told the local legislature yesterday. He ordered immediate publication of his democracy legislation. Mr Patten told a packed Legislative Council (LegCo) that the UK and Hong Kong governments had done all they reasonably could to achieve agreement with China. But Beijing had refused to accept Hong Kong government officials as part of the British team and would not commit itself to a date for the start of talks. China's reaction was swift. A senior Chinese government official said the governor's action meant Sino-British talks could not proceed. Mr Zheng Guoxiong, vice-director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, said Mr Patten had 'deliberately ruined the foundation of talks'. The Hong Kong stock market reacted badly. The Hang Seng Index, which only earlier this week had risen to record levels, fell sharply in the last hour of trading. The index ended 201.44, or 3.16 per cent, lower at 6,170,40. Mr Patten said he remained prepared ready to talk to China about arrangements for the colony's 1994-95 elections. He would not present the bill to LegCo on Wednesday, as would be normal, but would judge 'in the light of subsequent developments' when best to do so. The governor made it clear that China's conditions for talks were totally unacceptable. 'I cannot myself see how (diminishing the standing of Hong Kong government officials) demonstrates sincerity or how it demonstrates a commitment to make a success of talks, a success that I would like to see.' He told BBC radio he was not prepared to 'humiliate' Hong Kong by agreeing to China's demand that talks should be between Beijing and London without Hong Kong representatives. 'What I'm not prepared to do is to confuse being accommodating and conciliatory on the one hand with having absolutely no principles on the other.' A British Foreign Office official said last night it was hard to escape the conclusion that China had engaged in an elaborate exercise of deception. From virtual agreement to talks on Thursday morning it tried to change the basis for talks on Thursday afternoon and yesterday morning. Reaction within LegCo to Mr Patten's decision divided largely along party lines. Liberal politicians supported his stand while conservative legislators reacted with disappointment. Mr Allen Lee, leader of the main conservative bloc in LegCo, said he could not envisage a situation where Britain and China confronted each other for the next four years.

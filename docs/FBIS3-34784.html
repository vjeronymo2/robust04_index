[passage omitted]    He said that the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon "are  playing a positive role in maintaining security." He revealed  that "they recently contributed to the arrest of those accused  of killing the Jordanian diplomat" Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah.  He said that the solution in the region "will not be at  Lebanon's expense," referring in this connection to assurances  from U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren  Christopher. He spoke of an agreement between Lebanon and Syria  to sign the peace agreement together once it is achieved  "because it is a matter of national security for both countries."    Al-Hariri made these revelations on the evening of the day  before yesterday during a "seminar on the issues of the hour"  held at the central school attached to the Lebanese Maronite  monastery in Juniyah. [passage omitted]    Asked why the al-Ta'if agreement has not been implemented,  particularly such matters as dissolution of all the militias,  withdrawals of weapons, administrative decentralization, and  formation of the economic and constitutional councils, al-Hariri  said that "a decree will be issued about the Constitutional  Council which has been formed after consultation with the Shura  Council." He said that what was meant by decentralization under  the al-Ta'if agreement was administrative not political  decentralization. He said: "We are talking about Lebanon's  unity. We cannot address that and at the same time speak of  political decentralization. Lebanon is a small state. Should we  divide it into many parts? That is out of the question."  [passage omitted]    He said: "I do not believe that there is a single Lebanese  who would not condemn the execution which occurred in Ba'labakk.  Nobody can defend that and we cannot accept it. The judicial  authorities have moved to act in this connection." He stressed  the importance "of consolidating the judicial authority and  expediting its procedures" within the democratic system.    Asked why the Syrian Army has not been redeployed in  accordance with the al-Ta'if agreement, al-Hariri replied:  "Under the agreement the Syrians are supposed to help the  Lebanese state maintain security in the country." He spoke of  promises of massive aid from abroad not honored except by three  states, namely Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. "We just got  advice from other states." He added that "the Army cannot be  rebuilt with just words. It takes a major part of the budget,  and that is our duty. We are engaged in negotiations with  Israel and agreement on withdrawal may be achieved. We all know  that one of the most important conditions for withdrawal is  security. That is the duty of the Lebanese state. In other  words, a major part of the Lebanese Army would go to the south  to assume responsibility for security. Are we now able to  maintain security in all parts of the Lebanese Republic or do we  need some time and assistance? Some states sent us some aid for  the Army, consisting of vehicles, trucks, light weapons, and  many promises. In practical terms, we have not received aid  that would enable our Army to maintain security in all parts of  the Lebanese Republic. We should not hide behind our hands on  this matter. Not long ago an official of the Jordanian Embassy  was assassinated and the perpetrators were arrested. The truth  is that the Syrians contributed to the apprehension of the  culprits. Since I assumed my government post the Syrians, I can  confirm, have been playing a positive role. We should all seek  to strengthen the Army and the Internal Security Forces and in  fact all the security authorities so that they can assume  responsibility for security throughout the republic."    Asked why there are still Syrian Army barriers in the  streets and why the Internal Security Forces should not man  these barriers, he replied: "We need the Syrian forces to  maintain security. They are present at some barriers and not at  others, according to need. These are military matters."    Al-Hariri pointed out that "the position of the state and  the  government is that the solution in the Middle East will not be  at Lebanon's expense. That is what the Americans assured us of  in two messages from President Clinton and his secretary of  state. Secretary Christopher assured me of this personally,  directly after the Geneva summit. To say that the solution  would be at Lebanon's expense is out of the question." [passage  omitted]    He was asked: If Israel told Lebanon that it was willing to  withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territory, would the state  accept such a withdrawal separately from Syria or would it await  the results of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations? He replied:  "Israel never said that it was willing to withdraw from Lebanon.  It said it was willing to sign a peace agreement with Lebanon.  If there is going to be a peace agreement, we and Syria should  be together. Resolution 425 means unconditional Israeli  withdrawal from Lebanon. We demand that. When President Hafiz  al-Asad met with President Clinton, he asked him openly to  implement that resolution. Its implementation means Israel's  withdrawal. So let it withdraw. We have no problem with that,  nor has Syria, but when it comes to signing a peace agreement  with Israel, we and Syria should be together. Why do we say  this? Because the matter concerns our national security and  Syria's national security." [passage omitted]    He denied deep differences between the three leaders [the  prime minister, the president, and the speaker of the chamber of  deputies). He expressed the belief that time will correct the  experiment. He said that it is inaccurate to use the word  hegemony (of one authority over another). [passage omitted]    Al-Hariri emphasized that "there will be no government  changes or reshuffle for the time being." He said that the  reason there is continuous talk about that "is that there are  some who do not like the situation, and the best way of  weakening the government is to say that it is on its way out."    He said that, in his view, "the ministers act on the basis  that the government will not change for the time being, but that  does not mean it will be there forever. It would fall if the  Chamber of Deputies withdrew confidence from it or if one third  of the ministers resigned, or if the prime minister resigned. I  have no intention of resigning at the present time." [passage  omitted]</p>

The company uses the cleanroom to manufacture the silicon-based  acceleration sensors that it has developed itself, and which are  designed primarily for use in motor vehicle applications.    Mannesmann Kienzle has invested all of 4.5 million German  marks [DM] to build the new manufacturing center, where  acceleration sensors are produced using processes similar to  those involved in the production of electronic devices:  photolithography, diffusion, and etching. However, the main  focus here is not on obtaining electrical functions, but on  setting up mechanical functions on the minutest area. As in the  manufacture of ICs [integrated circuits], the sensor "chips" are  fabricated on a wafer, which is processed under cleanroom  conditions (class 100). One wafer accommodates 99 sensors. The  micromechanical production plant is designed for a capacity of  up to 1 million sensors a year.    The sensors work as follows: The silicon chip is etched in  such a way as to create a freely oscillating inert mass  positioned between, but not touching, two aluminum electrodes.  The electrodes are mounted on two glass platelets, which are  fixed together and also constitute the sensor housing. The two  electrodes and the inert mass between them form a differential  capacitor. The capacitances of the two capacitors vary  according to the excursion of the silicon mass. If the sensor  is now subjected to acceleration, the amount of acceleration can  be measured from the fluctuations in capacitance. Mannesmann  Kienzle's main target market is the automobile industry.  Production Manager Wolfgang Tauser anticipates an annual growth  rate of about 90 percent for the sensors over the next few years.</p>

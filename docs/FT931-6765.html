			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Landlords' landlord calls time on traditional relationship - A look at the problems facing the response of GrandMet and Courage to the government's beer orders OUTSIDE the annual meeting of Grand Metropolitan last Tuesday publicans were protesting that the food and drinks group was charging 'excessive' rents on its pub properties. The alleged hardship and havoc that resulted were 'Killing Our National Heritage: The Pub', one sign proclaimed. Inside, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, was giving shareholders a more upbeat appraisal. The leases the company offered through Inntrepreneur Estates, its joint venture with Courage, the brewer, were helping to transform the pub trade into a more consumer-oriented business. Only 'a very small minority' of Inntrepreneur's 4,700 leaseholders were trading unsuccessfully. 'Rents are not imposed. They are agreed by both parties.' But for some licensees the economics are not working. 'Inntrepreneur wants Pounds 1,500 a week from me in rent and arrears, but my weekly takings are only Pounds 1,000,' said Mrs June Varty, licensee of the Gardeners Arms at Droylsden near Manchester. The two sides have argued for several years over leases and rents but a deepening recession in the pub trade has brought an extra edge to the debate. Disgruntled publicans have formed the National Association of Inntrepreneur Licensees to press their case with GrandMet and in the courts. Nail's concern is not just the level of rents but some of the terms of the 20-year leases. Three years ago, Courage and GrandMet told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the establishment of the Inntrepreneur joint venture that the move from short tenancies to long leases was inevitable. The resulting MMC report said that the companies argued that 'twenty year leases for public houses would develop whether or not the transaction went ahead. They were appropriate in changing market conditions'. The National Licensed Victuallers Association, however, expressed concern about the leases to which GrandMet had begun to convert its own pub tenancies in 1988. The NLVA told the MMC that it accepted the principle of the leases. But it complained that the terms of letting and the management tactics of GrandMet had caused 'grief and heartache' to many erstwhile licensees. 'If pitfalls in the basic terms of the lease, such as high rents and penalties for failing to achieve the minimum purchasing obligation, could be rectified, the businesses could be run successfully,' the NLVA said. But it 'daily handled many examples of lessees facing financial ruin as a direct result of these terms'. The MMC ignored the licensees' pleas and Inntrepreneur was established with its commercial plans to convert all the pub tenancies of its merged estate to 20-year leases intact. GrandMet devised the leases in anticipation of the 1989 MMC report on competition in the brewing industry which persuaded the government to loosen the grip of national brewers on pub retailing by forcing them to free a third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies. The government orders sharpened the brewers' focus on their retailing operations. In reshaping their estates, they were forced to evaluate the potential profitability of every individual pub; to treat them like other mainstream forms of commercial/retail property. As GrandMet had foreseen, long-term assignable leases offered brewers the best way of maximising profits from pubs in a more competitive environment. In return for market rents and liability for repairs, the pub landlord could be offered greater security and a chance to share in the capital appreciation of the business. Inntrepreneur, which was the first important response from the industry to the government orders, set an example that has been followed by other national brewers. Bass, the UK's largest brewer, has converted more than 1,000 of its pub tenancies to long-term leases. The Whitbread pub partnership scheme covers 2,300 of its licensees. When Inntrepreneur began trading in 1991, GrandMet had converted 2,000 of the 3,150 tenanted pubs it brought to the venture. Of the enlarged estate of 6,850 pubs, about 4,700 are now on long-term leases. The aim is to convert the rest over the next 12 months. Recession has added to the difficulties of the restructuring. Inntrepreneur  -and its lessees - have been hit by falling property values and the squeeze on consumer spending. Rents agreed in the more buoyant market of a few years ago have been tougher for licensees to meet as trading conditions have declined. Pub beer sales fell by up to 5 per cent last year and the failure rate of Inntrepreneur leaseholders rose. Some 9 per cent of them have gone out of business in the past two years. The value of Inntrepreneur's pub estate was estimated at Pounds 2.8bn when the deal was first proposed in 1990. By the time it came to fruition a year later, the slide in the property market had reduced that to Pounds 2.36bn. Inntrepreneur has now sold 1,500 of its smaller outlets but has continued to suffer from asset deflation. Further revaluations of the remaining property last year cut its value by Pounds 234m, or 11 per cent, to less than Pounds 2bn. GrandMet charged its Pounds 117m share of the reduction against reserves. Inntrepreneur made a trading profit of Pounds 162m last year but after interest payments of Pounds 203m recorded an operating loss of Pounds 28m. Apart from sharing that loss, GrandMet and Courage each had to inject another Pounds 32m to ensure it met its banking covenants. With bank debt standing at Pounds 1.27bn, the company is unlikely to be able to meet the covenants' conditions this year that debt should not exceed 57.5 per cent of assets. A further revaluation of Inntrepreneur's pubs will be made in September. 'If it is necessary to put in more money, then we shall do so,' Mr David Nash, GrandMet's finance director, said this week. Inntrepreneur's finances will be helped by recent reductions in interest rates and industry analysts agree that at the trading level, the venture is progressing satisfactorily. Most expect another small operating loss this year but forecast it will break even or move into profit in 1994. Once Inntrepreneur becomes profitable, few would be surprised if its owners did not sell it or float it. Events this week have done little to change the widespread view that the venture fits uncomfortably with GrandMet's portfolio of international brands.</p>

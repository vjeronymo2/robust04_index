			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from Nikolayev </F> Alumina Plant by Ivan Petkov, identified by caption; figures in  brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and  seconds]    [Text] [201103] [Petkov over aerial views of Nikolayev  Alumina Plant] The Nikolayev Alumina Plant, the biggest of its  kind in Europe, is in trouble because of a minute capsule  containing pure and hence particularly radioactive cesium.  Criminals removed the capsule from a measuring instrument in the  hope of lining their pockets by selling the valuable metal.  Twenty of the plant's workers have so far been affected. Three  had to be dispatched to Kharkov for special treatment at an  institute. An investigation is under way.    Meanwhile specialists have worked out that 200 cubic meters  of contaminated soil will have to be removed from the plant's  territory and buried. An even bigger quantity of water will  have to be removed from the reservoir where water for  fire-fighting purposes is kept. It is assumed that the  ill-fated cesium capsule is resting at the bottom of this  reservoir. [201147] [video shows extensive aerial views of  Nikolayev alumina plant and reservoir]</p>

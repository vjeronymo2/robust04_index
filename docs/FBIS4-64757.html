			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eastern Cleanup To Cost Up To DM270 </F> Billion"]    [Text] Enormous sums are required to clean up the  extensive environmental damage in the former GDR, concludes a  study commissioned by the Industrial Initiative for  Environmental Protection in the New Laender.    Most of the environmental damage in the former GDR was  caused  by planned economy considerations. The GDR wanted to increase  industrial output at all costs, and was never genuinely  concerned about a clean environment.    The Institute of German Industry says major investments are  required to clear the damage. The lowest estimate is 82.8  billion marks [DM], the highest is DM521 billion. The widest  range of estimates concerns the removal of old waste. The cost  of performing this operation is estimated at between DM3 billion  and 270 billion. The operation would entail either the  elimination of acute dangers, for instance by erecting fences  around contaminated lakes, or comprehensive cleanup work, such  as the excavation, cleaning, and recultivation of soil.    In the GDR, enterprises were supplied with quantities of  energy equal to the quantities they had consumed during the  previous period of reckoning, a practice that led to senseless  waste. Therefore, an enterprise that consumed its coal supply  sparingly could expect to receive less coal for the following  period.    In this way, energy was wasted without regard to the  environment, says the report. Therefore, private households  also felt no encouragement to economize on energy.</p>

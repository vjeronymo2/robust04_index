			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Theroux paddles his own canoe - The travel writers' trials THE HAPPY ISLES OF OCEANIA: PADDLING THE PACIFIC by Paul Theroux Hamish Hamilton Pounds 16.99, 541 pages TRAVEL writing is not especially easy. There are too many traps, of which sentimentality, superficiality and counterfeit enthusiasm are only the three most obvious. The worst sort of 'travel writing,' common in newspapers but also found in books, is practically identical to advertising copy-writing. It is designed to move product, sell holidays, put bums on aircraft seats. The best sort of travel writing, on the other hand, may be many things: what Paul Theroux, in his introduction to someone else's travel book (Moritz Thomsen's The Saddest Pleasure) has called a report of a journey, a memoir, an autobiography, a confession, a foray into topography and history, a narrative - a summing-up. Whatever it is, it requires an abundance of technique, however skilfully disguised. To see how it is done, you can seldom do better than Paul Theroux himself, whose latest travel book, about the Pacific, is panoramically accomplished. The writing is cool, the reportage industrious and the research rock-solid. Theroux's control of his material is a wonder to behold. My only quibble is its silly title, but I doubt that that was Theroux's idea - probably a marketing wally's. Theroux is a loner, eccentric, possibly weird. But it is thanks to his talent for solitariness and to his monomaniacal determination to paddle between this island and that in a collapsible kayak that we owe many of the bonuses of this remarkable adventure. A kayak, yes. Despite sharks, crocs, currents, surf and sometimes unpredictable and surly natives, Theroux is never happier than when paddling his little craft to unpopulated spots as far from human company as he can get. Here he is, for example, loading his boat for a trip to the secluded islands of the Vava'u group, a part of Tonga whose attraction to Theroux is that it doesn't contain any Tongans: 'My heaviest single item was water. . . I carried it in two- and three-gallon bags, a week's supply, which I stuffed under the bulkheads, with my waterproof bags containing my food, my dry clothes, my stove, my pots, my tent. On the deck, in a plastic holder, I had my map of the whole archipelago, and a water bottle, and a compass. Close to hand I had emergency flares.' Theroux's journeying starts in New Zealand, with a mind-clearing trek in Fiordland. Then he visits Australia, where not all his encounters are happy ones. At a literary dinner in Fremantle a fat drunk lurches down the hall and stands menacing Theroux in front of all the guests, gargling and making gestures. 'You're a wanker, mate]' says the drunk, and has to be dragged away. After that, Theroux heads for Melanesia (the Trobriands, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Fiji), Polynesia (Tonga, Vava'u, Western and American Samoa, Tahiti, the Marquesas, the Cook islands and Easter Island) and eventually Hawaii. Theroux could not be dull if he tried. And he is scrupulously inquisitive. He does not just tell us that Samoans are famously fat. He finds out why. The answer is massive amounts of bananas, taro, breadfruit; fat-white mutton; unsaleable parts of dead animals imported from New Zealand and Australia - chicken backs, parson's noses, trotters, withers; canned corned beef so loaded with fat (sometimes hippo fat) that it can be eaten with a spoon. In Tahiti for Bastille Day, he watches the gala the French call Heiva Tahiti  -Tahiti Festival - which turns out, as he expects, to be a 'wonderful example of colonial comedy and hypocrisy'. After the parade, Theroux talks to some of the French foreign legionnaires who are thick on the ground in Polynesia. He discovers that the legionnaires often buy their Tahitian girlfriends sets of false teeth. 'When the legionnaire goes home to France he takes his girlfriend's teeth with him, so as to leave her less attractive to men. 'Sometimes the girl does not want to give her teeth back,' a legionnaire told me in Papeete. 'Then we turn her upside down and shake them out of her.'' Theroux gives ground to no man in castigation of the French and their infantile colonial behaviour. If the French foreign ministry is still unsure of the harm France does itself with its antics in the Pacific - most wickedly, its nuclear testing - then it ought to have Pages 414-415 faxed to Paris at once. When France has destroyed a few more atolls, says Theroux, and managed to make the islands glow with so much radioactivity that night is turned to day; when they have sold the rest of the fishing rights; when everything has been thoroughly plundered, the French will plan a great ceremony and grandly offer the unemployed, deracinated Pacific citizens in T-shirts and flip-flops their independence. 'In the destruction of the islands, the French imperial intention, its mission civilisatrice, will be complete.' Theroux is equally sharp when writing about the missionaries and other trawlers for souls - Mormons, especially, but also Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, Catholics, the whole despicable crew  - that have played such an egregious role in shaping the Pacific. Many will rate this Paul Theroux's best travel book. Me, I love them all.</p>

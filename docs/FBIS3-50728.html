The order  was given in recognition of the significant accomplishments  attained during her brilliant artistic career and her invaluable  contribution to the development of culture on the occasion of  the 45th anniversary of the Cuban Ballet. This was also a happy  coincidence for Alonso who is celebrating her birthday today.  Likewise, the National Culture award was presented to a group of  artists and technicians of the Grand Theater of Havana who have  dedicated their lives to this important artistic endeavor.</p>

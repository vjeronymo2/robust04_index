			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok vernacular dailies --  KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT and SIAM POST -- carry editorials commenting  on the political situation following the submission to the House  by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's a motion to set up a new  constitution redrafting committee, in a bid to ease up political  tension following a hunger strike by activist Chalat Worachat.    KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2,  entitled:  "For the Sake of Democracy, Do Not Stop Phalang Tham's Motion,"  notes that the setting up of the "Democracy Development  Committee" proposed by House Speaker Marut Bunnak has, to a  certain extent, alleviated the "severity" of the political  tension caused by the hunger strike. "We are satisfied with the  attitude of the government and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in  this regard. However, it is necessary for all parties concerned  to prove their sincerity with action."    The editorial says: "We regard as the right step the motion  submitted by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's for the deliberation of  the house, the setting up of an extraordinary committee to  compile, rewrite, and draft a constitution.    "The Phalang Tham MP's have done their job in the  legislative  branch. Such a move will not affect the image of the government  or create any rift within the coalition. The Phalang Tham  party's endorsement of the motion will prove that it truly  adheres to the principles of democracy, and not the political  etiquette of being a partner of the coalition government. We  feel that the Democrat Party, as the leading core of the  coalition, should be broad minded enough not to oppose the  decision of the Phalang Tham Party."    In conclusion, the editorial says: "The government should  generously allow the house speaker to place the motion on the  house agenda as soon as possible. All political parties, both  in the coalition and opposition bloc, must allow their MP's to  vote freely with the sense of responsibility toward democratic  development and the country."    SIAM POST's 350-word editorial, on page 4, entitled:  "Democracy," notes: "Many political observers believe that the  current political conflict will not lead to the violence of the  'May 1992' incident because all concerned parties abide by the  laws and are aware of their rights and freedom."    "The problem that may arise now is the effect of the Phalang  Tham Party motion after it is passed into law on the  now-functioning parliament constitutional amendment commission  and the parliamentary mechanism.    "This is a new political phenomenon worth everybody's keen  attention. Meanwhile, the New Aspiration Party is planning to  submit a motion to the house to amend Article 211 of the  Constitution to pave way for the formation of the constitution  drafting council."    The editorial points out that the people are confused by  political parties and politicians. "What is happening now  indicates that our political parties and politicians lack unity  and discipline. Hence, the cabinet cannot function smoothly and  the parliamentary mechanism might eventually fall apart."</p>

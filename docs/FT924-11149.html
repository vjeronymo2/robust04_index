			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (7): Who reaps benefits of economic growth? - Banking BANKERS in Colombo express their avid support for the government's liberal economic policies. In the past three years, business has picked up, offices have been refurbished and the freeing of exchange controls has allowed foreign banks to repatriate profits. Government officials, however, are not so enamoured with the banks and claim they are monopolising the benefits of economic growth. The government has adopted a campaign of moral persuasion to convince banks that, unless the 'trickle down' to poorer sections of the population is increased, social unrest may re-emerge. The response from banks has not been encouraging. One executive noted bluntly: 'I'm not going to lend on the basis of a threat of insurgency two years down the line'. Sri Lanka is not alone among developing countries in experiencing the rude shock that, upon liberalising the economy, banks prove reluctant to fund the government's social agenda. Despite its frustration, however, the government is unlikely to alter its policy of reducing the state's role in the banking sector. In the short-term, this will require firm action in restructuring the two state banks and setting a timetable for banks to comply with Bank for International Settlements (BIS) guidelines, particularly on capital adequacy. Sri Lankan banks' capital requirements are based on a percentage of customer deposits, a standard not recognised internationally. The two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, account for about 70 per cent of total lending and dominate the industry. But years of mismanagement and political interference have left them undercapitalised and with a large volume of non-performing loans. Central bank officials will only describe the state banks' capital adequacy ratio (CAR) as 'low' and the requirement for new capital as 'substantial'. Private bankers suggest the two banks have a CAR of about 4 per cent of risk-weighted assets, compared to 8 per cent under BIS guidelines. The central bank is also reluctant to publicise the state banks' non-performing loans but these may be as high as 30 per cent of their portfolios, according to bankers. A World Bank plan to split each state bank into two companies - one to take the substantial burden of debt and be slowly run down, the other to emerge as a financially sound and efficient enterprise - was rejected by the government. This followed concern, government officials say, that the plan would entail the closure of many rural branches and the retrenchment of staff. The government has also ruled out a World Bank suggestion that the two banks be privatised. 'We are not moving towards privatisation. We are moving towards commercialisation - making them commercially viable entities - which may achieve the same result as that of privatisation,' explains Mr S. T. Fernando, deputy governor of the central bank. The private banks in Sri Lanka - 17 foreign and four domestic - are in better shape, although many do not fully recognise their non-performing loans and may need to increase capital to satisfy the BIS. It remains uncertain when the guidelines will be implemented. A deadline of January 1 next year had been set but government officials now concede the state banks will be unable to meet that date. Central bank rules demand that the guidelines be enforced on all banks simultaneously. Other weaknesses of the sector include a volatile interbank rate which, due to the dominant role of the two state banks in the interbank market, can vary over 20 percentage points in any one week. Central bank officials say they would like to see generally lower interest rates. But they add that until a long-term capital market is established, it will be impossible to decide how low a short-term interest rate should be. Banks currently offer deposit rates of 15-17 per cent and lending rates anywhere from 18-23 per cent, giving a spread on high risk loans of up to 8 per cent. On their dollar offshore accounts, banks are offering around two percentage points above Libor for deposits. Government treasury bills, of which there are about SLRs75bn outstanding, give about 18 per cent interest - a real interest rate, once inflation is deducted, of 7 per cent. This has led many banks with excess dollars to buy rupees on the interbank market and invest in treasury bills. While the treasury bills have helped to fund the government's budget deficit, their high interest rate has undermined its campaign to persuade banks to lend to the productive sector. As one central bank official notes: 'With a risk-free investment providing 18 per cent, why look around for productive investment which carries a risk?' While the task of restructuring the sector is a big one, the government and central bank have maintained a decent record at tackling important issues. In particular, they have followed an International Monetary Fund prescription of limiting the growth of bank credit. The banking sector's assets, made up primarily of customer loans, grew from SLRs81bn at the end of 1990, to SLRs102bn last June. In September, the central bank demanded that banks placed with it the rupee equivalent of 13 per cent of onshore foreign currency deposits. This removed SLRs1.3bn from the banking system, tightening the government's control over money supply and reducing banks' ability to lend. 'Banks certainly do feel the pinch of keeping this money sterile here and not earnings interest, but that is part of the game. We have to maintain a certain amount of monetary discipline,' says Mr Fernando. Bankers say, however, that the decision marked the breakdown of an informal dialogue between the central bank and private financial institutions over policy changes. Central bank officials say it reflected their growing confidence in supervising the economy. Mr Fernando says: 'There was no necessity for discussion with the commercial banks, because the central bank was quite convinced it was a decision in the right direction'.</p>

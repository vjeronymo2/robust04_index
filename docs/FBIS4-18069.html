			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Hencke article: "Tougher Aid Rules `Fate to UK </F> Trade'"]    [Text] Three leading industrialists yesterday accused the  Overseas Development Administration [ODA] of leading British  exporters towards "a massacre" by imposing tighter rules on aid  and trade subsidies in the wake of the Pergau dam scandal.    John Lippitt, a director of GEC [General Electric Company],  told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee which is  investigating the 1 billion pound aid-for-arms deal, that the  restrictions to come into force next year were "fundamentally  flawed."    Mr Lippitt was giving evidence with Sir Robin Biggam,  chairman of BICC [British Insulated Calanders Cables], the  parent company of Balfour Beatty, which won the 417 million  pound dam contract, and Allan Gormly, a director of Cementation  International.    All three condemned a review conducted by the ODA which from  next year will limit aid to exporters to creditworthy countries  with average annual income below 760 pounds per capita and to  schemes costing less than 48 million pounds. This compares with  2,465 pounds per capita with no limit on the cost of schemes  under the OECD rules agreed by Britain's competitors.    Mr Lippitt pointed out that such a policy would remove  support for all big schemes like power stations and dams. In  addition every country in Southeast Asia would become ineligible  for aid except China and Indonesia.    "We don't mind following the rules which apply to other  countries but the Overseas Development Administration is  proposing to take our troops 50 miles ahead of everybody else.  We know what happens when troops are put in such a position --  they are massacred."    He also accused the German government of breaching the rules  to win bids which Britain was poised to sign over the Shanghai  and Canton metros.    "Chancellor Kohl who was visiting Beijing at the time was  determined to win every single metro contract in China," he  said. As a result the Germans gave grants of 51 per cent and 68  per cent. OECD rules limit grants to 35 per cent.    Earlier Sir Robin criticised the ODA,s handling of the  Pergau  project, which secured 234 million pounds of British taxpayers,  aid.    He said the department's two day assessment of the scheme  was  "absurd" and could not have been accomplished without visiting  the site.    Questioned by Labour MPs, the directors denied that  donations  to the Conservative Party from GEC and Trafalgar House increased  their chances of winning contracts.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> They don't have a scorer or rebounder in the top 10. They aren't first in any  individual or team statistical department. Only in won-loss record do the  Lakers lead the NBA. . . .  </P> <P> "The Lakers are opportunists," Boston Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers said. "That's  what they're all about. You can't afford to make a mistake against them." . . .  </P> <P> Vlade Divac might have been the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft instead of No. 26  if scouts knew what they do today. I mean, would you rather have him or Pervis  Ellison? . . .  </P> <P> The Lakers' top spot in the league could be in jeopardy this week. A game and a  half ahead of Portland, they must face San Antonio and Denver on the road on  consecutive nights and then Philadelphia and Utah at the Forum. Meanwhile,  Portland is stuck on the road, but against Charlotte, Cleveland, Chicago and  Indiana. . . .  </P> <P> Who got booed the loudest during pregame introductions at the Forum Sunday?  Larry Bird or Kevin McHale, you say? No. Referee Jake O'Donnell. . . .  </P> <P> Most Forum fans don't even bother trying to rattle Bird at the free-throw line  anymore. They know it won't do any good. . . .  </P> <P> Overlooked in the Lakers' victory was the inspired performance of Orlando  Woolridge off the bench. . . .  </P> <P> Watching Michael Cooper play defense is more interesting than watching most  guys play offense. . . .  </P> <P> One reason for UCLA's slump is poor outside shooting. The Bruins are 12 for 49  from three-point range in their past three games. . . .  </P> <P> Don't confuse the dollars of a James (Buster) Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight  with those of a Douglas-Mike Tyson rematch. Not even close. Douglas is a huge  attraction only in the same ring with Tyson. . . .  </P> <P> However, it is refreshing to see someone in boxing, Douglas' manager John  Johnson, finally stand up to Don King. . . .  </P> <P> While negotiations for Douglas-Holyfield continue, Johnson has scheduled a  meeting in Las Vegas with George Foreman adviser Ron Weathers. . . .  </P> <P> The NHL would not have been out of line to suspend Laurie Boschman of Winnipeg  for the rest of the season instead of eight games for his vicious attack on  Tomas Sandstrom of the Kings. . . .  </P> <P> The entire St. Louis Blues roster won't be paid as much as Will Clark this  year. . . .  </P> <P> King Coach Tom Webster on his recent fall in the shower: "Maybe I should wear a  helmet." . . .  </P> <P> Unless he's traded before the Thursday deadline, Dallas Maverick forward Sam  Perkins will be the most sought-after free agent in the league after the  season. . . .  </P> <P> Bill Buckner, who signed a minor league contract with the Red Sox, is getting a  bum rap from the media and Boston fans. He should be remembered for more than  his error in the World Series against the Mets. Here's a natural who will be  able to hit a line drive 20 years after he retires. . . .  </P> <P> Trainer Ron McAnally ought to enter his exceptional mare, Bayakoa, in the Santa  Anita Handicap. We're not exactly talking about one of the greatest Big 'Cap  fields ever. . . .  </P> <P> Laz Barrera's Kentucky Derby candidate Mister Frisky equaled Man o' War's  winning streak when he won his 14th in a row at Santa Anita. Now he is aiming  at Citation's record of 16. . . .  </P> <P> On a rainy Saturday afternoon in Arcadia, Santa Anita ticket sellers were  advised not to sell any reserved seats below row 7. Anything above that is  protected by the roof. . . .  </P> <P> Proud papa: All seven children of Joe Pimentel, twin brother of former  bantamweight contender Jesus and not a bad featherweight himself, are either  attending college or have graduated. . . .  </P> <P> Floyd Patterson, 55, looked more like 45 when interviewed on ESPN the other  night. . . .  </P> <P> The Wright State Raiders of Dayton, Ohio, boast the best record of any  independent in the nation at 18-5. . . .  </P> <P> Honeymooning at The Lodge in Pebble Beach are Jeanie Buss, daughter of Jerry,  and two-time U.S. Olympic volleyball gold medalist Steve Timmons. Best man at  the Valentine's Day wedding in Carmel was Timmons' former teammate Karch  Kiraly. . . .  </P> <P> If you're still swimming competitively at 25, you're a senior citizen who is  eligible for masters' meets. . . .  </P> <P> Pat Haden would have been a terrific quarterback in the San Francisco 49ers'  system. . . . Nevada Las Vegas forward Larry Johnson deserves consideration as  college basketball player of the year. . . .  </P> <P> Whatever happened to Mark Macon, the Temple guard who was supposed to be the  next Oscar Robertson? . . .  </P> <P> I sure miss those pictures in the paper of ballplayers doing sit-ups in Florida  and Arizona.  </P></p>

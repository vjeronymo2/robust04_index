			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Potential cost of selling it cheap every day - Is Kingfisher's unexciting performance down to its strategy of permanently low prices? Is everyday low pricing the right retailing strategy for the 1990s? Yesterday's relatively lacklustre UK results from Kingfisher - the Comet, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworth group - raises a question of growing interest to City analysts and competitors in the retailing industry. Kingfisher unveiled a jump in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 205m, before exceptional items, to Pounds 309.3m - apparently a strong performance. But much of the gain came from last year's Pounds 1bn acquisition of French electrical retailer Darty, without which earnings growth since 1990 would have been unexciting. The blame in some quarters is being put on the strategy promoted by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher chairman, of cutting prices, which has resulted in lower margins but disappointing volume growth. Sir Geoffrey, however, is adamant that the approach is sound, but that it needs time. 'The combination of a shift away from promotions and sales to everyday low pricing, stronger merchandise ranges and significantly improved customer service generally resulted in promising increases in like-for-like sales,' he insists. Everyday low pricing dates back to the start of modern retailing last century, to Woolworth's 'Five and dime' stores in the US or Marks and Spencer's penny bazaars in the UK. There have always been 'discount' retailers concentrating not on high margins, but on selling large volumes of goods as cheaply as possible. What refocused attention on the potential of that approach in the late 1980s  -especially in the US - was the huge success of discount chains such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, and other new formats such as warehouse clubs, or 'category killers' like Toys R Us, whose central philosophy is EDLP. The theory is that in chains which tightly control costs, lower prices should increase volumes and market share, generating increased profits and buying power which can be used to cut prices further - the so-called 'virtuous circle'. Other retailers experimented with a consistently low-price stance. The shift to EDLP was given further impetus in the US when the consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble decided in 1991 to adopt an EDLP approach in supplying retailers, ending 'trade allowances' - periodic discounts to retailers to allow them promote brands at lower prices. By mid-1992, one US survey found six out of 10 packaged-goods manufacturers and almost half of all retailers had implemented or tested EDLP. Now EDLP, value pricing, or 'investing in margin', are becoming buzzwords among UK retailers - partly in reaction to the recent influx of US and continental European discount formats. Kingfisher has been the most vocal proponent, although Sir Geoffrey's EDLP campaign kicked off in earnest only a year ago, with the introduction of permanently reduced 'key lines' in his chains. Some retail experts support his claim that it is too early to judge the results. They argue customers are slow to pick up the low-price message on high-ticket products purchased only infrequently - such as those in Kingfisher's B&amp;Q DIY chain or Comet electrical chain. Critics counter that the results of EDLP should have been seen more quickly in lower-ticket chains such as Woolworth. They also point to the apparent success of EDLP elsewhere. One example is Marks and Spencer, which has not referred to it as such, but which some analysts argue has effectively adopted an EDLP approach. Its 'Outstanding Value' campaign, launched in autumn 1992, froze the price of 75 per cent of its products, and reduced the price of the remainder. The campaign brought a significant increase in volumes, attested to by M&amp;S suppliers, and a 21 per cent increase in profits in the latest half-year to Pounds 308m. Moving to permanently low pricing has been central to the recovery of the Asda and Gateway grocery chains, after both ran into difficulties in the early 1990s. Asda was reported last week to be strengthening its commitment to EDLP with a call to its suppliers to move away from periodic discounts towards consistently lower prices. Yet, strangely, a limited move to EDLP does not seem to have worked at the UK's biggest grocer J Sainsbury, which indefinitely cut the price of 300 own-label products accounting for 10 per cent of sales last October. The result, revealed in January, was a 0.4 per cent drop in gross margin and a 1 per cent underlying fall in sales. Analysts suggest that Sainsbury's move, like Kingfisher's, suffered from poor marketing. Yet both ran higher-profile campaigns than Marks and Spencer. 'I am still convinced EDLP will play a major role in UK retailing in the 1990s,' says Richard Hyman, director of retail research group Verdict. 'Kingfisher has taken an important step in introducing it into its corporate strategy.' Whether or not such predictions come true, it is already clear that simply cutting prices may not bring customers streaming through the doors. Getting the range of products and customer service right, and effectively communicating the message to consumers, are an integral part of the process.</p>

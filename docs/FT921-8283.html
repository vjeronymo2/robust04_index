			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / North Sea oil price falls after Opec deal NORTH SEA oil prices fell almost Dollars 1 a barrel yesterday amid pessimism on the London market following the insubstantial weekend agreement by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Geneva. The 1m barrels a day (b/d) cut in production agreed by Opec, to about 23m b/d, was smaller than traders had expected, and North Sea Brent crude prices dipped from Dollars 18.40 to Dollars 17.525 a barrel in busy trading. The agreement is set to be undermined by the reservations of the organisation's largest producers; Saudi Arabia said it would produce more than its allocation and Iran believed output cuts should have been deeper. One crude trader for a Norwegian oil company said: 'The market is questioning whether we have a firm agreement at all.' London market traders had taken a more optimistic view of oil prices late last week when it looked as though Opec was approaching a deal to reduce the flow of oil by some 1.5m b/d. 'The final agreement came as a real disappointment,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, manager of the petroleum desk at Smith Barney. 'The next few days will be very dangerous for oil prices.' Most Opec ministers believed the new production arrangement would at least stabilise prices. But few were optimistic that it would push prices up towards their target of Dollars 21 a barrel. Traders will now be looking for signs that the producers' club can deliver the promised cuts in output. If these are not evident in the market in the next month, prices could collapse further. Traders believe that the fact that Opec has scheduled its next meeting for two months' time seems to suggest that the organisation is sceptical about the effectiveness of its latest deal.

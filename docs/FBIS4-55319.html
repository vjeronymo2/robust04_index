			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "sad:" "NBP on Current Exchange With Foreign </F> Countries--Still Negative"]    [Text] The National Bank of Poland [NBP] reports  that, after the first quarter of the year, the foreign trade  deficit was $268 million. Despite the deficit, the state's  foreign currency reserves exceeded the figure of $5 billion.    In its monthly reports on a balance of routine exchange, the  NBP takes into account trade with foreign countries involving  merchandise, services, the repayment of interest rates on  foreign debts, and the transfer of hard currency. The NBP  calculates the balance on the basis of reports on changes in the  balance of bank accounts from several dozen banks that are  middlemen in foreign trade transactions.    After the first quarter of this year, the routine exchange  deficit was $438 million.  <H5>  Trade Involving Merchandise </H5>   "The trade deficit involving merchandise after the first  quarter was lower by $100 million compared with a year ago, but  it nevertheless surpassed the $268-million mark," Jozef Sobota,  a director at the NBP's Analysis Department, told journalists  yesterday [12 May]. Over the same period, export revenues came  to $3.489 billion (14.8 percent less than during three months of  last year), while import expenditures amounted to $3.757 billion  (an increase of 10.2 percent). "Preliminary data indicate that,  in April, the trade balance involving merchandise could possibly  be positive," director Sobota stated.  <H5>  Services and Property Income </H5>   In the first three months of this year, revenue from the  sale  of services (this mainly refers to transportation) exceeded  expenditures borne of having the services brought in by $74  million, despite the fact that, in March, the deficit was $6  million (last year it was $2 million).    Property income (including, among other things, dividends  paid to Polish companies for participation in foreign companies)  amounted to $17 million after the first quarter (a year ago it  was $24 million).  <H5>  Interest Rates and Transfers </H5>   The negative balance of interest rates being paid on foreign  debts was $1.119 billion, which is a decrease of $351 million  compared with a year ago. This happened despite the fact that  we had to repay $634 million to the Paris Club in March.    Official transfers amounted to $765 million, out of which  $734 million was the 80 percent of interest rates that the Paris  Club decided to write off for us. After the first quarter, the  balance of private transfers was $93 million (last year it was  $106 million).  <H5>  Dollar Reserves </H5>   Despite the trade deficit, the NBP's official reserves were  $5.080 billion after the first quarter. The reserves rose by as  much as $704 million just since March, and that figure includes  the $504 million of credit obtained from the IMF.    In the view of the NBP, the so-called border-area exports,  among others, had a very big impact on the level of the  reserves: Tourists leave hard currency, thus contributing to a  surplus in the purchases of hard currency at hard-currency  exchange units; that surplus was $758 million.</p>

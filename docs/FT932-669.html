			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Russian president faces curb on powers PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention, which reconvened at the weekend, is no closer to adopting a new constitution despite progress in refining a draft text, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Yeltsin said one more plenary meeting of the convention was required to finalise a draft but set no date for it. Many participants believe the new constitution can only be adopted after parliamentary elections this autumn. Parliament, meanwhile, officially boycotted the meeting, although several deputies showed up. The refined draft establishes reassuring checks on the president's powers, following fears that the original draft could become a blueprint for dictatorship. A loose phrase allowing Mr Yeltsin or his successors to dissolve parliament when a political crisis cannot be resolved by constitutional means has been dropped. The latest presidential draft also seeks to appease supporters of a rival parliamentary draft, which is touted as being more socially just, by incorporating a citizen's right to housing - even though economists might deem this an unwise commitment on the part of a bankrupt state. The main point of conflict now centres on defining the rights of Russia's 89 regions and republics. The new draft says the 22 republics, which are based on ethnic minorities, are 'sovereign' while the regions, many of which are richer and more powerful than republics, are just 'state formations'. While some critics argue that calling the republics sovereign only panders to separatist aspirations, some regions are upset at not being given an equal status to republics.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / The Long View: You shall go to the ball The Cinderella asset is back in favour. Property may be lagging a long way behind the securities markets but it is beginning to share in their buoyancy. Institutional investors in the UK are becoming active buyers of commercial real estate once again, and in the residential market prices are starting to creep higher on a year-on-year basis, although the level of transactions remains low compared with the halcyon days of the late 1980s. But first, it is worth highlighting how much the property market has slipped behind the stock and bond markets. Last year, even though commercial property prices began to rise, and according to the property agents Healey &amp; Baker, average prime investment yields declined from 8.5 to 7.0 per cent, the investment returns were still relatively poor. Average total returns for 1993 are being estimated at 13 or 14 per cent, compared with 28 per cent on UK equities and more than 30 per cent on long-dated gilts. The average 1993 return on the portfolios of UK pension funds - which these days only have about 5 per cent of their assets in UK property - was 28 per cent. But property follows a rather different cycle. Its last boom year was in 1988 when it returned 30 per cent, while the average pension fund's asset mix produced only 12 per cent. In the last three years property has suffered a hangover while equity and bond prices have roared ahead: compared with the aggregate 86 per cent return in three years on UK equities, UK real estate has returned only 7 per cent. A similar deviation has been seen in residential property, where prices bottomed out last year. As investments, houses have performed very poorly Since 1989, losing about 10 per cent of their value nationally and more than 20 per cent in the harder-hit south-east of England. Yet since the end of 1988, remember, share prices have shown capital growth of some 80 per cent. Clearly the smart private investor would have sold his house in the late 1980s, rented a place and switched his wealth into stocks. Housing is for nesting, not investing, according to today's wisdom. It is, however, time to be considering the reverse transaction. Why do financial assets and property assets behave so differently? Clearly it is because they are influenced by different kinds of investors and are valued on different bases. This ought not to be so true of commercial property which is owned by the same institutions that dominate the securities markets (and which ought to be capable of valuing assets on a consistent basis). But the supply of property is erratic because of the role of speculative developers. Essentially the securities markets are driven by flows of cash. They tend to be buoyant in the early part of the economic cycle when there is surplus liquidity and interest rates are low; this was the case in 1993. But the real estate market is dominated by borrowed money - whether household mortgages or bank loans to real estate developers. So property prices tend to be strong in the later part of the cycle, when people are confident enough to accumulate debt. For several years the banks have been so battered by losses on loans to the property industry that the flow of cash has dried to a trickle. As for houses, mortgage lending remains weak: from a peak of Pounds 40bn in 1988 net advances have declined and were much less than half that figure in 1993. The fundamentals in property also change according to a different time scale. For instance, the occupation of commercial property continued to be affected by weak demand in 1993, when prime rents fell by about 7 per cent. There are substantial time lags in the completion of developments conceived in past booms and in the renegotiation of old leases. In contrast, the pain in most listed non-property companies was experienced earlier: by last year demand was beginning to rebuild and profits were recovering. Dividends have not fallen overall, in contrast to the income on investment property. Different rules apply, but there is an awkward interface of the property and securities markets in the property sector of the stock market. This has been booming, to the extent of producing some of the best returns in the equity market. You can rationalise this in terms of a turnround in medium-term expectations, but it is probably more simply explained by the conflicting pressures on investors. There are still important structural barriers between securities investors and direct property investors even when they co-exist in the same institutions. It is no more than a particular case of the general rule that the flood of global liquidity into the stock market has greatly raised share prices relative to the valuation of the underlying assets that listed companies own. If economic growth continues, as optimists assume, property values will eventually catch up with what the stock market is projecting. Indeed, a lot of institutional buyers are now drawing the conclusion that property is cheap. Given that long-term sterling interest rates have tumbled from 8 3/4 to 6 1/2 per cent, a substantial fall in property investment yields was also inevitable. However, property professionals have found it hard to take on board this purely financial adjustment at a time when the rental market has remained depressed. If the valuers were up to date it is possible that the property investment market would have shown better returns last year than those now estimated. There is inevitably a strong element of subjectivity. What about the residential market? This is still further separated from the lush revenues that are pushing up securities values. It tends to be younger people who bid up house prices and, by and large, they have few stock market investments. The squeeze on employee earnings is benefiting corporate profits and at the same time is holding back the borrowing capacity of home buyers. But the cycle has turned.</p>

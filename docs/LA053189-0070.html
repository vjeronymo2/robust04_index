			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO, SAN MARINO REACH 2-A FINAL  </P> <P> For the ninth time in 30 years Coach John Stevenson has guided El Segundo High  School into the Southern Section baseball finals.  </P> <P> The Eagles (25-5) defeated Temple City (20-8), Tuesday afternoon, 4-2, at  Culver City High, to advance to the 2-A division final, which is scheduled for  Saturday at 10 a.m. at Dodger Stadium. El Segundo will play San Marino, a 4-3  winner over Gladstone.  </P> <P> El Segundo has won five Southern Section titles, the last coming in 1979 when  it defeated Oxnard Hueneme in the 4-A championship.

He lost a front tooth.  Nevin was thrown out of the game for not sliding but the run counted. The loss  marked the 14th consecutive year that the top-seeded team in the Southern  Section major division has failed to win the title.

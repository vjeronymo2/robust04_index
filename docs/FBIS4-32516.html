			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 25 June (TANJUG) -- Republic of Srpska  president Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka this evening that  the Serb republic would refuse to sign a peace agreement for  former Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the signature meant an  automatic suspension of sanctions against the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia. "Despite our desire for peace and readiness to  make a sacrifice, we will not allow the Western world to destroy  our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro," Karadzic said.    Assessing the current policy by the great powers toward the  republic of Srpska, he said that despite the horrific pressure  the West's policy was more favorable than last year. According  to Karadzic, the Western powers have finally realized that the  fate of "the great former Yugoslavia" must be experienced by  former Bosnia-Herzegovina which was always singled out as  "little Yugoslavia." This means that a unitary Bosnia is out of  the question.    Speaking about a possible exchange of territories with the  Muslim-Croat side, Karadzic said that this was possible and that  perhaps it was inevitable, but the people's assembly of the  republic of Srpska and the whole nation if necessary would have  the final say on this matter. According to Karadzic,  representatives of the "contact group" for the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina were clearly told that the Serbian side did  not have a great deal of faith in them, but that the Serbian  opinion would depend on the final solutions they offered. If  rumors coming from the contact group can be trusted, it offers  to create a fragmented republic of Srpska with no firm border on  the Sava, Drina, or Una Rivers or around Sarajevo, which is  completely unacceptable.    "If the Muslims want to enlarge their territory around  Sarajevo, they must make some concessions to us in eastern  Bosnia, namely Gorazde, Srebrenica, and Zepa. It is completely  clear to us at the moment that America is dictating conditions  that we cannot accept, which automatically means the  continuation of the war."    "America and Germany have openly sided with the Muslim-Croat  side, while Russia is openly neutral. It is precisely this that  is encouraging the Muslims, who are now launching fierce  offensives on Mount Ozren and toward the Serb-held town of  Doboj, while we are defending ourselves. If this continues, we  will switch to an active defense and push them back from the  current lines of separation," Karadzic said in conclusion.    In addition to Banja Luka businessmen, the talks were  attended by Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the republic of  Srpska, and Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the Serb Democratic  Party of Serb Lands.</p>

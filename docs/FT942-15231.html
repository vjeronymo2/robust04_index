			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / France urges 'hard core' of EU members France yesterday proposed a formula by which it hopes to incite all its European Union partners to follow its lead in adopting all EU policies as defined by the Maastricht treaty. Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, suggested that, 'when the decision is made to pass to monetary union, certain European countries, including France and Germany, should propose the status of 'new founding members of Europe' for the largest possible number of countries applying all the (Union) policies, in the monetary, security and social fields.' Acknowledging such a status would create yet another division between EU states, Mr Lamassoure said: 'The distinction would not last for ever.' He hoped creation of a club of founder-members of the new Europe would have a 'contagious' effect in drawing along laggards in its wake, so that eventually all would have the same status. Mr Lamassoure's proposal, made in a speech to the annual conference of the Assocation for European Monetary Union, was vague, implying that self-styled founders of the new Europe would be linked more by a political declaration than any new version of the Treaty of Rome, which launched the European Community in 1957. Because of this, officials from the UK and Denmark, which have important opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty, played down its significance. But it appears to mark a shift in French policy towards Europe. French ministers - particularly Mr Alain Juppe, who as foreign minister is Mr Lamassoure's senior - have tended to accept, even vaunt, the new 'variable geometry' of Maastricht that lets countries opt in and out of the treaty's monetary, defence and social commitments. However, in the wake of French criticism of Germany for being too soft on the Nordic countries in recent accession negotiations, Mr Lamassoure's remarks seem to reflect a growing French feeling that a hard core of EU members must take a stand to prevent European integration becoming ever more ragged. On prospects for monetary union itself, Mr Lamassoure said the decision about which countries would be fit to adopt the single currency would be essentially a political one, saying, for instance, it was inconceivable that Belgium, whose debt far surpassed the Maastricht guideline, would not be a founder member of the currency union. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor, added that Maastricht's debt criterion 'could perhaps be looked at more closely'. For his part, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank board member, said: 'It may be relatively easy to enter the final stage (of monetary union), but whether it will last is open to history', echoing the German constitutional court's warning that so sacrosanct were the Maastricht criteria that they could be used to expel countries from the currency union. Mr Trichet forecast that 'the gradual lowering of short-term interest rates in Europe will be continued. . . without (in the case of France) jeopardising the stability or credibility of the currency'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (YONHAP) -- China virtually refused  Seoul's request Thursday to participate in UN sanctions against  North Korea, but agreed on the gravity of the nuclear situation  and promised diplomatic efforts to find a solution.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with his  Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen for nearly two hours in the  morning, but they failed to narrow their differences on  Beijing's crucial participation in the sanctions, officials at  the South Korean embassy said after the meeting.    Han tried to explain why the UN Security Council was  compelled to seek sanctions against North Korea and asked for  China's active involvement, officials said.    But Qian withheld comment on such explanations and instead  urged all directly involved parties -- South and North Korea,  the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) -- to leave the door open for dialogue, said Kim  Ha-chung, minister at the South Korean Embassy.    Nevertheless, the Chinese foreign minister agreed with Han  on  the seriousness of the current situation and promised his  country's best efforts in full consideration of the matter's  gravity, he said.    The officials said they took this remark as a sign of  China's  willingness to persuade North Korea and mediate between the  North and the United States to resolve the nuclear row.    China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with  veto power, does not favor punitive steps against North Korea  and thus poses a major obstacle to a council resolution,  expected next week, spelling out sanction measures.    The participation of China, a major supplier of crude oil to  North Korea which shares a common border with the reclusive  state, is considered critical to effective sanctions.    Han flew into Beijing late Wednesday after holding strategic  talks with council members earlier this week.    The two foreign ministers agreed to cooperate closely at  both  the Security Council and bilaterally in seeking a resolution,  according to Kim.    Han briefed Qian on the IAEA's report to the Security  Council  last week and South Korea's ensuing consultations with the  permanent members of the council.    He stressed that China's role is more important than ever as  sanctions are being discussed, the officials said.</p>

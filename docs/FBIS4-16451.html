			<p>BFN     [Text] The participants in the All-Union Congress of the  Union of Officers held in Moscow's suburbs have decided to ask  the Russian military leadership to cancel the joint  Russian-American military exercises planned for the summer of  this year. The Union of Officers regards assisting and  participating in the maneuvers as treason. The Congress passed  a resolution assessing the recent air strikes against Bosnia as  preparing a bridgehead for the mounting of aggression against  Russia and other Slav states. In this connection the delegates  demanded an immediate convocation of the UN Security Council to  end the escalation of the violence and genocide of the Serbian  people. This was reported by the Interfax agency.</p>

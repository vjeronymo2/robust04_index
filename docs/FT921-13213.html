			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ameritech depressed by restructuring charge AMERITECH, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bells', reported 1991 net earnings of Dollars 1.16bn, or Dollars 4.39 a share, down from Dollars 1.25bn, or Dollars 4.73, last year. A Dollars 141m restructuring charge, taken in the fourth quarter, caused the annual results decrease. Without it, net earnings would have been Dollars 1.3bn, which included a Dollars 73.6m gain from the initial public offering of Telecom Corporation of New Zealand shares. Revenues for 1991 rose slightly to Dollars 10.8bn, from Dollars 10.7bn. The one-time charge included costs related to job cuts, write-downs of certain assets, some other non-recurring charges in the company's unregulated businesses and retirement of debt. In the fourth quarter, net earnings after the charge were Dollars 199.2m, or 75 cents per share, compared with Dollars 286.8m, or Dollars 1.09, a year ago. The charge reduced per share earnings by approximately 53 cents. Customer telephone lines rose in 1991 by 306,000 to 16,584,000 compared with 1990. Cellular customers increased 48 per cent to 483,000 from 157,000 at the end of 1990. Ameritech is the parent of Bell companies serving Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin and other information related companies, both foreign and American.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Knight Up, Bossi Down"] </F>   [Text]The Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] is galloping while  the Bandwagon [Northern League symbol] is slowing down. The Oak  Tree [symbol of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] is  growing on terrain where the bushes are getting ever thinner.  These, along with the increase in the extreme wings of  Communist Renewal and the National Alliance [AN] are the most  significant predictions coming from a CIRM poll on voters'  intentions for the 12 June European election. The poll was  conducted among 4,155 individuals between 18-29 April, and  compared voting intentions for the European election with votes  cast under the proportional system for the Chamber of Deputies  in the election of 28 March.    Compared with the preceding election, today Forza Italia  would gain 3.1 percent, going from 21.1 to 24.2 percent of the  total vote; the PDS would grow by 1.4 percent, AN by 1.1  percent, Communist Renewal by 0.9 percent. The Greens would  remain stable, while all the others would register serious  losses. On the progressive front, the greatest loss would be  registered by the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] (minus 0.9),  followed by the Rete and AD [Democratic Alliance] (minus 0.4  and 0.3 respectively.) In the Center, the most penalized would  be the Segni Pact, which would lose 0.8 percent, while the  Italian Popular Party [PPI] would lose 0.5 percent. [Marco]  Pannella's loss is considerable (minus 1.5), while among the  government coalition the Northern League would be the only one  to lose (minus 1.1).    How many of the voters would today repeat the choice made on  28 March? The table below reports the "degree of loyalty" for  each party, keeping in mind the high number of undecideds just  a little over a month before the election. In this case the  award for loyalty goes to the extreme factions (Communist  Renewal with 78 percent and AN with 76). However, CIRM has also  elaborated the poll data using the so-called "French method,"  that is, hypothesizing a certain distribution of the undecided  votes. Using this method, the most loyalty is that shown by AN  voters, 96 percent of whom would repeat the choice made on 28  March. A close percentage--above 90 percent--goes to the  following, in numerical order: Forza Italia, PDS, Northern  League, Communist Renewal, and PPI. The "traitors" would seem  to be above all among the voters of Pannella (66.7 percent  loyal), the Rete (74.6), AD (78.7) and the PSI (80.8). Where  would these wandering votes go? According to CIRM data, the  most significant number of votes would go from Communist Renewal  to the PDS; from the Rete and AD to the PDS and (hear, hear!) to  the AN; and from the Segni Pact and Pannella list to Forza  Italia.    The Northern League's "tough line" attracts male voters in  particular: [Umberto] Bossi's party clearly receives more  preferences from men than women. The same goes for the AN, and  in a lesser sense, for the PSI, AD, and Communist Renewal. The  Knight's indiscreet charm, instead, attracts women in  particular, who vote for him more than men, a phenomenon that  also occurs within the PPI and the Segni Pact. Young voters  especially reward Communist Renewal, the Greens, Forza Italia,  and the AN. The elderly --those over 65--instead show a marked  preference for the PPI.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Index of Loyalty to Various Parties

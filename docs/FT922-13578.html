Mr Alan Milburn overturned Mr Fallon's 2,661 majority, polling 26,556. Mr Fallon polled 23,758. He had held the seat since winning a 1983 by-election. Mr Fallon was the only minister with a seat in the 30 constituencies between the Scottish border and North Yorkshire. Mr Fallon was a member of the No Turning Back Group, the self-styled guardian of Thatcherite doctrine. The group called for the dismantling of the welfare state, the privatisation of British Rail, and considered a voucher scheme for the NHS.

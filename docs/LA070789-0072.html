			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES HOMER, BUNT, STEAL TO DEFEAT TIGERS  </P> <P> The New York Yankees are known for hitting home runs, not for bunting and  stealing bases.  </P> <P> They did all three Thursday and rallied in the 11th inning to beat Detroit,  6-5, and move above .500 for the first time since May 12.  </P> <P> "That was one of the biggest games of the year for us," said Steve Sax, who hit  the game-winning sacrifice fly. "There was something different about this game.  It was kind of out there for either team to grab."  </P> <P> Dave Righetti blew a 4-3 lead in the ninth inning, allowing doubles to Gary  Ward and Alan Trammell. Detroit took the lead in the top of the 11th when Lou  Whitaker, who has never hit more than 21 homers, hit his 18th, off Eric Plunk,  3-1.  </P> <P> But Jesse Barfield led off the bottom of the 11th with his first home run since  June 8, a line shot to right off Mike Henneman, 5-2.  </P> <P> "It's about time I came through in a situation like that," said Barfield, who  is just 8 for 44 with runners in scoring position since the Yankees acquired  him from Toronto. "I've left my quota of runners on base. I've squandered my  share of chances."  </P> <P> Pagliarulo then checked his swing on a forkball and blooped the ball into short  left field for a double.  </P> <P> "It was perfect placement," Pagliarulo joked. "I practice that in BP."  </P> <P> Don Slaught was intentionally walked and Alvaro Espinoza executed a perfect  sacrifice. Roberto Kelly was walked intentionally, loading the bases, and Sax  flied to medium right.  </P> <P> "I had some butterflies," said Sax, 14 for 28 against Detroit this season with  seven runs-batted in. "I tried to get a real loose grip on the bat. If I try to  muscle it, I'm going to pop it up. Just sting it."  </P> <P> The Yankees, 42-41, had not been over .500 since they were 17-16. They have not  been two games over this year.  </P> <P> "It looked like it was gonna slip away from us," Yankee Manager Dallas Green  said. "It was a good, bear-down win for us."  </P> <P> Detroit, on the other hand, dropped to 31-51, losing its seventh straight game  in Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> "When you're losing, things go against you and things pile up," Tigers manager  Sparky Anderson said.  </P> <P> The Yankees took a 4-3 lead with two runs in the fifth. Kelly walked, stole  second and scored on Sax's double. Sax then stole third and scored on Luis  Polonia's groundout.  </P> <P> "It wasn't the big home-run type of Yankees lineup that people are used to  seeing," Sax said. "There weren't many big homers but there were doubles up the  gap and down the line."  </P> <P> Rookie Clay Parker, New York's most effective starter this season, gave up  seven hits and one earned run in six innings and almost got the victory.  </P> <P> "I felt out of synch," he said. "I let too many little things bother me. Every  inning, it's tough to do, get out of those situations. There's no excuse for  it."  </P> <P> Lee Guetterman pitched two shutout innings before Righetti took over. He wound  up blowing his fifth save in 20 opportunities.  </P> <P> Rick Schu's sacrifice fly gave Detroit a 1-0 lead in the second, but New York  tied it in the bottom of the inning on Pagliarulo's fourth home run.  </P> <P> Detroit went back ahead in the fourth on Ward's sacrifice fly and Trammell's  RBI infield hit.  </P></p>

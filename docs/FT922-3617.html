			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Banks shelter behind trust law MR KENNETH TRENCH, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, stated confidently this week that banks and financial institutions holding some Pounds 217m in securities belonging to the Maxwell pension funds would return those assets. To the Maxwell pensioners the issue seems straightforward: if a person in possession of stolen goods can be forced to return them to their rightful owner, the same rule must apply to banks. Yet the banks maintain that they cannot be forced by law to return the pension fund assets. National Westminster, which holds shares in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company, which are claimed by the funds, has said that it has to put its shareholders' interests first and cannot return them. Legal experts said yesterday that where assets have been transferred out of a pension fund by its trustees, in breach of the terms of the trust deed, different rules apply to individuals and to banks in receipt of those assets. If the trustees had paid out money to an individual not entitled to it, for example by paying a pension to someone who had never worked for a Maxwell company, they could demand repayment on the grounds that it had been paid by mistake in breach of trust. Banks, however, are able to avoid having to repay the money providing they can show they gave value in return for it. Even if it is stolen and has been paid in breach of trust, they can avoid repayment if they can show that they are 'bona fide purchasers for value without notice'. In the Maxwell case, therefore, if the banks can show they acted in good faith; gave value for the money by, for example, granting a loan to Mr Maxwell or one of his companies; and they had no knowledge that the money had been paid in breach of trust, then they cannot be required to repay it. The crucial issue in the Maxwell case will be whether the banks had notice that the assets were paid out of the pension funds in breach of trust. The banks will argue that they were told the assets belonged to Mr Maxwell, or one of his companies, and had no means of knowing that they belonged to the pension funds. The pension trustees, in the form of the liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, will argue that while the banks may not have had actual notice, they did have constructive notice that the money came from the funds. In other words, if they had asked the questions they should have asked, they would have known the true position.</p>

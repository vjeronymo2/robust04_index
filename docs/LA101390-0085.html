			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES RISE 1.6% IN SEPTEMBER, FUELED BY OIL COSTS;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: TWO-MONTH SURGE IN THE PRODUCERS' INDEX IS THE BIGGEST SINCE 1980.  INFLATION PACE MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THE FED WILL TRY TO CUT INTEREST RATES.  </P> <P> Fueled by sharp increases in oil prices, inflation surged ominously during  September, the government reported Friday.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices jumped 1.6% for the month, after a 1.3% increase in August.  Taken together, the increases mark the biggest two-month gain since 1980 and  make it all the more difficult for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest  rates.  </P> <P> The September increase, which equates to an annual inflation rate of 20.9%, was  primarily attributable to soaring energy costs. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait  on Aug. 2, crude oil prices have doubled, nearing $40 a barrel in recent days.  </P> <P> "Inflation is getting out of hand," said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> The worrisome trend was acknowledged by the White House. "Inflation going up is  never good news," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that, even if increases in the volatile energy and food sectors  are excluded from September's producer price index, wholesale prices rose by  0.6% for the month -- the equivalent of more than 7% for the year.  </P> <P> "These numbers suggest that the underlying inflation rate has picked up," said  Sara Johnson, an economist at Data Resources Inc. in Boston. "I think we can  expect to see steep increases in October and November as well."  </P> <P> In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1% in  September to a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion. The increase reflected  soaring gasoline prices and rebounding auto sales. Retail sales had declined  0.4% in August.  </P> <P> Although the sales report indicated that higher prices have not yet dampened  consumer spending, economists warned that, as recession looms nearer, inflation  may hit the economy with a second punch.  </P> <P> "For the time being, we have stagflation," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief  economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York, referring to the 1970s  phenomenon of declining growth accompanied by rising prices. "The economy is  weak, and there isn't enough liquidity in the system."  </P> <P> Although inflationary pressures are likely to make it more difficult for the  Federal Reserve to ease interest rates, Data Resources' Johnson said she  believes the threat of recession should receive priority consideration.  </P> <P> "The primary concern at this stage should be stabilizing the economy by easing  interest rates and stimulating demand," she said. Besides, Johnson added,  "recession itself would reduce inflationary pressures."  </P> <P> "We have inflation because of the temporary increase in oil prices," Kellner  said. He urged the Fed "to release the chokehold . . . on the economy" even  before Congress reaches agreement on the federal budget.  </P> <P> The White House, however, refused to criticize the Federal Reserve's reluctance  to ease interest rates to stimulate growth.  </P> <P> "We are concerned about growth and about preventing a recession," Fitzwater  said, "and we think the Fed has recognized all these factors and is on the  right course."  </P> <P> Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn., also supported the  current Fed policy. "They have to move with caution and prudence," he said.  </P> <P> However, Gramley expressed hope that energy-fueled inflation could subside in  several months, particularly if the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved without  military conflict.  </P> <P> "It's just clear that, when oil prices double, you are going to have to swallow  hard for three to six months. But, if the danger of a shooting war (in the  Middle East) recedes, then oil prices can't stay at $40 per barrel," he said.  "I think we can look forward with confidence to several months of high prices,  but I don't think it will be a disaster."  </P> <P> As the inflation report was issued, a group of corporate chiefs meeting in Hot  Springs, Va., warned that the U.S. economy appears to be tottering on the edge  of recession, although it has not yet fallen into a full slump.  </P> <P> "It feels like a recession in some segments, but other segments are quite  good," said John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric Co., mirroring the  ambivalent attitude of his colleagues at the Business Council, a group of  current and former chief executives.  </P> <P> Recessionary concerns were echoed in a survey of corporate economists presented  at the Business Council meeting.  </P> <P> The economy will have a period of "very weak growth" through mid-1991, the  economists said in the survey, and "there is a significant chance of  recession." The report blamed oil prices for the reduced growth prospects.  </P> <P> Executives attending the session acknowledged that business conditions clearly  had deteriorated since their last gathering in May. But they were not prepared  to proclaim the end of the nation's eight-year economic expansion.  </P> <P> "There is kind of a recession psychology among (auto) dealers and customers,"  said Roger B. Smith, recently retired chairman of General Motors Corp. and the  Business Council's chairman.  </P> <P> But "price incentives" should help domestic sales, he said, and foreign  prospects are enhanced by growing demand from new markets in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, was more pessimistic,  saying the United States is "either already in or entering a recession."  </P> <P> "There is no place where we are not seeing a softening of business, and in some  places a real recession," Butcher said. "The real estate business is lousy --  the bottom has not been reached."  </P> <P> The Business Council report, based on a survey of 20 corporate economists,  forecast anemic economic growth of less than 1% until the middle of 1991, with  more vigorous expansion expected in the second half of the year.  </P> <P> A recession is formally defined as two consecutive calendar quarters in which  the nation's output of goods and services declines. Only five of the 20  economists advising the Business Council believed a recession is in the cards.  </P></p>

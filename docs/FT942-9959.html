			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Test of independence for Bank of Italy: Will the bank or government prevail in choosing a new director For the second time in a year the Bank of Italy has to appoint a new member to its four-man governing directorate. The departure of Mr Lamberto Dini to the treasury ministry yesterday opens up a delicate contest for his replacement as the director general, the bank's number two job. At issue is whether his replacement will be sought from inside the Bank of Italy or whether the new Berlusconi government will seek to impose an outsider. The latter solution would tend to undermine the Bank's hard won independent status, no matter the quality of the person chosen. An outsider would also risk having differences of view with Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor. Mr Fazio himself was chosen a year ago over Mr Dini to replace Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who had agreed to become prime minister. This then required appointment of a new director, the choice falling on the chief banking supervisor, Mr Vincenzo Desario. Any appointment has to be decided by the bank's 16-strong governing council, presided over by the governor, and then ratified in agreement with the treasury, the prime minister and the president of the republic. This complex mechanism allows a considerable variety of views and political pressures to enter into the choice, although the governor should have a major role. Within the bank, the post by tradition of seniority should go to Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, a brilliant and eclectic economist strongly wedded to the idea of European monetary union. He was also seen at one stage as Mr Ciampi's natural heir. But those close to the new Berlusconi government have let it be known that his nomination would not be to their liking. The populist Northern League would also like to use the occasion of Mr Dini's departure to introduce a fixed term of office for the governor. Of the outsiders, the name most heavily canvassed is Mr Rainer Masera, who formerly worked in the bank and is currently chief executive of IMI, the finance institution. Another name suggested is that of Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the treasury; but Mr Dini is expected to want to keep him at the treasury to help with privatisation and debt management. The bank would prefer that the decision be taken without haste and not before the end of the month when Mr Fazio presents the governor's annual economic statement, the Bank of Italy's keynote assessment of the state of the economy and the task in the year ahead for the government. Milan magistrates yesterday filed papers requesting the passport be withdrawn from Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister, who faces a string of charges of alleged corruption. Mr Craxi has been living outside Italy for more than a month. When the new parliament was sworn in two weeks ago, all members of the outgoing parliament automatically lost their immunity. At least 16 members of the last parliament have had their passports withdrawn.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (3): Winning streak continues - Government bonds have enjoyed a phenomenal run AFTER a phenomenal 18-month run, the rally in global government bonds has already exeeded most observers' expectations. But the end of the bull run is proving very difficult to call. Institutional investors are scared that if they take profits now they could miss a further leg of the rally - as happened to some US Treasury investors during the summer - and have to buy back in at a more expensive level. Company treasurers are also getting twitchy. They want to raise long-term debt at the lowest possible interest rates, but every time they feel ready to lock in fixed-rate funding, long-term bond yields fall further. And, as with Las Vegas gamblers on an unprecedented winning streak, each favourable turn of the roulette wheel increases the tension for the next time. Now the questions are: where and when is the rally finally going to end? The first question breaks up into four possible areas: the UK, the European high-yielding countries, the mainstream EC markets and the US. And it prompts the subsidiary question of why the winning streak is going to end, ie which investment power, Japan the US or Europe, is going to pull the plug? These questions have prompted fevered debate in the UK where nominal long-term interest rates, reflected by 15-year government bonds, have fallen from 8.4 per cent in June to just over 7 per cent last week, the lowest level since the sixties. For the past few months many UK fund managers steeped in the tradition of boom-bust economics have believed that it cannot continue and while they have not gone so far as to take their money out of the gilts market they have not been putting any more in. The rise in prices and subsequent fall in yields has been led by overseas investors. They have looked at the fundamental economic position rather than the historical perspective and are more prepared than their UK counterparts to believe in a sustained period of slow growth and flat inflation. In fact, some economists believe the UK's traditional enthusiasm for inflating itself out of trouble may have changed at a fundamental level. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist with SG Warburg Securities, argues that 'a low inflation psychology is developing in the UK'. Also, the trend towards mortgages at rates fixed for several years will make it harder to tinker with the economy via short-term interest rates and more dependent on low interest long-term borrowing. Amazement surrounding the UK market is almost matched by the surprise at the performance of the southern European countries generally referred to as the high yielders - Spain, Italy and Portugal. These three countries, traditionally dogged by rocketing inflation, have seen 10-year rates plunge since last autumn. Spain's benchmark yield, the standard by which other forms of public and corporate borrowing are set, has tumbled from above 14 per cent last October to below 8.5 per cent recently. The return on equivalent Italian bond yields which take into consideration a 12.5 per cent tax charge for overseas residents has slipped to around 8.8 per cent from 14.7 per cent in October. In Portugal, short-term rates fell by 6.75 points to 10.25 per cent between May and July. These high-yielding markets have been heavily supported because they have so much further to fall than their more stolid European neighbours. France and Germany, which form the hard core of the exchange rate mechanism, have also fallen significantly. At the moment they are in limbo as Germany struggles to maintain high rates to combat the inflationary by-product of its unification programme and France refuses to cut rates because it is determined to attach itself to its neighbour's monetary coat tails. But just when European investors began to wonder if there were more exciting opportunities elsewhere, Japanese buyers moved in, determined to make the most of a very expensive yen. Also, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which recently advised its clients to shift equity holdings from the UK to mainland Europe, says continental bond markets remain popular. 'We are positive on all the major European markets and US investors are still pouring in money,' says one Goldmans trader. The US interest is a reflection of the astounding performance of the US Treasury market. At the beginning of September the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond had fallen below 6 per cent, the lowest return in its 16-year life. At the same time, several brokerage houses were warning that the market was close to overheating, arguing that investors had underestimated the strength of the economy. It may be one of the classic cliches that when things happen they happen first in the US, but that could be the case with the end of the global rally in government bonds. When the economy picks up inflation will turn round and send yields bouncing upwards. As to timing it largely depends whether investors start to panic and the signs are that most US institutional fund mangers are sanguine to the point of being phlegmatic. Economists are also divided in spite of the historic lows achieved by 30-year US bonds. Yamaichi, the Japanese bank, believes the US outlook is improving and long-term debt prices are out of touch with the inflationary pressure that any pick-up will impose. On the other hand Goldman Sachs say growth remains low, inflation is being skewed by high prices in some commodities and bond yields should 'continue to drift lower as time passes'. Its US rival, Salomon Brothers, also believes that the prospect of a US rate rise has receded and advises its clients to remain overweight in US Treasuries. Perhaps the best that can be said is that when the spectre of inflation returns it is more likely to be roaming the streets of Manhattan than the boulevards of Paris.</p>

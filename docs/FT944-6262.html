			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Grant reduction draws criticism  -Housing associations Plans to cut the amount of grant provided to housing associations were strongly criticised last night by housing organisations which said it would mean more homeless people. Housing investment plans for England for 1994-5, including the rough sleepers' allowance, have been cut from Pounds 1.73bn to Pounds 1.36bn; a reduction of more than Pounds 300m. The National Federation of Housing Associations said that would mean new rented homes provided by associations would fall to only 10,000, against this year's 25,000. That was in addition to a reduction of 9,000 homes already announced, following a previous cut of Pounds 250m in the 1994-5 budget. The federation said homes started for low-cost and shared ownership schemes would fall from 20,000 to 12,500 next year. Reduced building programmes could cost 4,000 construction jobs in 1994-5 and 7,900 the following year. Higher benefit payments and lost tax revenue would cost the Exchequer Pounds 35m next year and Pounds 70m the year after, it added. The Chartered Institute of Housing said the budget cuts would make it more difficult for people on modest wages to find rented accommodation. Mr Jim Coulter, chief executive of the National Federation of Housing Associations, said: 'For three years the government has achieved falling homeless figures, but Mr Clarke's announcement could mean that the level may start to rise again.' Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said that falling construction costs and increased private sector investment in association schemes had meant that building programmes had been maintained. From April, the government expects private investors to provide 42 per cent of associations' finance, against 25 per cent private investment in 1989-90.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: Spell out the risks as well as rewards - Serious Money RISK IS at the heart of investment, but while many savers know that it exists, they find it hard to define. While they strive to safeguard their portfolios against the most obvious types of risk, more subtle dangers are sneaking in via the backdoor. The most common mistake is to focus on the threat to nominal capital, while ignoring the effect of inflation. Accordingly many people leave the bulk of their capital in the building society, because the alternatives are 'too risky'. But even at 4 per cent inflation - the top of the government's target range  -the value of money halves in 18 years. So someone retiring now at the age of 60 might see a drop of 70 per cent or so in the value of their savings over their remaining lifetime. Given that the cost of care for the elderly will probably increase at a faster rate than prices elsewhere, this could eventually result in serious financial difficulties. Income is just as affected by inflation as capital. Interest rates have fluctuated between 6 per cent and 15 per cent over the past 15 years. Anyone who has relied on their building society for income will accordingly have enjoyed a roller-coaster ride. The canny may have saved the excess income in the high interest years in order to spend it in low interest times like today; many will not have been so wise. Of course, interest rates may well rise from their current levels. Nevertheless, over the long term there is no reason to expect increasing income from a building society. According to Moneyfacts, someone who invested Pounds 5,000 with Abbey National would have received a gross income of 8.33 per cent in 1978, compared with just 5.35 per cent now. Prices have nearly trebled over the period. Contrast the position with equities. If you had invested Pounds 10,000 in shares in 1980, your gross dividend income, initially Pounds 580, would by now be worth Pounds 2,016 per annum, a return of 20 per cent on your original investment. By and large, share prices keep pace with inflation over the long term. BZW's equity price index, inflation-adjusted, reached a peak of 453.1 in 1936 (1918=100), fell back to 158.6 in 1952, rose again to 476.8 by 1968, before plunging alarmingly to 106.2 in 1975. At the end of 1992, the index was at 458.2. So even if you had bought at the market's inflation-adjusted peak in 1968, your capital has more or less kept pace with prices. Dividend income, however, follows a much more steady upward path. The peak year, in real terms, for dividend income was 1991, when the index reached 382 (1919=100). The long term real return for equities, according to BZW, is 7.3 per cent per year with income reinvested. So if capital values keep pace with inflation, the positive real return comes from an average dividend yield of 5 per cent plus 2 per cent of income growth, roughly equal to the long term economic growth rate. The above analysis shows that in the long term, the real risks are taken by those who choose not to be in equities. But it would be wrong to suggest savers should rush out and invest all their capital in shares tomorrow. For a start, equities do not look particularly cheap at present. The dividend yield on the All-Share Index is 3.9 per cent and the price-earnings ratio is 20.3. Economic recovery may have already arrived but the market has anticipated much of the benefits. So a phased, or savings scheme, approach to equity investment is sensible. A more fundamental problem is choosing which shares to buy. Most investors will be aware of the 'blue chips', so-called because of their quality and dependability. But blue chips can let investors down, as US investors in IBM have found. Between the 1987 Crash and the end of January 1993, the computer group's market value fell by an astonishing Dollars 72bn. There is no example in the UK which is quite on the same scale; nevertheless, stocks such as BP, ICI, Land Securities, Pearson and P &amp; O are still lower than they were before the Crash. Some of today's blue chips will probably underperform on a similar scale; indeed it may well be that smaller companies are the sector to choose from. But for the small investor, stock selection is a difficult task which is why an investment trust, which owns a wide portfolio of shares, may well be the best bet. Even in this sector, there is a big difference between the capital shares of a split trust and an international generalist such as Bankers or Foreign &amp; Colonial. Robert Fleming, one of the largest investment trust management groups, took a step to help private investors make their choice by asking securities group Smith New Court to give risk ratings to its trusts. They were ranked in four different categories - slightly below average risk (Continental European and Mercantile), average risk (Fledgling, High Income and the units of the Income &amp; Capital trust), slightly above average risk (Enterprise, European Fledgling and Claverhouse) and above average risk (the ordinary income shares of the Income &amp; Capital trust). Investors are also told which trusts offer capital growth, income or a combination of the two. Other groups have attempted risk ratings like Fleming's and one hopes that more follow suit. As a wider public is tempted into equities, the risks, as well as the rewards, need to be spelled out.</p>

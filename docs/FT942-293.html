			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (18): Enough to go round - Mineral Resources / Kenneth Gooding finds that, despite growing demand, supplies will last World Index of Resources and Population by David Hargreaves, Monica Eden-Green and Joan Devaney Dartmouth Publishing, Pounds 95 417 pages The world will not run out of mineral resources, at least not before the year 2025. That is the comforting message presented in the overview to this intriguing tome. Nevertheless, the statistics are awe-inspiring. Some 25 per cent of all the people ever born are still alive today. There are about 5.5bn people in the world and in 30 years time the global population may reach 8bn, 10bn or more. If the 8bn use mineral resources at the present rate that will require, for example, an extra 9m tonnes of aluminium a year compared with today's demand of 16m; 1.4bn extra tonnes of oil, against 3.1bn today; and 1.5bn more tonnes of coal versus the present 4.4bn. In many developing countries, such as China, Indonesia and Mexico, the per capita usage of minerals is also increasing. On even the most pessimistic forecast this will require a massive expansion of the mining, oil and gas industries as well as the refining, transport and fabrication sectors. But the authors - a mining engineer, a social scientist and an international economist - dismiss the 'doomwatch' theory which suggests that the world will have run dry of resources by then. They argue that, despite demand for many minerals having trebled or quadrupled between 1950 and 1993, known reserves in the ground have continued to increase. 'There is every probability that they will continue to do so,' they state confidently. Substitution, recycling, miniaturisation and longer-life applications will also ensure there are enough minerals to go round. Nevertheless, major new sources will have to be developed in order to meet the extra demand. This book brings together in one volume statistics and forecasts about the factors that will decided where new mining and oil and gas fields should be sited. It systematically analyses the factors which will determine the changes in demand to 2025 for the 36 minerals which make up more than 95 per cent of the present global total by value. It examines the 61 countries which represent the major producing and consuming regions and the 30 leading internationally-operating companies which fund, develop, produce, refine and distribute the minerals. So where will the new mines and oil and gas fields be developed? If companies follow the 'investment potential' guide devised by this volume, the top six 'picks' will be the United Arab Emirates; Australia; Norway; the Commonwealth of Independent States; the US and the UK. The places most to be avoided seem to be Pakistan; Zaire; Sierra Leone; Zambia; and Bolivia. This investment guide is calculated from five factors: the value of minerals in a country's gross domestic product - which is seen as being particularly important - the value of minerals in per capita GDP; the total annual value of minerals produced; the rate of population increase; and a subjective assessment of the political and economic scene. At Pounds 95 the World Index is not an 'impulse' purchase but, apart from its obvious attraction for any organisation involved in or with the minerals sector, it would make a worthwhile addition to any well-used reference library. It covers seven topics: world population; individual countries (from Algeria to Zimbabwe); individual companies (from Anglo American Corporation to Zimco); individual minerals (from Antimony to Uranium); the energy industry (with sub-sections on coal, gas, oil, nuclear and hydro); the automotive industry, because it is the biggest user of raw materials; and the environment 'because environmental awareness now impacts on every facet of the minerals industry from mining through to consumption.' In this connection the World Index shows us why big UK-based groups such as Hanson and RTZ are busy buying up coal mines despite a vocal environmental lobby wanting to curb sulphur emissions from coal-burning power stations. It says: 'Given the forward energy demand profile, there will be no alternative to a rapidly rising coal burn world-wide.' The review forecasts an increase in coal burned from 2.2bn tonnes to 4.6bn tonnes by 2025. Little of this increase will take place in Europe, 'the focal point of pollution awareness'. Most will be in the US, China and the Pacific Rim.</p>

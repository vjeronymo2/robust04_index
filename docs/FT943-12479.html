			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Kopper must walk critical tightrope - Deutsche Bank Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's irascible chairman, will be choosing his words carefully when he opens the German banking sector's half-year reporting season at a press conference tomorrow. He has been advised that it is time to start refurbishing Deutsche Bank's public image after the calamities of the recent past, including the near collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Schneider property affair. While more mishaps cannot be ruled out, and DM500m (Pounds 206.6m) has already been set aside to cover Schneider losses, the bank's recent statements that it expects 1994 provisioning for bad and doubtful debts to fall from last year's DM3.3bn seem confident enough. Operating profits after provisions were down 10 per cent after four months, but there is increasing confidence among investors and analysts that some of the ground will be made up by the end of the year. The main reason is an expected drop in own-account earnings from last year's bumper DM2bn. But improved commission income and better interest margins should provide some compensation. Deutsche's substantial stakes in corporations such as Daimler-Benz are seen as having big recovery potential. Other attractions include hints that Germany's biggest credit institution will celebrate its 125th birthday next year with a handsome dividend bonus.</p>

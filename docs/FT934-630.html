			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: State likely to sell Elf in single package The French government is likely early next year to privatise Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, in a single issue, according to Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister. Mr Alphandery said, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, that the government would 'most probably' sell its stake in Elf, which is France's largest company with a market capitalisation of over FFr100bn, 'in one go'. It had previously considered selling the shares in two tranches. However, he stressed the government would wait until the last possible moment to decide how best to structure the sale and the timing of the issue would be determined by stock market conditions. 'Elf is a pearl of French industry,' he said. 'But it's a big mouthful for the market to swallow.' Mr Alphandery also confirmed that 10 per cent of Elf's shares will be allocated to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors. A number of companies have already been mooted as noyaux durs including Banque Nationale de Paris and the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group, as well as Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti interests. The government plans to remain Elf's biggest single shareholder by retaining a 10 per cent to 15 per cent stake in the oil group. The French state controls 50.79 per cent of Elf, which means the privatisation will involve the sale of a 35 per cent to 40 per cent stake valued at between FFr37.4bn (Dollars 6.36bn) and FFr42.7bn on yesterday's share price of FFr415. The success of the Elf privatisation will be seen as an important indication of investors' response to the next phase of the French government's state asset sales. This year's issues, notably the sales of BNP and the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company, have been heavily over-subscribed.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> RECALL ISSUED FOR ICE CREAM  </P> <P> The Stater Brothers market chain recalled some of its house-brand ice cream  because of possible exposure to ammonia from a refrigerant leak during  manufacture. Staters spokesman Tom Reingrover said the half-gallon packages  affected contain golden vanilla and chocolate ice cream and are marked with the  code number 092289. "It's strictly a precautionary thing," he said. "We found  very little product affected." Reingrover said it was not immediately  determined which of the chain's 101 markets in Southern California received the  ice cream.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgium and France have decided to clarify the  situation. Brussels and Paris are saying that it is out of the  question to do anything other than protect foreign nationals.  Listen to this reaction to events in Rwanda from Blaise  Compaore, the president of Burkina Faso. He is currently in  France:    [Begin Compaore recording] We felt a lot of pain when we  heard the news because we believe that the Rwandan people do not  deserve this. However, we can see that Africa, unfortunately,  is going to go through many other tests before it achieves its  democratization, because we have historic limits which prevent  us from going forward at the rate hoped for by the people and  even by the international community, but we trust that the  Africans will manage to establish their nations and, of course,  to preserve their freedoms. This, of course, will have to be  with the support of the international community. [end recording]</p>

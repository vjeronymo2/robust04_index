			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty-six people were killed in fierce gun battles  in Basilan in Mindanao yesterday between government troops and  the Moro bandit group, the Abu Sayyaf. Of the fatalities, 20  were bandits and six were Marines of the Philippines Armed  Forces.    The fierce gun battle took place as government troops  assaulted the camp of the Abu Sayyaf on top of a hill in  Isabela, Basilan. Marine officials said the bandits, who were  positioned on the hill, opened fire at the soldiers pinned below.    The Marines decided to launch an assault on the Abu Sayyaf  camp to free Catholic priest Father Cirilo Nacorda, being held  hostage by the bandits. Negotiations for the release of Father  Nacorda had broken down. The bandits held on to the priest  after killing 15 people earlier this month. They released 57  other hostages last week during the negotiations. Church  officials fear that the bandits have already killed Nacorda  following the bombardment of the Abu Sayyaf camp. The bandits  have threatened to kill the priest if their camp was attacked.    In Manila, Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Arturo  Enrile gave the Marines 48 hours to capture the Abu Sayyaf camp.  Enrile brushed aside criticisms that the military was making an  overkill by deploying about 2,000 troops backed by heavy  artillery and aerial attack. He said superior force was needed  to overcome the advantage of the Abu Sayyaf, who had been well  entrenched and were familiar with the rugged terrain.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ER FANS GET LAST LAUGH AT COLUMNISTS  </P> <P> Now that the Rams have been eliminated, I anticipate that the fickle among the  Los Angeles "faithful" will be raising a clamor that the Rams, Jim Everett and  John Robinson are (A) losers and (B) chokers.  </P> <P> I would respond that the basic purpose of professional sports is to entertain.  The Rams delivered the goods in terms of entertainment. The elation that I felt  as a result of their regular-season victories and their two playoff wins surely  outweighs the final disappointment. The moral? Sometimes it's just as good to  win a lot of battles as it is to win the war. Thank you, Rams, for a memorable  season.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER CHASE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

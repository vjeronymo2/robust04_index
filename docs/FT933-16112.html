			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Coopers faces scrutiny after disciplinary case COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, is to be subjected to an independent review of its internal systems. This follows a breach of ethical rules in connection with the administration of Polly Peck International, the group formerly headed by fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir. The review represents a substantial climbdown over disciplinary action initially proposed by the accountancy profession against two Coopers partners, Mr Richard Stone and Mr Michael Jordan. The practice regulation review committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday that it would be testing Coopers systems to ensure that they were able to detect potential conflicts of interest early before the acceptance of insolvency appointments. Mr Stone, head of corporate finance, and Mr Jordan, head of the firm's insolvency arm, were fined Pounds 1,000 each by the institute's disciplinary committee last October. The fines were the maximum possible and were imposed for breaching an ethical standard that insolvency practitioners should not accept appointments to a company with which their firm has a 'continuing professional relationship'. The insolvency licensing committee had made an order on April 15 this year, subject to appeal, that the two men would be placed under temporary restrictions on taking new insolvency appointments. That judgment - which was never made public - was overturned by the three-person review committee, which said yesterday the order would be varied so that no restrictions would be imposed on future appointments. The costs of the systems review will be paid by Mr Jordan and Mr Stone, who made personal representations to the review committee at its hearing at the end of last month. Mr Bruce Picking, head of practice regulation at the institute, said the committee's only concern was whether procedures now in force worked in the public interest. He said: 'The issue of the past has already been dealt with.' Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that its systems were 'not as robust as we thought' at the time of the Polly Peck administration in October 1990. The firm said it had misunderstood the ethical guidance. Nadir at Number 10, Page 12</p>

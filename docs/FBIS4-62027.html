			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Lekant report in the "Relations" column: "The </F> Americans `No Longer Love Yeltsin So Much.' Russia Thinks That  the United States Is Indifferent To It"]    [Text] The fifth forum of the Russian-U.S. Aspen Dialogue,  organized on our side by the International Association of  Enterprise Directors [IAED] and on the U.S. side by the Colorado  State Civil Administration Center (Aspen), ended in Sochi last  weekend with the adoption of a final declaration.    This time its text was rather tough. The sides have started  talking about a "post-romantic" period in the relations between  Russia and the United States. The Americans expressed  misgivings about the nature of Russian democracy which is in a  state of lengthy transition, not excluding the possibility of an  "enlightened authoritarianism" period being established (the  term by Presidential Council member Andranik Migranyan). And  they expressed doubts as to whether democratic goals can be  achieved by undemocratic means. Greg Guroff, director of a U.S.  State Department division, said that the U.S. press and the  people no longer love Yeltsin as before. And support by U.S.  politicians of actions analogous to the storming of the White  House in Moscow will not be repeated. The Russian side however,  in the person of IAED President Mark Masarksiy, believes that  the return of authoritarianism is impossible because federal  power can no longer concentrate all financing in its hands  following the introduction of a two-way taxation system.    The declaration also talks about the Americans' anxiety over  Russia's policy in the CIS states which the Russian side regards  as a sphere of its vital interests, while the opposite side sees  it as a zone of possible expansion by Moscow within the former  Soviet sphere of influence. "For the United States and the  world community, 25 million Russian-speakers in the CIS is no  less painful an issue than the Armenians living in Azerbaijan or  representatives of other nations in third countries," Mr. Guroff  believes.    The final document also states that "U.S. policy... has lost  an element of sensitivity to Russia's real needs in the post-  confrontation situation." This statement was preceded by a  speech by Aleksandr Yakovlev, director of the Russian Federal TV  and Radio Broadcasting Service. He noted that "the United  States' policy toward Russia is temporizing and indifferent."  The Marshall Plan was adopted because it testified to victory  and billions were spent on it. On the other hand, the  revolution of the 80's and 90's in Russia was "alien" to it, and  it gave nothing. "And this is just as well," Mr. Yakovlev  thinks. In his opinion, in the United States there is no  understanding that reformation of Russia has worldwide  importance. The Americans for their part have recognized that  their country has no coherent policy with respect to Russia.    The tonality of the Aspen dialogue has also changed. Whereas  earlier the forum was of an enlightening character -- U.S.  experts/democrats were teaching the young Russia -- now they  want to understand what is really going on over here.</p>

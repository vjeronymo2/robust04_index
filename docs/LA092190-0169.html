			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KEATING'S BAIL STILL $5 MILLION; OTHER DEFENDANTS GET REDUCTION  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge today rejected appeals to reduce Charles H. Keating  Jr.'s $5-million bail and sent him back to county jail to await arraignment on  a 42-count state grand jury indictment.  </P> <P> Judge Gary Klausner reduced the $1-million bail set for each of three  co-defendants but rejected arguments that Keating was not a flight risk and  that it hadn't been shown the alleged crimes were serious.  </P> <P> "There has been a picture painted here . . . of a person who has creditors  knocking at the door," the judge said at the end of a bail-reduction hearing.  </P> <P> Keating is the central figure in the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan,  which was owned by Keating's holding company, American Continental Corp. of  Phoenix.  </P> <P> The judge also noted the many other legal actions against Keating, calling them  "significant reasons not to stick around."  </P></p>

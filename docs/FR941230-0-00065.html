Phone: (202) 260&hyph;1339.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is promulgated under the authority of CAA section 308, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7608, and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law No. 103&hyph;182, section 104, 107 Stat. 2057, 2064 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 308 of the Clean Air Act provides for mandatory licensing of patented technologies needed to meet certain CAA requirements. Under section 308, the United States can require the owner of a patented technology that is necessary to enable another party's compliance with certain limitations of the Clean Air Act to permit the other party to practice the patented technology in exchange for a reasonable royalty set by a Federal court. In order to compel the licensing of a patent under section 308, the EPA Administrator must ask the Attorney General to certify to a Federal district court that the following conditions are satisfied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The patent must be necessary for compliance with the standards of the CAA sections 111, 112 or 202;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The patent right must be actively in use or intended for public or commercial use and not otherwise reasonably available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) No reasonable alternatives to licensing the patent can exist for meeting the specified CAA standards; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Failure to license the patent may cause reduced competition or monopoly conditions in any area of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon certification of the above conditions to a Federal district court by the Attorney General, the court may then order the patent holder to license the patent under terms and conditions determined by the court after a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 17 of the NAFTA addresses intellectual property issues generally and article 1709 addresses patents specifically. NAFTA article 1709 promotes the availability of patent protection for a broad range of inventions and also limits the scope of permissible violations of patent rights. The latter function is performed by paragraph 10 of article 1709, which sets conditions for violating a patent holder's right to decide the conditions for practice of the holder's patent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAFTA Article 1709(10) sets specific conditions that must be met by the compulsory patent licensing statutes of any member country. The conditions are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Authorization of each compulsory license of a patent must be considered on the individual merits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING, AWAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> 'SPOON' HAS BEEN A BULL AT HOUSTON  </P> <P> Spoooooooon. Hey, Chuck Weatherspoon, the eyes of Texas are upon you, good  buddy.  </P> <P> After a season-long ban, Texans -- heck, folks nationwide -- can catch you and  those high-scoring Houston Cougars on TV this year. Tough break about missing a  bowl game again, though. NCAA sanctions can be rough.  </P> <P> But never mind that stuff, Spoon, tell us about all those yards you've gained  as Houston's one-and-only super back?  </P> <P> Earl Campbell and Eric Dickerson never had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons  as collegians. Can you become the fourth running back in Southwest Conference  history to do it?  </P> <P> How does that stumpy body roll over those hulking defenders, anyway?  </P> <P> And about that Heisman Trophy -- can you win it like your teammate Andre Ware  did last season?  </P> <P> Do tell, Spoon, do tell.  </P> <P> Please, a pause for reflection from the man whose name will echo into the  Astrodome rafters on Saturday afternoons this fall.  </P> <P> The first time Weatherspoon heard an Astrodome crowd erupt in a chorus of  Spoooooooon, it scared him.  </P> <P> A nervous freshman from La Habra High School, Weatherspoon whispered into a  teammate's ear, "Did I do something wrong?"  </P> <P> He thought he was getting booooooooed for the first time, in his first college  game.  </P> <P> When the teammate set Weatherspoon straight, the young running back smiled to  himself.  </P> <P> "OK," he thought. "That's all right."  </P> <P> The Houston media guide lists Weatherspoon, a senior, at 5 feet 7. That's a  lie. He's closer to 5-10. It also says he weighs 210 pounds, which is what John  Jenkins, in his first season as Cougar coach, wishes Weatherspoon weighed. He's  closer to 220.  </P> <P> Watching a man Weatherspoon's size run, defenders draped over him trying to  drag him down, inspires all sorts of analogies with bulls -- mechanical and  otherwise.  </P> <P> A Texas sportswriter recently asked Weatherspoon the following question:  </P> <P> "You know they closed down the mechanical bull at Gilley's, you gonna take it's  place?"  </P> <P> Weatherspoon shook his head, spit tobacco juice into a paper cup, then laughed.  </P> <P> "I'm like a wild, loose bull out on the field," Weatherspoon said.  </P> <P> To hear the stories, you'd think Weatherspoon dragged the entire Southwest  Conference on his back for each of the 2,150 yards he has gained in his career.  </P> <P> That's not so.  </P> <P> Weatherspoon's Pop Warner days appear to be the source of current hyperbole.  </P> <P> Johnny Weatherspoon bought a weightlifting set for his three sons, Anthony,  Linton and Chuck, when the three were youngsters. Chuck, in particular, lifted  with great gusto. While he never sprouted like Anthony, who played at Colorado,  or Linton, also at Houston, he developed enormous muscles in his legs and upper  torso.  </P> <P> Once in a Pop Warner game, Weatherspoon was carrying the ball when a defender  jumped on his back. Another climbed aboard, then another, but Weatherspoon kept  running with "a whole bunch of them trying to get me down."  </P> <P> At La Habra, where he rushed for more than 4,000 yards, Weatherspoon was  alternately referred to as a frigate and a battleship.  </P> <P> Today, he resembles no one as much as Robert Newhouse, a stocky fullback with  the Cougars from 1969-71 and later with the Dallas Cowboys.  </P> <P> "People bounce off him like in a little pinball machine," said Newhouse, a  commentator on the Cougars' radio network. "We're built about the same, but I  don't think I was as strong as him."  </P> <P> Weatherspoon tries to hit the defenders before they hit him, which may account  for the pinball effect.  </P> <P> "Gang tackling," he said, is the only sure way to bring him down.  </P> <P> Weatherspoon was recruited by Houston before the Cougars hit it big, when fans  still remembered Newhouse as the school's greatest running back.  </P> <P> Bill Yeoman, who had coached Cougar teams good and bad since 1962, brought  Weatherspoon to Houston to play a rather straightforward brand of football.  </P> <P> Yeoman resigned in 1986 after going 1-9, his second consecutive losing season.  Worse, two former players accused Yeoman and his staff of paying players and  allowing them to play while ineligible. Following the 1985 season, 12 players  flunked out of school and 10 of 28 recruits from 1985 were ruled scholastically  ineligible. Soon after, the NCAA started looking into the charges.  </P> <P> Jack Pardee, ex-Chicago Bear and Washington Redskin coach, took over in 1987,  hiring John Jenkins, an offensive coordinator with the Houston Gamblers who  knew how to spruce up the Cougars' sagging offense.  </P> <P> Pardee allowed Jenkins, who was tinkering with the run-and-shoot offense, to  indulge himself. It took awhile to get the thing revved up, but once they did,  it worked with ridiculous ease.  </P> <P> Last season came the big breakthrough -- quarterback Andre Ware threw short  passes on almost every down, wide receiver Manny Hazard grabbed Ware's throws  and Weatherspoon ran through gaping holes when defenses were sure the Cougars  were passing.  </P> <P> Among the numbers the Cougars posted on their way to a 9-2 record were:  </P> <P>  -- Weatherspoon averaged 9.6 yards a carry, breaking the NCAA mark of 9.4 held  by Greg Pruitt of Oklahoma. His all-purpose total of 2,391 yards broke by 284  yards the 25-year-old SWC record held by Donny Anderson of Texas Tech.  </P> <P>  -- Ware passed for 517 yards in little more than a half of the Cougars' 95-21  wipeout of Southern Methodist.  </P> <P>  -- A team scoring average of 53.5 points, including four games of more than  60.  </P> <P> Fittingly, the announcement of Ware as the Heisman Trophy winner came on the  afternoon of yet another Cougar rout, this one, 64-0, over Rice.  </P> <P> On a muggy summer afternoon in Houston, with the beginning of the season still  a month away and Jenkins the Cougars' new coach, Weatherspoon mulled over the  numbers and laughed.  </P> <P> He knows that neither Campbell, a Heisman winner at Texas, nor Dickerson, who  was part of SMU's Pony Express, had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.  </P> <P> Weatherspoon also knows that teammates have not won consecutive Heismans since  Doc Blanchard ran inside and Glenn Davis outside for Army in 1945 and '46,  respectively.  </P> <P> "The Heisman Trophy," he said "that doesn't faze me at all. It's nice to be  recognized, but I just want to go out and play."  </P> <P> You can't blame him. Above all else, the run and shoot is fun. Fun to play and  fun to watch.  </P> <P> "Our fans stay until the end of the game, no matter the score, because you  never know what could happen," Weatherspoon said. "It's too bad people didn't  get to see us on TV last year."  </P> <P> The Cougars were banned from live TV and bowl games last year, as part of NCAA  probation in the wake of Yeoman's turbulent final seasons at Houston. This  season, the Cougars are back on TV (they make their return Sept. 13 against  Texas Tech on ESPN), but still cannot play in a bowl game.  </P> <P> "It ain't gonna be my goal to win the Heisman," Weatherspoon said. "(But) it's  a honor to have people know how good the Houston Cougars are. It'll be nice.  People will see us on TV and say, 'I like Houston. They're pretty good.' Before  they only got to read about us."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] At noon today, Trade and Industry Minister  Vladimir Dlouhy took part in talks held by the Left Bloc  deputies' group, which were open to the public.    Milan Repka has phoned in the following report:    [begin recording] [Repka] Vladimir Dlouhy said at this  meeting that, thanks to the [European Union] association  agreement, Czech exports reached 15-20 percent [as heard] in  1993.    As for the Slovak Republic, there was a reduction in the  volume of reciprocal trade by about 20 percent in the first half  of 1993, and reciprocal trade stagnated at this level in the  second half of 1993.    Asked by Zdenek Vorlicek, a Left Bloc deputy and member of  the Economic Committee, why the Czech Republic had reduced its  exports to the countries of the former USSR to the current 8  percent [as heard], Dlouhy said that he firmly rejected the  allegation that the Czech Republic will be withdrawing from  Russian markets, thereby creating space for Western traders.  According to Minister Dlouhy, one has to realize the extent to  which the former states of the USSR are solvent and capable of  paying for goods delivered.    Tomas Sojka, a member of the Economic Committee, was  interested in knowing how the Czech Republic will behave as  regards cooperation with the Visegrad Group of states. Dlouhy  said that the Czech Government opposes the unnatural political  institutionalization of mutual relations, but this is not valid  for the sphere of economic cooperation, where the Czech  Government supports the widest liberalization of reciprocal  trade.

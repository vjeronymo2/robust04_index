			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Taking a gamble on the switch - The reverse takeover of Crockfords by TV-am THE DIRECTORS of TV-am, the breakfast television company which lost its licence, yesterday took a final gamble and bought Crockfords, the Mayfair casino in a reverse takeover. The deal will be paid for by a rights issue which will raise Pounds 50m and give the company, to be known as Crockfords, a market capitalisation of Pounds 90m. Mr Richard Redmayne, a director of TV-am who will remain a non-executive director of Crockfords, said yesterday: 'I think it is a very good deal which offers TV-am shareholders a very real alternative.' After losing its licence to Good Morning Television, TV-am was planning a voluntary liquidation until it was approached by Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman of Crockfords. He was not only keen to get a Stock Exchange listing for his casino group but also wanted to 'acquire' some of TV-am's institutional shareholders, who range from Phillips &amp; Drew and Scottish Amicable to Schroders and Fidelity. Under the conditional deal, TV-am will acquire all the issued share capital of Crockfords in return for 71.25m ordinary shares in TV-am credited as fully paid. These shares are worth Pounds 64.1m at the offer price of 90p. Of the shares, 26.8m will go to the vendors and 44.3m will be offered as part of the rights issue. The issue is on the basis of 9-for-2. Of the Pounds 50m to be raised from the issue, Pounds 39.9m will go to the vendors and the rest, together with about Pounds 9m of TV-am cash, will be used to pay off remaining Crockfords debt. Hambros Bank, which is sponsoring the deal, is also offering to buy up to 20 per cent of the existing ordinary TV-am shares to provide a cash alternative of 18p. Not all TV-am directors were happy with the Crockfords deal. Mr Stratos Zagraphos, who was its finance director, resigned last month because he felt he did not know enough about the casino business to carry out proper due diligence. Pro forma earnings per share of the enlarged group were 12.6p for the year to December 1992 and 7p for the 24 weeks ending June 13 1993. The pro forma earnings multiple at the offer price is 7.1 times. Operating profits at Crockfords have ranged from Pounds 7.4m in 1990 to Pounds 19.8m last year. The figure for the first half of this year is Pounds 11.4m. The company warns, however, that in each of the last three financial years Crockfords top 10 players have accounted for 5 per cent of profits although the members of the 'exceptional players' list changed over the period. 'A small group of players can have a dramatic impact on the performance of an up-market casino in any given period,' the Hambros statement said. Last year, if the current proposals had been implemented, there would have been a dividend of 5.2p. Dealings in the shares are due to start on September 1.</p>

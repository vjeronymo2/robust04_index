			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges City regulation THERE IS a 'very real trade-off' between the cost of financial services regulation and the cost of compensation, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told MPs last night as he fended off Labour charges of 'giving up on the fight to put City regulation in order'. Many would be content to pay more for regulation if they thought that was likely to have an impact on compensation costs, he suggested. Even the best system of supervision would be wasted without the right people and the willingness to exercise it. As the Commons approved regulations to implement the second European banking directive, he reiterated his comments to the Financial Times last week that there was much that could be done to beef up financial services supervision without resorting to new legislation. 'The City wanted self-regulation, it has got a high degree of self-regulation, it must now self-regulate,' he said. He was responding to a call from Mr Alistair Darling, shadow Treasury spokesman, to 'set up a regulatory system with teeth' that would be good for the consumer, efficient for industry and vital for the good name of the City. Prompted by Mr Darling, Mr Nelson admitted that the government would have liked the recently agreed European investment services directive to have come into force at the same time as the banking directive in January - rather than in 1996, as currently planned. He described the scheduled timetable for implementation as 'realistic'. Addressing last night's directive, which provides the legal framework for a single market in banking, Mr Nelson said the BCCI affair had demonstrated the difficulties faced by supervisors in dealing with complex international conglomerates. But he argued that the measure's underlying supervisory principles remained 'valid in a post-BCCI world'. Those principles 'in many respects' were part of the process of ensuring that a bank could not in future develop as BCCI did. That view was 'echoed' in the conclusions of the recent Bingham report.</p>

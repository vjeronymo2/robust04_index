			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Industrial disputes could trigger US rail chaos THE US rail system was braced yesterday for possible coast-to-coast industrial action which could bring chaos to both freight and passenger services. Talks between rail unions and operators were continuing up to a midnight deadline yesterday. Amtrak, which runs passenger services across the US, had already cancelled about 50 overnight runs, to prevent passengers being stranded. It was also refusing to take long-distance reservations for today and tomorrow and negotiating stand-by arrangements with bus companies and airlines. Greyhound, the largest long-distance bus operator, said it had agreed to accept Amtrak tickets on all routes, while special arrangements had also been made between Amtrak and USAir. At issue are three separate union-management negotiations, all attempting to establish new labour contracts. The first centres on talks between the International Association of Machinists and the freight railroad industry generally; the second concerns Conrail, one of the largest freight operators and its track workers; the third involves Amtrak and half a dozen unions. Late last night Amtrak announced it had reached agreement with two unions but said it was still negotiating with the other four. If strike action is called it is unclear whether it would occur in all three disputes, or just one. A strike by the IAM against the freight operators would be the most damaging. However, Conrail alone serves 14 states and about half the freight moved in the US starts or ends on Conrail track. A strike against Amtrak would badly disrupt commuter traffic in metropolitan areas on the east coast - such as Boston and New York. Congress has special powers over the rail industry which allow it to enforce labour settlements - authority it has used as recently as last year. Union supporters allege that the railroad operators are anxious to incite strike action in order to drag Congress into the dispute. It is likely Congress will step in if a strike is called. President George Bush has met Mr Andrew Card, the new transport secretary, and both signalled that the administration was poised to pressure Congress to intervene.</p>

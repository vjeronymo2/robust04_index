			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Radiant at 100 - Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra The music of Dutilleux is Gallic refinement at its most quintessential, hard to bring off without finely-tuned orchestral playing. We found that out a couple of years ago, when the Orchestre de Paris came to the Proms and turned the composer's Second Symphony into a thick and congested melange of noise. On Saturday more music by Dutilleux - his Timbres, espace, mouvement - came to the Royal Albert Hall, but this time it shone with crystalline radiance. The improvement was thanks to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, playing with all the fastidious care that the Parisians lacked. This is a comparison worth making, as there is a tendency not to judge the British regional orchestras on an international level, which may be unfair. Several major EC countries do not have even one orchestra that can match the Bournemouth SO's standards. With this visit to London, under its principal conductor Andrew Litton, the orchestra was inviting applause. This year marks the centenary of its foundation and at a time when every orchestra in the country must be becoming nervous about funding, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra wanted a programme to make a splash and show how adventurous it is - a major orchestral score, a brief British fanfare (Tippett's No. 5) and a UK first performance. The Dutilleux counted as that, because the composer has recently added an extra section to the score, where cellos unwind a long, unhurried theme to add to the feeling of far horizons (the 'espace' of the title). In its unshowy way, the piece works quite well as an orchestral showpiece. Everything was perfectly detailed, but also hazy, atmospheric, imaginative. The main work, however, was Mahler's Second Symphony. For this, Litton must have worked hard with his musicians to get the playing so assured all round, from the strings sinking their teeth into their first violent phrases with ferocious unanimity, to the proud brass perorations at the end (botched high C's from the trumpets apart). With Jean Rigby and Yvonne Kenny as soloists and a commendable showing from the City of Bath Bach Choir, this was in every way a technically impressive performance. It was also exciting now and again, but not all the way through. Litton let the temperature drop in between Mahler's heated climaxes; but all the big moments came off splendidly, and the finale's vision of resurrection was properly awe-inspiring. When the Arts Council's own day of judgement arrives, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra will have done itself no harm with performances like this.</p>

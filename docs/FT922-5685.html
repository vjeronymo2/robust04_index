			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin Distilleries a wee dram higher at Pounds 8.6m SOBER Christmas revellers dampened spirits at Macdonald Martin Distilleries, maker of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray whiskies, which yesterday revealed profits only Pounds 240,000 higher to Pounds 8.6m for the year to March 31. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said a lack of consumer demand during the vital Christmas period had re-sulted in an overhang of stock last year. Neverthe-less, he was pleased with the profits progress despite the effects of the 'deep and persistent recession worldwide'. The advance had been achieved on sales 7 per cent down at Pounds 31.8m. This was the result of lower overheads through increased efficiencies, better deals on raw materials and job losses through natural wastage. Mr James Fyfe, finance director, said the company had also increased its share of a declining international malt market during the past 12 months. International malt whisky volumes fell by 9 per cent, while MMD's shipments fell by just 4 per cent. Mr Fyfe said a strong performance in Japan - where sales jumped by 20 per cent compared to a market decline of 20 per cent - had helped to cushion the effect of tougher trading in the US. Shipments there were down by 10 per cent. In the UK, excise duty and VAT increases combined with recession to depress sales for the first time in almost 10 years. Customer demand fell by about 11 per cent in the UK, Mr Fyfe said. He added that the excess stock had worked its way through the system since December, although production was being cut by 15 per cent this year. Blended whiskies - which represent about 500,000 cases a year, compared with 160,000 for malt - were expected to suffer increasing margin pressures due to lower prices, Mr Fyfe said. Yet MMD had managed to increase overall margins last year by 2.6 points to 26.9 per cent. Earnings per A share rose from 39.74p to 41.88p. The final dividend is raised 10 per cent to 6.6p for a total of 8.8p (8p).</p>

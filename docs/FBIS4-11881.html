			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 3 Apr -- The Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]  Ministerial Council ended its 50th session this afternoon at the  Council's General Secretariat in Riyadh. It was chaired by His  Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Saudi foreign minister.    The Ministerial Council issued a press statement that was  read out by GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan  al-Qasimi. The following is the text of the press statement:    The Ministerial Council held its ordinary 50th session at  the  headquarters of the General Secretariat in Riyadh on 2nd and 3rd  April, 1994. His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the  foreign minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and head of the  Ministerial Council's current session, chaired the meeting which  was attended by all its members -- His Excellency Rashid  Bin-Abdallah al-Na'imi, the foreign minister of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE]; His Excellency Shaykh Khaled Bin-'Abdallah Al  Khalifah, Bahrain's housing minister; His Excellency Shaykh  Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, the foreign minister of the  State of Qatar; and His Excellency Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al  Sabah, first deputy prime minister and the foreign minister of  the State of Kuwait.    The Ministerial Council studied the new regional  developments  and developments in the Gulf in the light of the Iraqi regime's  lack of compliance with all international commitments imposed by  Security Council resolutions related to its aggression,  continuing procrastination, its pick-and-choose treatment of  those resolutions, pursuit of a hostile policy toward the State  of Kuwait, its continuing formation of a threat to GCC security  and stability, and continuous attempts to split the cohesiveness  of international legitimacy.    The council also studied the Iraqi nonimplementation of the  UN Security Council resolutions related to Kuwait, its attempts  to evade its international commitments concerning the Kuwaiti  issue, its persistent repetition of expansionist claims on  Kuwait, its claims against Kuwaiti sovereignty, its threats to  Kuwaiti independence, and its cease-fire violations. In this  context, the council recalled the GCC Supreme Council's  emphasis, in its 14th session, that respecting the sovereignty  and independence of Kuwait, as it came in the second paragraph  of Resolution 687, and the international borders of Kuwait, as  ratified by UN Security Council resolution No. 833, represent  the essence of the commitments specified in Resolution No. 687,  and that their nonimplementation represents a violation of the  essence of that resolution.    As it welcomed the resolution adopted recently by the UN  Security Council to continue the international sanctions against  Iraq because of its nonimplementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions related to its aggression against Kuwait, the GCC  Council expresses its satisfaction with the understanding shown  by the UN Security Council members of the aggressive policy of  the Iraqi regime and their insistence on the necessity for Iraq  to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait and sanctity of its  territories. The council appeals to the international community  to continue its pressures on the Iraqi regime in order to make  it stop its aggressive behavior and to submit completely to all  the UN Security Council resolutions related to Resolution No.  687, particularly those related to recognizing the international  borders between the two countries, releasing the Kuwaiti and  other prisoners of war and detainees, the payment of  compensations, and a commitment not to commit or support any  terrorist or sabotage action.    The council emphasizes its complete commitment to Iraqi  unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and expresses its  sympathy with the fraternal Iraqi people against the human  suffering for which the Iraqi regime is fully responsible  because of its refusal to implement the UN Security Council  Resolutions 706 and 712 that deal with the Iraqi needs of food  and medicine.    The council also reviewed the new developments in the  relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and reiterated its  firm stance of supporting the UAE and its sovereignty on the  three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb, and the Lesser  Tunb. The council also reiterates its absolute support to all  the peaceful measures and means adopted by the UAE to restore  its sovereignty over its islands.    It expresses hope that Iran would comply with the call of  His  Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan al Nuhayyan, president of the  UAE, with regard to the holding of a direct dialogue between the  UAE and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the latter's  occupation of the three islands belonging to the UAE.    The Council condemns the noticeable escalation by Iranian  media and its media campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  during March 1994 and its allegations, according to which the  Kingdom is obstructing the Iranian pilgrims.    It expresses full support for the measures that the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia has adopted to enable pilgrims to perform the  duty of pilgrimage in comfort and tranquility, in accordance  with the teachings of the pure Islamic tradition and the  resolution of the foreign ministers of the Islamic states in  their meeting in Amman, Jordan, during March 1988.    The Ministerial Council followed the developments in the  Middle East peace process and in the occupied territories and  expresses in this respect its great anxiety about the  deterioration of the security situation and living conditions in  the occupied Arab territories. It holds Israel fully  responsible for the increase in the number of people killed  among the sons of the fraternal Palestinian people, in a way  that is in contradiction with the spirit of the peace process  and represents a violation of the fourth Geneva Agreement.    In this respect also, the Council condemns Israel for the  massacre carried out by the Israeli settlers against worshipers  in Ibrahim's Mosque [Hebron]. It calls on the UN Security  Council and the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United  States and Russia, to speed up the implementation of the  articles of UN Security Council's Resolution 904. This  resolution concerns the condemnation of the massacre and the  adoption of measures to guarantee the safety and protection of  Palestinian civilians in all parts of the occupied Palestinian  territories, which includes the provision of an international  presence, the disarming of Israeli settlers, and the  implementation of the fourth Geneva Agreement to the occupied  Arab territories.    It stresses in this respect that the Israeli settlements in  the occupied territories are illegal according to international  law and that their continued presence constitutes an obstacle to  peace that is liable to rock confidence and will not provide a  suitable atmosphere for the achievement of a comprehensive  solution to the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict.    While welcoming the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement concerning an international presence in al-Khalil, and  the resumption of the peace negotiations, the council reaffirms  its full support for the peace process on all tracks aimed at  reaching a just, permanent, and comprehensive solution to the  Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis  of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for  peace principle, a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  Arab lands, primary among which is holy Jerusalem, and securing  the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,  including its right to self-determination.    The council reiterates its request to the international  community to put pressure on Israel to carry out UN Security  Council Resolution 425 to secure an immediate and unconditional  withdrawal from southern Lebanon.    The Ministerial Council brought back to mind the  recommendations of the 8th conference of the Damascus  Declaration member states foreign ministers held in Damascus on  9-10 January 1994, and welcomed the graceful invitation made by  the State of Kuwait to host the coming meeting of the Damascus  declaration foreign ministers' conference, in implementation of  Article 1 of the recommendations of the 8th Damascus Declaration  member states foreign ministers' conference on the importance of  continuing coordination and consultation in the political domain  between the 8 countries regarding regional and international  issues.    The council is following with interest the development of  the  political and security situation in fraternal Somalia, and it  expresses its aspiration to see a reconciliation between the  Somali factions. It welcomes the signing of the Nairobi  agreement and hopes that this step will contribute to the  restoration of security and stability to Somalia so that it will  be able to resume the reconstruction and development march. The  Ministerial Council also followed the latest developments of the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it lauds the international  efforts made to force the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from  Sarajevo, and it urges the international community to take  similar measures in the other security zones.    The council welcomes the signing of an agreement on the  establishment of a Muslim-Croatian Federation in Bosnia and  considers it a step toward restoring peace and security to the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirming its sovereignty,  independence, and territorial unity.    It calls on the Security Council to enable the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the right of legitimate  self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations  Charter, to lift the arms embargo imposed on it, and to tighten  sanctions and redouble pressure on Serbia and Montenegro.    The council expresses its deep concern at the continuing  deterioration of the situation in the sisterly Republic of  Afghanistan, and calls on all the Afghan factions to put a halt  to the fighting, to give priority to the national interest, and  to respond to the United Nations efforts for that purpose so  that security and stability can be restored throughout that  sisterly country.    The council also discussed the minutes of a number of  ministerial committees and approved them. It reaffirmed to the  technical committees the necessity of completing implementation  of the rules of the unified economic agreement, in line with  decisions taken by the Higher Council.    The Ministerial Council also reviewed the situation in the  international oil market, expressing the concern of its states  over its instability. In that context, the Ministerial Council  urged oil-producing states within and outside OPEC to respond to  the appeal made by their majesties during the 14th session, and  to cooperate in stabilizing the market.    The council expressed its satisfaction at the positive  results of the latest round of the Gulf-American dialogue  chaired by the Saudi minister of commerce representing the GCC,  and the U.S. trade secretary, representing the United States.  It the council hoped that the steps agreed upon would provide  more support for cooperation between them.    The Ministerial Council is awaiting its fifth meeting with  the European Union foreign ministers in Riyadh on 8 May 1994 and  the issuing of resolutions that will serve cooperation between  the two groups in various fields.    Issued in the city of Riyadh    On 3 April 1994.    His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign  affairs minister, then declared the meetings closed.</p>

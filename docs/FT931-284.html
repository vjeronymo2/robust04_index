			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Segni splits Italy's Catholic vote ITALY'S Christian Democrat party has been plunged into an identity crisis following the resignation on Monday of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement. The party has always accommodated an enormous spread of ideologies and personal differences. Thus it has been both conservative and progressive, deeply Catholic and left-leaning, market-orientated and heavily in favour of a strong state sector in the economy. Mr Segni's gesture has profoundly damaged this diffuse, accomodating personality and opened up an unprecedented rift in the Catholic vote. The circumstances in which he has left permit no room for doubt: there is no space for him in a party so profoundly tarnished by the corruption scandals and the even more damaging imputation from magistrates that its most senior members are allegedly linked to the Mafia. His Christian Democrat credentials are impeccable. Mr Segni, aged 53, is the son of a former Christian Democrat president of the republic and has been with the party for 16 years, representing his native Sardinia. He formed the Referendum Movement three years ago both as a challenge to the inability of parliament to reform the electoral process and to the control of his party by an increasingly discredited group of politicians. Mr Segni has spent the best part of a year agonising over whether to remain inside the party. It seemed after this length of time that he accepted he could carry more weight acting as a reformist inside the party - no matter how much he disagreed with Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the astute new Christian Democrat leader. Mr Martinazzoli has consistently out-manoeuvred him; perhaps the final straw was the way in which the Christian Democrats have climbed aboard the referendum bandwagon. This threatened to deny him a much deserved achievement as his referendum proposals for introduction of a majority voting system for the Senate are likely to be endorsed on April 18. His break leaves him free in a fast-changing political climate to forge new alliances or form his own party. Already he has the support of Mr Gianni Rivera, the former international football player and Christian Democrat deputy, plus that of another party deputy, Mr Alberto Michelini. The latter is identified with the conservative Catholic movement, Opus Dei, much in favour with the papacy. This is the first time since the war that the Catholic vote has been faced with a split. The Church, powerful and important backers of the Christian Democrats, now faces an awkward choice: back the new reformist forces or stay with the discredited Christian Democrats in the belief that Mr Segni will burn himself out and that the former can regenerate themselves. The Christian Democrats obtained 29 per cent of the vote in last April's general elections. Poll analysts estimated their share of the vote earlier this month had fallen to 23-25 per cent, leaving them still the largest party by almost 10 per cent. With the Christian Democrats under siege in their traditional strongholds in Rome and further south, the Segni split could deprive them of this status.</p>

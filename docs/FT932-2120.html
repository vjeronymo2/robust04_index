			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Uffizi Gallery partially reopened THE Uffizi Gallery in Florence was partially reopened yesterday only 23 days after one wing was seriously damaged by a car bomb blast that also killed a family of five, Robert Graham writes from Rome. Mr Alberto Ronchey, the culture minister, cut through Italy's bureaucracy, obtained L30bn (Pounds 13.3m) in funds and encouraged volunteer help in order to open the world-famous gallery to the public as soon as possible. The damaged wing and its paintings will require up to another six months of restoration, but Mr Ronchey insisted on this first step to show that Italy would not be intimidated by terrorist violence. The authorities have yet to identify those responsible for the car bomb. But they continue to insist the Mafia was involved. The blast in Florence was preceded by a few days by a car bomb in Rome aimed at a television talk show journalist, the first such incident in the capital and again thought to be the work of the Mafia. However, there is suspicion that elements of the security services - long linked to right-wing extremist groups and the secret Masonic lodge P2 - might be involved.</p>

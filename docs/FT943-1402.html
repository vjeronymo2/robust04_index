			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Gaelic to be encouraged in Scottish primary schools All primary schoolchildren in Scotland would be encouraged to learn Gaelic under plans drawn up by the SNP. The conference agreed to a range of measures to encourage the language, which is spoken by only 70,000 people - about 2 per cent of Scots. Delegates agreed Gaelic should have equality with English in law and be recognised and promoted as a national language. Bilingual workplace signs, Gaelic road signs and a Gaelic radio station were among ideas for promoting the language. Mr Peter Scott-Wilson from Aberdeen said: 'Unless the language is supported by a very firm policy it will not be encouraged, it will not grow - and we desperately want Gaelic to grow in Scotland.'</p>

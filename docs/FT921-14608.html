			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela's output record VENEZUELA'S production of crude oil in 1991 averaged 2.488m barrels a day, the highest level on record since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976, official sources said in Caracas. The 1991 production figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions of condensates and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11 per cent over 1990 production of 2.249m b/d. Exports of crude oil and refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d, up more than 10 per cent from the previous year's average of 1.88m b/d. Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. This means that Venezuela continues to hold the largest proved reserves of crude oil in the Western Hemisphere, even without including the country's very large deposits of extra heavy oil located in the Orinoco Belt.</p>

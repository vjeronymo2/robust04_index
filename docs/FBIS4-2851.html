			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (AFP)--Beijing police are  cracking down on the capital's currency black market following  the murder of a moneychanger, arresting several traders in  recent days, one dealer said Thursday.    "We can't change money, we're too frightened," said the  stallholder in the Ritan clothing market, a centre for the  illegal trade in the Chinese yuan.    "The police closed down lots of stalls and arrested the  stallholders last week for continuing to change money," she  said, adding that the crackdown followed the murder last month  of a trader from northwestern Xinjiang province.    "He was murdered during a moneychanging deal. We don't know  who did it," she said.    At least four nearby stalls were closed, with notices  reading  "Shut on April 8, 1994" pasted across their doors. The  stallholder said the market was still crawling with plainclothes  police.    China's black market has continued despite this year's  currency reforms, which included the unification of the dual  rate system that had previously pegged the yuan officially at  5.7 yuan to the dollar compared with about 8.7 yuan on swap  markets and on the street.    Traders were buying dollars for up 8.87 yuan last month,  when  the foreign exchange market rate was 8.69 yuan and banks, with  their hefty commission, were giving individuals just 8.48 yuan.    The stallholder said she did not know the present black  market rate.</p>

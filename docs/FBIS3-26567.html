Economists, entrepreneurs and professors participated in the  meeting held here in Beijing.    Cao Siyuan, who was the first to call for the introduction  of  the Bankruptcy Law and participated throughout in the process of  its drafting, said, "During the period, people's courts at  various levels have tried nearly 1,000 bankruptcy cases with  more than 400 bankruptcies officially declared. This law has  particular significance in the market economy as it can help  enterprises adapt to the market and accelerate the establishment  of a market-oriented economy in China."    According to Cao, there were nearly 100 bankruptcy cases  heard by the courts from late 1988 to early 1989, but the number  dropped to 32 in the following 12 months. However, in the past  few years, with the changes in the economy and business  practices, many enterprises that incurred losses and fell into  debt turned to the Bankruptcy Law to protect their legal rights  and interests.    There were only 117 bankruptcy cases in 1991, but as many  428  in 1992. The past four years has witnessed a total of 675  bankruptcy cases. In the first half of 1993, another 273  bankruptcy cases were tried.    "This is not a large number compared with the Western  countries, which see thousands of companies going bankrupt each  month. But it is still a significant number for China, a  socialist country which is just starting to run a  market-oriented economy," Cao said.    Statistics show that around one-third of state-owned  enterprises are losing money due to poor management or for other  reasons. This is a heavy burden for the government as it has to  subsidize these deficit-ridden enterprises with huge sums of  money merely to keep them in operation, even though they may  incur further losses.    Yang Kewen, Director of Beijing Industrial Adjustment  Association, revealed that 40 percent of state-owned enterprises  in Beijing operated at a loss in the last three quarters of  1993, compared with 33.6 percent in the same period in 1992.  "Many of these enterprises should be declared bankrupt to stop  further losses. But only a few of them have done so," he said.    In China, the word "bankruptcy" carries such negative  connotations that many people, including factory directors and  government officials, have a preconceived negative attitude  towards it. As a result, many businesses refuse to declare  bankruptcy.    Bian Jingzhai, Law Department Director of the All China  Federation of Trade Union, said that the law, good as it is,  will be hard to implement if auxiliary measures are not taken to  help enforce it. "When an enterprise is declared bankrupt, the  workers are out of a job, but the directors and mangers, who are  supposed to assume responsibility for the losses, are more often  than not shifted to other leading posts. Is this fair?" he said.    Bian also mentioned that even some senior engineers are  forced to take low pay and engaged in manual work after their  enterprises are shut down. Who is going to hire laid-off  workers in this tense and competitive market? It is  understandable that most workers oppose declaring bankruptcy  even though their enterprises are losing money and debt-ridden.  He also called for the setting up of labor markets to find  jobs for laid-off workers.    Experts have called for the creation of a Labor Law,  Corporate Law, Enterprise Merger Law and law to insure the  unemployed and retired, guarantee their basic living standards  and protect their rights.    "I hope that in five years the Bankruptcy Law can be  repromulgated with no restrictions or conditions and not on a  trial basis," Cao said. The following are the amendments to  the law proposed by the economists:    -- The law should cover all enterprises, not just the  state-owned ones, as more and more collectively and  privately-owned enterprises, and even Chinese foreign joint  ventures, will be involved in bankruptcy cases.    -- The conditions of the Bankruptcy Law should be clear and  specific, so the words in Article Three of Chapter One  "enterprises which, owing to poor operations and management that  result in serious losses, are unable to repay the debts that are  due shall be declared bankrupt" are amended as follows:  "Enterprises unable to pay debts that are due shall be declared  bankrupt."    -- The amount of time needed for applications and the  hearing  of bankruptcy cases, which can extend to more than half a year  in accordance with the provision of the law, should be shortened  so as to enhance efficiency and reduce the losses of both  debtors and creditors.    -- The formation of a liquidation team should be undertaken  according to market principles, namely, the leader of the  liquidation team should be chosen and appointed by the people's  court from among the experts working in firms that do bankruptcy  consultation, law firms and accountancy firms, and not from  government officials. The members of the liquidation team  should be hired by the team leader and approved by the court.    According to the decision made at the just concluded Third  Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of CPC, the  government will try to turn some state-owned enterprises into  limited liability companies which must shoulder responsibility  for their profits or losses, relieving the state of financial  responsibility for the business.    "Under such circumstance, tens of thousands of debt-ridden,  long-term loss-making enterprises in China are expected to apply  for bankruptcy. That will make our business very prosperous in  the coming years," Cao said.    He also explained that China's rejoining the GATT and its  integration into the international market economy will  inevitably eliminate any obstacle and unfair measures that  protect failing enterprises. It makes no sense, in a market  economy, to subsidize enterprises that are losing money.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If UN troops come into the Dniester region they will  not be perceived by the population as peacekeepers. This was  said at a news conference today by Igor Smirnov, president of  the Dniester-Moldavia [Moldova] Republic. Speaking about the  results of the conference of international cooperation in  peacekeeping in regions of conflict on the territory of the CIS,  which was held in Moscow from 20-22 June, he expressed the firm  conviction that only Russia has the right to peacekeeping  activities in the Dniester region.</p>

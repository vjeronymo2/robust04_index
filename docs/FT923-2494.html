			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / India lifts oil prices INDIA has raised petroleum prices by 18 per cent as part of its drive to reduce government subsidies and the fiscal deficit, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said in London yesterday. Petrol went up by more than 7 per cent, diesel by 21 per cent and bottled gas, the most widely-used urban cooking fuel, by 22 per cent, from yesterday morning. Only kerosene, cooking fuel for the poor, was exempt from the increase. 'We have clearly shown our commitment to deal with the fiscal crisis,' Mr Singh said, during a visit to Britain. He said India's export performance was encouraging, if the drop in trade with the former Soviet Union, which used to purchase half of India's exports, was left out of account. Exports to convertible currency areas rose by 6 per cent in dollar terms last year, despite a squeeze on imports, and were now rising by 8 to 10 per cent.</p>

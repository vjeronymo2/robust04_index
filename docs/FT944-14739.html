			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Russian leadership set to impose tough curbs on spending The Russian cabinet yesterday approved an austere budget for 1995, amid criticism from the International Monetary Fund of the government's spendthrift policies in recent months. Senior IMF officials in Moscow took the Russian government to task this week for failing to control government spending and credit creation, and not attacking the macro-economic fundamentals behind the rouble's crash earlier this month. Mr Michael Mussa, the chief IMF economist, said on Wednesday: 'Until a cap is put on spending, there is no hope of containing the budgetary situation. That needs to be demonstrated by the government.' Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government - which has in the past preferred a gradualist approach - appears to have accepted the IMF's view that there is no alternative to tough fiscal and monetary policies. However, such efforts may be thwarted by hostility between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, arising from the rouble crisis. The draft budget, approved at a closed meeting of the cabinet, yesterday, aims to reduce the budget deficit next year to 8.3 per cent of gross domestic product and bring inflation down to 1 per cent a month by the end of the year. The draft sharply reduces subsidies to agriculture and the coal industry but maintains defence spending at 5.1 per cent of GDP. It must still be passed by parliament, and may be indirectly opposed by spending ministries. According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Mr Chernomyrdin told the cabinet that the collapse of the rouble demonstrated the dangers of loosening fiscal and monetary controls. Many economists attribute the rouble crisis to massive government subsidies to industry and agriculture in August and September. Traditionally, spending ministries such as defence and agriculture have restrained their objections to austerity during the drafting of the budget but have lobbied for additional revenues after the budget has been passed. Mr Chernomyrdin sought to pre-empt that, telling ministers that henceforth they must operate on the basis of 'an accurately calculated real budget' rather than expecting that 'something more will be given' later in the year. IMF officials have warned the Russian government that it will not receive further assistance until it cuts spending. One said a strong Russian plan would unlock support.

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Fears on resale of council houses THE COMMONS environment committee has urged the government to investigate the likely consequences for the housing market if increasing numbers of former council properties bought by tenants cannot be re-sold, Ivor Owen writes. In a report published yesterday the committee highlights anecdotal evidence that building societies are not prepared to fund mortgages when some properties acquired by tenants under the government's 'right-to-buy' policy, particularly high-rise flats, are placed on the market. The cross-party committee expresses concern about the possibility of growing numbers of 'unsaleable right-to-buy properties' and the consequent effect on the value of surrounding homes.

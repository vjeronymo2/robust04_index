			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15-CARRIER U.S. NAVY  </P> <P> Trost's defense of our need for a "15-carrier Navy" fails to address the most  elementary consideration for these multibillion-dollar task forces, their  vulnerability to ICBM attack. A point he did make which we can also seriously  dispute in today's world is the ability of the Navy to protect us and insure  our survival, let alone our prosperity. The nuclear standoff that has existed  between us and the Soviets for the last 30 years is responsible for our  survival, and not our 15-carrier Navy.  </P> <P> Now that the battleships are gone all that remains of the traditional fleet for  the admirals to man is its carrier task forces and nuclear submarines. With a  defense budget that is now helping to bankrupt us, there is little doubt where  our limited financial resources should be spent. Nuclear submarines, although  they lack the visible deterrence of our carriers, are a far more effective  defense than carriers simply because, in addition to their tremendous  multiple-warhead missile firing capability, they are much less vulnerable to  attack. They give those of us paying for the largest defense budget in our  history a weapon capable of surviving a nuclear attack which is also a real  deterrent to our enemies.  </P> <P> Satellites and radar track the position of our carrier task forces within a few  hundred feet anywhere on the earth. They are prime, highly vulnerable targets  for ICBM attack in a nuclear war, and will be vaporized along with our cities.  All that will be left are our Trident submarines.  </P> <P> F.X.

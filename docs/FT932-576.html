			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / SA police arrest four over storming of talks SOUTH AFRICAN police last night said they had arrested four people in connection with last Friday's attack by right wingers on the country's democracy talks. The arrests eased pressure on president FW de Klerk who has come under mounting criticism for failing to act swiftly against the right. Police would not release the names of those arrested. It was not clear whether the rightwing leaders who openly led the attack - well-known politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative Party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB),and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella right-wing group - had been arrested. Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, which saw leading politicians chased through the corridors of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the AWB. Police said arrests were delayed by the fact that suspects had given them false names, an explanation dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. Mr Mandela said last night the ANC was ready for violence from the right: 'If the rightwing thinks that they can use coercion and intimidation to get what they are unable to get through negotiation, they are making a serious mistake . . . And if they are thinking in terms of violence, we are ready for that. We would not like to talk along those terms, but we are not going to allow anybody to impose his will on the people of South Africa.' Constitutional talks were due to continue this week despite the attack. Harry Oppenheimer, Page 30</p>

China's first gigantic computer, the "Yinhe No. 2", is used  to forecast medium-range weather conditions, so that China has  become one of the few countries to provide effective weather  forecasts four to five days ahead.    A ground reception system in coordination with the "Fengyun  No. 2" meteorological satellite has begun to receive and handle  data from the satellite, the officials said.    The feasibility report of an automatic atmosphere monitoring  system has been drawn up, and a preliminary plan to organize a  state climatology center has been approved and regional branches  have gone into operation.    Nationwide, 331 remote computer terminal stations had been  set up by the end of last year, together with 15 ocean  meteorological stations and 14,750 stations at township level.    The central and local meteorological departments also gave  accurate reports of some disasters last year, such as sand  storms, typhoons and torrential rains.    In addition, the departments made great efforts to aid the  growing and harvesting of crops, and the handling of plant  diseases, insect pests, soil conditions, and forest fires.    Meanwhile, meteorological departments in 23 provinces and  autonomous regions induced artificial rain and prevented hail  over an area of more than two million sq km.</p>

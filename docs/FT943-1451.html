			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (12): Mittelstand need persuading - Germany, opportunity knocks but not every company is answering the call When you ask Mr Holger Frommann why the German venture capital market is so small, he winces audibly. Mr Frommann runs the German Venture Capital Association (BVK) and he says there are countless reasons why the volume of business done in Germany is minimal compared, first, to the size of the German economy and, second, to activity in neighbouring France and the UK. Venture capital risk is still something many German businessmen shy from. The medium-sized companies that would be ideal candidates for buy-outs or buy-ins are often run by the people who founded them and who are wary of financial buyers. Stock markets function differently and banks are much more prominent - 'ultimately, the entire economic development of Germany is different,' Mr Frommann says. The recession has not helped either. A report by the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) concludes that in 1993 the market ground to a halt because of falling company prices and a declining economy: DM1.21bn was invested in 1993 - 5 per cent less than a year earlier - representing about 40 per cent of what was invested in the UK. However, a series of big deals this year - including the recent sale of Kassbohrer's Pisten Bully to a group of investors advised by Schroders &amp; Partner Beteiligungsberatung - suggest that while the market may not mushroom there is evidence of relatively strong growth. The Kassbohrer sale is the sort of deal which venture capitalists promised in in spades when the German market first found its feet around 1989: to help old, family-owned companies suffocating under a mountain of debt and in need of outside capital. The BVK says there are perhaps 5,000 companies of this sort and a percentage of them would be ripe for venture capital. But financial buyers are still regarded as wheeler-dealers, whose philosophy is largely anathema to the long-term corporate strategy practised in Germany where emphasis has always been more on organic growth than on acquisitions. 'Owners often still want to know what happens to their business even if they've sold it,' says one industry source in Frankfurt, illustrating barriers the venture capital business has to overcome. Another phenomenon cited to justify the rosy prospects for venture capital in Germany is the question of succession at many Mittelstand, or medium-sized companies, started in the 1950s or '60s by people now looking to hand them on. However, in some instances it is not just a question of finding a new chief executive and outside capital, but more a need to find an entirely new management team. 'In a situation like that the pure financial buyer is challenged,' says Mr Martin Stringfellow who works for Kleinwort Benson in Frankfurt. 'Whether he comes in depends on how able he is to provide a management team for the company and often that is a problem.' Industry observers say there are interesting prospects in eastern Germany as restructuring continues and it becomes clear which elements of the DDR's former command economy have survived the shock therapy administered over the past four years. But Mr Frommann and others admit that business in the five eastern Lander remains largely prospective for a number of reasons. Risks in the eastern Lander are greater because there are no balance sheets from which to extract reliable figures, while the business environment remains precarious - in part because many companies are only just finding new markets following the collapse of the former Soviet-run Comecom trading bloc. And while the BVK estimates that venture capital companies in western Germany spend on average seven years shepherding their investments, they will have to commit themselves for longer periods in former eastern Germany. An under-developed stock exchange is another factor which has stunted the growth of the market. Many US and UK companies which have been helped to find their feet with venture capital, progress naturally to a stock exchange listing, an exit which is still unusual in Germany where stock exchanges deal in heavy-weight shares. Deutsche Beteiligungsgesellschaft, the venture capital arm of Deutsche Bank and an example of several similar companies which are linked to the country's big banks, recently floated the MHM Mode Holding. But such an outcome is the exception rather than the rule. The vast majority of investments end in trade sale, buy-back or secondary purchase, according to the EVCA report. Despite the idiosyncrasies of the German market, venture capital is becoming more respectable in deals involving DM30m or more, a threshold beneath which most international financial buyers do not operate. Even so, money for start-ups and smaller deals is still hard to come by, especially for smaller businesses which only have access to the regional financial centres in Germany. To combat this, the economics ministry in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, often at the leading edge of innovation in German business practices, is developing a new venture capital fund in conjunction with private industry designed to finance start-ups with up to DM2m. For years the state has been running a successful subsidies programme, similar to those available in Germany's other Lander, but the state-run funds have not been able to cater for all the applicants. 'It suggests very clearly to us that people are not prepared to take enough risks,' says an official at the Baden-Wurttemberg economics ministry. Several of the larger international venture capital companies have been encouraged by the volume of business so far this year. The Kassbohrer deal, the Tarkett buy-out and the restructuring at LVW, the former food co-operative group, all augur well for the future, they argue. However, few will commit themselves to predictions about the possible future size of the market, and most suggest that it will continue to be small relative to others - 'I don't think we will ever have a development in Germany as we have seen in the US or the UK,' says Mr Thomas Krenz from Schroders &amp; Partner Beteiligungsberatung in Frankfurt.</p>

The summit's final communique restricted itself to inviting  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command in Bosnia to  "urgently draw up plans to ensure the rotation of the UN forces  at Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at  Tuzla," without referring to military action that NATO might  undertake to achieve these goals.    The document reiterated last August's reference to air  strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the  "strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other  Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic.    Reports from Sarajevo said Serb bombardments had ceased this  morning after the newly raised NATO threat of air strikes in  Bosnia.</p>

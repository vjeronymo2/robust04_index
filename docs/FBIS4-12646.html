			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League  assistant secretary general, has called for assigning a  permanent UN Security Council seat to the Arab group. He said  that apart from its significant geopolitical location, the Arab  world possesses sufficient human, technical, financial, and  cultural resources to justify such a demand.    'Imran told MENA that a permanent Arab seat at the Security  Council is necessary to defend Arab rights, particularly after  the erosion of the Security Council's credibility as a result of  its double-standard policies on more than one occasion.    Citing the recent Security Council resolution extending  sanctions against Libya, 'Imran voiced regret at the method in  which the Council has been handling the Libyan-Western dispute.    He added that the Security Council has double standards and  allows itself the right to punish whom it wants but it does  nothing about Israel's defiance of it and its resolutions.    'Imran said that maintaining the anti-Libyan sanctions  clearly contradicts the provisions of the UN Charter which  assert that a country has sovereignty over its territories and  citizens.    He pointed out that the Arab League will continue trying to  explain the Libyan position. He stressed adherence to the  recent Arab League resolution that called for putting the two  Libyan suspects on trial before a Scottish tribunal meeting at  the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>

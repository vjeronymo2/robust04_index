			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Water prices Water customers have had a raw deal from the industry's 1989 privatisation, according to the National Consumer Council, the government-funded body that represents the interests of consumers. The accusation is not new, but it has struck a chord with public and politicians, coming just two weeks before Ofwat, the regulator, reveals the rate at which water bills will rise in the next decade. The NCC's case rests on two charges: that the water companies' investment programme is too costly, and that the regulator has allowed too much of these costs to be passed onto households, rather than shareholders. On the first point, the NCC has growing support. Much of the capital spending - which water companies estimate will reach Pounds 40bn this decade  -is driven by European Union environmental directives. Some of these - such as the permitted level of nitrates in drinking water - appear unnecessary on health grounds. Nonetheless, the rules are currently part of UK law, which means the industry's ability to rein back spending is limited. The NCC is right, too, to maintain that privatisation gave shareholders too good a deal. Some of its financial arguments are misjudged, such as its attack on the rise in operating costs, which is largely due to new construction. But it is clear, in retrospect, that the pricing formula did not take adequate account of efficiency gains which were achievable. It would be wrong to lay the failings of the privatisation formula at the regulator's door. But this year's review has given Ofwat its first chance to devise a new one, and its claim to be a tough regulator will rest on the figures it reveals on July 28. The test of Ofwat's strength centres on the return on capital it grants the companies. That rate should be much lower than in the past; given the industry's low level of risk, it should be scarcely above that on government bonds. The industry has failed to make a convincing claim that it needs a real rate of return of 9 1/2 per cent to attract finance. Although Ofwat should sharply restrain the rate of increase in household bills, one reform that would cut the present level of bills is beyond the scope of its review: shifting more of the costs onto industry and agriculture. The government says that it bases its environment policy on the 'polluter pays' principle. Factories and farms which discharge effluent to sewers are, indeed, charged large sums by water companies. But if they discharge to rivers, they pay only a token amount to the National Rivers Authority, although the water companies must still bear the cost of removing this pollution. Under present UK legislation the NRA is entitled to recover only administrative costs from polluters. Allowing it to charge the full cost of the clean up would at least help Ofwat redistribute the painful burden of paying for cleaner water.</p>

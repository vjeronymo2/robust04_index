			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Telecoms alliance may turn to merger The national telecommunications companies of Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands could turn their alliance into a full merger in response to accelerating competition within Europe, according to company strategists. The three companies last year launched a joint venture, Unisource, to target the growing multinationals market for one-stop telecoms networks. They have taken steps towards merging their international networks. Dr Bertil Thorngren, director of corporate strategy at Telia, the state-owned Swedish operator, said: 'Within five to 10 years the three companies could become one company. We are set to become more integrated.' A full merger was one of the 'serious options', Dr Thorngren said. Others include equity exchanges and/or a merger of long-distance and international operations, spinning off separate local operators in each country akin to the US regional Bells. Such radical options reflect the impact of competitive pressures on Europe's smaller telecoms operators as monopolies are abolished and the EU's larger operators form alliances to target cross-border traffic. Most of the smaller western European operators are urgently reassessing their futures. The Irish, Belgian and Portuguese state concerns are considering selling minority stakes to larger operators, possibly as part of privatisation. Several smaller operators are in talks about joining Unisource. Telecom Eireann and Belgacom, the Irish and Belgian operators, have also approached British Telecommunications. A London-based telecoms analyst said a Swiss/Swedish/Dutch merger would be a 'logical extension'. However, he highlighted some difficulties, including the enlargement of Unisource and the state-owned status of Telia and the Swiss telecoms operator. A one-third stake in KPN, the Dutch operator, was floated earlier this year. Privatisation of Telia is under serious consideration in Sweden, which is one of the world's most competitive telecoms markets. However, the Swiss state operator has yet to be split from its postal division. Last month Unisource admitted Telefonica, the private Spanish operator, as a full member and forged an alliance with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, which may take an equity stake.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Ministers clash on N Sea tax A ROW emerged yesterday between the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry over proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime, which have caused a furore in the oil industry. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has clashed with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, over the type of contracts that are eligible for transitional relief under the petroleum revenue taxes changes proposed in the Budget. The new PRT regime, which would reduce the tax rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish tax relief on exploration and appraisal work, provides transitional help for companies which have already entered into contracts with drilling contractors. The industry says that obligations made to the DTI for new drilling as part of previous oil licensing rounds should be classed as legal contracts - automatically eligible for full tax relief - because companies are not able to withdraw from them. Mr Dorrell has disputed this interpretation. Mr Eggar, however, suggested that the obligation contracts were binding. Referring to the oil industry's drilling commitments to the DTI, Mr Eggar added: 'There is no question of any blanket exemption.' One leading North Sea explorer said: 'We've been getting very mixed messages and that point certainly needs clarifying. We need to get relief or release.' The DTI yesterday published its 'brown book' of oil and gas statistics which showed that the North Sea oil and gas industry contributed more than Pounds 10bn to the UK economy last year. The industry drilled 131 exploration and appraisal wells last year. Oil companies believe this figure could be halved if the government's proposed changes to PRT were adopted in their present form. Mr Eggar said the DTI had contacted companies which had made applications for licences to drill in the North Sea as part of the 14th licensing round but very few companies had changed their plans in the wake of the tax changes. The North Sea had a record 113 fields in production and the success rate for oil exploration had improved significantly, he said. One well in every 3.6 drilled found oil or gas, compared with a world average of one in 20 wells. Oil production increased to 94.2m tonnes last year from 91.3m tonnes in 1991. Mr Eggar said forecasts for oil output suggested it would rise and reach record levels over the next four years. Oil discoveries reached 230m tonnes last year - taking proven and probable reserves of oil to 2.9bn tonnes - enough to last for nearly 30 years at present production rates. Gas discoveries last year reached 165bn cu m. Development of Oil and Gas Resources of the UK. PO Box 30, Alton, Hants GU34 4PX.</p>

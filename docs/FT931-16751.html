			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / A rebound with risks: Japan's economy is set to recover in 1993 - Forecast 1993 There are two outstanding features of Japan's current recession. One is the gross national product gap, the difference bet-ween potential and actual GNP, and the other is the sharp deterioration of financial institutions' balance sheets. The GNP gap is widening rapidly. There is a simultaneous decline in investment in manufacturing, commercial business construction and consumer durable goods. All three sectors are now suffering from excessive stocks, and all are victims of the deflation of Japan's 'bubble' economy of the 1980s. Falling investment is partly the result of an increase in capital costs. Whereas companies could raise funds through the issue of equity at an abnormally low cost of about 1 per cent during the late 1980s, the decline of the stock market has confronted companies with higher financing costs. In the corporate bond market, for example, the cost of capital is about 5 per cent. The plunge in prices of stocks and land has hit consumer demand, and contributed to a sharp increase in real estate-related bankruptcies. The value of these bankruptcies has climbed steadily over the past two years, reaching a record for the post-war period. The sharp fall in stock prices, which saw the Nikkei index fall by 26 per cent last year, has threatened financial institutions by undermining their ability to meet the Bank for International Settlements requirement of an 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio by the end of March 1993. However, it has become increasingly clear that the more important culprit in weakening banks' balance sheets has been the decline of land prices and the widespread uncertainty over real estate price trends in the future. As a result, there has been an accumulation of non-performing assets at the banks and an increase in defaults by their clients. There is much speculation about the magnitude of this problem, but the scale is large enough to make commercial banks worried about the adequacy of their own capital, regardless of the BIS regulations. Meanwhile, deferred interest payments and the writing-off of bad assets are also large enough to erode the bulk of banks' gross profits. In these conditions, financial institutions have naturally become risk-averse in their lending policies. One result is that there is little increase in money supply, and only a small increase in bank lending - in other words, a credit crunch. Bank loans for small and medium-scale enterprises are stagnant, which is unusual. In past recessions, banks vigorously extended loans to such enterprises, allowing them to play a leading role in the recovery from recession. The Japanese government recognised the unique features of the current recession, and launched a comprehensive Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.6bn) spending package in August. As a result, government investment in public works will increase by 13 per cent in the year to the end of March 1993. Government loans for private housing at low interest rates are already contributing to a recovery in residential construction. In sharp contrast to private institutions, government financial institutions have been extending loans to small and medium-scale enterprises. The value of such loans is currently growing at an annual rate of 6 to 7 per cent. At the same time, the government has been increasing its procurement of land in an attempt to stimulate real estate transactions. Given the government policy package, what are the prospects for the Japanese economy? Two groups of forces are at work, but pulling in different directions. One is the government-supported expansion of public investment and housing development, and the other is sluggish activity by the manufacturing, commercial building, construction and consumer sectors, which is depressing economic growth. Only during 1993 will the successful adjustment of capital stock levels reduce these negative forces, leading to a recovery of final demand. Private economists forecast that real GNP growth will reach about 2.7 per cent for fiscal 1993, compared with 1.6 per cent for this year. The present slump is expected to bottom out in the first half of fiscal 1993, and be followed by a second-half recovery which will be sluggish. But there are two risks. First, will an unemployment problem eventually emerge? Second, could the expansion of Japan's trade surplus cause fresh conflict with the new US administration? If weak final demand further threatens the labour market, the government should consider the introduction of income tax cuts, combined with the promise of an increase in consumption tax a few years later. This value-added tax now stands at 3 per cent. The policy combination would meet two requirements simultaneously, providing a shorter-term stimulus of demand, and achieving the medium-term target of transferring the country's tax collection system from direct to indirect taxes. It would also help to contain the budget deficit. Strong political leadership is required for this simultaneous commitment. It is also clear that short-term interest rates should be lower than during a normal recession to ease the shortages of capital and credit. On the trade front, Japan's surplus has expanded rapidly over the past year and a half. It is often assumed that the recession must be responsible for this expansion, by depressing demand for imports. But more than 80 per cent of the surplus is due to more favourable terms of trade for Japan because of the appreciation of the yen and to reduced 'financial transactions'. For example, export prices in dollar terms are higher, and the price of imported petroleum has declined. In addition, a sharp decline in gold imports has added to the surplus. A recovery of the US economy will certainly enlarge the external imbalances of both the US and Japan. This will create a pattern in which the additional shortage of US domestic savings required for that country's recovery and growth will be financed by the further expansion of Japan's surplus. How these larger external imbalances are perceived and dealt with by the new US administration is just one of the uncertainties facing Japan in the coming year.

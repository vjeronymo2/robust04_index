			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 7 KYODO -- Both Japan and Germany  should be given permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, a  panel of some 40 Japanese and U.S. academics, diplomats and  U.N. executives said Wednesday [6 April]. This would make up  for an increasingly serious shortage of U.N. resources, such as  peacemaking personnel, financial resources, and other means  needed to keep or enforce peace in conflict-torn areas, it said  in a 16-page report.    The panel, formed by the United Nations Association of the  United States (UNA-USA) and the Asia-Pacific Association of  Japan (APA), said U.N. authorization of military force should be  a last resort and relatively rare, but once decided should be  carried out efficiently, effectively and professionally. "To  accomplish this, however, will entail major improvements in  command and control procedures, in training, in the preparatory  earmarking of troops...and supplies, and in the provision of  financial support," it said.    Pointing to the need for a further use of U.N. peacekeeping  activities, it urged that member states "contribute to the  strengthening of that capability."    To resolve the problem of financial constraints on the U.N.  peacemaking budget, it urged all member states to "explore the  possibility of paying the U.N. peacekeeping assessments from  their defense budgets."    The panel also recommended Japan and the U.S. "maintain  close  cooperation on all U.N.-related matters, particularly those  involving the Security Council." To this end, it recommended  that "American and Japanese representatives meet regularly in  New York and consult on outstanding U.N. issues."    The report acknowledged, however, the U.N. difficulty, due  to  its financial and personnel limitations, in living up to the  expectations from the international community to ensure peace.    It expressed understanding of arguments by some U.S.  intellectuals that the U.S. forces should keep its independence  of command from U.N. peacekeeping operations in enforcing peace.  "We fully acknowledge that not all of the suspicion and  resistance, if not outright opposition, to U.N.-led  multilateralism derives from selfishness and shortsightedness,"  the report said.    "There are genuine dilemmas that we must face up to and  resolve," it said, adding that it hopes the report's  recommendations will "provide some impetus for overcoming these  dilemmas."    The report, titled, "Addressing the New Challenge, Regional  Crisis Management and the United Nations" and based on two and a  half years of research, was drafted under the co-chairmanship of  Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and  Ryukichi Imai, former Japanese ambassador to the U.N. Geneva  Disarmament Conference.    The UNA-USA urged the U.S. State Department to implement its  recommendations to bolster the capability of the U.N. to restore  peace in various conflict-marred regions at a time when the U.S.  is increasingly loath to police such trouble spots.    The institution is a private research group dedicated to  strengthening the U.N. and enhancing U.S. participation in it.  The APA is a quasigovernmental research group affiliated with  the Japanese Foreign Ministry.</p>

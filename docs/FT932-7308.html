			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Hotels in Americas see better prospects HOTELIERS in the Americas are gaining confidence, but Europeans and Asians say prospects are gloomy, according to a survey by leisure consultants Horwath International. It found that 54 per cent of North American hoteliers were more optimistic than they were six months ago, with only 8 per cent saying they were less optimistic. In Latin America, 70 per cent were more optimistic and none was less. In Europe, only 20 per cent said they were more optimistic than six months ago, with 38 per cent saying they were more pessimistic. This was an improvement, however, over six months ago, when 10 per cent were optimistic and 48 per cent pessimistic. In the Asia-Pacific region, the optimistic proportion shrank to 33 per cent from 36 per cent six months ago. However, the pessimistic proportion also fell - from 33 per cent to 15 per cent. With the exception of North America, hoteliers worldwide said they had reduced their workforces and would continue to do so. In Europe, 68 per cent of hotels said they had reduced employee numbers over the past six months and 39 per cent said they would do so over the next six. Only 2 per cent said they had increased staffing levels over the past six months and only 13 per cent said they would do so over the next six months. More than 40 per cent of Asian hotels had reduced workforces and nearly half intended to do so in the next six months. Even in Latin America, half the hoteliers said they had fewer workers than they had six months ago and 20 per cent said this trend would continue in the next six months. Only in North America were staff numbers expected to rise, and then only slightly. Staff increases were planned by 24 per cent, with 23 per cent planning reductions in the next six months.</p>

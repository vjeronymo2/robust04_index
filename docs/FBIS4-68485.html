			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar </F> Republic Executive Committee"]    [Text] Dear Comrades!    The appeal of the republic assembly of representatives of  the  Balkar community to the peoples, political parties, and public  associations was perceived by the Communist Party of the  republic with approval.    The communists of Kabardino-Balkaria consistently advocate  with all patriots and internationalists the integrity and unity  of the republic within the indivisible Russian Federation. The  centuries-old friendship and fraternal unity of the Kabarda,  Balkars, Russians, and all other peoples of our republic is the  most valuable property of all that was bequeathed us by our  forefathers. These relations helped us endure in the years of  the wartime adversities, famine, and repression. Only by  preserving them will we overcome the present serious situation  also. The communists support the efforts of the president,  parliament, the government, and all parties and national  movements aimed at preservation of the unity of the  Kabardino-Balkar Republic.    We condemn the irresponsible statements of individual  leaders  of the National Council of the Balkar People concerning the  division of Kabardino-Balkaria and regard them as an attempt to  destabilize the peaceful situation and to incite interethnic  strife in the republic.    The Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic  Executive Committee calls on the working people, communists,  parties, and movements to make every effort to preserve the  unity of Kabardino-Balkaria and peace and tranquillity in our  native home.    [Signed] Communist Party of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic  Executive Committee.    Nalchik    29 March 1994</p>

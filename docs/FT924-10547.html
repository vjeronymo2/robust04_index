			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: City ambushed by Tomkins' latest target - The take-over tactics of Greg Hutchings' cashed up conglomerate FOR THE past year the Tomkins name has rarely been far from takeover rumours that periodically flash around the City. Earnings growth was beginning to slow, possibly to stall; more than two years had elapsed since the last acquisition; and the group had built a handsome Pounds 150m war chest. But when Mr Greg Hutchings' industrial conglomerate yesterday launched a recommended bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, countering a hostile approach from his old boss Lord Hanson, it took City observers by surprise. 'We have a few hard weeks ahead of us to convince people it is not a departure for us,' said Mr Hutchings. Judging by the 19 per cent slide in the Tomkins share price yesterday, the market would seem to be saying Mr Hutchings has some fast talking to do. On the other hand, Mr Hutchings has his record on his side. Since starting to build a conglomerate in 1982, his acquisitions have tended to be infrequent and big, relative to the size of the business. What is more, they have mostly been very good for shareholders. The meteoric rise of Hutchings from the personal staff of Lord Hanson via the 1982 acquisition of a small fasteners company, into chief executive of a FT-SE 100 company has long passed into the history of 1980s acquisition driven growth stocks. But Mr Hutchings is usually credited with trying to build an industrial conglomerate; RHM would take Tomkins far deeper into markets dependent on the foibles of consumers' daily decisions about brands. Mr Hutchings will be trying to remind sceptics that many of his previous acquisitions have also been into markets that he knew nothing about. This is a view echoed by Mr Geoffrey Eaton, Tomkins corporate development manager: 'We are always moving into new markets. When we bought Smith &amp; Wesson, we knew nothing about guns; when we bought Murray Ohio in the US - a loss-making bicycle maker - everyone threw up their hands in horror.' Both have turned out to be good acquisitions. Tomkins' last acquisition, Philips Industries in the US for Dollars 550m, was typical of what people think Tomkins is about. The US company was a widely based industrial group where the management was disenchanted and attempting to put together a buy-out. Prior to that, however, the 1989 acquisition of Murray Ohio for Dollars 224m was closer to consumer markets as was Smith &amp; Wesson, the handgun company bought for Dollars 112m a year earlier. More importantly, most Tomkins' targets display a number of common threads. They tend to be mature, low to medium technology manufacturing companies, and are not in distribution. They usually generate cash but are poorly managed with lacklustre management. RHM, Mr Hutchings says, has many of the same characteristics: 'It is a manufacturing business and a management opportunity.' Another Tomkins characteristic is the ruthless revitalisation strategy. Targets are put swiftly on to the Tomkins' financial reporting system and management is set strictly defined targets for cash and profits generation and return on controllable capital employed. RHM managers, encouraged by the prospect of a more energetic and focused head office might take note of what they are up against. 'RHM has Pounds 1.4bn of costs that we can examine,' says Mr Hutchings. While this strategy has been successful, it has left Tomkins with a growing problem. About 75 per cent of the business is in the US. Quite apart from currency exposure problems, Tomkins is approaching a serious ACT problem as the current mix of businesses do not generate enough UK profits. The UK was therefore the most likely venue for the next acquisition. Market reaction yesterday was varied. Conglomerate followers gave Tomkins the benefit of the doubt because of its successful record. Observers of the food industry, however, were more sceptical. Mr Geoff Allum, at County NatWest, said there were clear reasons why Tomkins would want the deal, not in the least Tomkins' apparent belief that UK economic recovery is not imminent. As a result, there was little point in Tomkins investing in recovery stocks, many of which it believes are still over-priced. Instead Tomkins' tighter control of costs and cash would be one of the few sources of profits growth in the UK. However, Mr Allum said Tomkins has not yet explained how it will lead RHM out of the difficulties facing the bread market and the problems of the milling and baking industry. As a result, Mr Hutchings still has to convince large sectors of the market that Pounds 935m is not too high a price. 'There may be something that can be done if capacity in bread can be reduced,' Mr Allum said. 'But there is no evidence that there is a reasonable strategy to sort out bread.' Tomkins dismisses the scepticism. Baking, Mr Eaton says, is not a business in terminal decline. 'The question is who is going to take out the (excess) capacity,' he says. 'We are profit not market share driven.' Yesterday's share price fall in Tomkins left Mr Hutchings disappointed that his strategy had not been better understood. The question remains whether he will have the leisure to explain the move or whether he will have to deal with a higher counter-offer from his old boss.</p>

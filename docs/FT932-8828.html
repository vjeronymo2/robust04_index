			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Serb mayor confident in Bosnian town where mosques are rubble: Voters go to polls in referendum on peace plan BRANKO GRUJIC, the Serb mayor of Zvornik, just laughed. He had been asked about the mosques in this once Moslem-dominated eastern Bosnian town on the frontier with Serbia. The mosques are rubble now, reduced to nothing by the Serb forces that seized the town 13 months ago when Mr Grujic re-placed his Moslem predecessor. There is no need for any trace of that Moslem heritage in Zvornik today. Most of the Moslems have fled Zvornik. It was one of the first towns to fall to Serb forces who last spring expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia, killing tens of thousands more in the process. Mayor Grujic called it a 'normal population exchange'. At polling station number two not far from from Mayor Grujic's office, a Serb fighter in camouflage cast his No vote in the Bosnian Serbs' 'referendum' on the international peace plan: 'We will fight to the last Serb.' A wizened old man deposited three voting slips - one for himself, the others for members of his family. Weary refugees who showed identity cards were added to the lists. Voter registration was always going to be a last-minute affair in this hastily convened referendum. Mayor Grujic had no doubts that Bosnia's Serbs would vote against the Vance-Owen plan. After all, it would force them to give back nearly half the territory seized since the war began, including his town. The plan, he said, and threats of military intervention were evidence of a world conspiracy against the Serbs. 'We know the plan was copied from a secret Vatican document.' It proposes to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. If implemented it would put an end to Greater Serbia by cutting off links between Belgrade and Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia. 'We are ready to be hungry, thirsty, and naked, but at the end of the war we will have our Srpska Republika,' said Mayor Grujic. Srpska Republika is the self-styled Serb state which covers about two-thirds of Bosnia. A second question in the referendum asks voters whether they are 'for' or 'against' an independent state with the right to unite with other peoples and states. There should be little difficulty getting a Yes vote for that one. Two teenage Serb refugees on their way to Janja, a mostly Moslem village 30 miles north of Zvornik, stopped off to vote. They accused Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic of betraying Bosnian Serbs by supporting the peace plan. The voting lists in the local fire station revealed some Moslem voters had cast ballots. An official said everyone was being allowed to vote, regardless of nationality. But Munir, a Moslem, nervously admitted he did not vote. 'They did not tell us to,' he said. In nearby Bijelina, most voters were opposed to the plan even though it designates that rich north-eastern town to be a Serbian province. Mr Pero Simic, a local journalist, said voters were divided because of appeals by their Belgrade patrons to back the plan. 'We share more with Belgrade than with our brothers in Banja Luka,' he said. Banja Luka is the bastion of Serb radicalism in north-western Bosnia. The only 'yes' voter encountered anywhere by this correspondent was a Moslem woman. 'We all want the war to end. I am voting for peace.' she said and hurried away. Bosnia peace plan 'may be enforced', Page 3</p>

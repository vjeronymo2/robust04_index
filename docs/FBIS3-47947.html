Leaders of both ruling coalition parties and the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party were continuing their efforts to  persuade rebel members within their camps to vote in line with  their parties' policies.    Hosokawa has reiterated his resolve to stake his political  future on the package of four bills designed to introduce a  combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation in the House of Representatives.    Failure to pass the bills could lead to Hosokawa's  resignation or dissolution of the lower house for a general  election, many political analysts said.    If enacted, the package could consolidate the political  power  base of Hosokawa, whose seven-party coalition government broke  the LDP's 38-year grip on power last August, and trigger further  realignments in the country's political arena, they said.    The seven coalition parties have a total of 131 seats in the  252-member upper chamber while the opposition LDP, the Japanese  Communist Party and Niin Club have 115. A simple majority of  the full house is 126.    More than 10 upper house members of the Social Democratic  Party (SDP), the largest force in the coalition government,  however, have expressed opposition to the package, fearing the  introduction of single-seat electoral districts in the lower  house might deal a severe blow to the party.    Some LDP members are also expected to defy the party  leadership and vote for the bills.</p>

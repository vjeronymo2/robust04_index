			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Casa chief moves over to Inespal Mr Javier Alvarez Vara, president of the Spanish aerospace company Casa for the past seven years, has been appointed head of Inespal, the aluminium producer. The move is part of a reshuffle of top jobs in Spain's state-owned corporations. In a second move, Mr Manuel Fernandez Garca, a former trade unionist who became chairman of the nationalised capital goods manufacturer Babcock &amp; Wilcox in 1985, has been promoted to head the group of companies that form the industrial backbone of the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), the public-sector holding company. The changes appear to represent an attempt by INI to put its more successful executives into the holding's trouble spots. However, Mr Alvarez and Mr Fernandez will be missed at Casa and Babcock &amp; Wilcox respectively. Both companies have recently returned to profitability after years of losses and are now seen as possible candidates for privatisation. Inespal is forecast to lose between Pta35bn and Pta40bn (Dollars 250m-Dollars 286m) this year on sales of Pta100bn.</p>

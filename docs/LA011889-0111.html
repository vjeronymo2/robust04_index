			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> TASK FORCE ADDRESSES REA CENTER PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Members of a city task force met Tuesday in a continuing effort to resolve  complaints of residents about the number of disabled and needy people who visit  a private relief agency and other social service programs at the Rea Community  Center.  </P> <P> "Parents do not feel safe letting their children walk to school," said Barbara  Littrell, one of three residents on the eight-member task force. According to  Littrell, children have been followed and panhandled by transients near the  center.  </P> <P> Increased crime, traffic and littering were among the eight major complaints of  area residents who responded to a questionnaire, a task force spokesman said.  Solutions proposed to deal with "real and perceived" problems include  relocation of Share Ourselves (SOS), a private anti-poverty agency; changing  bus stops, and increasing police patrols .  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said that while major crimes such as burglaries  and rapes have declined in the area over the last 3 years, there has been an  increase in minor offenses.  </P> <P> "Most of the problems are petty theft or nuisance calls," Kent said. He  explained that the department has increased patrols in the area to address  nuisance complaints such as loitering and sleeping in public places.  </P> <P> Jean Forbath, director of SOS, admitted some problems based on the number of  clients but said that many complaints stem from misconceptions.  </P></p>

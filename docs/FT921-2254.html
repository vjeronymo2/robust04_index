			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / A death in Sicily changes the election landscape in Italy: A cynical public, writes Robert Graham, wants credible explanations, not vague warnings from the Christian Democrats Unflappable and long-used to parrying the most direct questions with sybilline ambiguity, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing Italian prime minister, rarely loses his cool in public. But the killing last Thursday in Palermo of Mr Salvatore Lima, who was Mr Andreotti's friend and the most powerful Christian Democrat politician in Sicily, has provoked his sustained ire. What has pained him most has been renewed talk of his late friend's involvement with the Mafia. Nevertheless, the killing, which magistrates and much of the public assume was on Mafia orders, has not only unsettled Mr Andreotti. It has again brought to the fore, at a most sensitive moment in the country's general election campaign, an assertion in which almost every Italian believes: 'The Mafia never acts without good cause.' The Christian Democrats, and particularly Mr Andreotti, whose faction within the party Mr Lima supported, have to explain why the Mafia might choose to eliminate the man who delivered the party's large Sicilian vote. But, rather than provide a credible explanation, the government has begun to mutter darkly about a plan to destabilise Italy. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Interior issued a circular to the nation's 92 civil governors specifically warning of a campaign to destabilise the elections. Something like this occurred in the 1970s, when Italy faced the prospect of 'an historic compromise' between the Christian Democrats and the Communists. The mainstream opposition, the security services and elements within the Christian Democrats then orchestrated a strategy of tension to confuse the electorate. But the idea that similar forces are now at work has been greeted with widespread cynicism. President Francesco Cossiga, who these days seems to do much of the opposition's work by rejecting his Christian Democrat credentials on the grounds that the party is incapable of instituting urgent institutional reforms, summed up public reaction: 'If anyone thinks a coup is being planned, the plotters should be denounced. Otherwise it's just trouble-making and giving ideas to fiction-writers.' That these issues should be given a public airing has transformed the election campaign and cast a cloud over the political future of Mr Andreotti, who as seven times prime minister has his sights on the presidency after the April 5 poll. It also makes the Christian Democrats ever more awkward allies in what is bound to be a fresh coalition government after the elections. Christian Democrat election strategy until Mr Lima's death was based on the assumption that votes would be lost in the North to the populist Lombard League and the small Republican Party (PRI) but would be offset by gains in the South, especially in Sicily, where old-style political patronage still holds sway. Lombardy and Sicily are the two regions with the largest number of voters. Thus, while in the North the Christian Democrat vote could fall below 30 per cent, it could be above 40 per cent in the South. This would give the party its traditional third of the national vote. It is possible that the Christian Democrats can successfully play on a vote of fear, especially if further prominent killings occur. But the 'fear vote' has always been based on apprehensions in a Catholic country of a Communist-dominated government. As Prof Paul Ginsborg wrote in his study of contemporary Italian politics: 'To hold power in the face of the (Communist) enemy became almost an end in itself, to which essential reforms were to be subordinated.' However, the threat no longer exists, and the electorate knows, as the government has also been saying in its saner moments, that the challenge is to create the conditions for convergence with Europe. The killing has also exposed another uncomfortable reality: the dependence of the Christian Democrats and, to a lesser extent, their Socialist partners on organised crime for part of their vote in the South. As much as 10 per cent of the vote in the South is reckoned to be controlled directly by organised crime with a further 25 per cent 'tainted,' according to a recent article by the weekly newspaper Il Mundo. In other words, while the state is formally at war with the Mafia, at the level of local politics, a complicity exists. This state of affairs led Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former Christian Democrat mayor of Palermo, to break with his party in Sicily (controlled by Mr Lima) and form a rival grouping campaigning for clean government, La Rete (The Network). The latter picked up 8 per cent of the vote in last year's regional elections in Sicily and could be a significant beneficiary of the Lima affair. The impact of the Lima affair also has to be seen in the context of a ruling party riven by internal factions and run by a diminishing number of political heavyweights. An ageing and tarnished Andreotti leaves only Mr Arnoldo Forlani, the party secretary, and Mr Ciriaco de Mita, the president, as experienced players with significant support bases. The sole new blood is Mr Mario Segni, the son of a former president, who is pledged to carry out a series of referendums on institutional reform on a cross-party basis. And it is not clear how long Mr Segni will choose to remain inside the party. Although the Christian Democrats continue to control the levers of power, from 4,163 of the 8,100 mayors, to the security services and the major state corporations, the present circumstances do not afford a comfortable base on which to fight an election and defend a record of 46 years' uninterrupted government.</p>

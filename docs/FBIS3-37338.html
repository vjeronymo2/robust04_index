According to Interfax's sources, Hryb emphasized that the  Supreme Soviet, which is to be convened one of these days, would  discuss a new Constitution, in particular the state structure.    He promised the delegation that the petition he had from  them  would be discussed at the next Thursday's meeting of the Supreme  Soviet presidium.    People's Deputy Sergey Antonchik, a strike committee member,  said that the indefinite strike in the republic was continuing.  The next rally will be held on Independence Square in Minsk on  February 22, when parliament is scheduled to be reconvened.    Our correspondent in Minsk reports that the rally, attended  by a crowd of about 6000, has moved from Independence Square to  outside the parliament building.    Now the rally demands that the national strike committee be  given 15 minutes on the television immediately after the evening  news program, reinstatement Vladimir Yegorov as interior  minister as well as resignation of the cabinet and dissolution  of parliament.    Yegorov had been dismissed for allowing the arrest and  removal to Vilnius of Lithuanian communist leaders Mikolas  Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius.    Belarusian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Platonov told  Interfax that no trouble had erupted during the rally or march  towards the parliament building.    He did not rule out the possibility, however, that "measures  will be taken" against strike committee activists. For one  thing, they had staged a rally on Independence Square where no  public events other than national holidays can be held. What is  more, the rally had not been authorized.    Platonov also said that the activities of the committees  were  illegal because it had not been officially registered.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPAIN PROBING DREXEL UNIT'S ROLE IN DEAL  </P> <P> Spanish securities regulators are investigating a unit of the U.S. brokerage  firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. over allegations that it misrepresented itself  in the stock sale of the petroleum giant Repsol SA, a report published  Wednesday said.  </P> <P> The newspaper El Pais quoted unnamed sources from the National Securities  Commission as alleging that last spring Drexel sold Repsol shares intended for  small investors to a few large private institutions.  </P> <P> The newspaper's sources said Drexel requested an estimated $59.8 million in  shares of the state-controlled Repsol to be sold to 400 investors. But they  claimed that on May 11, the first day of public trading, Drexel improperly sold  the shares to a small number of large private investors, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> There was no comment on the report at Drexel's Spanish office.  </P> <P> However, Repsol issued a statement late Wednesday denying that Drexel formed  part of the syndicate of 48 brokerages or investment firms that took part in  the stock sale.  </P> <P> "Drexel Burnham Lambert did not form part of the offering, thus, there has been  no relation at all between that firm and Repsol," it said. "Repsol has  cooperated since the start of the (commission's) investigation (in early June)  and based on its outcome will then take the appropriate legal action."  </P> <P> Between April 20 and May 6, Repsol, Europe's eighth-largest petroleum company,  sold 79.75 million shares at $14.70 each to 400,000 shareholders worldwide.  </P> <P> The company sold 44 million of the total shares offered to individual Spanish  shareholders under a prorated system.  </P> <P> El Pais said the sources confirmed that the commission had contacted at least  10 of the 400 investors Drexel had identified as original buyers. They said  they knew nothing about ordering the purchase of Repsol shares.  </P> <P> El Pais said if Drexel used the names of investors without their consent, the  brokerage could face criminal fraud charges.  </P></p>

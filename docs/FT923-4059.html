			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Killings at Bisho SLOWLY BUT surely the prospect of a stable, democratic South Africa is moving out of reach. The circumstances of the June massacre in Boipatong and Monday's slaughter in Bisho differ widely, but are the symptoms of the same malaise - politically motivated violence. The latest tragedy underlines the need for a speedy implementation of the Security Council's plan for a UN observer team intended to help avert such tragedies and revive the stalled peace process. No party emerges from the Bisho killings with clean hands. The overwhelming burden of blame clearly rests on Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, leader of the nominally independent homeland of Ciskei. Yet Brig Gqozo is also a creature of apartheid, and Pretoria remains the puppet master. President FW de Klerk's denial of responsibility on the grounds that the massacre did not take place on South African soil, and that it was Ciskei soldiers who were in charge, is disingenuous. A similar march in July nearly ended in bloodshed; intervention by South African security forces might have prevented Monday's massacre. But it is the tactics of the ANC that deserve to come under the most critical scrutiny. What was its objective in marching on Bisho? If it was to parade the party banner in an important constituency, where Brig Gqozo's regime has tried to suppress opposition, it was a legitimate albeit risky exercise. There seems little doubt, however, that for some demonstrators, notably senior members of the South African Communist party, it was an intoxicating opportunity to storm the barricades, at the risk of deaths, to give impetus to the mass action campaign that fizzled out after its launch last month. The rhetoric of these radicals obscures reality. Mr de Klerk is too weak to govern effectively; but he remains too strong to be overthrown - or allow the ANC to overthrow homeland leaders. Corrupt and authoritarian as most of the homeland 'governments' are, they are a fact of life, notwithstanding the political fantasy of their claims to independence. They perform practical administrative roles, responsible for education, health, housing and other services. A post-apartheid government must live with - and work through - the administrative structures now in place. But unless the ANC is prepared to countenance bloodshed on a scale far exceeding the massacre in Bisho, the future of the homelands must be determined at the negotiating table. The appropriate formula has in fact already been accepted at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the multi-party negotiating forum which reached deadlock last May. Nearly all homeland leaders agreed in principle to referenda which would offer the choice of independence or re-incorporation into South Africa. But the homelands are secondary to the fundamental issue: how to relaunch negotiations on reconciling majority rule and minority rights. And here the outlook was not without hope before the latest tragedy. Although piecemeal and tardy, the government's response to the ANC's terms for the resumption of talks, broken off after the Boipatong killing, had appeared to open the way for renewed negotiations. The Bisho massacre makes the need for such talks even more pressing.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / German strike talks to resume today TALKS aimed at ending the 10-day-old public sector strike in Germany were adjourned last night until today, with no sign of a promised new offer from the employers. Union officials and representatives of federal, state and local authorities had just a brief meeting in Stuttgart after four hours of separate consultations by the two sides. 'We stood next to each other and did not have anything to say,' Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the largest public service union, oTV, told reporters. Negotiators said they would meet this morning for 'further exploratory talks'. The Bonn government's chief negotiator, Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, added: 'We will have lots of time then.' Hopes had been raised by the public sector employers' indications that they would make a new offer to try to end what is already western Germany's most disruptive wave of industrial action since the Second World War. They previously offered a 4.8 per cent pay rise, while the unions originally demanded a 9.5 per cent increase. Ms Wulf-Mathies, said before the talks less than the 5.4 per cent proposed recently by arbitrators would be rejected. Both sides hinted earlier this week that a deal limiting wage rises for top earners and giving more to the lower-paid might be the best way forward. According to trade union estimates, more than 500,000 workers in both public and private sectors were on strike yesterday. While leading economists suggested that the stoppages would have to last at least a month before having any noticeable effects on economic output, tangible evidence of the strike's effects continued to mount. The national railway network was within days of collapse, a Bundesbahn official said. Only a quarter of its locomotives were still in service and losses had already reached DM100m (Pounds 34m). In Cologne 120 wagons of mail were standing in sidings. In Frankfurt an estimated 13,000 tonnes of uncollected refuse was piled in streets. At the same time unrest grew in the private sector. About 75,000 members of the IG Metall engineering workers' union defied threats of a lock-out and continued warning strikes as it became clear that employers were not yet prepared to increase their 3.3 per cent pay offer. IG Metall leaders will meet next Tuesday to decide on their next step. Building workers, members of the IG Bau union, threatened a work-to-rule until employers improved their 3.4 per cent offer. Printers demanding an 11 per cent increase continued token protests. Prof Hans Schneider, chairman of the 'five wise men', the group of leading independent economic advisers to the government, warned of dangerous consequences for the economy if the talks led to excessive pay rises. However, he added, a 5.5 per cent overall deal 'would not be the end of the world'. He agreed with the respected Ifo economics institute in Munich that a full month's stoppage in the public sector, with an average of 300,000 workers striking daily would cut the year's GDP growth by only between 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Levitskiy report: "Estonia Secretly Issues Its </F> Passports to Russian Citizens...and Accuses Russian Foreign  Ministry of Slander"]    [Text] Tallinn -- The Estonian State Assembly has adopted  a statement-appeal to UN member states. The parliamentarians  make a resolute protest against intensifying imperialist trends  in Russia's foreign policy, according to which the Baltic states  are included in Russia's sphere of influence. Statements made  by Russian Government members directed against the Estonian  state contravene the provisions of the UN Charter and the CSCE  Final Act....    The parliamentary statement was preceded by an Estonian  Foreign Ministry statement assessing as slanderous utterances by  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev about serious violations  of human rights in Estonia and Latvia and ethnic cleansing in  these countries....    A sentence spoken by Russian Foreign Ministry Information  and  Press Department spokesman Mikhail Demurin, to the effect that  diplomatic resources alone are not enough to support Russians in  CIS and Baltic countries, has provoked indignation among both  politicians and diplomats. President Lennart Meri summoned  Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov and demanded an  explanation for the latest statement by the Russian Foreign  Ministry leaders. President Meri's press service made the  following statement: Estonian reality has nothing to do with the  picture that radical-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are trying  to paint. The "Russian threat" has rallied the parliament, the  president, and the prime minister, who were in sharp conflict  with each other until recently. Such anti-Russian tension is  perhaps unprecedented in Estonia. It is as though a detonator  has been activated to explode a charge of passions that had been  stored up for a long time.    The Russian Embassy press service circulated the full text  of  Mikhail Demurin's statement: On the Foreign Ministry's  initiative, a program to protect the interests of ethnic  Russians abroad and give them support is being prepared. This  envisages special television and radio broadcasting,  humanitarian aid, support for Russian business and enterprises  in which the Russian-speaking population is employed,  collaboration in banking, and customs and economic privileges.  That is why, Demurin says, diplomatic efforts and resources are  insufficient -- decisions and active support from the Russian  Government are needed.    Why is the story of the planned program perceived as a  threat  in Estonia? Surely it is not just because the Russian  Government intends to help Russians to settle down more firmly  in the countries where they have found themselves at the whim of  fate, and does not intend to remove them back to their ethnic  homeland?</p>

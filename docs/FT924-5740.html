			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Corporate body shapes up to a tougher regime: German industry was caught off guard by the downturn but it is doing more than just shedding jobs GERMAN industry has been cutting the fat for the best part of a year. Now it is trying to tone up the slenderised body corporate. Workforces and wage bills, bloated by the need to keep up with demand in the boom that followed reunification, are still being squeezed back into shape. But as employers face up to the prospect of forced redundancies, they are also starting to look for economies from restructuring. The need for further action from companies has become clear in the past few days with the release of a series of grim third-quarter figures. Daimler-Benz set the tone with an out-of-the-blue 'background briefing', forecasting that full-year profits would fall by almost a quarter. It was preparing the ground for an interim report which showed an 8 per cent fall at the nine-month mark, caused by unexpected upsets in its main profits source, Mercedes-Benz. Then came the three big chemicals groups: Hoechst, down 19 per cent; BASF, down 45 per cent; and Bayer, off a mere 16 per cent. Metallgesellschaft's full-year result from its mining and industrial activities was 23 per cent lower. Engineering giant Mannesmann will shortly enlarge on this week's advance warning of 'considerably lower' nine-month earnings. Volkswagen, reporting yesterday, said that, after a 13 per cent drop in profits in the first nine months, the outlook for the fourth quarter had worsened 'drastically'. The company hinted that it may cut its dividend. German industry, as Daimler's interim report suggested, has been caught off guard by the suddenness and severity of the third quarter downturn. In the spring the group had promised an 'excellent' result, and profits were ahead 16 per cent after six months. Part of the problem stems from miscalculations of the timing of international recovery - an appearance billed for September this year has now been postponed to some time in 1993. Part lies with devaluations in important export countries and the consequent losses in translation of sales and earnings to D-Marks. According to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman of Bayer, currency fluctuations cost his group DM904m (Pounds 373.5m) on its sales figure for the first nine months and more than DM100m in profits. But as results from the groups' German-based parent companies showed, the domestic slowdown has played a considerable role. These ranged from a 73 per cent slump in the BASF parent, to 28 per cent at Hoechst and 27 per cent at VW. Against this background, the leading lights of German industry are doing more than simply shedding jobs. Marginal and loss-making operations are being shut or sold. Mergers and collaborations of every kind are being discussed and even management is being squeezed. Accelerated job cuts at Bayer - more than 6,000 will go this year - have so far kept the increase in the group's wage costs to less than 1 per cent. But, as Mr Schneider said, there are 'some structural problems' in sectors where German manufacturers were losing or had already lost the ability to compete. An unspecified number of production facilities in the dyes and inorganic chemicals business would have to be closed, he said. At Hoechst, meanwhile, the PVC business - another area facing murderous price competition in over-supplied world markets - is to be merged with that of Wacker-Chemie in an attempt to gain critical mass. According to Hoechst, the deal would give the combined group a 10 per cent share of west European production capacity. BASF, in another consolidation move aimed at making 'considerable savings', said yesterday that its computer services division was to close 16 of its centres. The workload, at present spread around 10 European countries, would be concentrated in three centres: two in Ludwigshafen and one in Antwerp. Earlier this week the group announced the closure of unprofitable oilfields and the disbanding of its composite materials division and said it was considering collaboration with others in the field of magnetic audio and video tapes. At Daimler-Benz, where plans were recently unveiled to streamline the headquarters of its AEG subsidiary, reducing staff from 940 to less than 200, the same subsidiary is talking hard with Siemens on a project possibly to merge the two groups' railway interests. Siemens seems to have bucked the downward trend of big German companies. Difficult, long-term industrial issues, with implications reaching far beyond the foreseeable limits of the international recession, are being debated with unusual vigour and acted on with characteristic caution. Structural measures undertaken so far are minor in comparison with the radical changes imposed in other industrialised countries. Industry seems unwilling to cut deeper until it has clearer indicators of how deep, long and damaging the current downturn will be. In the meantime, it may hope with some justification that Bonn will at last respond to its long-running appeals for relief from what it considers the competitive disadvantages imposed by federal policies. Long-awaited corporate taxation reforms, for example, are already under way. There are also signs of growing conviction in government departments outside the environment ministry that the rigorous rules on nature protection are undermining investment prospects in both sides of the country. According to Bayer's Mr Schneider, all industry wanted of Bonn was that it should ensure that business could operate under the same competitive conditions as its international rivals. The conviction that Germany's players already feel fit enough to compete, and all that remains is for the government to level the playing field, seems unshakeable. Volkswagen results, Page 26</p>

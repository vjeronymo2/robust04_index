			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Lamont shifts emphasis of economic monitoring MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday announced two fundamental shifts of emphasis in the Treasury's monitoring of the economy. In a speech to the annual convention of the Institute of Directors, Mr Lamont acknowledged that official economic data would continue to signal that the UK was in recession in spite of the output recovery expected to begin in the second half of the year. At the same time, underlying inflation - as measured by the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments and the community charge - would be 'meaningless in the coming year' as a result of the changes to the poll tax and VAT announced in the Budget. To track underlying inflation, the Treasury would monitor closely the RPI less mortgage interest payments. That would recognise the largely offsetting nature of the partial taxation switch from community charge to VAT and exclude the volatility from changes in interest rates. To assess the shape of the recovery, the Treasury would focus on anecdotal surveys of consumer and business confidence, as they had given the best early warnings of the recession which started in the middle of last year. In general, forecasts - which rely more on economic statistics - failed to predict the recession. Mr Lamont said he was sceptical towards forecasts but had a lot of respect for data. Lagging indicators of the economy - such as unemployment figures - would continue to signal recession for some time after the recovery had begun.</p>

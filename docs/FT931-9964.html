			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LME COPPER prices were depressed by Tuesday's unconvincing chart close, and eased back under stale bull liquidation. News that Polish copper miners had called off a strike alert underlined bearish sentiment. ZINC fell below important support around Dollars 1,110 for three-month metal, undermined by the absence of further production cut news. ALUMINIUM went into reverse after news of an unexpected 17,000 tonne rise in December IPAI producer stocks. Also, there is heavy technical resistance above Dollars 1,240 for three-month metal. NICKEL eased under technical liquidation, lacking follow-through to recent investment fund interest. But prices held stable around the lows. Robusta COFFEE futures finished with gains of Dollars 17 to Dollars 25 a tonne on key positions, but were below the day's highs as the market continued to be highly volatile. Dealers said technical factors remained dominant. Conditions remained very nervous and the threat of a resumed downtrend remained. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WISCONSIN;  </P> <P> APOLOGY ISSUED FOR MASSACRE OF INDIANS  </P> <P> Sac and Fox Indians received an apology from Wisconsin for the 1832 Bad Axe  Massacre during which hundreds of their tribal predecessors were killed while  trying to flee white pursuers. "I thank you, sir," Elmer Manatowa of Stroud,  Okla., chief of the Sac-Fox nation told a state legislator who presented a  proclamation of apology from the Wisconsin Assembly during a ceremony at the  battle site near Victory, Wis. Known as the Black Hawk War, the pursuit of the  fleeing Indians and the riverside massacre by soldiers, state militia and  settlers was described as "one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad history of  American-Indian relations."  </P></p>

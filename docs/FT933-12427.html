			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Spanish government believes peseta can ride out the storm THE peseta yesterday traded just below its central parity in the European exchange rate mechanism, reinforcing the Spanish government's belief that if the ERM holds together the currency should be able to ride out the storm. Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy and finance minister who took office last week in a government reshuffle, said the peseta was resisting well the attacks on the French franc and the Danish krone. 'I do not think that there are reasons for a fourth devaluation (of the peseta),' Mr Solbes told El Pais yesterday. The Bank of Spain took a similar bullish view at yesterday morning's certificate repo tender. Confident that the peseta could defend itself without recourse to interest rate rises, the central bank kept its key money rate unchanged at 11 per cent. By early afternoon the currency was trading at Pta80.20 against the D-Mark, just over half a peseta down on the previous day's close. On Thursday the peseta slid through its central parity of Pta79.11 against the D-Mark for the first time since its 8 per cent devaluation on May 13 - its third realignment within the ERM since September. The peseta has a 6 per cent band within the ERM grid and it remains well off its Pta84 floor. 'We're in the middle of the band. So what's the problem?' said Mr Jaime Pinies, chief of research at Banco Santander de Negocios. Analysts said that if the ERM overcame its present turmoil, there could be renewed confidence in the peseta as the main features of Mr Solbes' economic policy filtered through to the markets. In his interview the minister spoke of budget austerity, case-by-case privatisations and a pact with unions to cap salary increases. 'Speculators who are taking forward positions on the peseta are taking a big risk,' said Mr Ignacio Montejo, chief economist at Madrid brokers FG. Echoing a widely shared view that the currency's value was properly corrected in the May devaluation, Mr Montejo said the peseta was 'cheap' as soon as it fell below its central parity in the grid.</p>

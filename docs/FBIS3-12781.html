A statement  issued by the Foreign Office in Islamabad today said the  government appreciates the role played by the United States in  achieving this result and is confident that this accord, which  follows closely the cease-fire concluded by the Bosnian  Government and Croats last week, would bring about a lasting  reconciliation between the two communities. The statement said  the agreement reached in Washington between the Bosnian  Government and the Croat community would mark a significant step  toward a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Bosnian  conflict. Pakistan also welcomes the positive role played by  the Russian Government in the reopening of the Tuzla airport,  making possible humanitarian aid to the city.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE CAR MAKERS  </P> <P> James Risen's article "Why Can't America Catch Up?" (Part A, Jan. 14) strikes a  familiar note. I know of a U.S. auto maker whose products lack "reliability and  overall quality."  </P> <P> I got royally stung. I was sold a vehicle by Ford whose paint began to fall off  one year after purchase. It had been applied incorrectly at the factory,  according to written testimony by numerous auto body technicians. Yet Ford  refuses to correct the error. The board room executives of this company are  more interested in profit margins and in buying up defunct savings and loans to  gain huge tax advantages than in turning out quality products. Ford's slogan  "quality is job one" is a sham and an insult to consumers.  </P> <P> I was formerly a staunch buy-American advocate; now my dollar vote will go to  Japanese auto makers. Wake up and catch up, American auto makers! Your  existence depends on us, the consumers.  </P> <P> MAGNUS P. STUDER  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

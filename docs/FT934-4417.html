			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Gyllenhammar goes down with deal  -Christopher Brown-Humes on the fall of Volvo's controversial chief If Volvo stumbles, the tremors are felt elsewhere in Swedish society,' Pehr Gyllenhammar once wrote. Yesterday Volvo did stumble and the tremors brought down with them the man who had led the group for the last 22 years. Only three months ago it would have been impossible to credit. Then PG, as he is known in Sweden, looked set to crown a glittering and controversial career by assuming the figurehead role at the top of Renault-Volvo. Since then a massive shareholder revolt, characterised by strong personal criticism of Mr Gyllenhammar himself, has changed everything, so it was not surprising that when the deal collapsed its principal architect should fall with it. Along with Mr Percy Barnevik, the head of Asea Brown Boveri, Mr Gyllenhammar, 58, can claim to be Sweden's best known industrialist. But he was never content just to be a businessman. As the head of Scandinavia's biggest industrial group and a passionate advocate of Swedish membership of the European Union, he relished a broader role as both a statesman and an ambassador for his country. Sometimes it seemed that both Volvo and Sweden were too small for his restless energy. This energy manifested itself in a number of ways. On the one hand, he always seemed to have some ambitious new deal on the go, despite the setbacks he not infrequently suffered with his plans. On the other hand, he never shied away from controversy and often seemed eager to question long-standing Swedish taboos. He focused the national debate on Swedish membership of the European Union well before the country had even applied to join, and talked about the need for free market reforms before the country became serious about adopting them. His success and his outspokenness provoked admiration and envy in equal degrees. Some were infuriated by his arrogance and his domineering style. Others were compelled by his charm. If the business community often derided him, Swedish people were certainly won over. His critics are only too anxious to reel off the Gyllenhammar deals that never were. They include a plan to merge with Saab-Scania, Volvo's domestic rival; a scheme to sell a 40 per cent holding in Volvo to the Norwegian government in return for North Sea oil rights; and a SKr5bn co-operation pact with Fermenta, the pharmaceuticals group. The setbacks continued last year when a plan to take over Procordia was rebuffed outright by the Swedish government and when two car plants which pioneered 'humane' production techniques were forced to close down. For PG, the deal with Renault looked ideal, enabling him to fuse his pan-European ambitions with his role as Sweden's industrial statesman. A fluent French speaker who holds the Legion d'Honneur, it was obvious he would revel in the position of chairman of the supervisory board of the combined concern. Again, his critics say this ambition blinded him to the deficiencies in the accord which shareholders have picked on so relentlessly in recent weeks. A suspicion that the deal was effectively put together by just Mr Gyllenhammar and Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer - with other Volvo board members remaining in the dark on some aspects of it - was never far from the surface. This and Mr Gyllenhammar's cavalier attitude to shareholders help to explain why criticism at times centred as much on the Volvo chief's handling of the Renault agreement, as it did on details of the accord. Many thought the great survivor might pull something out of the bag to save both the Renault deal and himself, even at the last minute. It was not to be.</p>

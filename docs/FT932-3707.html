			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays In recent years, English China Clays has developed a reputation for doing the right thing without ever really delivering the right result. Its latest significant shift in acquiring a US speciality chemicals business for Pounds 202m and pressing ahead with the demerger of its construction materials division may do little to alter that impression. The addition of Calgon undoubtedly makes strategic sense. It broadens ECC's product base while giving Calgon greater access to European markets. But an exit multiple of 24 represents a full price, even though ECC promises the deal will be earnings neutral in its first full year. Thereafter, it may prove tough work squeezing margins higher: Calgon only commands the weak third slot in the US market. The demerger proposal also makes industrial sense but it is not clear that it will create additional shareholder value. Applying a market multiple to ECC's two divisions individually produces a value somewhat shy of its current share price. Moreover, ECC's markets remain dire with paper makers, in particular, bracing themselves for sharp declines in German demand. The other niggle about Calgon is its financing. ECC's new shares, yielding more than 7 per cent, represent an expensive means of raising money. Borrowing dollars from the bank would have been cheaper, although this would have pushed up gearing from 24 per cent to 69 per cent. Lower debt will doubtless make life easier when the demerger proceeds. But shareholders may reflect on the last time ECC tapped them for cash in February 1992. Those who subscribed for new shares at 415p had seen them rise by just 1p by Thursday's close.</p>

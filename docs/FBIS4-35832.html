			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayer sermon by Ayatollyah Yazdi in Tehran </F> on 3 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [Passage omitted: Yazdi praises the virtues and  achievements of Ayatollah Khomeyni]    The esteemed leader [Ayatooal Khamene'i] has made several  speeches at meetings which have very interesting points, which  we have all heard, at meetings with Majlis deputies and dear  guests who came to take part in the ceremonies on the fifth  anniversary of the Imam's death. [passage omitted]    These are the words of the esteemed leader, His Eminence  Ayatollah Khamene'i. [crowd chants slogans in praise of  Khamene'i] After the necessary instructions the nation, the  government, and the country's officials are alert. But that is  not enough. You must be aware and not do anything that would  give the enemy hope. [passage omitted]    As the esteemed leader said, we have never claimed that  there  are no difficulties in the country. Or that there are no  problems in my own sector, the country's judiciary. We would  never claim that.    However, fairness is also a good thing. One must open one's  eyes to see all the tasks which have been accomplished during  the present era when the country is undergoing reconstruction  after freeing itself from the burden of the war and managing to  find the means for its reconstruction. A lot of work has been  carried out in all sectors. In my own area of work, for  instance, why is it that when you sit together you are not  prepared to mention one single positive point about the judicial  apparatus? When a weakness appears in a certain corner, even  though the judiciary has dealt with it and has dismissed the  offender, you still choose to pretend that the individual is  still present in the judiciary, and then tend to judge the whole  apparatus on the basis of that individual. Is this fair?    When the eminent leader says that you should not do anything  which could inspire hope among the enemies, he is obviously  referring to such things. That is to say overlooking the  positive points at a time when the officials of the country are  working hard and rendering their services. When we review the  situation in this country, we see all our means of oversight and  scrutiny, as well as all our honorable, faithful, pious and  religious judges, who constitute high-ranking strata in the  society and are engaged in their works with such integrity,  sincerity and piety.    However, you still tend to pay attention to a particular  judge whom we have already arrested on the basis of a special  warrant without letting everyone know about it -- as we dealt  with the matter in a confidential manner and only informed those  whom we had to inform. We have arrested and sacked this judge,  and we have also clarified his charges and forced him to pay  back to the public funds that he had embezzled. However, when a  number of individuals sit together, they still tend to say that  the judicial power is such and such.    This was an example from my own area of work. The situation  regarding the esteemed government is very much the same. Why  are you not prepared to mention one single positive aspect of  all the work which has been carried out by the government?  However, you invariably choose to pick one negative point and  dwell on that. The Majlis too has done a great deal of service  in creating so much coordination and harmony between the  judicial and executive branches, carrying out so much  legislation, supervision, research, and dealing with so many  complaints based on Article 90.    You choose not to see all these services, but you question  the Majlis when a certain deputy utters something somewhere. Is  this right? [Passage omitted: Yazdi emphasizes parts of  guidelines by Khamene'i on importance of constructive criticism  and advice]    I am cancelling the remainder of my sermon since we are  overrunning on time and prayers could be delayed. I have written  down one or two sentences in Arabic but before that: Israel and  the kidnapping by Israel which does not comply with any of the  international regulations and laws and is a blatant violation of  all international regulations; a violation of human rights!    Unfortunately international forums have not made any  comment!  And, moreover, this is land and air aggression against state  borders! What licence is there for that? Why do those who raise  legal issues say nothing? Is the presence of an individual or a  group in a third country, whose ideology is against the ideology  of the system... [sentence as heard] Can that be a licence for  aggression against a country's land and air frontiers? Why has  the world kept silent?    Then, naturally, we see the recent air attacks, the  bombarding of south Lebanon and the martyrdom of Muslims!    They think that with such acts the problem will be resolved.  History has demonstrated, divine honor has demonstrated that  problems cannot be resolved by those means. And we are certain  that the area will not be calm until the day when the owners of  that land, the true owners of Palestine, return to their homes.  [crowd chants: "God is great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "Death  to Israel"]    The last time I stood at this podium I told the British  government that if it has any proof regrading its claim let it  be given to us for investigation. So far, not only have they  had no proof and have not shown anything, but they have also  embarked on other action which follows those hegemonist ideas.  In short, I tell the British government that that method has  become old-fashioned now; the actions you have embarked upon are  not right. Mend your ways. The Islamic Republic of Iran has  demonstrated in practice that it always seeks a peaceful  existence and will never be willing -- despite your behavior --  to embark on actions which are beneath its dignity; even in  retaliation.    We really say to Afghanistan that it is enough; don't ruin  the country any further.    We say to some Arab countries which agitate that the Islamic  Republic of Iran is not in a situation where it can be affected  by such provocation. This government, which has such an alert  and vigilant people, is in control of all its aspects and will  not allow any power, either in the farthest region of the world  or in its nearest neighborhood, to attempt the slightest  violation against its independence. [crowd chants: "God is  great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "death to  antirevolutionaries"; "Death to Israel"] [passage omitted]</p>

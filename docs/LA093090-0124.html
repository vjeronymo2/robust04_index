			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIANS AND SCANDALOUS BEDFELLOWS  </P> <P> Re "Feinstein's 'Star Power' Dimmed by Martyrdom Claim" (Sept. 19): Columnist  Dana Parsons is quite politically naive if he cannot distinguish between the  attacks on husbands of women running for high office and that of the scandal  produced by former state Sen. Bill Campbell and his wife, Margene Taylor  Campbell.  </P> <P> Let me enlighten him.  </P> <P> Bill Campbell sponsored the women's conference, seeded by taxpayer's money,  through the Small Business Administration. Mrs. Campbell became a consultant to  that conference shortly before the conference began and was paid for her  services.  </P> <P> Campbell's aide and secretary also benefited greatly from this conference, and  of course, because of community property laws, so did Bill. Mrs. Campbell's  association with the conference was all that came under public scrutiny. I have  a feeling that Campbell would have been happy if Parsons had not used his case  as an example.  </P> <P> Parsons also makes it clear that Caesar's wife will always be Caesar's wife,  candidate or not.  </P> <P> Feinstein's husband is in private business, and his success is a product of  free enterprise in our capitalistic system. This was the same with other mates  of females daring to run for high office.  </P> <P> It must be noted that when no fault can be found with the female candidate,  they attack her husband. In the case of male candidates, it seems no one cares  what they have done or what their wives have done; we just look the other way  and say "Oh, they all do it."  </P> <P> Pete Wilson became a wealthy man after his marriage. Perhaps it would be only  fair if Gayle Wilson's financial background was carefully checked over.  </P> <P> DONA STINE  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

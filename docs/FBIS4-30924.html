			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvolen, Central Slovakia (CTK) -- The restrictive  fiscal policies of the current Slovak Government are necessary  to ensure a macroeconomic stability which will provide a solid  basis for future economic development, Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik said today while meeting with administrative officials  of the Zvolen district.    Moravcik indicated that the prerequisites for development  were a stable budget and a state budget deficit of around four  percent through increased consumption and value-added taxes.    In connection with restrictive policies the government must  also provide stimulus for development, primarily in the  construction industry, said Moravcik. Statistics for the first  quarter show a revival of production, but a drop in investment.  The government is lacking funds with which to stimulate  industry because it was forced to transfer them to a judiciary  system which could neither afford telephones nor essentials for  its prisoners.    Privatization currently offers the only source of funds for  the government, said Moravcik. Major changes in the  privatization process will have to be made in order to ensure  economic development, he said.    Reduced budgets for agriculture and defense are unavoidable  in order to cover budget outlays of eight billion crowns which  were imprudently planned by the previous government. Moravcik  indicated that any deepening of the state budget deficit was  unacceptable, because it would mean "jettisoning good relations  with international institutions".    The premier fears that an unfavorable international  evaluation would threaten loan negotiations and a deficit would  spur the growth of inflation. Reduced expenditures and more  active privatization appear to Moravcik as the most viable  development path.</p>

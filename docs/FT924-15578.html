			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sad decline of the building societies  -Diary of a Private Investor / They're getting the banks' bad habits two adults, two children - had 15 separate accounts with seven different building societies. Recently, however, we have cut back. One of the reasons we had spread our money so widely was that I believed the UK was 'over-branched' with societies and that, with a decline in the housing market and a difficult economic situation, more of them would have to merge. If that occurred, we might hope to benefit from 'bonuses' paid by societies to members to encourage them to vote for such mergers. (This happened in 1990 when, as members of the Portman building society, we received a bonus of 4 per cent on our investments (with a Pounds 100 bonus limit for each account) when it merged with the Regency and West of England). We also thought that several societies would follow Abbey National and gain a stock market quotation, with shares being given to members. In the present recession, though, I feel some societies will be forced into mergers or could be taken over by other financial institutions; in such circumstances, relatively little may be offered as a bonus payment to members. And if they vote against a merger or takeover, their society might have rather a difficult future. It is also worth remembering that building society investors are protected for only the first 90 per cent of their deposits, up to Pounds 20,000 for each individual per society. With the recent flop or withdrawal of several company flotations and continuing uncertainty over the stock market, it could well be that any society that had considered a flotation will defer such plans for a few years. There are still, however, a number of small societies which ought to attract bonus payments if they are taken over. These are the ones which have not diversified into loss-making activities like estate agents, and which have a high free capital ratio. Take the Lambeth (with which I am retaining an account). While many societies have a free capital ratio of less than 6 per cent, it reported a free capital ratio of 9.61 per cent for the year ended January 31 1992. Of course, takeover terms for societies will depend heavily on their loan policies. Have they granted too many 90-100 per cent mortgages where the value of the property is now considerably less than the outstanding loan and many people are finding it hard to meet payments? Have they taken adequately into account the likelihood of further falls in property prices? Do their accounts reflect problem loans properly? The societies complained bitterly recently about competition from various National Savings products; this led to a reduction in the interest rates offered on some of them. But the societies also face increasing competition from banks and other institutions. Some years ago, there was a marked difference between banks and societies. The banks generally were overstaffed (although people had to queue for service) and they made a series of bad loans to third world countries, failed property companies and crooked businessmen. By contrast, societies appeared keen and efficient. There were seldom long queues in their branches and they made comparatively few bad loans  - although all were secured on property. Now, some societies send out a torrent of unsolicited junk mail offering people loans for all sorts of purposes. Some have been involved with failed property companies, some are increasing their overseas lending and, somehow, queues are starting to appear in branches. There are, of course, many excellent societies, but I fear some are becoming more like the banks of a few years ago. While some banks now are striving for greater efficiency and better service, it seems remarkable that, despite the recession, the number of society staff actually has increased - despite the number of new mortgages granted being considerably less than in, say, 1988 - while standards of service appear to have diminished. Many co-owners of societies (their depositors) are unaware of these staff increases. This is because most societies do not send their shareholder depositors a full set of accounts. Instead, they receive rather scrappy 'summary financial statements.' In general, these omit to mention the salaries paid to directors. Indeed, many societies appear to be run by self-perpetuating boards. But these could well need a shake-up; a board that managed in easier economic times might not be suited to the tougher climate now. As well as competition for depositors and mortgage advances from the banks, I think the societies also will face growing competition from foreign currency funds. The recent turmoil within the EC has shown how nice profits can be made from foreign currency transactions. As it is easier to switch currencies with banks than with building societies  -especially if people want to back something exotic like the Korean won - will the societies find some of their large depositors turning elsewhere?</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (4): Divided over the speed of the process - Czechoslovakia / In Slovakia, nationalist fervour and resentment at high unemployment and other negative side-effects of market reforms, proved stronger than economic self-interest. This could mean that the second wave of mass privatisation might only take place in the Czech lands Last month's general elections in the Czech and Slovak republics illustrated for the first time the vote-winning potency of privatisation - and the divisive force of conflicting views over the need to speed up or slow down the process. For Mr Vaclav Klaus, clear victor in the Czech lands, determined championship of mass privatisation through a complex voucher system proved an electoral trump card. Nearly 80 per cent of the electorate went into the voting booths as owners of a book of vouchers which they had bought earlier for a nominal sum, equivalent to one week's average wages. This included over 2m Slovak investors, many of whom opted to buy shares in Czech companies. The vouchers entitled the holders to shares in any of the nearly 1,500 state-owned enterprises involved in the first of two waves of mass privatisation. With his signature on each page of the voucher book, Mr Klaus made sure that voters had a stake in the reforms and that, in the Czech lands at least, they identified their interest with his Civic Democratic Party (ODS). However, in Slovakia, nationalist fervour and resentment at high unemployment and other negative side-effects of market reforms, proved stronger than economic self-interest. This could mean that the second wave of mass privatisation might only take place in the Czech lands, with a different and possibly slower timetable for Slovakia. Privatisation is expected to power ahead in the Czech lands where the ODS won 30 per cent of votes while the communist party won only 14 per cent and effectively lost the power to interfere. Bidding for the future shares begun two weeks before the polls opened. On May 18, over 8.5m citizens started using their vouchers to compete for a share in the equity of Czech and Slovak enterprises. Only a quarter did so individually. Confused by the complicated process and lacking basic information, 72 per cent of voucher holders entrusted their vouchers to one of the 436 private investment funds which sprung up earlier in the year to benefit from privatisation. Without these private funds, with their pledges to buy voucher books for up to 10 times their purchase price after 12 months, the voucher scheme may never have got off the ground. The first funds, led by the enterprising Harvard Capital and Consulting Company, run by 28-year-old Mr Viktor Kozeny, promised to take the risk out of the initial investment for millions of potential investors who initially greeted vouchers with indifference. Equity with a book value of Kcs299bn (Dollars 9.9bn) in 1,491 enterprises has been put aside for voucher privatisation. This is about 60 per cent of the book value of the assets being privatised this spring. A second wave is being prepared for the autumn. The mechanics of the voucher programme consist of a series of bidding rounds which are expected to last through the summer. The first round started on May 18 and was completed in mid-June. Enterprises where the demand for shares outstripped the original valuation of the equity on offer will be subjected to a second round of bids. Up to five rounds of bidding are provided for at progressively higher prices in voucher terms until supply and demand can be matched. No fixed percentage of equity was set aside for voucher privatisation and every enterprise involved was obliged to draw up its own privatisation plan. Some enterprises have 20 per cent of their equity slated for vouchers while others offer as much as 97 per cent. A minimum 3 per cent is set aside for the restitution fund, formed to compensate those illegally expropriated by the old regime. Equity not involved in the voucher scheme can be privatised by a series of other methods, including public auctions, restitutions and direct sales to domestic or foreign investors. An estimated Dollars 2bn worth of foreign investment has been committed to Czechoslovak companies and as much as Dollars 3bn is in the pipeline, according to US advisers at the Czech Ministry of Privatisation. However, Czechoslovakia's recent political developments could easily darken the prospects for the smooth continuation of the voucher programme. Nationalists, who won the upper hand in the smaller republic of Slovakia, have pledged to curtail the influence of the federal authorities in Prague over their economic affairs. In the short term, Mr Klaus's voucher scheme should not be endangered. The new programme for the interim caretaker federal government, recently agreed upon by Mr Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar, the newly-elected leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, states clearly that both sides are committed to continue the privatisation programme. Much will depend, however, on the intentions of the newly-elected left-wing leaders in the Slovak republic. Strong voices within Mr Meciar's party have criticised the voucher programme and have offered an ill-defined alternative based on employees' ownership. But attracting foreign investment will remain a priority for the small, cash-strapped republic. To a certain extent, enterprises have restructured into Czech or Slovak joint-stock companies as they prepared for privatisation. However, in the rush to launch the scheme before the elections, federal authorities assumed a lasting and unified equity market. Ten per cent of Slovaks have given their vouchers to Czech investment funds while less than 1 per cent of Czechs have placed their vouchers in Slovak funds. But Slovak funds are bidding for the shares of Czech enterprises which have better chances than their debt-ridden Slovak counterparts. Czech enterprises have attracted 90 per cent of foreign investment to date. Until shares are distributed, enterprises slated for the voucher distribution are legally the property of the National Property Fund. If prolonged, this status could paralyse enterprises, foreign advisers believe. In the long term, there are positive aspects to a division of the two republics. Western businessmen have often been hampered by the complexities of dealing with both republican and federal bureaucracies. Many say that dealing with just one government in each republic could facilitate foreign investment in both.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Bonds: SEK offers Swedish krone Eurobond Swedish Export Credit's (SEK) latest offering - the first global Swedish krone Eurobond - was the focus of the market yesterday, while the day's other feature was a flurry of structured floating-rate note issues, mostly in US dollars. SEK issued SKr2.5bn of 6.5 per cent bonds due June 2001, which were priced to yield 11 basis points over the 13 per cent Swedish government benchmark bond at the re-offer price of 99.359. The deal met strong demand from investors in the US and Europe, according to a syndicate official at lead manager Merrill Lynch. Towards the end of the day, the bonds were trading at 99.40 bid, the yield gap having narrowed to 10 basis points. 'People are very positive on the krone market: they expect the currency to appreciate; they like the yield pick-up over other European markets; and they hope that yields will decline further as interest rates continue getting cut,' said a trader at another bank, who reported keen interest in the paper. Others felt the bond's pricing was on the tight side, compared with some outstanding SEK krone Eurobonds which yield around 30 basis points over government bonds. However, global bonds tend to be more tightly priced as they are considered to be more liquid and usually have a wider investor base. SEK also issued Dollars 100m of one-year so-called 'corridor,' or range, floating-rate notes, a structure where interest only accrues when three-month Libor falls within a specific range during certain dates. Yesterday's other range-floaters included Dollars 75m of one-year notes for Rabobank Nederland via Goldman Sachs; Dollars 150m of two-year notes for Canada's Export Development Corporation via Swiss Bank Corporation; Dollars 100m of two-year notes for Osterreichische Postsparkasse via SBC; Dollars 100m of two-year notes for the World Bank via Morgan Stanley; and Dollars 150m of two-year notes for UBS, via UBS. 'Structured floaters have become the flavour of the month - they're likely to take over from collared FRNs,' said one trader. Collared floaters are structured so that the coupon range is limited by a floor and a ceiling rate. The structure of most corridor floaters implies that investors take the view that short-term US interest rates will not be very volatile, and that if they rise, they will do so only very slowly, the trader said. 'If you call interest rates right, you can get very nice returns; of course, if you don't, you get nothing,' said another dealer. He added that these relatively highly leveraged instruments have seen strong demand from institutional investors and money market fund managers, who are taking an increasingly aggressive approach to their portfolios in the current low-yield environment. In the dollar sector, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) is set to launch its Dollars 1bn 10-year global offering via Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs today. The bonds are expected to be launched at a spread of 155-165 basis points over Treasuries. In the sterling market, the European Investment Bank is expected to issue Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m 10-year bonds today. While the pricing is expected to be tight and the 10-year sector of the Eurosterling market is weighed down with recent supply, the bonds are expected to meet with solid demand from institutional and multi-currency investors. Elsewhere, the City of Prague was awarded an implied triple-B senior debt rating with a positive outlook by Standard &amp; Poor's - the first investment grade rating for a municipality in central Europe. The rating comes as Prague prepares its entry into the Eurobond market. According to the city's mayor, Mr Jan Koukal, 'obtaining a rating was an important step in the implementation of our international borrowing plans. We will now focus on obtaining cost-effective and diversified financing.' Pending approval by the city's governing general assembly, Prague is expected to tap the market in the next two months, with market talk focusing on a Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m issue of five-year bonds. Nomura International, which acted as Prague's rating adviser, is among the banks tipped to lead-manage the issue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Kola Plant Will Be </F> Rebuilt''--first paragraph is AFTENPOSTEN introduction]    [Text] Russian authorities and the leadership of the  proprietary company have made up their minds: The nickel works  at Kola is to be modernized.    This was announced at a meeting of the Norwegian/Russian  environmental commission in Murmansk this week. The current  round of bids will be closed within a short time. ``We were told  that the work to modernize the plant would be started toward the  end of 1994 or in the beginning of 1995,'' says State Secretary  Borre Pettersen of the Environmental Protection Agency.    During the past year there has been speculation about  whether  the Russian authorities themselves, and not least the combine  that owns the smelting works at Kola, would not prefer to close  down the works rather than carry out a modernization that would  cost about 4.5 billion kroner. A large portion of the ore that  is being smelted at Kola is carried by rail from the north  Siberian city of Norilsk, where the combine has other smelting  works. Now, however, it looks like nickel ore will continue to  be smelted at Kola. The ice-free harbor probably plays a  decisive factor.  <H5>  Norwegian Support </H5>   Norwegian authorities made it clear during the meeting in  Murmansk that the promise of environmental support of up to 300  million kroner for the project is still valid, and that the aid  is not dependent on giving any orders to the Norwegian company  Elkem in connection with the modernization.    ``This is pure environmental support that eventually will be  granted when we are given assurances that the emissions of  sulphur and heavy metals are as low as we demand,'' Pettersen  says.  <H5>  Nuclear Storage </H5>   At the Murmansk meeting Pettersen was informed that Russian  authorities are now working more concretely than before on  building a long-term storage facility for waste with low or  intermediate levels of radioactivity. The plant will be located  either at Novaya Semlya or east of the Kola peninsula. The  Russians have responded positively to the Norwegian request to  participate in the planning as an advisor. No promises were  given as to Norwegian economic support for the building itself.    Because the dumping in the ocean of low-level radioactive  liquid waste again has been on the agenda since the Japanese  protested dumping in the Pacific, Pettersen raised the subject:  ``Russian environmental authorities did not inform us as to  where they were dumping, how much, or anything like that. They  stressed, however, that Russia aims to stop the dumping, but so  far this is impossible because there are no storage facilities  on land.''  <H5>  New Expedition </H5>   Norway and Russia have agreed to carry through another  research expedition to the Kara Sea next year in order to  examine the Abrosimov Bay on the east side of Novaya Semlya. A  common project will also be carried out in order to evaluate to  what degree the nuclear plants in Mayak pose a risk for the  northern areas from the river Ob. To be established under the  commission is a subcommittee that will work with the ocean  environment in the Barents region, write a report on the present  conditions, make a list of priorities of things to be done,  initiate new research, and coordinate current research. A  training program in environmental technology for leaders and  engineers in Russian industry will also be started. It was also  agreed to continue working on plans to create a completely new  system to coordinate environmental data in Russia. The long-term  goal is to establish such a center in Moscow.</p>

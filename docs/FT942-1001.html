			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Value added policies bring big benefits - Glen Peters on the key messages The theme which unites the winning companies in our survey and earns them the respect of their European peers is a commitment to their shareholders, customers and employees. The message which emerges is clear - if you can enhance value for each of these 'stakeholder' groups you will earn a prize. But if you can use the principle of value enhancement to drive all your operational, investment, and financial decisions then you will earn the glittering prize. Enhancing value for its stakeholders is one principle that drives M&amp;S. 'Value for money' is delivered to the customer by a business strategy that creates the greatest cash value for the shareholder. The recent 'outstanding value' sales campaign exemplifies M&amp;S's ability to meet the needs of both customers and stakeholders: it raised turnover by 10 per cent, year-on-year, without an apparent reduction in margins. Higher returns, lower risk and more rapid growth are used by Percy Barnevik and his team at ABB to create value for their stakeholders. Shareholders benefit from a continuous push into growth markets, a focus on reducing fixed costs and reductions in net debt. Customers receive an unusually high level of customer service; and employees benefit from the devolution of responsibility which is a hallmark of Barnevik's strategy. M&amp;S and ABB have distinctive leadership and management styles which receive much praise from their peers. Their success highlights the message that delivering value to stakeholders is intrinsically linked to sound management. In ABB's case, this is a decisive vote for the company's 'matrix' management structure, which allows Barnevik to manage a business with 200,000 employees from a head office of only 150 people. Top management must not only allocate resources and resolve conflicts, but also create a common purpose, challenge the status quo and stimulate corporate renewal. Elsewhere in the rankings, information technology has propelled Reuters into the 'most admired' category. Some 90 per cent of the group's revenue now comes from financial information and transaction products. Reuters' dominant position in the dealing rooms of the world's financial centres has been gained through aggressive acquisitions, strong market positioning, advanced products and buoyant cash generation. It is a recipe for gaining and retaining the commitment of the company's stakeholders. Shell's positive attitude to its stakeholders has also received strong endorsement in the survey. The company's position is strengthened by strict debt control and commitment to targets of 14 per cent return on capital employed and and 12 per cent return on investment. British Airways' customer service record helped make it the overall winner in the transport sector. BA is also committed to its employees: mechanisms such as regular employee surveys give staff a say in how the business is run. At Unilever, co-chairman Sir Michael Perry says shareholder value is high on his list of priorities. The group's strategy - attacking the cost base, focusing corporate resources more tightly, and innovating in brands - earns it strong endorsement from its peers in the food and drinks sector. Brands are also essential to BMW, which tops the automotive sector. Its brand image of high quality and high performance is a symbol of its commitment to its customers. Brand strategy will be the key to its relationship with newly-acquired Rover - the two brands will be kept distinct and will be developed independently. BMW may be a better-known brand, but Siemens is German industry's bellweather. Many of its divisions operate in depressed markets, and the growth rate of its biggest market, telecoms, will slacken as the initial stages of wiring up East Germany are completed. But the company retains the admiration of its competitors in the electronics sector. In the banking sector Deutsche Bank is most respected by its peers for its overall business performance and market leadership. With over half its shareholders outside Germany, and with strong local subsidiaries in in Spain, the UK and Italy, Deutsche Bank must successfully address the interests of a wide-spread group of European stakeholders. The message of the survey is that the most successful top managements now judge their business decisions by the value that they create, and that they are judged in turn by their ability to deliver value to their stakeholders. For those who wish to join the select ranks of Europe's most respected companies, the message is equally clear: to aspire to this list, you must identify the key factors that add value to your business, and make them work for you. Glen Peters is a partner with Price Waterhouse Management Consultants, where he heads the market and customer management division.</p>

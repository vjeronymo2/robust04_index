			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Opera sings out against cuts - Six major companies go on the offensive AFTER years of phoney crises the nation's arts companies are convinced that the crunch in public funding will actually happen this year. The six major opera companies - Royal Opera, ENO, WNO, Scottish Opera, Opera North, and Glyndebourne Touring, in an unprecedented show of unanimity, have decided to go on the offensive in an attempt to safeguard opera in the UK. They have produced a joint letter which has been sent to all the people that matter, from Norma Major (separate one for John) down, spelling out the devastating effect on their activities if the government goes ahead with its threatened cuts and freezes. In total the government plans from next April to reduce the subsidy of the companies by 6 per cent compared with previous promises, a reduction in funding of Pounds 5.5m. The Royal Opera has already cancelled a planned production of Oberon; is having second thoughts about a revival of Gawain; and has postponed a joint production with the Kirov of War and Peace. In addition the future of its Garden project, dedicated to new and experimental opera, is threatened. The ENO says that it has already cut rehearsal time to dangerous limits, and would be forced to axe its Bayliss programme of opera for the young, cancel new commissions, and cut the size of its orchestra and chorus. WNO would reduce touring, new productions, education and outreach; Scottish Opera would virtually eliminate touring; Opera North would drop its new productions, including the planned Tannhauser, and its mid-scale touring; and Glyndebourne would forego its educational work as well as a week on the road. The full horror of the projected cuts is set out in the June issue of the magazine Opera. Quite rightly the opera administrators feel that they cannot make good the short-fall by raising seat prices any higher, or attracting more sponsorship money in the current state of the economy. Savings will have to be made in their work load. Compared with past disaster scenarios this one sounds much more convincing. The fact that all the directors have co-operated on the document, and presented their case so early, confirms that they take the situation very seriously. Early evidence that this could be the bleakest year for the arts in decades comes with the news that London City Ballet, the touring classical dance company which depended mainly on box office and sponsorship for funding, is at last calling it a day after its July 3 performance at Bath. The Arts Council will not rescue it and only the unlikely appearance of a generous sponsor can save it this time.</p>

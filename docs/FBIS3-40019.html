			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Theo Waigel, finance minister and CSU </F> chairman, by Kai Diekmann and Dirk Hoeren; place and date not  given: "CSU Chairman Waigel: `Rau Should Not Let Himself Be  Elected by Armchair Communists!'"]    [Text] [BILD] Mr. Waigel, there are only eight months  left until the Bundestag elections! How long will you give the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to make a clear statement  on the coalition?    [Waigel] The FDP cannot afford a zig-zag policy in this  respect. It has always been well off with a coalition statement  for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union  [CSU]. It would be good for the political situation in Germany  if the FDP were to commit itself before the presidential  elections!    If the Liberals were to hesitate with their coalition  statement, we will relentlessly try to get their coalition  voters in the election campaign. Then we will tell everybody  who wants to vote for the FDP for the continuation of the  coalition that they are making an uncertain choice with that!  Then the FDP will have problems getting into the Bundestag at  all.    [BILD] What do you recommend to the FDP regarding the  presidential elections?    [Waigel] I expect the FDP will vote in the third ballot, at  the latest, for CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog! The election of  Johannes Rau with the help of FDP votes would be a disastrous  signal for the continuation of the coalition.    [BILD] May Johannes Rau let himself be elected president  with the votes of the Party of Democratic Socialism?    [Waigel] It is not permissible that Johannes Rau lets  himself be elected president by the votes of armchair Bolsheviks!    In 1969, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] asked  Gerhard Schroeder, the then CDU/CSU candidate for the office of  president, again and again whether he would permit himself to be  elected with the votes of the National Democratic Party of  Germany [NDP]. The SPD must now accept being asked the same  thing.    In this respect, the attitude of the CDU/CSU candidate is  exemplary.    [BILD] From the purely arithmetic point of view, the results  would currently be sufficient only for a grand coalition in  Bonn. What will the CSU do then?    [Waigel] If the SPD were to be stronger than the CDU/CSU  after the next Bundestag elections, the CSU would not  participate in a grand coalition. Similar signals have also  been heard from the CDU.    In this case, the SPD should form a minority government.  Grand coalitions only lead to a strengthening of the extreme  parties on the right and he left.    [BILD] When will taxes be lowered again?    [Waigel] Reunification has its price! We are coping with  these burdens by having saved about 70 billion German marks [DM]  and having raised taxes by about that amount. As soon as any  leeway develops in the budget, we will use that to lower taxes  again.    [BILD] What about the inflation rate?    [Waigel] In view of the price development, I consider it  possible that the inflation rate will have a 2 in front of the  decimal point by the end of the year. This gives rise to new  leeway for interest rate reductions. Each percentage point of  interest rate reductions opens up an investment volume of DM7  billion. This is more than can be done by any investment  program.    [BILD] Mr. Waigel, do you actually think that [former  Environment Minister] Peter Gauweiler can ever again become a  minister in Bavaria?    [Waigel] As district chairman, member of the CSU Presidium,  and member of the CSU Executive Committee, Peter Gauweiler  continues to be in the first rank of the party. We rely on him  in the election campaign. Of course, someone who temporarily  gets out of the line of fire can become a minister once again.  Free of his office, it will be easier for him to refute the  accusations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, 26 Jun -- A responsible source in Aden  today accused the "rulers of Sanaa of violating the cease-fire  they announced last night." At the same time, he called on the  international community to adopt sanctions on the northern side  in Yemen for continuing to violate the cease-fire.    In a statement to KUNA here today, the source said that the  northern forces have shelled the residential areas of  al-Mansurah, Shaykh 'Uthman, and Khormaksar this morning, and  pointed out the death and wounding of numerous people.    The source called on the UN Security Council to adopt  sanctions against Sanaa for continuing to violate the cease-fire.    The northern artillery bombardment has resumed at an earlier  hour this morning thereby putting an end to a cease-fire that  lasted for few hours when Sanaa announced it would adhere to it  from midnight last night.

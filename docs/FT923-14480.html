			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reflects worries about US economy Wall Street SHARE prices traded in a narrow range on either side of opening values yesterday, as the markets digested the implications of last week's bad economic news and the interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.92 at 3,339.21. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the finish, up just 2.07 at 413.84, as were the Amex composite, up 0.03 at 382.58 and the Nasdaq composite, 0.19 lower at 563.16. Turnover on the NYSE was 187m shares. Last week shares fell despite a big cut in interest rates by the Fed because investors were more concerned with what the bad June employment figures said about the state of the economic recovery. That concern continued to hamper the market yesterday, and with the first batch of second quarter corporate earnings due out soon, investors are likely to tread warily until they see a clear sign of improvement in company profits and in economic activity. Among individual stocks, consumer-related issues fared well in active trading on hopes that they could be a good defensive play during tough economic times. Philip Morris firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 78 1/4 , Procter &amp; Gamble climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/4 , Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 , Coca-Cola rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 in turnover of almost 1.5m shares, and RJR Nabisco put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 3/8 . Banks were mostly weaker as analysts warned that competition for customer accounts might prevent them from reducing their already low deposit rates in the wake of the Fed's discount rate cut. Chemical fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 37 7/8 , Citibank by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 20 3/4 , Chase Manhattan by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 and BankAmerica by Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 . Some of the broking stocks that rose after Thursday's rate cut also gave back some of their gains, with PaineWebber easing Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 and Salomon falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 35 5/8 , although Merrill Lynch recovered from early losses to end up Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 52 1/8 . Airline stocks took off in expectation that approaching increases in fares will boost flagging margins without damaging demand too much. Delta was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 55 1/4 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/4 , UAL was up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 117 3/8 , USAir gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 13 1/8 and Southwest Airlines rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43. On the Nasdaq market, FedFirst Bancshares jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/2 after Southern National agreed to acquire the company in a stock-swap deal worth Dollars 88.8m. Southern National fell Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 15 1/2 . Canada SHARE prices in Toronto closed slightly higher in relatively light trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index gained 6.77 points, or 0.20 per cent, to close at 3,426.91. Declines edged advances 274 to 243, trading volume of 20.643m shares was above Friday's 15.021m shares, and trading value was CDollars 242.6m against CDollars 166.9m. The financial services group posted the day's biggest gain. Royal Bank was up  1/4 to 24 3/4 , Bank of Montreal was up  1/2 to 47, Scotiabank gained 5/8 to 22 5/8 and Canadian Imperial Bank gained  5/8 to 28 3/4 .</p>

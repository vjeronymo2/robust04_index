			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Carlos Azedo] </F>   [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party]  leadership is upset because President Itamar Franco -- while  attending Carnival in Juiz de Fora on 15 February -- launched  the presidential candidacy of [Finance Minister] Fernando  Henrique Cardoso. The PSDB leaders believe this will only  jeopardize the approval of the Social Emergency Fund.    Deputy Luiz Maximo (PSDB-Sao Paulo), the vice leader of the  party bloc in the lower house, commented: "The president would  do the country a favor if he remained quiet. There was no need  for him to say what he did. Obviously, he has every right to  express his choice, but launching the PSDB candidate is  something that only concerns the party."    Senator Mario Covas, the party bloc leader in the Senate,  was  also upset by the president's comments because he believes they  contradict the PSDB's strategy regarding the presidential  succession and jeopardize the approval of the economic plan that  will be voted for the second time by Congress next week. The  PSDB candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo State -- who  supports Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy whether the plan  is approved or not -- said the PSDB should not voice an opinion  on succession before 2 April; the deadline by which those who  wish to run for election must resign from their public posts.    Federal Deputy Jose Anibal (PSDB-Sao Paulo) said the PSDB's  strategy is to approve the plan and cooperate with the  constitutional revision with a minimum agenda to guarantee  essential reforms: Those involving tax, social security,  political, and economic reforms. Only then will the party  choose its candidate for the presidency of the Republic.    "All parties are taking the succession into account. I  believe the plan should be approved and that a minimum agenda  should be discussed despite the president's attitude," asserted  Jose Anibal, minimizing the repercussion of Itamar Franco's  comments. He said Carnival and the reaction of the minister  have neutralized what the president of the Republic said.</p>

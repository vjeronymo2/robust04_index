			<p>BFN     [Text] Deng Nan, daughter of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,  visited the Vatican this morning to view the Sistine Chapel.  The news was officially confirmed by the spokesman for the Holy  See, Joaquin Navarro Valls, who insisted on the private nature  of her visit.    However, it cannot be excluded that the presence of Deng  Nan,  who is the deputy minister for culture in her country, could  also be interpreted as a further step in the direction of a  rapprochement between the Holy See and China, following the  severing of diplomatic links in the 1950's.</p>

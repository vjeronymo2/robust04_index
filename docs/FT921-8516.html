			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Krajina vote to oust Babic ONE of two rival parliaments in the Serbian enclave of Krajina voted yesterday to oust Mr Milan Babic, the president, over his opposition to a UN peace plan, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. About half the deputies in Krajina's parliament met in the Serb-controlled town of Glina, central Croatia, and voted to oust the enclave's government. The move was apparently directed by Serbia, which has politically marginalised Mr Babic over his opposition to the UN initiative. Mr Babic denounced the decision as illegal and said he had 'no intention of stepping down'.</p>

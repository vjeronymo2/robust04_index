			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] In an editorial headlined "An Improper Beginning,"  the AL-BA'TH newspaper says: At the beginning of next week  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the  region again after he toured its capitals two weeks ago, but his  mission of giving a push to the peace process has not achieved  any results due to the Rabin government's stands which pushed  the peace talks to a stalemate.    The paper adds: What makes things uncomfortable is that Mr.  Christopher begins his new tour of the region with the statement  issued by his department on terrorism and the states which  protect terrorism, in which the name of Syria, along with the  names of other states, was included. This is not a good and  appropriate beginning, especially since the U.S. State  Department's statement is unrealistic and based on many  fallacies, in addition to the fact that it is hostile and  provocative.    AL-BA'TH says: If this statement is meant to pressure Syria,  Syria has never yielded and will never yield to pressures from  any one.    The paper adds: We would have hoped and wished that  Secretary Christopher had not sent this statement as an opening  message concerning efforts to reactivate the peace process.  This is because this is an improper message and the address to  which it was sent is completely wrong.    The paper says: Christopher is returning to the region based  on his statements that he has positive ideas on the  Syrian-Israeli track. Undoubtedly, everyone who loves just and  comprehensive peace hopes that Christopher will something in his  quiver that justifies his optimistic tone, and that the ideas he  is talking about will be based on U.S. success in persuading the  intransigent side which is rebelling against the international  legitimacy; namely Israel, to accept the indispensable bases of  making progress toward a just and comprehensive peace.    The paper stresses that Christopher will find in Syria every  concern about a just and comprehensive peace, and sincere  cooperation to put the peace process on the road leading to this  peace.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is working  for peace in the open. It will not accept a humiliating peace.  Moreover, it will not do anything that would be shameful to  announce. It is either an honorable and just peace or no peace.    Under the headlines "The Basis for Peace," the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: He is mistaken who thinks that Syria would  accept less than the full restoration of the Golan, in addition  to occupied southern Lebanon. This is because full withdrawal  is the basis for a comprehensive peace, and he who is concerned  about a just and comprehensive peace must also be faithful to  the pillars and constants of peace which were approved at the  Madrid Conference.    The paper adds: Israel has imagined it can have peace and  occupation together. Sometimes it slandered Syria's stands, and  other times Lebanon's stands. It has always sought to entrap  this or that party in a separate deal, something which was  achieved in the labyrinths of Oslo which led to the Cairo  agreement that imposed Israeli trusteeship on the Palestinian  Arab people and their destinies.    The paper adds: Israel cannot present the agreement with the  Palestinian side as an example of partial solutions which it  seeks to achieve on the other tracks of negotiations, or use it  as a pretext to peddle such unilateral deals, and at the same  time exclude the bases of the peace process and the pillars  governing the Madrid conference, foremost of which is the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and the  land-for-peace principle.    Proceeding from this important point, President Hafiz  al-Asad stressed, when he received U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher early this month, the need to tackle the major  issues of the peace process in order to guarantee making  progress. Also based on this, Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi  have called for adhering to the Madrid bases and for further  coordination among the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks.  This is in order to foil Israel's attempts to deal separately  with each Arab side and drag it into partial solutions that have  nothing to do with the Madrid bases and the essence of a just  and comprehensive peace, which is based on full withdrawal and  resolving all aspects of the conflict to guarantee the  establishment of a peace that would end all factors of tension  and chaos, and fulfills the international community's desire for  stability and security in the region.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Peace cannot be established  without an accurate implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions which Israel seeks to bypass through secret deals  and partial solutions which entrench occupation and give Israel  peace and land together, something which is impossible.    Under the headline "The Israeli Withdrawal," the newspaper  TISHRIN says: News agencies cited informed sources as saying  that the U.S. secretary of state's Middle East tour this time  will be confined to Syria and Israel, and that it is aimed at  giving the Syrian-Israeli track a push forward and at achieving  tangible progress on the road to a just and entrenched peace in  the region.    TISHRIN adds: It is known that Christopher held lengthy  talks in both occupied Jerusalem and Damascus during the  previous tour. It is no longer a secret that Syria adhered to  the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from the  Golan as a basic condition for peace. At the same time, Israel  gave first priority to its security, after which withdrawal will  follow or will be achieved in phases to test Syria's peace  intentions, as the Tel Aviv rulers say.    The paper adds: Talk about probing Syria's peace intentions  is a kind of deception and cover for the occupation and its  expansionist plans, taking into consideration that Syria has  always complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and the  UN Charter and principles. Moreover, Syria has never been  exposed to a single international denunciation. However, Israel  has been violating the UN Security Council resolutions since  1947 until now. It has also violated the principles and  charters of the international community. Based on this, Israel  is the one which must be put to the test, considering that it is  the aggressor and the occupier. Testing Israel's desire for  peace can be represented by its full withdrawal from the Golan  and all the occupied territories. The Knesset decision on the  annexation of the Golan will never change this.    The paper says: Syria has made several appeals to achieve a  just and comprehensive peace, the peace of the brave, and called  on Israel's rulers to be brave and to be up to this peace.  Until this moment, Syria has not seen any true Israeli  response. On the contrary, Israel's rulers adopted the policy  of procrastination, prevarication, and of evading the UN  Security Council resolutions. They have just made statements on  a certain withdrawal from the Golan. We want to reiterate that  Syria rejects any phased settlements or partial solutions. This  is because true peace hinges on the full restoration of the  Golan, the dismantling of all settlements, and the return of the  Syrian evacuees to their land and homes. Consequently, Israel's  withdrawal does not constitute a concession, for withdrawal is  dictated by the international law and the UN Security Council  resolutions.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East depends  on Israel's compliance with the resolutions of international  legitimacy. Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied  territories paves the way for a firm and true peace. Without  this, talk about peace will be a waste of time.</p>

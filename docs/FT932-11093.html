			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Ontario pay threat enrages unions CANADA'S powerful civil service trade unions are gearing up for a fight over demands by provincial and local governments for concessions aimed at curbing budget shortfalls. Tensions are most apparent in Ontario, where a social-democratic government, elected in 1991 with the backing of organised labour, has called for CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) in wage cuts. The government has warned that 40,000 jobs could be at risk if unions failed to agree a belt-tightening 'social contract' ahead of the provincial budget later this month. Ontario, which has been one of the heaviest borrowers on international capital markets this year, risks having its credit rating cut if it fails to bring its 1993/94 budget deficit down from a projected CDollars 16bn-CDollars 17bn to CDollars 10bn-CDollars 12bn. Three of Canada's four biggest unions represent public sector workers. Led by the 407,000-member Canadian Union of Public Employees, they are generally more militant than their private-sector counterparts. Mr Andrew Jackson, economist at the Canadian Labour Congress, said traditional ties between the labour movement and the New Democratic party - which governs in Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan - were unlikely to deter unions from acting in their members' interests. The governments appear to be banking on limited public support for the unions. In a provincial election in Newfoundland earlier this week the ruling Liberal party won a big victory on a platform of public-sector austerity. Under legislation passed last year, federal civil servants' pay scales are frozen for two years in return for almost total job security. But Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, said in last week's budget that Ottawa wanted to reopen the job-security deal.</p>

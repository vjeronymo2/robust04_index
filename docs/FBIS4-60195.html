			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source in the Democratic  Republic of Yemen has said that the information being leaked by  the news media of the bloody al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa which keeps  (?misleading) Arab and international public opinion that the  gang's forces have reached up to within view of the city of  Aden, are untrue. The source said that it was not strange for  the trumpets of this gang to continue the course of lies,  misleading reports and deceptions with the objective of  falsifying the realities at the battle fronts and concealing its  defeats and its enormous human and material losses.    The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic  of  Yemen recalled the obvious and scandalous contradictions in the  statements issued by the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, head of  the ruling gang in Sanaa, in his press conference held this  morning when he pointed out that his forces had destroyed 80  percent of the weapons and machinery of our steadfast armed  forces. At the same time, he admitted his inability to  determine the outcome of the battle quickly because of what he  called the existence of a huge military arsenal belonging to our  forces. The responsible military source ridiculed the  misleading information given by the ruler of Sanaa that three  brigades in Shabwah had surrendered. The military source  pointed out that had this claim been true then the forces of the  ruling gang would have occupied Shabwah in its entirety where  the brigades which the war general claimed had surrendered to  him were based. He is seeking imaginary gains which have been  difficult for him to achieve in the battlefields due to the  steadfastness of our armed forces and the masses of the people  which supported them and out of their conviction in the justice  of their right to life.    The responsible military source in the Democratic Republic  of  Yemen has reiterated that the misleading media reports of the  dictator, the dictator of Sanaa, are tantamount to confused  dreams and that the road to Aden is a very long and thorny one.  It will be the graveyard of the new invaders before their  delusions can touch proud Aden.</p>

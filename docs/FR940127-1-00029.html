			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Very little habitat remains at low elevations in the Puget Trough area of Washington. Lands surrounding the Puget Trough, particularly to the east and south, are highly urbanized or developed for agricultural use, forcing marbled murrelets to fly up to 25 miles inland to reach the first available suitable nesting habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although marbled murrelets have been heard and/or seen at some inland sites during most months of the year (Paton  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1987, Naslund 1993), detectability at inland sites increases during the spring and reaches a peak late in summer coincident with the peak in breeding activity (Paton and Ralph 1988, Nelson 1989). In early fall, the number of inland detections decreases markedly, presumably because birds have completed breeding and are undergoing a flightless molt at sea. It is unknown why marbled murrelets visit inland sites during the non-breeding season. Researchers hypothesize that birds attending these areas in fall and winter may be experienced resident birds and that these visits may aid in maintaining nest sites, nesting territories, and pair bonds (Naslund 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marbled murrelets are currently experiencing very low recruitment rates. Juvenile to adult ratios of marbled murrelets are between 0.012 and 0.035 (i.e., there are between 1 and 4 juvenile fledglings of that year observed for every 100 adults observed) (Strong  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). These results are supported by survey data collected at points along the central coast of Oregon during 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. The average percentage of juveniles in these counts were approximately 1, 4, 2, 5, and 1 percent, respectively (Nelson and Hardin in prep.). Surveys conducted in California have indicated similar juvenile to adult ratios since 1989 (Ralph, U.S. Forest Service, Redwood Sciences Lab,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pers. comm. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). If the juvenile to adult ratios observed in the marine environment are accurate, then only 1 to 5 percent of the observed population is successfully reproducing, that is, successfully fledging young.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average annual adult survival for stable populations of several other alcid species is approximately 90 percent (Hudson 1985). Alcids typically experience their highest rates of mortality prior to the attainment of breeding age. The average survival to breeding age for alcids is 29 percent (Hudson 1985). The combination of low fledging rates of marbled murrelets, as demonstrated by the juvenile to adult ratios, and low survival to breeding age are likely to produce recruitment rates far below those required to maintain present population levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the longevity of other alcids (Hudson 1985), marbled murrelets are estimated to live an average of 10 years. With such long-lived species, recruitment rates are a more accurate indicator of species condition than population counts. At-sea counts of adult marbled murrelets may reflect a large portion of non-breeders that will not contribute to the future population. If the current low recruitment rates are the result of recent losses of nesting opportunities, counts of adults may not reflect the sustainable population until the population adjusts to remaining nesting habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

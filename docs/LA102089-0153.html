			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS AS ROLE MODELS: AN UP-TO-DATE CALENDAR;  </P> <P> IMAGES: UC IRVINE OFFICIAL SAYS PUBLICATION WILL 'ALLOW US TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT  A GROUP OF HEROES FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.'  </P> <P> Kenneth Vernon hopes his participation in the 1990 Orange County Black Role  Model Calendar will help black youngsters better understand their own  potential. He also hopes it will help change some preconceived notions about  blacks.  </P> <P> "You see so many negative stereotypes about blacks that I hope this shows that  not all blacks are on welfare. Not all blacks are uneducated. Not all blacks  don't have a strong male image in the home," says the 30-year-old geologist,  who has a 4-year-old son.  </P> <P> Vernon is one of 14 nominees included in the calendar, which was created by a  group of Orange County black businesswomen. The 12 nominees who receive the  most votes from members of the community attending Selection Night today at the  Irvine Marriott will be featured on the 12 months of the calendar. The other  two will appear in the year-at-a-glance section. The calendar will also include  biographical material on each man as well as highlighted black history dates.  </P> <P> Nominees range in age from 20 to 58 and include entrepreneurs, a former FBI  agent, a mortgage banker, a salesman and a young man who made his way from  foster home care to studies at Stanford University.  </P> <P> Some are married. Some are single. Most have a college degree, though one of  the nominees created a successful business in spite of only an eighth-grade  education.  </P> <P> The nominees include: Howard Wesley Anderson of Anaheim Hills, 42, a senior  special investigator with Rockwell; Darrell L. Armstrong, 20, Anaheim, a  Stanford University student in public policy and economics; Nathan T. Edwards,  43, Costa Mesa, owner of Austin Diversified Productions, Costa Mesa; Ronald  Harding, 48, Yorba Linda, owner of Ron Harding Moving &amp; Storage, Anaheim;  Ottis Lenior, 43, Huntington Beach, a district sales manager with GTE; James D.  McClellan, 42, Orange, a salesman with Digital Equipment Corp. in Irvine, and  Robert Vernon McDonald, 42, Anaheim Hills, a marketing executive with United  Stationers.  </P> <P> Others are: James Edward Myers, 49, Anaheim Hills, insurance investigator and  owner of the Vargas Co.; Leo Parker, 40, Tustin, owner of People Security,  Santa Ana; Lionel Punchard, 37, El Toro, owner of First Republic Mortgage  Corp., Santa Ana; Patrick Rhodes, 52, Lake Forest, an account manager with  Digital Equipment Corp.; Anthony Romano, 58, Anaheim Hills, a realtor with ERA,  Anaheim; Ron Shirley, 33, a credit manager with Xerox Corp. in Santa Ana, and  Vernon, who works for Clayton Environment Consultants Inc. in Cypress and lives  in Rialto.  </P> <P> The calendar was the brainchild of a committee headed by Sandra Lynch of S.K.  Lynch Productions in Santa Ana. Lynch and her associates came up with the idea  after a speech by Thomas A. Parham, a psychologist and director of the Career  Planning and Placement Center at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> According to Lynch, Parham challenged members of the Black Business Alliance of  Orange County to do something positive to change the lack of visibility of  black male role models in the community.  </P> <P> The black male role models are out there, Lynch found. It's just a matter of  taking the time to notice them. She says the calendar is making a statement  that even in Orange County -- where blacks represent only 1.9% of the  population, according to Parham -- they were easily able to find more than  enough role models.  </P> <P> Sports and entertainment figures were purposely excluded from the calendar. The  difficulty with seeing only those people as role models is that it limits the  scope of what black youngsters are encouraged to aspire to, says Parham, who  assisted Lynch's committee with the project.  </P> <P> He says the calendar will "allow us to really highlight a group of heroes for  our young people. It allows our young people to believe in heroes who are  important and significant, not because they can bounce a basketball or because  they're an entertainer, but because they embody those characteristics that are  most highly valued in the black community."  </P> <P> "A role model to me," Parham says, "is some individual who can provide for and  protect his family. A role model to me is somebody who puts his community and  his group and his family before himself. A role model to me is somebody with a  strong religious orientation. A role model to me is somebody . . . who goes to  work every day . . . tries to advance himself and makes money and provides for  himself in an honest way.  </P> <P> "It's important to understand really what heroes are. Heroes are nothing more  than symbols, and as symbols, what they represent are the possibilities and  potentialities for young people to do the same thing."  </P> <P> The calendars will be available in early December and will retail for $8.95  each. Distribution plans are still in progress, however. Lynch hopes to be able  to sell them in convenience stores and also to make them available to students  through some corporate sponsorships. And she is negotiating with a soft-drink  manufacturer who is considering using the calendars as a promotional item.  </P> <P> The calendar is a for-profit endeavor for Lynch's committee, but she says they  will be lucky to break even this year.  </P> <P> Lynch's fellow calendar committee members, who selected the nominees, include:  Thelma Cole, owner of Hair Castles, Santa Ana; Joyce Jordan of El Toro, owner  of Office Services Unlimited; Marlene Dyce of Westminster, a fashion  coordinator; Kathleen Barros of Moreno Valley, president of Access  International in Riverside; Gwen McClellan of Orange, a sales representative  with Digital Equipment Corp., Irvine; Ernesta Wright of Anaheim, who works for  Elite Professional Services, and Tanya Ratcliff of Orange, owner of Tantra  Enterprises Wordsmiths.  </P> <P> Lynch hopes the 1990 calendar will be the first of many for Orange County --  and that the idea will spread to other areas.  </P> <P> And Kenneth Vernon hopes that people will understand what the calendar project  is really all about.  </P> <P> "I guess what I'm trying to say," Vernon explains, "is that I'm not taking any  particular pride in the fact that I'm a black geologist or a white geologist. I  just want to get across that it doesn't matter what color you are. It matters  how hard you strive for what you want to achieve, and color shouldn't be a  barrier towards your goals.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be recognized as a black geologist. I want to be recognized as  a good geologist who happens to be black. And if that is significant to black  kids who are considering vocations, well then, I think that's good."  </P> <P> Nancy Jo Hill is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASU'S REGENTS PUT OFF DISCUSSION OF NEW CAGE COACH  </P> <P> State regents postponed a conference call today about hiring a basketball coach  at Arizona State University, temporarily halting speculation that the job had  been offered to Purdue's Gene Keady.  </P> <P> "It was deferred until early next week," said Rick Wanninger, ASU's assistant  sports information director. He declined to comment on progress in finding a  replacement for Steve Patterson.  </P> <P> Published reports have cited sources who believe Keady has accepted the  position. However, Keady has refused to discuss his plans beyond saying that if  he decides to leave he will tell his employer and players first.  </P> <P> Athletic directors George King of Purdue and Charles Harris of ASU also  declined comment.  </P> <P> Patterson resigned last month with a 48-56 record, leaving his assistant, Bob  Schermerhorn, to coach the last nine games.  </P></p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Israel gets go-ahead for missile THE US has given Israel the go-ahead to continue developing the Arrow missile, a costly ballistic missile interceptor mainly funded under the US Strategic Defence Initiative. The approval comes despite recent concerns in Washington over alleged illicit transfer of US weapons technology by Israel to third countries. Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned company making the Arrow, said it had received an order to carry out the second phase of the missile's development following Pentagon approval. The US government is to fund 72 per cent of the Dollars 322m (Pounds 187m) cost of the 45-month second phase, intended to bring the weapon close to battlefield readiness. Israel will fund the remainder. The Arrow is designed to succeed the Patriot missile, made by Raytheon of the US and deployed against Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf war. The first phase of its development, which has been delayed by technical hitches during test launching, began in 1988 and has so far cost Dollars 158m, 85 per cent borne by the US. IAI also announced plans to establish a public company later this year to develop and manufacture its Amos communications satellite.</p>

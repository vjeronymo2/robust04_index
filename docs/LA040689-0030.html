			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TIMES HONORS TOP PREP CAGERS, OUTSTANDING COACHES  </P> <P> Centers Ed Stokes of St. Bernard and Lisa Leslie of Morningside and coaches  Carl Strong of Torrance and Frank Scott of Morningside were the South Bay award  winners Sunday at The Times high school basketball banquet at the Anaheim  Hilton.  </P> <P> Stokes and Leslie were named players of the year while Strong and Scott were  selected boys and girls coaches of the year. Scott, who guided the Lady  Monarchs to the state Division I title, won the award for the second straight  year.  </P> <P> Stokes, a 6-11 senior, averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and four blocked shots a  game to lead St. Bernard to a 23-6 record, the Camino Real League title and the  second round of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs. His previous honors include  Camino Real League most valuable player and Southern Section Division I player  of the year. He has signed to play for Coach Lute Olson at Arizona.  </P> <P> Torrance was picked by coaches to finish last in the Bay League, but under  Strong the Tartars surprised everyone by contending for the title until the  last week of the season. They finished third and won two games in the Southern  Section 4-AA playoffs before losing to eventual champion San Bernardino in the  quarterfinals. Torrance finished with a 16-11 record.  </P> <P> The 6-5 Leslie established herself as the most dominant girls player in the  state and perhaps the nation by leading Morningside to a 32-1 record and its  first state title. The junior averaged 26 points, 14.6 rebounds and nearly  seven blocked shots as the Lady Monarchs rose to the nation's No. 2 ranking in  USA Today. Leslie was named to the Parade All-American first team.  </P> <P> Scott guided the Morningside girls to their best season ever. They repeated as  Southern Section and regional champions before avenging last year's one-point  loss to Fremont of Oakland in the state Division I final, 60-50. Scott did it  with a team that had only one senior -- point guard JoJo Witherspoon -- and  started two sophomores and one freshman. ROB FERNAS  </P></p>

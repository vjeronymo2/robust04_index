The Japanese media has been reacting favorably to the trip.  Leading newspapers, news agencies and TV stations here have  given prominent coverage to Hata's talks with Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen and the meetings with Chinese President  Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.    As deputy prime minister, as well as foreign minister in the  Hosokawa cabinet, Hata's China trip paves the way for the  planned visit to China by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa this  spring.    Political analysts have pointed out that Hata's journey to  China has helped alleviate the bitter memories of the past, and  renewed bilateral ties enabling a free exchange of opinion.    That the visit marks a major step forward in ushering in a  new era for Sino-Japanese relations was a view widely expressed  in the Japanese media.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 4 Jun (TANJUG) -- The first round of the  working consultations on the territorial division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina between representatives of the three warring  sides and the Contact Group has ended in the French Embassy in  Geneva.    The maps, offered on the basis of drawings by a group of  experts in Washington, are the maps for war, not for peace,  Aleksa Buha, foreign minister for the Srpska republic, told  journalists from TANJUG and Serb Sarajevo Radio-Television. The  maps give 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Muslims and  Croats, and 49 percent to the Serbs, as proposed in the  declaration adopted in Geneva on 13 May. But according to Buha,  the talks should start with the percentage agreed upon within  the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which is 30 percent for the Muslims,  16.5 for the Croats, and 53.5 for the Serbs.    The maps currently on offer have turned the Srpska republic  into separate unconnected areas, which suggests the Muslim  concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is absolutely  unacceptable for the Serb side, Buha said.    Talking about the end of the first round of talks, Srpska  republic president Radovan Karadzic said that during the  exchange of opinions, it became obvious that the Contact Group  favored the Muslim side.    The talks on the cessation of hostilities have not yet  started in the Palais des Nations in Geneva. A Srpska republic  delegation has arrived in the Palais and is waiting for the  arrival of the Muslim and Croat delegations who have been  invited to the meeting by UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi after  the news that the Serbs had withdrawn from the 3-km zone around  Gorazde.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rights issue by Banesto in strong demand BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, yesterday claimed strong demand for its 3-for-1 rights issue, designed to improve the institution's weak capital base by raising some Pta52.6bn (Dollars 395m). Mr Mario Conde, chairman, said 25 per cent of the rights had been subscribed within the first five days of trading. The issue is the first stage of a three-part plan to increase the bank's capital, and the response means JP Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund, which has committed Dollars 200m to Banesto, may reserve its investment for the second tranche. In the second stage, Banesto will place 22.2m shares with investors, including the US institutions grouped in the Corsair fund and Mr Conde. Banesto shares are trading at slightly over Pta2,000 each. The new shares in the rights issue are priced at Pta1,500 and the shares in the placement at Pta1,900. Mr Conde said fee commissions had realised Pta10.5bn in the second quarter of 1993, up 11.5 per cent on the first quarter and 21 per cent on the last quarter of 1992. Average monthly borrowing on the interbank market had been reduced from Pta587.9bn in May to Pta236.6bn last month, Mr Conde said. Bad debts totalled Pta213.7bn in the second quarter, against Pta219.5bn in the first quarter, and provisions now cover 56 per cent of bad debts against 46.5 per cent at end-1992. He said Pta18.3bn had been set aside for bad debts in the second quarter following a Pta10.7bn allocation in the first three months. Total provisions in the first six months of this year are already up on last year's total of Pta24.7bn. The third tranche of the capital raising effort will be a Dollars 400m convertible bond with a coupon of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. A final decision on the timing will be taken after subscription of the rights issue and the share placement ends in the first week of August.</p>

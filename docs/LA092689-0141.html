			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE SAYS SOVIETS JOIN U.S. ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS, ISSUES NEW CHALLENGE  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, going a step further than  President Bush, said today that Moscow will match U.S. reductions in chemical  weapons and he challenged the United States to ban the devices completely and  to halt nuclear testing.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, in a speech to the General Assembly, said Moscow will join the  United States and "radically reduce or completely destroy" all the chemical  weapons it has stockpiled.  </P> <P> But he also issued a new set of challenges. He said the Soviet Union will stop  production of chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and stop making  weapons-grade plutonium and uranium -- all if Washington reciprocates.  </P> <P> The speech was a prompt reply from Moscow to Bush's proposal before the General  Assembly Monday to drastically reduce chemical weapons stockpiles. The proposal  was given to the Soviets during the weekend and announced by Bush in his U.N.  address.  </P> <P> Bush offered an 80% cut in U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles if the Soviets  reciprocate.  </P> <P> The delegates in the hall, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III and  U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, gave Shevardnadze a warm round of applause  after his speech.  </P> <P> Baker met with the Soviet foreign minister for about seven minutes after the  speech, but declined to say what they talked about.  </P> <P> He said Shevardnadze's speech was "very responsive to the President's  statement." He said he had to study it more closely but does not think the  proposals went beyond those of the President.  </P> <P> Speaking to delegates of 159 nations, Shevardnadze said Moscow "is ready to  reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions any day and hour, if the  United States reciprocates."  </P> <P> Moscow has declared several such moratoriums, which the United States has  declined to join. U.S. officials said the Soviets initiated such moratoriums  after completing a series of tests.  </P></p>

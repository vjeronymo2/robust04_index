			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sterling decline boosts BIT OVER THE year ended March 31 1993 British Investment Trust has seen its net asset value rise by 20.7 per cent, principally from the effect on the stock market levels of the fall in the value of sterling in the second half. The value per share was up from an adjusted 164p to 198p. Ordinary shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 616.9m, compared with Pounds 512.4m. On the income side, the contribution from investments fell to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 25m) while interest and other income rose to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 11.5m). Some of the companies within the portfolio cut their dividends and there was a decline on the UK side for the first time in many years. With the outlook for income remaining uncertain in the current year, the directors have decided to maintain the BIT dividend at 4.5p for 1992-93; the final payment is 2.6p. Revenue attributable to ordinary holders was Pounds 13.48m compared with Pounds 13.42m for earnings of 4.48p (adjusted 4.34p) per share.</p>

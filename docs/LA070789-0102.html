			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 5.88 IN MARKET'S 3RD STRAIGHT GAIN  </P> <P> The stock market eked out its third straight gain in another quiet session  Thursday as traders awaited the latest monthly report on employment.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,462.44, bringing its gain  since the start of the week to 22.38 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.45 million shares, against  127.70 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> The Labor Department is due to issue statistics today on the employment  situation for June.  </P> <P> Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of as much as 250,000 in  non-farm payroll employment, more than double the 101,000 preliminary increase  reported for May.  </P> <P> But they also maintain that the June figure will be inflated by a quirk in the  timing of surveys on which the data is based.  </P> <P> Thus, some argue, the latest evidence may not deter the Federal Reserve from  relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a slowdown in business  activity.  </P> <P> Brokers added that a pickup in employment might be warmly received anyway in  the financial world right now, by serving to calm the recession worries that  began to flare up late last month.  </P> <P> Armstrong World Industries rose 1 3/8 to 49 1/4 in active trading on top of a 4  3/8-point jump Wednesday, when the company said the Belzberg family of  Vancouver, Canada, had acquired 9.85% of its stock and was considering a  possible bid for the rest.  </P> <P> Takeover rumors and speculation lifted several other issues, among them Syntex,  up 3/4 at 50; UAL, up 5 1/2 at 152 1/2, and Whitman, up 1 at 34 5/8.  </P> <P> General Public Utilities rose 5/8 to 40 7/8, surpassing highs dating back to  the 1960s. The company, whose stock traded as low as 3 3/8 in the aftermath of  the accident at its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant 10 years ago, raised  its quarterly dividend from 45 cents to 55 cents a share.  </P> <P> In over-the-counter trading, Apple Computer climbed 3/4 to 41 1/4 and Adobe  Systems dropped 2 3/8 to 24 1/2. Apple said it planned to sell its 16.4% stake  in Adobe and was developing products to compete with some Adobe technologies.  </P> <P> As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded  stocks, the market increased $10.80 billion, or 0.34%, in value.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.57 to  178.92.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 367.19, and S&amp;P's  500-stock composite index was up 0.91 at 321.55.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 2.63 to  439.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at  361.11, up 1.99.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks closed higher in light trading, helped by a sharp rise in the  Japanese yen in overseas markets and a drop in short-term domestic interest  rates. The Nikkei 225-share index gained 113.77 points to close at 33,423.48.  </P> <P> In London, stock prices sagged slightly, pulled down by the negative influence  of Wall Street in a thinly traded market. The Financial Times 100-share index  ended the day at 2,161.2, down 1.7 points.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices rebounded amid further signs that the Federal Reserve might be  easing monetary policy and pushing interest rates lower.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose about 7/16 point, or more than  $4.30 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell  to 8.09% from 8.12% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said indications that the Federal Reserve might have eased credit  helped drive bond prices higher.  </P> <P> "The banking system has a large system of reserves," said economist Ward  McCarthy of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. "The Fed was expected  to drain some of those reserves and they didn't."  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9.313%, down from 9.375% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar closed narrowly higher against all key currencies in thin,  uneventful trading after a mixed performance overseas.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the dollar started out higher as traders looked for  bargains following Wednesday's selloff, which stemmed from continued fears that  interest rates will fall because the U.S. economy is slowing.  </P> <P> Gary Lutnick, a trader in the New York office of Banco di Sicilia, said the  currency traded in a fairly narrow range throughout the session in anticipation  of today's unemployment data for June, an important indicator of the state of  the economy.  </P> <P> "People were trying to limit their exposure due to the unemployment numbers,"  he said.  </P> <P> Some dealers said they expected the employment figures to show growth at the  rate of about 200,000 in non-farm payroll employment, about double the 101,000  preliminary increase reported for May.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  fell to 138.80 Japanese yen from 140.20 yen Wednesday. It traded higher in  London at 139.10 yen, and in New York at 138.88 yen, up from 138.40 yen late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The dollar was mixed against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6230 in  London, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.6155. Sterling bought $1.6265 in New  York, down from $1.6285.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mostly higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold  bullion for current delivery rose 40 cents to $386.40 an ounce. Republic  National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $384.25, down 35 cents  from late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Raw coffee futures prices slid to new 8-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar  &amp; Cocoa Exchange as the battered market reacted to news that an expected  freeze in the Brazilian coffee fields had not materialized.  </P> <P> On other markets, sugar futures fell sharply for the second straight day;  energy futures fell; pork futures continued to retreat; grains and soybeans  were mixed, and precious metals were mixed.  </P> <P> Coffee settled 1.49 cents to 6.62 cents lower, with the contract for delivery  in July at 93.38 cents a pound.  </P> <P> The selloff erased all of Wednesday's gains and deepened the market's anxiety  stemming from the suspension of coffee export quotas Monday by the  International Coffee Organization.  </P> <P> Sugar futures lengthened their steep slide on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa  Exchange. Analysts said the market was correcting from an overbought condition  after making strong gains in mid-June.  </P> <P> Sugar settled 0.18 cent to the permitted limit of 0.50 cent lower, with October  at 13.12 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Energy futures sagged on the New York Mercantile Exchange on reports that  striking maintenance and construction workers planned to return to work today  on North Sea oil production platforms.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 26 cents to 54 cents lower, with August  at $20.30 a barrel.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6  </P></p>

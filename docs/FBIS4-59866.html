			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The Interior Ministry today  praised the stand of the majority of lawyers, who issued a  statement on behalf of the Egyptian Society for Young Lawyers to  denounce the moves of a minority of self-interested members of  the Bar Association who claim that they belong to the Islamic  trend.    A responsible security source said the ministry issued a  statement last Saturday on the arrest of a leading group that  had assisted terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, including Lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, a dangerous terrorist who played a major  role in recent terrorist incidents and who was arrested on 3  July 1990. He and others were also charged in Case No. 7 of  1990 in Markaz Isna for attacking citizens and preventing them  from visiting cemeteries.    The source said that the statement also indicated that  Lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani was also charged in Case No. 4116 of 1991,  the jurisdiction of Markaz Isna, when he was caught while  distributing leaflets inciting extremist thought and instigating  acts of violence.    The security source said in his statement that the Interior  Ministry's statement of last Saturday contained a warning about  moves by some self-interested people who try in one way or  another to support terrorism by using some confrontations to  assume false heroic poses.    He added that in its statement the Ministry stressed its  intention to confront these elements firmly and decisively  should they contemplate any attempts to violate legitimacy and  the law under this cover while only aiming to create confusion  among the people.    The source added that this morning some elements known for  their activities in connection with these groups and some  members of the dissolved and banned Muslim Brotherhood incited  some lawyers and misled members of the Bar Association to  assemble at the Bar Association headquarters. There they urged  the lawyers to stage a mass demonstration to rouse the public,  incite them to violate the law, and subject the public to the  danger of infiltration by elements who pursue only sedition and  deception.    Responsible Interior Ministry security sources said the  security forces have emphatically advised these groups  repeatedly not to stage any demonstrations from the Bar  Association headquarters out of concern for the citizens' lives  and security. But, he added, it was evident that there was a  purposeful intention by this renegade minority to carry out  sedition and incitement.    He said this intention was manifested when those who  gathered  inside the Bar Association building threw bricks and stones down  onto the police and passers by and then rushed into the street  in a vociferous demonstration chanting hostile slogans.    The source added that the security forces deployed in the  area intervened immediately to break up the demonstration and  arrested 39 of the leaders. It transpired that there were 27  lawyers among them; the rest were not members of the Bar  Association.    He said that lawyer Mursi Muhammad 'Abd-al-Qadir and  (?teacher) Khalid 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ibrahim al-Jiddawi suffered  slight injuries for which they were hospitalized but no damage  was caused in the area because the security forces took control  of the situation.    The Interior Ministry responsible security source revealed  that the Ministry authorities had received information that some  extremist members of the Bar Association had called on their  colleagues to carry arms to confront the security forces.    He said the Ministry authorities at dawn today compiled a  report on this information, numbered 2293-Qasr al-Nil, and sent  it to the competent prosecution office.    The security source said that the Interior Ministry has been  patient with all the incitement incidents since the death of  terrorist 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, despite the extremely sensitive  security circumstances at this time.    He explained that the Ministry did this to show the  inevitability of democracy, which has been emphasized by the  political leadership; but the attempts by a hireling minority of  Bar Association members prompted the security forces to  decisively confront this morning's attempts to endanger the  Egyptian public's lives and property.    The Interior Ministry will issue a comprehensive statement  containing updated information and details on the issue at a  later time.</p>

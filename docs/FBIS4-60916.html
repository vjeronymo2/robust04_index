			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Katsman: "More Than a Third of Deputies </F> Are Against 26 June Elections"]    [Text] As a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent has learned  from sources close to the Supreme Council, a group of newly  elected deputies began to collect signatures demanding  postponement of the presidential and local elections. According  to preliminary assessments, as of the evening of 26 April, the  group collected 130 signatures. The list, however, is not yet  closed -- the collection of signatures continues. Having  obtained the support of a third of the deputies, the initiators  of this action continue to pursue their goal.    The same sources have reported that the number of  signatories  increased after Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk had revealed  his intention to ask the Supreme Council to change its  resolution on the summer elections. There is another very  interesting fact. Among deputies who have signed the motion,  are those who are affiliated to entirely opposing teams of  candidates for the presidency, including teams which consider  the elections absolutely essential.</p>

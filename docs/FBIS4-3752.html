			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, April 24 (XINHUA)--The No. 1 Automobile  Conglomerate, one of China's leading producers of motor  vehicles, has achieved great success on the market due to its  efforts in producing better cars in line with market demand.    According to officials with the company, in the first  quarter  of this year, it sold 41,000 automobiles of various kinds, and  earned 4.24 billion yuan in return, both showing marked  increases compared with the corresponding figures for the same  period of last year.    As one of China's oldest manufacturers of motor vehicles,  the  conglomerate, headquartered in Changchun, the provincial capital  of northeast China's Jilin Province, has grown into China's  largest auto producer and is now able to turn out lorries, sedan  cars, light-duty trucks, minivans, and buses in more than 100  specifications.    Before 1978, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant used to produce  only a few kinds of automobiles, and concentrated on the  production of "Liberation" brand trucks for about 30 years  without changes.    In the middle 1980s, the central government decided to carry  out structural adjustment of the auto industry step by step, and  issued industrial policies to encourage the production of  different light-duty trucks and sedan cars.    In 1986, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant was listed as a  production center of light-duty trucks, and the next year, it  was made one of China's three major production bases of sedan  cars.    Enjoying preferential policies concerning loans and  fund-raising, the plant got 300 hectares of land around the old  factory site to build two new workshops for producing light-duty  trucks and sedan cars.    Besides importing sophisticated auto-making technology from  Japan and the United States, the plant merged four other  factories in Changchun and Jilin cities, and soon upgraded its  light-duty trucks which are believed to have met the world's  advanced standards.    A large number of light-duty trucks, new versions of  "Liberation" vehicles produced with low costs and high quality,  have been put onto the market since the beginning of this year  and they are selling like hot cakes.    At the same time, the plant has also started development on  28 types of other light-duty trucks.    Officials with the company said that the plant would turn  out  50,000 light-duty trucks this year.    In the meantime, construction of the sedan car production  center has also made strides. At present, the No. 1 Automobile  Conglomerate is able to produce three categories of sedan  cars--Red Flag, Audi and Jieda.    Construction of the Sino-German joint venture plant between  the No. 1 Automobile Company and the Volkswagen company of  Germany is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and  its workshops will produce 150,000 sedan cars a year.    Besides this production center of sedan cars in Changchun,  China has got two other key production bases of sedan cars--one  in Shanghai and the other in Shiyan city, central China's Hubei  Province, in addition to three other centers in Beijing, Tianjin  and Guangzhou for producing Beijing jeeps, Xiali cars and  Peugeot cars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japanese trade and finance  officials are hoping bilateral insurance talks scheduled for  Wednesday [1 June] and Thursday in Tokyo will set the pace for  the resumed Japan-U.S. "framework" trade negotiations and an  overall easing of the U.S. stance on targets.    Already comments from both sides have paved the way for  agreement -- at least as far as the insurance sector is  concerned.    One senior Japanese Finance Ministry official has said the  United States has acknowledged that setting yardsticks to  measure Japan's market access is not appropriate.    And a U.S. diplomatic official in Tokyo has named the  insurance business in saying problems exist in adopting  objective criteria to measure market shares in areas full of  regulations, which he distiguished from the free-hand automobile  sector.    In fact, negotiators from both sides had suggested insurance  talks were approaching consensus before the overall talks hit a  snag due to sharp differences on two of the three priority areas  -- automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment.    If their comments hold true and negotiations are wrapped up,  the future of the still unclear agreement reached by the two  nations last week for reopening bilateral trade talks may become  more certain.    The breakthrough during exploratory talks came after a  four-day marathon in Washington, with the two sides agreeing to  set both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks instead of  numerical targets for each of the negotiation sectors.    The framework talks started in July last year under an  accord  by then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill  Clinton in Tokyo with the goal of setting a new framework for  the two nations' trade relations.    But they were ruptured in February when then Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach a common ground  over their definition of "objective criteria" during a summit in  Washington.    The insurance talks will reopen the stalled framework  negotiations Wednesday in Tokyo. Talks on other priority areas  will follow.    Automobiles and auto parts are scheduled for Thursday and  Friday in Washington, and government procurement of  telecommunications equipment in Tokyo on Friday and Saturday,  and medical equipment in Tokyo next Tuesday and Wednesday.    Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated that  Japan will not offer any new commitments on the insurance  negotiations, which are in the hands of his ministry.    "We will put our upmost efforts into realizing the voluntary  measures" that are included in the March market-opening package,  he said in a recent news meeting.    Indeed, the measures encompass the majority of U.S demands,  including deregulation, simpler licensing and adoption of a  brokering system.    The remaining key issues are the unclear "keiretsu," mutual  stockholding relationships between insurers and sales agents,  and a third area such as policies for cancer and nursing care.    The last area appears to hold the clue for the direction of  the insurance talks, with the U.S. calling on Japan to keep its  restriction on Japanese insurers. As a form of special  treatment, Japan only allows foreign insurers to engage in the  area.    Japan is expected to lift the ban in about two years, with  the insurance council, an advisory panel to the finance  minister, now preparing a report on legal revisions. The  package to reform insurance-related laws for the first time in  50 years is scheduled for submission to the Diet next year.    The U.S. is asking Japan to wait for five years at least. A  U.S. Government source said earlier this week that planned  revision in the third area would hamper new entries by foreign  insurers.    Meanwhile, Japanese officials are bewildered over the U.S.  demand, which they say contradicts deregulatory steps.    On the "keiretsu" practice, Japan is expected to seek  support  for its compromise of adopting a brokering system.    A ministry negotiator said the government cannot intervene  in  the "keiretsu" system, which is a private-sector dealing, and  noted that such unfair practices toward foreign insurers also  prevail in the U.S.    He cited the brokering system that is restricted in many  states and the liability reserves some U.S. states oblige  foreign insurers to build up.    Indeed, the negotiator said one major dispute has been over  Japan's demand for "two-way negotiations" to discuss such unfair  practices in the U.S.    Japanese industry leaders said they just do not understand  why the insurance business was included in the framework talks.    Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance  Association,  said Japan in fact has a trade deficit with the U.S. in the  insurance field.    "I haven't heard of any complaints from U.S. insurers  already  present in Japan, and many of them have been successful here,"  he said.    In conceding there is a lack of communication, Takashi  Onoda,  chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association, said his  industry plans to set up a forum to exchange views with U.S.  industry leaders.    A ministry source said, "all we needed was a bit of U.S.  compromise" on numerical targets by splitting the insurance area  from other fields.</p>

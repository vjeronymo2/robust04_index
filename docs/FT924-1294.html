			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Supplying drilling module A contract worth abut NKr400m (Pounds 38.1m) for fabricating the drilling module for the Heidrun production platform has been awarded to KVAERNER ROSENBERG. Placed by Conoco Norway Inc, the development operator for the Heidrun field off central Norway, the contract will be executed by the Kvaerner Egersund yard in Egersund south of Stavanger. An average of 300 people will be employed on the module over an 18-month period, with the workforce expected to peak at around 600 next summer. Work will begin immediately and last until July 1994. The Heidrun contract gives Kvaerner Egersund a good base workload up to spring 1994, and raises the yard's order backlog to about NKr800m (Pounds 76.2m).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- While clashes continue between the Turkish  security forces and the clandestine Workers Party of Kurdistan  (PKK) militants in southeastern Turkey, the militants announced  a series of new command strategies. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan  reportedly ordered the PKK's so-called regional "states" to be  divided up into "field commands."    Previously, the PKK's command structure was based on a  system  of regional states. These were Botan, Amed, Mardin, Garzan,  Serhat, Dersim, Devrimci GAP, Behdinan, and the southeastern  states. Now, as a result of Ocalan's decision, the states are  to be divided up into three areas, identified as the north,  central, and south field commands.    According to Ocalan, coordination in the region has to be  improved since regional development is being hindered. Ocalan  is quoted as saying: "We have to know how to organize the field  commands to increase the power of the organization. We feel  this new system will be very effective and useful."    Furthermore, the PKK leader also reportedly ordered an  increase in the number of attacks on rural areas and cities.  "We will apply all the rules of militarization, and attacks  will be conducted by our guerrilla forces," he said.    According to the Kurdish-German News Agency "Kurd-A," Ocalan  said: "We cannot continue to be satisfied with the present  level of fighting and the number of guerrilla forces. The  number of guerrillas has to be increased to 50,000, otherwise we  cannot achieve a strategic result."    Referring to the importance of the new strategy, the PKK  leader added: "The field command posts are necessary in order  to bring about a full political solution. There are targets  that will be hit by our guerrillas either by infiltration or  through assassination." Ocalan commented on the PKK's methods:  "Secrecy is the weapon of the guerrilla to the end, unlike in  the story of Don Quixote. We will chop them up and eat them bit  by bit. The militia will be in action. For example we can  prepare two militia units which can assassinate and carry out  sabotage activities."    By giving these instructions, the separatist terrorist  leader  has given his approval for assassinations to be carried out.  Sources known to be close to Ocalan say that these  assassinations will focus on informers and, later, anybody in a  "target position."    The first example of this strategy was seen Sunday with the  killing of the former Faysal Kut. A former PKK commander of the  Mardin region, Kut had been accused of stealing 1 billion  Turkish Lira from the organization.    Meanwhile, there have been clashes between government  security forces and the PKK in the mountains close to the  district of Saimbeyli in the Adana region. It is reported that  the PKK is organizing in the region in order to move quickly to  the Taurus mountains. The process of organization is reportedly  being carried out by militants of the Turkish Revolutionist  People's Party (TDHP), founded under the supervision of the PKK.</p>

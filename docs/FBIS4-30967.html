			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Garmaz: "Will the Livno Bomb Demolish the </F> Croat-Muslim Pact?"]    [Text] When one of the six mosques in Livno, Curcinica,  built in the first half of the 19th century in the very center  of Livno, was blown up at 0400 hours on 25 April, this was the  strongest evidence of the brittleness of the Croat-Muslim  agreement signed in Washington. Regardless of whether the mosque  was blown up by radical Croat nationalists, Muslims seeking a  pretext to continue the war with the Croats, or on the other  hand Serbs with an interest in demolishing the Washington  agreement, military and police authorities of Herceg-Bosna  simply should not have allowed such sabotage to occur,  especially not in an area so politically delicate. It is worth  recalling that politicians of Herceg-Bosna had rejected Drazen  Budisa's statement about the mosque demolished on territory  under Croatian control precisely by citing the example of Livno,  which presumably meant that Livno was one of the rare places in  Bosnia and Herzegovina where interethnic relations were tolerant  to at least some degree.    "Breaches of the Washington agreement are being committed  both by representatives of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union]  and representatives of the SDA [Democratic Action Party]. They  sometimes behave as though that agreement had not even been  signed," we were told by Professor Ivo Komsic, president of the  Croatian National Council [HNV], whom we talked to by satellite  telephone on Monday morning, 25 April, before news of the  mosque's destruction had been published.    Negotiations about who would occupy places of leadership in  the federation were taking place simultaneously with demolition  of the mosque, and Komsic's judgment about the willingness of  the Croats and Bosnian Muslims to actually carry out the  Washington agreement. Although those negotiations were to have  been completed already, so that the expectation was that on  Saturday, 23 April, candidates would be proclaimed for president  of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and prime minister of  Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is obvious that an agreement has not  yet been reached on that, and that no one knows when it will be  reached.    Instead of choosing the highest officials of the joint  state,  the two sides are once again lodging accusations against one  another in official communications, stating, for example, that  "the Bosnian Muslim side has not performed certain tasks  contained in the Washington agreement."    Finally, even in the Croatian media, after giving preference  to Bosnia and Herzegovina for a time, are speaking once again  about Herceg-Bosna as a legal political structure with almost  the rank of a state.    "I strongly reproach the Croatian media for perpetuating in  this way a quasi-state which the Croats themselves consented to  abolish in the Washington agreement," says Komsic, president of  the Croatian National Council.  <H5>  Provocation or Reflection of Chilled Relations </H5>   The Livno case, whether it really was only a successful  provocation or on the other hand a manifestation of really bad  Croat-Muslim relations, symbolizes most precisely the political  situation that has cooled once again between Sarajevo on the one  hand and Zagreb and Grude on the other, following a few weeks of  public idyll. In Livno itself, which we visited the day after  the explosion, the reactions of local Croats were utterly  contradictory. While some Livno inhabitants commented on the  demolition of the mosque with a smile, saying that the "first  Muslim missile had been launched," official representatives of  Croatian authorities condemned this act of sabotage in the  severest terms.    "This vandalism is a direct attack on the honor and dignity  of the Croatian people of Livno and the Livno area, on the  rightness of its defense of its native places and the 1,000-year  presence of Croats in these areas," we were told by Mate  Franjicevic, assistant commander for political activity of the  Livno Petar Kresimir IV Livno Brigade of the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council]. Franjicevic wanted to especially emphasize  that in the city of Livno, during the entire time of  Croat-Muslim conflicts, while young Croatian lads were dying at  the hands of the Muslims, not a single murder was recorded, nor  was any Muslim religious building demolished, which in other  places occurred on both sides.    "This act seems to have been aimed at furnishing an argument  to all those who saw demolished mosques in Livno some six months  ago, since something to that effect was written in some scenario  cooked up who knows where," Assistant Commander Franjicevic  believes.    Aside from Mr. Franjicevic, other officials of the  department  for political activity of the Livno Brigade of the HVO did not  want to talk about the bombing of the mosque. Instead, the  GLOBUS journalists in Livno were constantly under the  supervision of the military police. Thus our crew was frustrated  in its attempt to photograph the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic  alongside the remains of the mosque. Two members of the military  police escorted the GLOBUS reporters to the chief of the  military and civilian police, who already knew all details about  their movement in the Livno area that day.    The dramatic and shaky atmosphere in Livno, as best  indicated  by the nervous behavior of the military police, indicates for  one thing how difficult it is in the field to reestablish  cooperation between Croats and Muslims. It seems indeed that  interethnic tensions are now growing in places where there had  not been conflicts and that the situation is more difficult than  in those parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina which were directly  affected by the Croat-Muslim war.    The Livno imam, who was willing to talk even after the  GLOBUS  journalists were detained, testified to that.  <H5>  Has the Washington Agreement Provoked Crimes? </H5>   "Everything in Livno has taken a turn for the worse since  the  Washington agreement," is the opinion of Imam Dizdarevic. "I  will describe to you a banal example which provides good  confirmation of this. Before the agreement was signed, we  Muslims had no problems in Livno if we strolled through the city  wearing a beret. Now, however, the Croats force us to take it  off."    Another Muslim, who does not allow us to use his name for  reasons of personal safety, says that since the signing of the  Washington agreement the Muslims have become slaves in Livno.  "We have only one restaurant we go to. It is called `Cincar,'"  this man in his sixties says, and continues: "It is already  becoming the rule for the soldiers of the HVO to come there at a  certain time of the day and order the restaurant closed, and  they lead away all the Muslims who are there to do various  demeaning jobs for them, from washing dishes in a Croatian  restaurant all the way to digging foundations for houses the  Croats are building," our informant described the position of  Muslims in Livno.    "The situation was similar in Podhum, before the mosque was  also demolished there in October or November last year," says  the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic. "That mosque no longer exists  at all, nor does anyone dare to recall where it stood. To top  off this farce, they force us Muslims to haul away the stones  that were left from the demolished mosque," Dizdarevic says,  convinced nevertheless that the Livno Muslims are in a much  better position than the Muslims in nearby villages, since  members of the HVO are said to be taking away their livestock,  money, tractors, trucks....    According to the 1991 population census, in Livno Opcina  there were about 5,700 Muslims and 940 "Yugoslavs," who were  mainly Muslims as well. In the Croatian Defense Council,  according to a statement by Maj. Gen. Milivoje Petkovic, there  are more than 1,000 Muslims. Nevertheless, on 21 July 1991 the  Muslim population was disarmed. There was even fighting in which  six Muslims were killed.    Since the disarmament many Muslims in the Livno area have  been left unemployed; many have been driven out. It is said that  little cafes and automobiles are being taken away from the  Muslims.    The Livno Curcinica Mosque, which was bombed very  professionally at daybreak on 26 April (although the mosque was  in the center of town, adjoining houses were hardly damaged at  all), had been subject to bomb attacks before that.    Another particularly important element of pressure on the  Livno Muslims mentioned by GLOBUS informants is the ban on the  SDA, the leading Muslim party, and the effort to persuade the  Muslim population to go over en masse to the Muslim Democratic  Party of Armin Pohara, who is suitable to Zagreb.    The same morning when the mosque was blown up in the center  of Livno, Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic had his first official  visit in nine and a half months with Mr. Bakovic, mayor of  Livno, who said on that occasion that "destruction of the mosque  is not indicative of the view of Croatian policy towards the  Muslims." Speaking about the explosion itself, Mr. Bakovic said  that those forces which are resisting the federation of Croats  and Muslims as a permanent political solution are most probably  behind that sabotage.    And while in the field the Washington agreement is mainly  being carried out in its military aspect, in that Generals Roso  and Delic are really collaborating very well, so that even  President Komsic of the HNV, usually skeptical towards the  actions of the HVO, believes that at the moment there is no  danger that new conflicts will break out, what has been  happening between Sarajevo and Grude or, perhaps, Mostar)  suggests very skeptical conclusions about the good intentions of  the signatories of the agreement on a Croat-Muslim federation in  Bosnia and Herzegovina.    "The Constitution of the federation is completely clear. It  states that the cantons on the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina  now free are coming together to form a federation. The  federation, then, is a complex state community consisting of  cantons, not of two entities with predominantly Croat and  predominantly Bosnian Muslim populations. That principle of  ethnicity as the main criterion for creation of the state has  been rejected in the Washington agreement," Professor Komsic  believes.  <H5>  The HDZ Has Gambled Away the Trust of Bosnian Croats </H5>   Komsic finds the second circumstance that makes it difficult  to implement the agreement on the federation in the politicians  who are supposed to carry out that agreement: "I am not certain  that the politicians in the present leadership of Herceg-Bosna  are sincerely willing to carry out the Washington agreement.  They have been conducting a secessionist policy, perhaps some of  them have even been mixed up in acts like ethnic cleansing. How  can they now sincerely advocate an integrated Bosnia and  Herzegovina," Komsic reflects. In response to our direct  question of whether he thinks that the leadership of  Herceg-Bosna still has a political option in reserve aside from  the Washington agreement, Komsic replied in the affirmative.    The third main problem in carrying out the Washington  agreement is the impossibility of achieving consensus on the key  people of the federation. Dr. Ivo Komsic believes that it is not  necessary for the Croats at the top level of the federation to  be represented by a politician from the Croatian Democratic  Union, since the Croatian Democratic Union, according to Komsic,  has lost its political legitimacy. "The HDZ has betrayed the  political conception with which it was victorious in the 1990  elections, when it favored the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Ever since it allowed itself to become involved in creating the  quasistate of Herceg-Bosna, the HDZ ceased to be the legitimate  representative of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The policy  imposed by the Washington agreement, which speaks about an  integral Bosnia and which protects the interests of Croats in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, is contrary to the policy which the HDZ  has been conducting over the last eighteen months, and that is  why I really do not think that the Croats should be represented  at the top level of the federation by a man from the HDZ," Mr.  Komsic says, himself a candidate opposing Kresimir Zubak,  president of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, for the  highest Croat political position in the federation.    Komsic nevertheless does not reject the possibility that  Kresimir Zubak will become president of the federation or prime  minister, "if a political agreement among all parties is  achieved to that effect, and if the background checks prove that  Zubak has not compromised himself in what he has done in the  executive bodies of Herceg-Bosna."    Implementation of the Washington agreement is burdened by  many details and several essential political issues. The most  important thing, however, is whether the real willingness exists  on the Croatian and Muslim sides to implement that agreement, to  establish the federation between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and  then also the confederation with the Republic of Croatia. A  number of events in the past several days -- among which the  bombing of the mosque in Livno is particularly important  concerning relations of Croats and Muslims in the field, while  the failure to reach agreement on the highest government  representatives of the federation is extremely dangerous from  the political standpoint -- a number of such events, then, show  that the Croat-Muslim agreement is in serious trouble.</p>

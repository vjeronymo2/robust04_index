			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Privatised training provider fails ASTRA TRAINING Services, which was formed from the government-run Skills Training Agency three years ago to operate former Department of Employment training centres, is understood to have called in the receivers. Astra, which has headquarters in Sheffield and operates training centres throughout the country, provides services for companies and for Training and Enterprise Councils. It is the biggest private-sector provider of training. The government paid a Civil Service management buy-out team Pounds 11m to take over 45 of the Skills Training Agency's 60 centres. Eight of the centres were subsequently closed in a management effort to cut costs as Astra, which was training about 12,000 people a year, ran into financial difficulties. The original workforce of 2,500 at privatisation has been cut to about 1,000. Astra suffered in the recession as companies took more rigorous control of their training budgets, restricting the numbers of staff sent for training and the range of courses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a report from Route 68-western Siem Reap  battlefield:    1. On 24 April, our forces attacked and completely liberated  Angkor Chum District town. We seized a DK-75 and a DK-82.    2. Also on 24 April, we completely liberated Kouk Dong  commune and 18 villages around this commune. We also completely  liberated 12 villages in Nokor Pheas commune.    The people are very happy for having freed themselves from  the claws of the archcriminals communist Vietnamese and  two-headed government. Villagers have begun to till their lands  for rice paddies. They are no longer forced to serve as puppet  soldiers.    3. On the same day, we attacked the invading forces at  Chongkal, killing two of them and wounding three others.</p>

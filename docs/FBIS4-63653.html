			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The Crimean issue can be resolved only if Ukraine's  integrity and the territory's status remain unchanged, President  Leonid Kravchuk said speaking on the eve of a meeting between  Ukrainian and Crimean legislators in Kiev on Tuesday. He hopes  for comprise to be achieved.    Ukraine's statehood and integrity is the drawing line which  no one including Crimea is allowed to cross, Kravchuk said.    He called for a status quo that existed before last Friday  when the Crimean parliament passed a resolution to restore the  republic's constitution of May 6, 1992 which provides for  greater regional autonomy and dual citizenship to the Crimeans.  IF Note: On the same day, the Ukrainian parliament vetoed down  the decision by Crimean legislators who had in turn suspended  Kiev's resolution a day after.    For his own part, Kravchuk said Kiev's decision would  automatically become null and void as soon as the Crimean  parliament suspended its resolution of May 20.    The Crimean delegation flying out to Kiev on Tuesday wants  three main issues to be put on the agenda of talks there -- dual  citizenship, economic and financial matters (a banking union  between Crimea and Russia) and armed forces, one source close to  the Crimean parliament told Interfax.    He said that although Simferopol did not bank on a complete  breakthrough in the talks, it was sending a delegation to Kiev  to avoid further confrontation and build up bridges with Ukraine.    In the meantime, Speaker of the Crimean Parliament Sergey  Tsekov is convinced that the Supreme Soviet had to restore the  1992 constitution as the only and softest option for regulating  Simferopol's relations with Ukraine.    He admitted that the ruling Russia alliance's final goal was  to gain independence from Ukraine and unify with Russia. Tsekov  does not rule out the possibility of reunification with Russia  together with Ukraine.    Tsekov hopes that more sensible Ukrainian leaders will not  allow a souring of relations with Crimea.    Asked if the Crimean parliament had gone a bit too far in  its  demands for greater autonomy, Kravchuk said it would have to toe  the line.  IF Note: Chief presidential advisor for domestic policies  Nikolay Mikhalchenko said Kravchuk may ask parliament for  appropriate powers to ensure the country's sovereignty and  integrity as guarantor of the constitution if Simferopol failed  to rescind its decision. However, he declined to say whether  this meant the imposition of presidential rule or declaration of  a state of emergency in Crimea.    Kravchuk said that Kiev's position outlined by Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko's appeal to other countries "has found  full understanding throughout the world". This also includes  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev whom he quoted as saying  recently that "Russia will never raise the question of Ukraine's  integrity".    Kravchuk said the country's integrity was laid down in a  bilateral agreement between Kiev and Moscow as well as a joint  statement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and U.S.    Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin  and  Yefim Zvyagilsky meet in Moscow on Monday to discuss the  situation around Crimea and how to defuse tension between Kiev  and Simferopol. The meeting follows last Friday's telephone  conversation between Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says that the talks in Moscow  must focus on respect for human rights (above all, the right to  a peaceful life) as well as for self-determination but with  understanding that "Crimea is a sovereign republic within  Ukraine".  IF Note: Yeltsin spoke of receiving assurances from the  Ukrainian leader during last Friday's telephone conversation  that Kiev would refrain from using force to try to resolve the  dispute.    But a senior member of Kravchuk's office in an interview  with  Interfax criticized Yeltsin's statement.    He said that "Ukraine is an independent state and the  methods  it chooses to use for resolving internal conflicts depend  exclusively on the will of its people and parliament.  Undoubtedly, these will be in line with the Ukrainian  constitution and laws. Ukraine will always go by international  law".    The official spoke of being surprised at Yeltsin's statement  saying that "it is important that neither Russia nor Ukraine  meddle in Crimean affairs". He said that one may well infer  that Russia wanted the same status in relations with Crimea as  Ukraine of which Crimea was part.    Some reports say Prime Minister Zvyagilsky may meet the  Russian leader if he and his Russian counterpart Viktor  Chernomyrdin have made a breakthrough in Monday's talks in  Moscow.</p>

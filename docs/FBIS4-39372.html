			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gulsafa Ahmedova from a meeting between President </F> Geydar Aliyev and UK Ambassador to Azerbaijan Thomas Young in  Baku on 7 Jun--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Ahmedova] Republic President Geydar Aliyev  today received UK Ambassador to Azerbaijan Thomas Young at the  latter's request. During the meeting, the ambassador presented  to Geydar Aliyev a number of photographs that reminded the  president of his contacts in London.    In reminding him that the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II has  coincided with such a pleasant occasion, the Azerbaijani  president conveyed his sincere wishes to the UK people.    [Aliyev] Today is the birthday of your queen. I have sent a  letter of congratulations to the queen of Great Britain. Our  meeting fell on this day. You had requested a meeting some days  ago. Unfortunately, I had no opportunity, and maybe it was good  that the meeting took place on the queen's birthday. I  congratulate you; please convey my congratulations to the  esteemed queen, and wish happiness and peace to your country and  people.    [Young, in English with interpreter providing Azeri  translation] I have received your letter of congratulations. We  have sent it to the queen. I know that she will be most  grateful for your good wishes. It is an indication of, I think,  of the closeness between Azerbaijan and the UK that your own  national day, the 28th of May, is separated by a small period of  10 days from our own national day. I think we should work in  future to bring the dates even closer together. If I may say,  Mr. President, I was most grateful for the welcome and  hospitality you gave to [UK Minister of Energy] Mr. Tim Eggar  when he was here two weeks ago. He was very grateful to be  accommodated in your best house and to be entertained by you  personally for dinner. He benefited particularly from his  discussions with you on Nagorno- Karabakh and on the oil  question. The oil and gas exhibition showed that there are many  areas where the UK and Azerbaijan can cooperate. [passage  omitted]    You asked Mr. Eggar about discussions between Mr. [Douglas]  Hurd and Mr. Kozyrev in Russia. They met in both Murmansk and  in Moscow two weeks ago. Mr. Hurd urged Mr. Kozyrev to  integrate the Russian peace plan into that of the CSCE. He said  that the UK Government did not want a separate Russian force  outside CSCE control. He asked Mr. Kozyrev to make the Russians  work with [Minsk Group chairman] Eliasson, with Mr. Eliasson,  and to stop the confusion. The UK Government will continue to  press for CSCE leadership of the peace effort. I am sure that  other CSCE members, as well as ourselves, are keeping up  pressure for CSCE political leadership of this effort. On the  practical side, Britain is committed to provide a signals unit  for the CSCE force. And we shall provide other army and  diplomatic representatives in support of Mr. Eliasson. To  enable us and the UK Government to work with the latest  information, I wonder if you can tell me what has been happening  in Baku in the last few days on this question.    [Aliyev] I again thank you for the photographs you gave me.  They reminded me of my contacts in London and particularly my  sincere and businesslike talks with your country's prime  minister, Mr. John Major. I once more indicate that I was  pleased with those talks. One of the photographs depicts the  exchange of numerous agreements between Mr. Major and myself.  The Azerbaijani society and people warmly welcomed the signing  of these agreements. However, the task of our two countries now  is to implement these agreements.    Our meetings with Mr. Eggar here were also very fruitful  and beneficial. This [oil] exhibition organized with your  country's private oil company BP was a major event in  Azerbaijan's life. I think that this exhibition will help  develop ties between Azerbaijan and the Western oil companies  and with firms active in other industrial sectors, specifically  with UK firms. Therefore, I reiterate my favorable opinion of  this exhibition and I ask that you inform Mr. Eggar that I was  very pleased with our meeting.    The information you gave me about the meeting between Mr.  Hurd and Kozyrev in Murmansk is of great interest to me. The  principled stance of the UK on this important problem will  greatly help in its solution. The continued support to be given  on this issue by the UK to the Minsk Group, and to Jan Eliasson  personally, I hope will, as you already indicated, help stop the  war between Azerbaijan and Armenia and peacefully settle the  Karabakh problem. Therefore, send my regards to Mr. Douglas  Hurd. I now recall my very substantive and fruitful meetings  with him in London. I would like you inform him that I would  hope that he continues with his efforts to further develop the  ties between Azerbaijan and the UK on the basis of our London  talks and particularly to extricate Azerbaijan from its present  war condition. I believe that after my visit to your country,  to London, ties between Azerbaijan and the UK are developing  quite fast. I invited Mr. Major and Mr. Douglas Hurd to  Azerbaijan. I hope with your effort these invitations will  materialize. Cooperation on oil between Azerbaijan and the UK  has a great future. As you already noted, there is also  favorable opportunities for cooperation in other fields, with  other firms such as (?Kaizerin) Engineering Company, (?GBP) in  the communications sector, and in aluminum production.    I want to inform you again that I will personally take the  necessary measures to develop these economic ties.    I also want to say a few words on the continuing talks on  cooperation in the oil sector between the Western firms and  Azerbaijan. A regular meeting between the representatives of  the Azerbaijani state oil company and representatives of the  Western oil companies opened in Istanbul today. I received the  representatives of our oil firm two days before their departure  to Istanbul. We held a detailed discussion. They informed me  in detail on issues they were going to raise during the upcoming  talks and received the necessary instructions from me. I hope  that the talks that opened in Istanbul today will yield very  positive results.    In this connection, I want to draw your attention to a  problem. Of late, the Western companies felt a certain  uneasiness in connection with an insignificant incident. You are  aware that the Russian Foreign Ministry submitted a brief note  to the UK Embassy in Moscow in connection with our cooperation  in the oil sector. Purportedly, this note calls for caution on  this subject because the status of the Caspian Sea has not yet  been established. However, what I told the reception of the  heads of the Western firms during the exhibition is that no  attention should be given to such insignificant information.  The Azerbaijani oil men have been extracting oil from the  Caspian basin since 1949. The discovery and exploitation of the  oil fields in the Caspian sea has a great history, and all this  is linked to the Azerbaijani oil men and scientists. Therefore,  no one, no force, no country can deprive us, the Azerbaijani  Republic and people, from this right. Secondly, so far no  question of the status of the Caspian sea has been raised.  There was no such issue on the agenda. If any state has a say  on the oil extraction by anyone, in this case oil extraction by  Azerbaijan, in a certain sector of the Caspian, then that state  should make its views known to Azerbaijan. If the Russian state  and government has a say or objection on this issue, then it  should contact Azerbaijan, they have nothing to do with the UK.  This shows that if there was a really serious matter, a letter  or note would have been sent to Azerbaijan. No such note or  letter has come to Azerbaijan. In addition, I can say that  Russia's Lukoil firm is participating in our consortium. We  consented to its participation. That is, we included it in the  consortium because it concluded an agreement with us. The  essence of this is that the oil fields in these sectors belong  to Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan has sovereignty over them.    Despite all this, seeing that certain firms are somewhat  uneasy, I held a telephone conversation with Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on 31 May. I informed him that the  Russian Foreign Ministry--actually I have seen that note and it  had no signature-- has taken such an action. Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin informed me that he had no  knowledge about this affair and that the Russian Government had  no such problem, that the status of the Caspian is on the agenda  of neither Russia nor other countries. He informed me that  Azerbaijan's oil fields in the Caspian basin are known to  Russia, and we know that Azerbaijan is exploiting its own oil  fields and is holding talks with the Western firms for their  future exploitation. Therefore, he told me that Russia had no  problem on this issue. He told me that I could officially  announce this in the name of the [Russian] prime minister.    I instructed Natik Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijani  state  oil company, to formally announce this statement of the Russian  prime minister during the Istanbul meeting today, and to declare  that this is the view of the head of the Russian Government.  However, it is not known who wrote that note, maybe it was  anonymous.    In giving this information to you, I hope that you will  inform London, your government, and your Foreign Ministry about  this. I want to repeat that there is no reason for concern on  this issue. We are going ahead with our own work and we are  continuing the talks with the Western oil companies. I repeat  that I have instructed our delegation to see that the talks lead  to the signing of the contract.</p>

The two sides considered ways to resolve the Karabakh  conflict in the light of Russia's mediatory initiative and the  peacemaking mission of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe.    Araktsyan said the Armenian side, as a gesture of goodwill,  stated its readiness to ensure the transit of all freight by  rail across Armenian territory from Turkey to the Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic and the transmission of electric power for  Nakhichevan through the Armenian power grid.    At the close of the meeting, the Armenian parliament chief  said the Azerbaijani side is inclined to recognise  Nagorno-Karabakh as a full-fledged participant in the talks.    The meeting was held in an atmosphere of mutual  understanding  and constructiveness, Guliyev pointed out. He agreed with his  Armenian counterpart that the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh can be  resolved only politically, not militarily.    Bilateral consultations will be continued, the chiefs of two  parliaments said, according to the spokesman.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / People: Heron quits Capel for SNC David Heron, the longest-serving director of James Capel, is cutting loose after 34 years to head up Smith New Court's equity derivatives operation on January 1. Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, says Heron will be given a 'blank piece of paper' to develop the company's global equity derivatives business. 'We were surprised that he left (Capel),' he said, but we were keen to gain his expertise on the sorts of derivative instruments clients want in different parts of the world. Heron previously ran Capel's derivatives unit, but following the Hongkong Bank takeover, the derivatives business at Midland and Capel has been increasingly decentralised, with, for example, UK equity derivatives moved to the domain of stock trading. Recently his projects at Capel have included a scheme to raise corporate capital for the Lloyds insurance market.</p>

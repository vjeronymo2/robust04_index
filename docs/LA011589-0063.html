			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION  </P> <P> I was very moved by the information provided about the individuals Elaine Woo  interviewed, and their righteous indignation over the threat to redefine "Who  Is a Jew?" (Dec. 22).  </P> <P> We live in a changing world and each of us must constantly adapt and  re-evaluate what our place is within that world. The couples she interviewed  certainly coped with the tragedies they were confronted with, and their  adjustment is one to be in awe of. When one has made the decision to convert to  another religion, one can only admire the determination and conviction that led  one to take the steps to realize that goal. As with many crucial decisions in  our lives, our deep philosophical searchings cannot be ignored nor can they be  legislated as inadequate or invalid by those with prejudiced viewpoints.  </P> <P> BARBARA H. KAPLAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

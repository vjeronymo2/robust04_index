			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brice Lalonde, president of the Ecology </F> Generation party and former environment minister, by Arnaud  Hubert; date and place not given: ``France Does Not Have  Nuclear Policy'' -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS  introduction]    [Text] Brice Lalonde, former environment minister, has just  returned from a fact-finding visit to Russia and Ukraine and is  drawing up a report on the nuclear power stations in those  countries which he will submit to the European and French bodies  in the coming weeks. The president of Ecology Generation thinks  that the problems of the French civilian nuclear industry are  only just beginning, but that the real urgency lies in Eastern  Europe.    Hubert: How do you interpret the Cadarache  accident?    Lalonde: I think we are busy experiencing what  happened in the United States. Our sites are beginning to age,  and age badly. This is a problem for which we are not prepared.  I think that with regard to Rapsodie, the risks were  underestimated.    Hubert: Can or should this accident call into  question the restarting of the Superphenix?    Lalonde: I do not think that the two events should  be linked. The only common point is that the Cadarache accident  is due to sodium, which is found in very large quantities in  Superphenix. But Superphenix is an installation which bears no  resemblance to the Cadarache installation. Rapsodie was out of  use and I have the impression that this tank was cleaned in a  rather slipshod way. Whereas all the fairies are watching over  Superphenix and protecting it. Superphenix had to be shut down  less because of a possible danger -- which exists -- than  because its design was fundamentally a mistake and it became a  financial drain. It will one day be necessary to admit that  this story of converting it into an incinerator is a total lie.    Hubert: What is therefore now the order of  priorities in France?    Lalonde: The first problem is Phenix, which  strikes me as more of a weak link than Superphenix. We have  just had a problem with the first of the line, the  ``grandfather,'' namely Rapsodie, in the dismantling of this  reactor which no longer serves any purpose and the dangers of  which were underestimated. We still have the Phenix, the  ``father,'' which ought to be shut down. Superphenix shuts down  every five minutes because of alarms. The risk would lie in  switching off the alarms so that they could no longer be heard.  But if I was in government, I would ask for a report on Phenix.    Hubert: Could safety be more effectively  guaranteed in the French civilian nuclear industry?    Lalonde: Of course. At present, we have a risk  factor of one in 100 per year and per installation of an  accident producing radioactive emissions. We ought to increase  that to one in 1,000. Our engineers ought to be asked to improve  this probability. They can do so, but they are not doing so  because nobody has asked them to. In this country, there is a  routine, there are habits, factions which continue their  business, and politicians who do not know what orders to give.  In short, there is no nuclear policy.    Hubert: You have just returned from a fact-finding  visit to Eastern Europe. Does what you saw there present a  nuclear threat to Europe?    Lalonde: Yes, there is a real abyss in Ukraine and  Russia. That is where things will collapse first. The situation  is deteriorating, especially because of Russian nationalism and  the prevailing chaos. In Chernobyl, the population was moved.  Almost 5,000 people were mobilized to clean up, they were  ordered to do so because of the nature of the Communist regime  still in place at the time. It would now be absolutely  impossible to do that. The mechanisms of alternative  democratic, administrative, and economic authorities have not  been established. Russian nationalism proclaims that its power  stations are the best in the world and that the Western  countries have no role to play in them. Ukraine, for its part,  depends almost 100 percent on Russians for its engineers and its  spare parts. Anything which affects safety in Russia and in  Ukraine comes second to production.    Hubert: So there is a risk of a second Chernobyl  or worse?    Lalonde: Yes, and I am not sure that it is just a  risk, I think it is a certainty, and at any time. Moreover,  this is a very strange failure by our Western democracies. It  is rather like Bosnia: We know, we watch, but we do nothing, or  not much.    Hubert: Does nuclear power still represent the  future in the energy sphere?    Lalonde: It is not certain. It is one technology.  The future rests more with renewable energy sources. The  nuclear industry presupposes a great deal of virtue. At present  it is like being on a road on which our engineers responsible  for nuclear safety are driving while telling us: ``You see, I  don't have accidents! I'm driving at 110 km per hour and  controlling my car.'' They forget one thing: There are other  drivers who drive very badly.    Hubert: You are very pessimistic...    Lalonde: I am a realist. I realize to what extent  this world is becoming a little more radioactive every day.</p>

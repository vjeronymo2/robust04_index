			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / IMF urges Germany tospeed cuts in fiscal deficits THE International Monetary Fund yesterday urged Germany, in unusually forthright language, to act more quickly to cut its fiscal deficits and so enable European interest rates to fall. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth in the European Community slowed considerably last year and - at 1.8 per cent  - is expected to remain subdued in 1992. The IMF estimated the German general government deficit would grow from 3.3 per cent of gross national product in 1991 to 3.6 per cent this year before falling to 3.1 per cent in 1993. It said the tight monetary stance of the Bundesbank - which in December raised its interest rates to the highest levels since the 1930s to combat inflationary pressures - was a 'recent restraining factor' on European growth. 'The prospects for lower interest rates in Europe would be enhanced if Germany's fiscal consolidation plans were implemented more rapidly than currently envisaged,' the IMF said. In addition to accelerating existing plans for fiscal consolidation, it said there seemed to be scope for an early announcement of more deficit-cutting measures. The IMF report, which was circulated among governments before publication yesterday, may encourage Germany's partners in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to push for faster fiscal action from Bonn at Sunday's meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington. The report caused dismay among German monetary officials, who contrasted the stern advice to Germany with the IMF's much milder strictures against the higher and more persistent US deficits. The US has been critical for some time of the mix of high interest rates and large fiscal deficits in Germany, which it feels has contributed to the slowdown in world economic growth. US officials appear anxious, however, to avoid turning Sunday's G7 meeting into a concerted attack on German economic policies. The IMF report predicted that world output would grow by 1.4 per cent this year after declining by 0.3 per cent in 1991. The Fund's latest growth forecast for this year is 1.3 percentage points lower than its projection for 1992 which was published in October last year. However, the IMF said it expected global growth would quicken to 3.6 per cent in 1993. Although this recovery would be subdued compared with previous upturns, the Fund urged governments to act cautiously. 'Barring evidence that growth continues to falter, a further significant reduction in interest rates does not seem warranted in the US, Canada or Japan,' it said. The IMF said monetary authorities should stand ready to tighten policy promptly in response to signs of inflationary pressures. IMF laces growth projections with caution, Page 6</p>

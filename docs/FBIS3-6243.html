			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan's top economic  planner on Tuesday [15 March] called for more public works  spending, particularly housing investment, to give an added  boost to the burgeoning economic recovery.    The Japanese economy is showing some sign of pickup in such  areas as housing, home electric appliances, audio equipment and  autos, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency [EPA], told a regular press conference.    The bud of the economic recovery should be nurtured with  steps to spur personal spending, such as more housing investment  and early implementation of planned tax cuts, she said.    These measures will be effective in putting the economy on a  strong recovery track, she said.</p>

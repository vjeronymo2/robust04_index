			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS SAY IT'S TIME TO RAISE BRIDGE  </P> <P> A group of West Newport Beach residents on Tuesday urged that the Newport  Boulevard bridge leading to the peninsula be raised as well as widened.  </P> <P> During a public hearing on the widening proposal, being considered by the Coast  Guard, some residents said they believed that if changes are going to be made,  the bridge should also be raised to allow their boats to pass under it without  problems.  </P> <P> Craig Willford, an attorney representing the Citizens' West Channel Bridge  Committee, said, "The bridge already needs raising, and now is the best time  since we are making such a major modification to it."  </P> <P> Harold G. Polley, who has lived along the West Newport channel for 31 years,  also stressed the need to raise the bridge.  </P> <P> "A 50-year-old bridge is not adequate for 1990," he said.  </P> <P> The application presented to the Coast Guard by Caltrans and the city of  Newport Beach would widen the bridge, first built in 1936, by 29 feet. A third  northbound traffic lane and wider bicycle-pedestrian access would be added.  </P> <P> The widening would not affect the clearance for boats passing under the bridge,  however.  </P> <P> John Walter, principal civil engineer for the city, said that increasing the  height by 4 or 5 feet would add up to $5 million to the project. He said that  "the funds are tight and the clearance is OK."  </P> <P> If the Coast Guard doesn't approve the application as is, an amended  application will have to be resubmitted and the funds now allocated for the  widening will be gone, according to Paul Gonzales of Caltrans. He cautioned  that it could take 10 years for the reapplication to be approved and the funds  to again become available.  </P> <P> Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer said: "In order to raise the bridge, we need to rebuild  it. The council voted not to go ahead with a new bridge two or three years ago  because of the cost."  </P> <P> More than 60,000 vehicles a day travel over the Newport Boulevard bridge and  400 youngsters ride their bikes or walk over it on their way to and from  school. During the summer months, those numbers greatly increase.  </P> <P> After a series of public hearings on the plan are completed, the Coast Guard  will evaluate its findings and make a recommendation to Coast Guard officials  in Washington, who will either approve or deny the city's application. If  approved, work is scheduled to begin in September and take about eight months  to complete.MARCI HANOVER  </P></p>

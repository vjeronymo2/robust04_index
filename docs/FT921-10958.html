			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Calls to stem Ulster killings renewed ULSTER Unionist politicians yesterday stepped up their campaign for tougher security in Northern Ireland after a Protestant deliveryman was murdered by the IRA in Dungannon, County Tyrone, our Belfast Correspondent writes. Mr Gordon Hamill was shot as he took bread to a supermarket. He is the 17th civilian to be killed by terrorists in Ulster this year. His death came 12 hours after the outlawed Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters shot dead Mr Patrick Clarke, a Catholic taxi driver. There were fears last night that the latest killings could spark a series of revenge attacks across the province. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, accused a 'gutless government' of lacking the political will to tackle terrorism, and called for the reintroduction of internment. Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland Office minister, said the extremists were attempting to drive a wedge between the two communities. He called for public support for the security forces' efforts to rid the province of terrorism.</p>

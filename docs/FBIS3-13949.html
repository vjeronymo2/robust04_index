He said the presence of John Garang and Riak  Machar would give impetus to the negotiations.    Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr.  al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included  African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were  identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would  help in resolving the southern problem.    Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official  spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj,  said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours  following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said  so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to  Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali  al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD  group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the  Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for  the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in  Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali  al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same  people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London  Forum under Baroness Cox.    He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the  toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem  should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to  give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role,  especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel  leaders attending the talks for the first time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Progreso, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported here  that the Cuban fishermen who arrived in this Mexican eastern  port, in Yucatan State, asked the government to help them reach  Florida after they were declared illegal immigrants in Mexico.    Bernardo Crespo, navigation chief of the Progreso port,  pointed out that Cubans Amado Sanchez Garay, 35, and Roberto  Perez Ruiz, 38, had said they left Cuba 14 days ago to go  fishing and that a Mexican ship rescued them on 20 June.    The official added the Cubans, who were on board a  high-speed  boat with registration number 302-322, arrived in the port,  located 1,800 km east of Mexico City, early this morning and  they requested help to go to Miami, Florida. The Lamba 302  fishing boat rescued the two fishermen, whose high-speed boat  ran out of gas on the high seas.    Crespo also said the Cuban fishermen were handed over to  immigration authorities, who transferred them to Merida,  Yucatan's capital, located 36 km south of Progreso.    Some 193 Cubans have arrived in Yucatan Peninsula coasts so  far in 1994. In March, seven Cuban boat people were rescued off  the coast of Isla Contoy, and in April, three groups -- totaling  183 Cubans -- arrived in this port, Chetumal Bay, near Isla  Mujeres.    Last month, Cuban fisherman Pedro Gutierrez Fernandez  arrived  in San Felipe Port, also in Yucatan, after he was rescued by the  Piscis Mexican fishing boat.</p>

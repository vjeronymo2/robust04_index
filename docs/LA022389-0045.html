			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PICUS PUSHES PLAN FOR INTERCHANGE PROJECT  </P> <P> Moving to head off opposition to a proposed Woodland Hills freeway interchange  project, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said Wednesday that there is  "strong, broad-based community support" for the $40-million project.  </P> <P> Picus warned that the long-sought Valley Circle-Mulholland interchange to the  Ventura Freeway will never be built unless state and city transportation  engineers believe they can construct something that will handle future traffic  in the fast-growing Woodland Hills and Calabasas areas.  </P> <P> To accommodate that traffic, transportation officials say, the project must  include a secondary east-west bridge over the freeway linking Ventura Boulevard  in Woodland Hills with Calabasas Road in Calabasas and a widened north-south  bridge at Valley Circle Boulevard  </P> <P> Opponents of the secondary freeway "flyover bridge" have claimed it would  funnel heavy traffic into the Old Town village of Calabasas. They also oppose  off-ramp designs that call for the paving of land behind the historic  145-year-old Leonis Adobe.  </P> <P> Project foes have scheduled a meeting for 7 p.m. tonight at El Camino Real High  School, 5440 Valley Circle Blvd., to discuss their opposition.  </P> <P> Picus said that recent revisions in the flyover bridge plan would prevent heavy  traffic from clogging Calabasas and would eliminate the need to widen two-lane  Calabasas Road. She said the project has the support of state Sens. Ed Davis  (R-Valencia) and Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and of City Councilman Marvin  Braude.  </P></p>

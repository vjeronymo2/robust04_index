			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique issued in Bangui on 12 January; read </F> by Permanent Undersecretary Koumakoye Ngourouma]    [Text] The Central African Government will announce in time  the measures adopted by the heads of state of the franc zone at  their meeting in Dakar on 10-11 January on the devaluation of  the CFA franc which it approved. However, since this morning it  has been observed that certain panic stricken businessmen closed  their shops in order to change the prices of their commodities.    Even thought it is normal for businessmen to close their  shops in order to take stock, the government does not appreciate  their attempts to increase prices arbitrarily. Consequently,  the government condemns this practice and asks the Central  African people to remain calm. The government recalls that the  prices of commodities currently in the warehouses awaiting  customs clearance and those ordered before the devaluation will  not be increased. However, there are dossiers that will be  examined case by case [words indistinct].    Furthermore, the government demands those businessmen who  closed their shops this morning in order to change the price  tags to stop the operation and obey the present instructions.  Severe controls will be taken to this effect in order to detect  defaulters. A word to the wise is sufficient.</p>

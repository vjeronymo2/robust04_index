			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: When 'top rate' means 45% - David Cohen reveals how changes to the treatment of dividends are driving up tax bills Ask the Inland Revenue and it will tell you that the top rate of income tax is 40 per cent. The truth, however, is that some taxpayers now face a marginal rate of 45 per cent because of last year's changes to the tax treatment of dividends. Every dividend cheque is accompanied by a voucher giving a tax credit. On April 6 1993, the value of this credit was cut from 25 to 20 per cent of the gross payment. So, someone receiving an Pounds 80 dividend now gets a Pounds 20 credit, which is 20 per cent of Pounds 100 (the dividend and credit combined). Basic-rate taxpayers have been protected against the impact of this change. They are now taxable at only 20 per cent on their dividend income, so the 20 per cent credit still takes full care of their liability. But 40 per cent taxpayers have lost out. They are stuck with the reduced credit - without the benefit of a lower tax band. The 45 per cent crunch comes for those individuals in the higher-rate bracket who have a mix of dividends and other sources of income. The dividends will be treated as the top slice when calculating overall liability. Hence, the benefit of the special 20 per cent dividend rate will be available only to the extent that the basic-rate band has not been absorbed by the individual's non-dividend income. Any increase in such income will, therefore, catapult an equivalent amount of dividend income from 20 per cent straight up to 40 per cent. Take Ezra, whose income comprises a Pounds 16,000 salary and Pounds 12,000 dividends. Ignoring personal allowances, his tax liabilities will be as set out in Table 1. Table 2 shows the impact of a Pounds 5,000 salary increase. Additional tax of Pounds 2,250 is 45 per cent of the extra income. Having identified this trap, what can taxpayers do to avoid it? Many will have little or no influence over their income level, and an employee offered a pay rise is hardly likely to turn it down because it will be taxable at 45 per cent. Nevertheless, those with more flexible arrangements often will be able to take avoiding action. Owner-managers of private companies, for instance, can keep the 45 per cent threat at bay by paying themselves extra dividends in lieu of salary increases. Equally, husbands and wives can swap ownership of income-producing assets if one is a potential 45 per cent payer and the other is not.

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Council tenants to gain home repairs scheme COUNCIL tenants are to gain the right to have urgent repairs to their homes carried out at council expense under a Tenant's Charter, published yesterday. A consultation paper will be issued late next month setting out proposals for dealing with urgent repairs needed to make council homes safe or secure, such as blocked drains or broken water heaters. The scheme will allow tenants to approach an approved contractor to do the repairs if the council does not act promptly. The bill would go to the council, so that the tenant would not have to pay for the work and then claim the money back. Councils would have to consult tenants on which repairs were covered by the scheme and the time to be allowed before the tenant could take action. In addition to listing tenants' statutory rights, such as security of tenure and the right to buy, the charter also sets out guidance on good practice for councils in dealing with tenants. For example, housing officers should wear name badges, have answering machines to take messages when offices are not staffed and answer inquiries promptly. Launching the charter in Birmingham, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said many local authorities had made great strides in recent years in improving their management performance. Nevertheless, too much council housing was 'badly maintained and poorly serviced by bureaucrats who are remote, inefficient and out of touch with tenants' needs'. He added: 'The Tenant's Charter aims to improve quality, provide choice, set standards and give value for money in housing.' Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, said the charter was merely a pre-election stunt 'to shift the blame for the housing crisis and massive repairs backlog to local councils, when it is almost entirely government policy that is to blame'. He criticised the exclusion of private tenants and housing association tenants from the charter. Mr Gould urged Mr Heseltine to allow councils to spend their capital receipts on new homes and repairs.</p>

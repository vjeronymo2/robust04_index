			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK television Last year's TV franchise auctions look no less ludicrous with the benefit of hindsight. The reconfigured stations have been up and running since the start of the year but their financial fortunes have been largely predetermined by what the industry called the 'blind crap shoot'. The wide array of bids has resulted in some wild share price divergences. Companies lucky enough to have won by bidding low have done spectacularly well; Central and Scottish are the star performers. Others, such as HTV and Yorkshire which bid high to retain their franchises, have watched their share prices flounder. This simple arithmetic may get more complex as other factors enter the equation. There is a widespread expectation of further rationalisation among the 15 regional companies. Some share prices are twitching in anticipation. No bids are allowed before next year. Even then, the big nine ITV companies are not allowed to buy each other. But some of the largest companies, such as Carlton and Granada, may take strategic shareholdings and press for a relaxation of ownership restrictions. Overseas groups may also join the fray. Smaller companies, such as Anglia, could also reveal a sudden turn of speed if advertising revenue does show real recovery. The operational gearing of such operators should produce relatively fast rates of growth compared with their larger peers. Promise of rising revenues and bids looks hypothetical. But investors in the TV sector must now be used to living with uncertainty.</p>

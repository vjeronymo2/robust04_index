			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SEARCH;  </P> <P> ADULT ADOPTEES SEEK ROOTS  </P> <P> The drive from her Anaheim home to Santee in San Diego County was only two  hours, but Robin Gryvnak, 26, had been dreaming about this moment for years.  </P> <P> She had fussed all week over what she would say to him, what she should wear to  impress him, even how to arrange her hair so she would look more like him.  </P> <P> "I wanted everything to be just right. It had to be perfect, right down to  every detail," she had said nervously the night before.  </P> <P> But this Saturday morning four weeks ago as she drove into the Santee  neighborhood, parked by the white-framed house with the neat front lawn, and  saw Richard Campbell on the front lawn, grinning and waving -- she simply  melted.  </P> <P> She walked toward him shyly and awkwardly, suddenly like a little girl,  clutching the mementos she had brought just for him -- a bouquet of daisies and  a balloon that bannered the words, "It's a Girl!"  </P> <P> Then Robin Gryvnak fell into Campbell's embrace. An adopted child who found her  long-unknown birth father. A personal journey that now seemed headed for a  happy ending.  </P> <P> There was a time when reunions of adopted persons and their birth parents were  a true novelty, a rarely publicized lost-and-found phenomenon in America.  </P> <P> But not anymore. In the past decade, these tearful happenings have become  increasingly familiar. The parties in these long-abandoned relationships not  only are more eager to reunite, but also more willing to tell their  irresistibly dramatic and sentimental stories to the media.  </P> <P> All such tales are full of sure-fire plot elements -- first, secrecy and shame;  then, rediscovery and elation. Some relate such extraordinary ordeals and  bizarre twists that they border on the melodramatic.  </P> <P> And this is no passing fad. The American Adoption Congress, an umbrella  organization for search-support groups and reunion registries, believes there  are now at least 250,000 "active searchers" nationwide. While most still are  adult adoptees, the numbers of birth parents and those searchers under 30 are  markedly increasing.  </P> <P> But search advocates said the traditional stigmatic secrecy over adoptions  remains massive, despite the growing acceptance of the full "open adoption"  concept -- where birth parents are identified and remain in open contact with  the child and the adoptive parents.  </P> <P> California, like most states, keeps original birth certificates and other key  adoption-related records sealed, opened generally only by court order, which is  rarely given, activists said.  </P> <P> And many defenders of traditional "closed" adoptions still denounce searchers  as militant malcontents who break the original pact of confidentiality, engage  in extralegal search tactics and cruelly harass those who are contacted.  </P> <P> "Ridiculous!" countered Florence Fisher, founder of the national Adoptees'  Liberty Movement Assn. "That 'malcontent' accusation is just one more myth."  </P> <P> Fisher and other advocates conceded the potential does exist for "extreme  traumatic reactions" from the persons contacted. But, they noted, searchers  themselves could also face shocking discoveries, such as finding people who are  criminals or drug addicts.  </P> <P> "Of course, we worry about both these possibilities, but they happen very  rarely," said Cindy Shacklett, Orange County coordinator for the national  Concerned United Birthparents search-support organization.  </P> <P> Shacklett led a small group of protesters May 1 at the Orange County Courthouse  as part of a nationwide "Open My Records Day." In California, the advocates are  backing an Assembly bill, now in committee, that would make the most vital  adoption-case records -- such as original birth certificates -- available  without court order to adult adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents.  </P> <P> People search for different reasons, advocates said: For adoptees, it is to  find their full identity; for birth parents, to heal emotional wounds from  giving up their children; and for all of them, to exercise a new form of civil  rights.  </P> <P> "People don't go searching for a 'Mommy' or a 'Daddy' at age 18 or 40," Fisher  said. "They're looking for other answers."  </P> <P> Sheridan O'Brien, now 39, was raised lovingly by her adoptive parents, her  adoption status openly acknowledged.  </P> <P> After all, she was told, "adopted children were chosen, were picked out, are  very special. There's nothing to be ashamed of."  </P> <P> But "when you're older, you begin to feel there's something askew -- the flip  side of those usual explanations," recalled O'Brien, a graphic designer who  lives in Laguna Hills and belongs to the Orange County branch of Concerned  United Birthparents, whose members include adoptees.  </P> <P> "I began to feel a sense of void about my whole identity. It's feeling lost and  that certain pieces of our puzzle are still missing."  </P> <P> Her adoptive parents, she said, never went into depth about her adoption.  </P> <P> "They never said it was a forbidden topic, but you could sense it was too  hurtful to bring up. And you don't, because you love them," O'Brien said.  </P> <P> But by the mid-1970s -- after she had married and her own daughter, Jennifer,  was born -- O'Brien began searching on her own sporadically. Her adoptive  parents knew her full birth name and had told O'Brien. So she often spent whole  evenings, pouring over phone books of areas throughout California and other  states, looking for people with that unusual last name.  </P> <P> Still, the random calls -- and her own attempts to obtain identifying  information from public records -- proved to be a dead end. In 1988, however,  after turning her search over to a professional consultant, O'Brien located the  birth mother -- now 67, divorced, living in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> O'Brien placed the first call in February, 1989.  </P> <P> "Oh, I was shaking, and I wasn't sure I could even speak," she said. "Sure,  you're worried about absolute rejection. Sure, you wonder how upsetting this  might be to the other person."  </P> <P> "But (support groups and consultants) tell you to take it easy, to be up front  and tell them you're not out to intrude in their lives, but only want to meet,  learn about their lives and tell of yours."  </P> <P> The call went well, she said.  </P> <P> "She was polite," O'Brien said. "She never acknowledged the birth date or the  adoption. But she did say we might meet, but not right away -- she wasn't  feeling well."  </P> <P> The explanation devastated O'Brien. "She said she had cancer; she was  undergoing chemotherapy."  </P> <P> Two months later, just before Mother's Day, 1989, they met.  </P> <P> "I saw this woman, very ill, but who looked so much like me. It stuns you, no  matter how prepared you think you are. I hugged her. I cried a lot. We sat on  the couch, touching each other -- our faces, our hands, comparing  similarities."  </P> <P> "She swore me to secrecy," O'Brien said. "Her two daughters (from a later  marriage) didn't know about me. She asked me not to tell them or contact them  -- until after her death."  </P> <P> At the funeral 10 months later, O'Brien walked up to the half-sisters, offered  her condolences but introduced herself only as "a close friend of the family."  Later, when all the others had left, she returned alone to the grave site and  -- for the first time that day -- allowed herself to cry.  </P> <P> She has since phoned the half-sisters, who are both in their mid-30s.  </P> <P> "It's been like instant empathy, like we've known each other all our lives,"  O'Brien said.  </P> <P> Their first formal gathering will be this Memorial Day -- at their mother's  grave.  </P> <P> But O'Brien's memories of her birth mother are poignantly mixed.  </P> <P> "I saw her many times. But, no, I can't say it was perfect. There were strained  moments. I couldn't get real close to her. She stayed distant, and I realize  now she was a very private person."  </P> <P> Yet, O'Brien added, "I had this feeling that she was glad to see me and to know  that I was doing all right and had a wonderful daughter of my own. And that,  yes, overall, everything was OK."  </P> <P> The last visit took place in the hospital two months ago.  </P> <P> "I saw her alone and hugged her, like I always did," O'Brien said. "She  couldn't speak. But she moved her hand toward mine, and I held hers -- as  tightly, and as long, as I could."  </P> <P> Her mother died the next day.  </P> <P> Trish McAleer, now 40, remembers the feelings of guilt, secrecy and isolation  when she gave birth to her daughter out of wedlock 22 years ago.  </P> <P> But eight years ago, McAleer, who is married and has no other children, decided  to take matters into her own hands.  </P> <P> The San Clemente resident became a dedicated activist in the search movement,  inspired by a Phil Donahue talk show about the reuniting of birth parents and  adoptees, and driven by her own need to find her daughter.  </P> <P> And six years ago, after "piecing together bits of information" from public  records and sympathetic relatives, she located her daughter, who was born in  Ohio and still lives there.  </P> <P> After the daughter turned 18 in 1986, McAleer took the plunge. She went back to  Ohio and attended the daughter's commencement -- but staying incognito and  accompanied only by a trusted relative.  </P> <P> "I had to see her, even if from afar," McAleer said. "I had to be there. I  cried the whole time."  </P> <P> The next evening, while still in town, McAleer decided to take the next obvious  step. She phoned the daughter's home.  </P> <P> Luckily, said McAleer, the daughter answered and was alone. "She was guarded  and startled, but she took it very well. She seemed positive about talking  again and exchanging letters and pictures."  </P> <P> But the next day, McAleer said, the mood had changed abruptly. "She told me we  shouldn't meet and that if we did, it would hurt her parents."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, when McAleer returned to San Clemente, she mailed off a packet of  photographs with an explanatory letter to the adoptive parents.  </P> <P> "I told them," McAleer said, "I wasn't out to disrupt things, but only to make  contact -- and, if it works out, become friends."  </P> <P> The packet came back, the photographs and letter still in it, and with this  tersely formal note from the daughter:  </P> <P>  Patricia: I want no further contact with you. If I wanted contact with you, I  would have done so years ago.  </P> <P>  The most theatrical twist in this story came 18 months later when McAleer --  in Ohio to visit relatives -- decided to seize the moment.  </P> <P> Urged by relatives who knew where the daughter worked, McAleer went straight to  the store, intending to make face-to-face contact. But the daughter wasn't  there. "They told me she was in a car accident, that she was in the hospital  with serious injuries."  </P> <P> Once again, she took the plunge. That evening at the hospital, after the  adoptive parents had left and the daughter was alone, McAleer -- feeling both  terrified and driven by this one chance -- entered the room and introduced  herself.  </P> <P> According to McAleer, the daughter reacted at first with anger, then curiosity  and "we eventually had a nice talk." But basically, said McAleer, the daughter  shut the door on her, indicating the adoptive parents strongly opposed any kind  of contact.  </P> <P> That was 2 1/2 years ago. McAleer has not seen -- or heard from -- the daughter  since.  </P> <P> "I have no regrets about what I did. I would do it again, a thousand times  over, because you get only so many chances, if at all," said McAleer, a  Concerned United Birthparents national official and now a search consultant  herself.  </P> <P> "What people like me have done may be audacious, perhaps. Certainly,  persistent. But harassment? That's absurd! Since I last saw her, I have sent  her little cards on birthdays and holidays. Nothing more."  </P> <P> "I think of her constantly," she added. "And all I want her to know is that I  care, that I am here, and that my door is always open to her."  </P> <P> Trish McAleer is still sending the cards. Still wishing. Still waiting.  </P> <P> For Robin Gryvnak of Anaheim, who met her birth father in the Santee reunion,  the wait is finally over.  </P> <P> Last fall, through a consultant with the Fullerton-based Severed Strings search  program, she found her birth mother, now 42 and still living in San Diego  County. They have met only once and their relationship is "a slowly evolving  but difficult one," Robin said.  </P> <P> And that embracing reception last April 28 from the family of Richard Campbell,  the birth father, has touched her deeply -- "just like a real family," she  said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Campbell is now the very image of the solid family man. He and his  wife, Roberta, have two sons, Rick, 24, and Shawn, 22. And Campbell, who saw  Army combat duty in Vietnam in 1966, is a longtime employee -- an electrician  -- with a regional utility company.  </P> <P> "I thought it (Robin's first call April 22) might be some kind of hoax," said  the 47-year-old Campbell, who admits he was "something of a hell-raiser" at the  time he knew Robin's birth mother. "I never knew about the baby. I never saw or  heard about (Robin's birth mother) all these years. But I'm convinced I'm  Robin's father."  </P> <P> And now, said Campbell, pointing to a snapshot of Robin and her children,  Joshua, 4 1/2, and Amanda, 3, "we find ourselves suddenly with both a daughter  and grandkids!"  </P> <P> At their April 28 meeting in Santee, an obviously elated Robin presented  Campbell, a railroad model buff, with a miniature classic Rio Grande caboose  car -- and this note:  </P> <P>  To you, this may be the end of a train.  </P> <P> To me, it's a symbol of the end of a long search.  </P> <P>  -- Love, Robin.  </P> <P> Mary Gryvnak, one of her staunchest supporters throughout the six-year search.  </P> <P> Last Oct. 16, the day after Robin met her birth mother, she sent Mary a huge  bunch of roses. "I knew she would be feeling kind of hurt, and I didn't want  that to happen. I wanted to tell her something from the heart."  </P> <P> So with the roses came a tiny card -- one that made the 53-year-old Mary  Gryvnak, as she recalled later, "cry every time I read it."  </P> <P>  To my one and only MOM!!!!!  </P> <P>  -- Love, always, Robin.  </P></p>

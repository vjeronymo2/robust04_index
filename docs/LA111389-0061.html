			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> MOLDAVIANS CALL OFF NEW DEMONSTRATION  </P> <P> Moldavian nationalists called off a demonstration in their capital, Kishinyov,  after 2,000 more troops were deployed in the city to prevent a repetition of  Friday's clashes in which 180 people were injured. The city was reported calm  as police guarded government buildings. Resignation of the republic's hard-line  Communist leader, Semyon Grossu, is one of the central demands of the local  Popular Front and other nationalist groups. The Popular Front also is demanding  more autonomy for the republic, which was created largely out of Romanian  territory in 1940, as well as the resignation of hard-line local leaders.  </P></p>

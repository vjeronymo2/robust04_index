			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh </F> Subhi al-Tufayli by Nisrin Nasir-al-Din and Zaynah Ma'luli;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-DIYAR] Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, how are  you? What role are you playing?    [Al-Tufayli] As a citizen of this country, I have a right to  express my opinion. I like our clear rights to be respected.  Acting on this premise, I don't believe in imposed regimes.  The al-Ta'if Accord is a formula for a regime on which the  Lebanese people were not consulted. Therefore, I reject this  regime. Accordingly, anything that stems from this regime is  illegitimate because the Lebanese people have not decided on it.  Therefore, I am an opponent of the regime.    Furthermore, I don't believe anyone has the right to  reconcile with the Zionist entity, which is an oppressor and  usurper. The Lebanese regime is wrong in trying to reconcile  with the Zionist enemy. [passage omitted]    [AL-DIYAR] What are your specific differences with the  Lebanese regime?    [Al-Tufayli] I oppose the regime's many executive and  procedural actions. I cannot accept a regime that does not stem  from the will of the Lebanese or a majority of them. A  referendum must be held on any formula proposed to the people.  If the people accept this formula, then they will be  responsible for their decision.    The Chamber of Deputies--which was appointed or elected--was  elected on the basis of a formula which the people did not  approve. The formula determined the Chamber, the Chamber did not  devise the formula. A formula which is not presented to the  people is not respected, and must not be respected by anyone.    [AL-DIYAR] Does this mean you are not pleased with the  Chamber of Deputies?    [Al-Tufayli] The nature of Lebanese officials is essentially  bad. This is very regrettable. I am not revealing something  new. The officials in Lebanon, regardless of their positions, do  not care about the Lebanese people's interests and views. All  Lebanese officials are interested in is pleasing the party in  power. For example, in the past the French had the power and  Lebanese officials were anxious to know whether the French were  pleased with them. Today the same thing is happening with the  Syrian brothers. If the Syrians are pleased, there is no  problem even if the Lebanese people curse these officials. This  is not the work of honest officials. These officials are  irresponsible.    Hypocrisy is the hallmark of past and current Lebanese  officials. With such a mentality, we cannot say the people  govern in Lebanon. The people do not govern at all. From a  reading of the situation, we emerge with the conclusion that the  majority of the people are not pleased with the formula or with  the officials. If some of them are pleased, it is for personal  reasons or out of fear. [passage omitted]    [AL-DIYAR] You have spoken about the Syrian role. What  about the Iranian role in Lebanon?    [Al-Tufayli] The Iranian role is not political. Regardless  of their abilities or inabilities, the Iranians have not  interfered in political affairs. The Iranians have two roles.  The first role is to support the resistance, transfer military  expertise to it, and back it financially so it can buy weapons  and other things. The second role is in helping the people dig  water wells and rebuild destroyed houses, assisting the poor,  and other social activities. That is all what they have been  doing.    [AL-DIYAR] But they have interfered on some issues?    [Al-Tufayli] I don't believe the Syrians consult the  Iranians. The decision is ultimately a Syrian one. The work the  Syrians are doing in Lebanon is Syria's responsibility even if  others consult it.    [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with the Syrians and  Iranians?    [Al-Tufayli] Good; there are no problems.    [AL-DIYAR] Are there contacts?    [Al-Tufayli] Contacts are held according to need. I am  usually frank with the Syrians and Iranians. They know this.  Therefore, the relations are stable and there are no problems.    [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with Hizballah and what  are the points of disagreement with it?    [Al-Tufayli] In fact, there were two viewpoints regarding  the [parliamentary] elections. I don't like to participate in  activities I don't believe in. Since I did not believe in the  formula adopted for the elections, I told my brothers: I will  not join in this political venture. However, I am at your  service in other matters. [passage omitted]    [AL-DIYAR] What information does al-Hajj al-Dirani have on  pilot Ron Arad?    [Al-Tufayli] In my capacity as a former Hizballah secretary  general, I know details about Hizballah. Therefore, I can say  that Ron Arad is not being held by Hizballah or the Iranians.  The proof is that at some point in the past Hizballah and the  Iranians carried out a serious search for Arad. This means he  is not being held by them.    [AL-DIYAR] Can we identify the party that might be holding  Arad?    [Al-Tufayli] Some people say the Syrians are holding him.  However, the Syrians have not only denied this, they have also  carried out a search for him. Therefore, it is probable that  Arad died or was killed. Arad disappeared about the time of the  aggression against Maydun. For example, some of his guards  might have reacted and killed him in a moment of anger. There  is no proof of this; I am just trying to explain the riddle. If  he had returned to Palestine, they would have announced this.  No one in Palestine has claimed that he is alive or dead.  There is no reason for anyone to hide him. Therefore, there is  a high probability that he died or was killed. [passage omitted]</p>

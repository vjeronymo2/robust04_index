			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Transco Quits Field: Transco Energy Co., getting out of the oil-production  business, said a subsidiary would sell oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of  Mexico to Amerada Hess Corp. for $911 million, far more than had been expected.  The sale by Transco Exploration Partners Ltd., including 41 gas fields, three  oil fields and shore-based support facilities, is expected to close by the end  of September. Transco Exploration, 74% of which is owned by Houston-based  Transco Energy, is being liquidated so the parent company can concentrate on  its core business of transporting natural gas through a 16,000-mile pipeline  network.  </P></p>

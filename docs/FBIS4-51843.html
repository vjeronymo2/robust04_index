			<p>BFN     [Text] The government does not recognize the existence of  the Association of Democratic People [PRD] established on 2 May.  This is because the organization is inclined to conduct  political activities and is therefore against Law No. 3/1985 on  political parties and the functional group. Speaking after  chairing a coordinated meeting in Jakarta, Coordinating Minister  for Politics and Security Affairs Susilo Sudarman said the three  organizations legally allowed to conduct political activities  are the United Development Party, the Functional Group, and the  Indonesian Democratic Party. Therefore, the existence of PRD is  against the above law.</p>

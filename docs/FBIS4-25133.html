			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The First Sino-U.S.  Symposium on Environmental Monitoring and Management was  inaugurated here today to coincide with the "World Environment  Day".    Some three hundred Chinese and American experts, scholars  and  government officials attended this morning's opening ceremony.    They will hold comprehensive talks on environmental  monitoring, management and related technology as well as on  problems confronting them in their endeavors to protect the  environment, said Wang Yangzu, vice-chief of China's National  Environmental Protection Agency.    Wang, calling the U.S. one of the pioneers in the world in  environmental monitoring and protection, said the meeting would  "give a push to China's campaign to monitor the environment.".    Si Duk Lee [name as received], the U.S. delegation  president,  said that environment-related factors are playing an ever bigger  role in global economic development. He voiced the hope that  the two countries' environmental protection departments would  enhance cooperation.

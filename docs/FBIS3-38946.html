			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government welcomes the  NATO decision to impose an ultimatum on the attackers in  Sarajevo, giving them 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons  outside a radius of 20 km around Sarajevo. Otherwise, NATO is  threatening to destroy Serb positions with air strikes. Federal  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the press in Bonn today that  everything must be done to end any further bloodshed: "There has  to be an end to the siege of Sarajevo."    Kinkel spoke of "decisions with very far-reaching  implications." However, a political solution still has priority  over a military one, he said. NATO hopes that there will be no  need to implement the decision it has made. A peaceful solution  cannot, however, be achieved against the wishes of the three  warring parties -- the Moslems, Serbs, and Croats. He therefore  appealed urgently to the three warring parties to do their  utmost for a peaceful solution.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Chaos, crowds and comedy - Venice Biennale THERE ARE times, even now, when one is proud to be British. To find oneself at Venice, with the temperature nudging into the 80s and facing the prospect, courtesy of British Airways, of a week or so in the clothes one stands up in, is not one of them. The errant bags turned up the next day, with their absence unexplained but at least intact. Your correspondent is once more his usual dapper and imperturbable self. Not that that happy state has been a little difficult to maintain. The heat and humidity are trying enough, 'but the noise, my dear, and the people.' In spite of the public avowal by the director, Achille Bonito Oliva, at his London press conference that this, the 45th Venice Biennale, would be ready in time, it has proved so far the worst organised of any in my experience of the last 20 years. The central sight and focus of the Biennale are the public gardens at the far end of the city proper. There beneath the trees are the many national pavilions that make up so engaging an account of the architectural progress of the century. There, too, is the maze-like central pavilion that houses the principal thematic surveys of recent international art. And so, in the avenue before the gates into the gardens on the first of the three press days, the comedy begins, just as it has begun on the first day of every Biennale. We, the world's art critics, want to get in, and they, the guardians of the gates, young earnest men with walkie-talkies, and a handful of armed carabinieri who lend a certain tone, do not want to let us in until the last possible official moment. Fully-loaded cameramen are climbing everywhere above us to catch it all. Only this year the wait goes on and on, long after the promised hour. The sun beats down. Tempers shorten. Fists are raised. Things are said. People had been going in all the time, of course, if they had the magic words to whisper, or pass to show. Then there came the wonderful moment when the dam broke. I suppose some 50 got through, , before the gates were closed again by force, rather like the gates of Hougoumont at the battle of Waterloo. We too managed to break in, to our immense satisfaction, in a diversionary raid on the side gate. And so into the gardens, to make a start on the pavilions and exhibitions and to face the perverse ordeal of accreditation, which means another crush, another endless wait, and more hard words and lost tempers. This year the catalogue is in short supply, can hardly be had for love or money, and when at last achieved it weighs a ton. You cannot imagine the desperation, the sheer panic of the critic denied his catalogue. The next few days will bring receptions here and gossip there, things to be seen, conclusions to be drawn. Francis Bacon in the city, the young artists in the Arsenale, Richard Hamilton in our pavilion - such things await a thorough notice. The Biennale is under way again, and for the moment it is enough to lean on the balcony of the British pavilion, high above the gardens and the throng, a cooling glass on hand. Being British does have it moments after all. William Packer will write about the Biennale on Tuesday and Saturday next week.</p>

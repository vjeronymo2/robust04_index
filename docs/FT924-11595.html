			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Skandia to review future of North American reinsurance operations SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurer, is reviewing the future of its reinsurance operations in North America, after rejecting a Dollars 500m offer for the business from the New York-based investment group, John Head &amp; Partners. Mr Haakon Lindkvist, Skandia executive vice-president, said the group had rejected the offer, worth Dollars 20 per share, because it was 'too low'. He said the group had not received any other offers, but declined to comment further. Skandia has already tried to reduce its exposure to North American reinsurance by selling a majority stake in Skandia America Corp (SAC) through a public offering. However, it aborted these plans earlier this month because it could not get the price it wanted for the shares. Since then, Mr James Dowd, SAC's chairman and chief executive, has resigned because of differences over business strategy. John Head said yesterday that it was still prepared to meet Skandia executives to discuss the offer. The US group already has other insurance operations, which are affiliates of its Head Insurance Investors unit, and it was prepared to subscribe Dollars 60m in preferred stock had Skandia's public offering gone ahead. Last year SAC produced an SKr59m (Dollars 10.33m) profit for Skandia on gross premiums of SKr3.2bn.</p>

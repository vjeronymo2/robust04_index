			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- The Coordinating Committee of the  communications industry enterprises insists on meeting Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and on adopting a specific decision  to eliminate the industry's indebtedness, an ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told by Anatoliy Nazeykin, the chairman of the  Russian Federation Communication Workers' Trade Union.    He said that "measures taken yesterday were insufficient,  because the government issued more than 10 written instructions  to resolve the issue last year. Yet another written instruction  will not resolve the problems that have become extremely  exacerbated," he said, and noted that the coordinating committee  expected the government's official response. If no solution is  found, the industry's workers will continue their Russia-wide  protest action, emphasized Anatoliy Nazeykin.    Currently numerous regional communications systems in the  Far  East, Siberia, central non-black soil zone, and a number of  other regions are taking part in the protest action. According  to the Communications Ministry, approximately 40 percent of  Russian radio communications facilities were taking part in the  protest action as of midday 10 February.    At an emergency meeting on Wednesday with Russian Federation  Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Aleksandr Yakovlev,  head of the national Ostankino Russian state TV and radio  company, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin instructed  the Finance Ministry "to find an opportunity of a stage-by-stage  repayment of the 80 trillion rubles debt that the state TV and  radio companies owe to the communications enterprises." This  measure was taken in response to a threat from the Russian  Federation Communications Workers Trade Union addressed to the  government and the TV companies that from 10 February onward  "only the news bulletins from Ostankino and the national state  TV and radio company would be put out in the morning and  evening" until the debts to the communications enterprises were  settled in full.</p>

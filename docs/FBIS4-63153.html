Accepts Russia's Mediatory Attempts as the Part of </F> Activity of International Organisations" -- TURAN headline]    [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- "The U.S. back the principle  of territorial integrity and sovereignty of the states," said  the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Richard Kauzlarich, at  today's press conference in Baku. "The U.S. do not intend to  stay aside from the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. The  warring parties have to realize that the conflict must be  settled as soon as possible. One will not be able to achieve  any other purposes without that," said Kauzlarich.    The U.S. Ambassador said that "they say that we must point  to  the culprit of the conflict. We think that it will not help to  settle the conflict."    Answering to the question concerning the international  mediation in settlement the Karabakh conflict, Richard  Kauzlarich noted that the U.S. accept the mediatory attempts of  Russia only within the international organisation's framework,  in particular CSCE. He said that all the members of CSCE should  be involved to the process of observers' sending to the conflict  area.    American ambassador noted that mediatory success can be  provided only in case of the actions not only of some countries,  but of international organisations.    In respect with the CSCE activity, Kauzlarich said that this  organisation, during last two years practically had not chances  to realise its peacemaking potential. "During this period both  parties turned away from the attempts of CSCE," said the  ambassador.    He also noted that in case of signing the oil contracts with  American companies, Azerbaijan can hope on obtaining the status  of most favour in trade with U.S.A.</p>

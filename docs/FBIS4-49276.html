			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The Palestinians and the  Israelis have agreed on jurisdiction affairs in the Gaza Strip  and the West Bank's Jericho area where Palestinians will  implement self-rule in accordance with an agreement they signed  today.    Under a jurisdiction annex of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement on Palestinian self-rule, the power of the Palestinian  autonomy authority covers all matters that fall within its  territorial, functional and personal jurisdiction.    The annex says the territorial jurisdiction, which covers  the  Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, shall include land, subsoil and  territorial waters.    The functional jurisdiction does not include foreign  relations, internal security and public order of Israeli  settlements and the military installation area and Israelis, and  external security.    The personal jurisdiction extends to all persons within the  territorial jurisdiction, except for Israelis.    The Palestinian authority has legislative, executive and  judicial powers and responsibilities, while Israel has autority  over the Israeli settlements, the military installation area,  and Israelis.    The annex also specifies criminal and civil jurisdiction.    Two other annexes, one on israeli troops withdrawal and the  other on civil matters, were also signed along with the  jurisdiction annex. They are part of the Palestinian autonomy  agreement.    Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho within three weeks.    An annex on economic affairs was already signed at the end  of  last month in Paris.    The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel signed a  peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which provides  for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. But, the  implementation of the accord was delayed because of differences  between the two sides on some key issues.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / 'Cheating' in China ventures China yesterday accused foreign investors of cheating by overvaluing the worth of machinery and equipment they put into joint ventures instead of cash. The Xinhua news agency said inspectors had, between January 1991 and June this year, discovered discrepancies totalling Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) between the stated and actual value of such goods provided by foreign investors. Inspectors checked 4,940 shipments of machinery and equipment and found the actual value was Dollars 1.8bn, against a stated value of Dollars 2.3bn, it said. It said one Hong Kong investor provided 15 pieces of equipment to a joint venture in Wuhan, of which two were made in Japan in the 1930s and two made in China in 1969 and 1973, which he said had a total value of Dollars 2.12m. But local inspectors found the value to be Dollars 20,000. In the first half of this year, 23 per cent of such equipment officially inspected was found to be over-valued, against 25 per cent in 1993, the agency said. Such equipment accounts for an average of 70 per cent of the value of the foreign contribution to a joint venture, with the figure rising to 90 per cent in some areas, it added.</p>

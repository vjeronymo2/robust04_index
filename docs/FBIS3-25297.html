The two leaders  agreed to set up a joint committee that will, among other  things, discuss the homeland's stand on a new dispensation in  South Africa, as well as the normalization of relations.  Relations between the ANC and Bophuthatswana deteriorated  further recently following several incidents in which ANC  political activities in Bophuthatswana were disrupted by the  security forces.</p>

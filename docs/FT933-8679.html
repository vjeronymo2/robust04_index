			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / E Timor rebel has jail sentence cut MR Xanana Gusmao, the East Timorese rebel leader sentenced to life imprisonment by Indonesia last May, yesterday had his jail term reduced to 20 years. Diplomats say President Suharto's decision is in response to international criticism of Jakarta's human rights record. Amnesty International, the human rights group, said Mr Gusmao's trial 'failed to meet international standards of fairness,' noting his defence plea was suppressed and his choice of lawyer denied. Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, a move not recognised by the United Nations. In his defence plea Mr Gusmao, who led the Fretilin separatist movement, accused Indonesia of 'killing my people. Small and weak, they have always been subjected to foreign rule'. Government officials say Mr Gusmao has since accepted he had acted wrongfully in opposing Indonesian rule.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Observer: Stony road for gumshoe Nyet a rouble. The Russian government has still had nothing back from its relationship with America's ace sleuth Jules Kroll, despite 12 months' work and a Dollars 1m down-payment. But whose fault is it? Kroll, hired by Moscow a year ago to hunt millions of dollars spirited out of the country by the Communist party and tax-shy trading outfits, has found the tracking task far stonier than his previous forays in recovering the ill-gotten gains of third world dictators. He says he hasn't given up hope, blaming the lack of progress on his being denied any clear line of communication with the Russian authorities. Moreover, public prosecutor Valentin Stepankov has said that, apart from his own office, his country has failed to provide the hitherto golden gumshoe with the feedback he required to continue his searches in the west. On the other hand, complaints about the usefulness of Kroll's work so far have been voiced by Mikhail Gurtovoi, who lost his job as head of the anti-corruption commission with its disbanding last week by President Yeltsin. The task has now been handed to the vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi, backed by continued probing by the president's own government inspectorate. Even so, Stepankov has been calling for the setting-up of a replacement commission. The tangled web surely testifies that, here again, Russia's new authorities lack the political will and efficient management needed to crack a serious problem. Nor is solving it made any easier by lousy civil service pay and enduring state control over most assets.</p>

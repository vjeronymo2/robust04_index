			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The information and study workshop on the  prospects for the Algerian economy, which was set up by the  presidency and government and in which members of the government  and the main social and economic operators participated, has  issued its recommendations. In the recommendations, the  participants urge that a start be made this year on drawing up a  comprehensive and coherent program for institutional reforms and  restructuring, in order to free the initiative of economic  operators and reintroduce a market economy mechanism.    The participants also recommended that as soon as possible  work should begin on drawing up a coherent program to  restructure the public sector in order to increase output; work  should also begin on the reorganization and diversification of  the activities of banks. They also recommended the  reintroduction of a system that would encourage partnership.    Concerning the social sphere, the participants stressed the  importance of bolstering the program for social and economic  development, as part of the embodiment of social justice,  through the consolidation of the national system of social  security and the protection of the purchasing power of those  strata who are below the poverty line. They also stressed the  importance of bolstering dialogue and national solidarity.  [passage omitted]</p>

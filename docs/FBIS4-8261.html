			<p>BFN     [Text] London/Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Czech President  Vaclav Havel will avoid interviews with news agencies because  his office cannot check the published text, presidential  spokesman Ladislav Spacek told Reuters today.    "We have to control in which way, in which shape, it (the  text of the interview) will be published," Havel's spokesman  Ladislav Spacek told Reuters.    "I think it is good for us to be sure that nobody can take  just a part of the text and publish it in convenient context."    Reacting to this, Reuters wrote that under the communist  regime Havel had worked in the executive committee of the Czech  Pen Club, "a writers' organization which campaigned for freedom  to publish without government intervention."    According to Spacek, Havel stated he would refuse all  requests for interviews, including that from Reuters, before the  forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the Central European  countries in Litomysl, East Bohemia, to take place on April  15-16.    Spacek said that Havel was "dismayed" by the published  versions of several recent interviews he had had with local  press. Havel will not give any interviews to any news agency in  the future, Spacek announced.    "You know our press. Sometimes we must be more careful than  in the Western democracies where the press is on a higher level  of responsibility," Spacek said. "It's not very convenient for  us to see some quotation or cutting without any context which we  can't prerequisite or check beforehand."    Spacek gave a similar answer to the Czech News Agency (CTK)  when it requested an interview with Havel last week. "We cannot  approve the form of information in which it reaches the reader.  What matters in every case is also the context in which the  report appears in the media, and the statement which is  selected. These are the risks because of which we have not  granted an interview to CTK since the president has assumed  office (in January 1994)," Spacek told CTK, adding that "we can  still leave the question open."    CTK has requested the presidents of other Central European  states to grant it an interview before the Litomysl meeting.  Some press offices answered in the affirmative or turned the  request down, saying the head of state was busy.</p>

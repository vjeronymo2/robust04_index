			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Leading Article: There has to be a better way Last weekend's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, was an unmistakable debacle. Arriving with stern warnings that China's persecution of its dissidents was jeopardising renewal of its most favoured nation trading status, Mr Christopher was met with a robust refusal by Chinese leaders to discuss any link between human rights and trade. To ram home the message, the authorities rounded up a number of their usual suspects before and during the US envoy's stay. In spite of it all, Mr Christopher has lamely tried to present a few cosmetic Chinese concessions as evidence of a 'narrowing of differences' between Washington and Beijing. If the visit served no other useful purpose, it confirmed what many observers have suspected ever since President Bill Clinton attached a list of human rights conditions to a further renewal of China's MFN status, due by this June: that his administration has landed itself in an embarrassing bind over trade policy towards China. The risk, unless the issue is handled with greater care and clarity in the next two months, is that embarrassment could turn into humiliation or, worse, a trade dispute that will harm both sides. Wrong-headed Mr Clinton's attempt to use trade sanctions to influence China over human rights fulfilled a campaign promise but was wrong-headed from the start, for both philosophical and practical reasons. First, it was never likely to work: Beijing is least likely to give ground when under intense, public pressure. Second, trade is the wrong weapon. Export-led growth has brought the population of its southern coastal provinces increasing prosperity and economic freedom, which may over time bring greater political freedoms in its wake. Withdrawing MFN would penalise the very same people and give a great fillip to conservative bureaucrats still sceptical about the merits of China's opening to the world. Third, the Clinton administration has muddied the waters with conflicting signals in its dealings with the Chinese government - investing considerable effort, for example, in upgrading political relations at the same time as threatening sanctions to foster political change. In pursuing closer political contacts, President Clinton is acknowledging that Washington has a broad range of interests - strategic as well as economic or humanitarian - to discuss with China. Against that background, the MFN debate seems curiously out of proportion. Commercial fall-out Fourth, it now seems clear, the threat is so severe as to lack credibility. Withdrawal of MFN would lead to swingeing tariff increases that would harm other commercial powers of interest to the US - principally Hong Kong - at least as much as China itself. Chinese retaliation against US exports - Dollars 9bn last year and growing rapidly - would be inevitable. Beijing cannot have failed to notice the growing clamour in Washington from US businessmen anxious about the potential commercial fall-out. President Clinton thus risks being damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he seeks to renew MFN citing puny human rights concessions, he may be subject to attack in Congress for caving in. If he chooses not to, he will face a crisis in America's relations with the world's fastest growing economy and in his relations with his own business community. Averting the latter outcome, and preventing any recurrence of the MFN dilemma, ought now to be the highest priority for the White House. Fortunately, a way out of the mess is available. This would involve the US joining with its partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to negotiate speedy Chinese entry on the right terms. Chinese Gatt membership, with proper safeguards to tackle the specifically economic problems of integrating a state-dominated trading power into the world economy, would morally oblige the US to extend MFN status to China without political conditions. Washington could and should still show strong concern over human rights in China by political means such as increased contacts with dissidents and heightened attention to oppressed Tibet. But it would be better able to do so without an economic gun aimed at its own head as well as China's.</p>

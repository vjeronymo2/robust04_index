			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The city government  of Guangzhou, capital of economically booming Guangdong  Province, is calling on its citizens to show more concern for  handicapped orphans, to observe 1994 as the International Year  of the Family.    In the city's orphanages are living some 350 disabled  children who were abandoned by their parents because they  suffered from congenital or post-natal diseases, such as heart  disease or mental or physical handicaps.    Aiming to give these children the chance to enjoy family  happiness, various city government departments, including civil  affairs administration, women's federation and children's  welfare society, are working together for residents to adopt or  give financial aid to these unfortunate kids.    The children can be expected to grow more healthily if they  receive better family warmth, care, entertainment, medical care  and education.    So far, more than 40 orphans have been adopted or are  receiving help.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Nutty nukes Lord preserve us - how many more acronyms can the nuclear power industry come up with? Yesterday's report by the advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations - ACSNI - for the Health and Safety Commission - HSC - drew on the advice of the radioactive waste management advisory committee - RWMAC - and the nuclear installations inspectorate - NII. Whoa - there's more to come. The Atomic Energy Authority - AEA - now has a decommissioning and radioactive waste management operations directorate, known as DRAWMOPS. All this should be certified by the nuclear unloading think-tank section; also known as NUTS.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL'S TROUBLES MOUNT WITH 5-2 LOSS TO CANYON  </P> <P> There's no question that the bottom fell out for Foothill High School's  softball team this week. The only dispute is how far it fell.  </P> <P> After taking a 5-0 record into the second-to-last week of the Century League  season, Foothill -- ranked 10th in Orange County -- lost to then-last place El  Modena Tuesday and 5-2 to seventh-ranked Canyon Thursday. And Foothill might  have to forfeit another.  </P> <P> The league's athletic directors voted Monday that Foothill should forfeit a  game to Villa Park that was scheduled for April 3 but never played because of a  scheduling mix-up. However, Foothill Principal Jim Ryan said Thursday that the  league's principals have yet to declare a forfeit. On the other hand, Villa  Park Athletic Director Sue Gardiner said the principals have decided, ruling  the game a forfeit.  </P> <P> With the forfeit, Foothill would 15-11 and 5-3 in third place.  </P> <P> On the field, Foothill committed five errors in five innings and allowed four  unearned runs in four innings.  </P> <P> Krissy Kyriazis , who went 2 for 3, led off the third inning with a walk and  scored when right fielder Karen Hernandez missed a fly ball by Maureen Del  Mazzio. Del Mazzio scored on a squeeze bunt by Traci Himes.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Karen Jacobs and Stephanie Carew scored after Kyriazis singled  to left and left fielder Christina Mazurie let the ball get by her.  </P> <P> "When we get out in front you aren't going to get us," Canyon Coach Lance Eddy  said.  </P> <P> Not when Canyon pitcher Sara Roberts is on her game. Roberts shut down Foothill  for much of the game, allowing five singles and one earned run.  </P> <P> Relying on her fastball and an occasional changeup, Roberts (12-4) had a  shutout through four innings until she walked four consecutive batters in the  fifth. Foothill scored an unearned run in the sixth inning but Canyon center  fielder Kyriazis singled, moved to second and third on passed balls and scored  on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> The victory moved Canyon (19-4, 6-2) into first place in the league. Foothill  Coach Joe Gonzalez said Foothill, which had four errors against El Modena  Tuesday, might have committed more errors in the past two games than it has all  season.  </P> <P> "We're looking at a forfeit, so it could get really lonely," Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're concerned with fixing the defensive part of our game -- which  has been our strength -- in time for the playoffs."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Villa Park 8, Santa Ana 3 -- Munique Hernandez (9-4-1) pitched a six-hitter and  struck out six with no walks to lead host Villa Park (11-10-1, 6-2) Hernandez  had two hits, scored twice and had one RBI and Jamie Franco and her sister  Tiffanie Franco each had two hits for Villa Park.  </P> <P> El Modena 6, Santa Ana Valley 5 -- Jennifer Fleming tripled to drive in the  winning run with one out in the sixth inning for host El Modena (6-15, 3-5).  Kerry McGowan was 2 for 3 with two RBIs for El Modena.  </P></p>

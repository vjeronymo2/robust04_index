Has the Palestinian  delegation to the Taba negotiations received any new  instructions regarding tomorrow 's resumption of the Taba  negotiations?    [Al-Yahya] Yes. We and the Israeli side have agreed to  resume the second round of negotiations in Taba tomorrow  morning. I hope that during this round, we will be able to make  some progress on the security issue.    [Mu'addi] Has the Palestinian delegation received special  instructions from the PLO leadership on the resumption of these  negotiations?    [Al-Yahya] Yes. We received instructions this morning. The  Israeli side was contacted on this issue. We only hope that  this time negotiations will be successful and productive.    [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba also cover  the  topics listed on the agenda of the Civic Committee?    [Al-Yahya] Yes. The negotiations will also cover the work of  the Civic Committee.    [Mu'addi] What are the topics listed on the agenda of the  Security Committee?    [Al-Yahya] It might be correct to say that all issues are  listed. So far, we have not agreed on any particular issues.    [Mu'addi] What about the topics on the agenda of the Civic  Committee?    [Al-Yahya] During the past round, some progress was  achieved.  We hope that progress will continue in the same pattern.    [Mu'addi] In light of the consultations that were held with  the PLO leadership, do you believe that it is possible to  overcome the obstacles and reach an agreement on security issues  during this round of negotiations?    [Al-Yahya] Everything is possible. I believe that this issue  depends more on the Israeli side than on the Palestinian side.    [Mu'addi] Are there any new proposals or compromises with  respect to the pending security issues: Control of the  crossings and the size of the Jericho region?    [Al-Yahya] So far, there are no compromises. But I hope that  during this round, we will be able to achieve some progress.  This round is supposed to continue until Friday [21 January].    [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba take place  within the general committee or within the subcommittees of  negotiations?    [Al-Yahya] Negotiations will be held within the framework of  both the subcommittees and the general committee. To explain,  there are now two drafting committees, one on security issues,  the other is civilian. There is also a general drafting  committee which covers all topics and which will draft a final  formula of the major agreement and its security and civilian  appendixes.    [Mu'addi] Maj. Gen. 'Abd-al-Razzaq a-Yahya, head of the  Security Committee, many thanks.    [Al-Yahya] Thank you.</p>

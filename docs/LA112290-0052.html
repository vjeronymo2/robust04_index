			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA  </P> <P> An inmate at the County Jail in Vista died at Tri-City Medical Center after  hanging himself with a telephone cord in a holding cell at the jail, the  Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Armando Ramirez Rabago, 28, of Vista was found unconscious about 11 p.m.  Tuesday by deputies who were conducting a nightly count of all inmates, said  Lt. E. J. Lubic of the Vista jail.  </P> <P> Deputies performed CPR with no response, and Rabago was taken by ambulance to  the Oceanside hospital. He died Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Rabago, who was unemployed, was arrested in Vista Monday night in connection  with a 1983 murder and was brought to the jail about 9:30 p.m., Lubic said.  Deputies booked him but did not complete the classification process that would  place him in more permanent housing in the jail, because other duties took  precedence, he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Rabago appeared in court for arraignment and was ordered to return  to court Wednesday, Lubic said. When Rabago was brought back to the jail late  Tuesday evening, he was placed in a holding cell and the classification process  was reinitiated by a deputy.  </P> <P> The process was interrupted by deputies making their nightly count, Lubic said.  Rabago was left alone for a short time in the concrete cell, one of several on  the first floor equipped with a wall phone, Lubic said.  </P> <P> A coroner's examination was planned.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and Empress  Michiko left Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday [10 June] morning for  Atlanta, Georgia, to begin a 17-day, 11-city visit to the United  States.    The emperor and empress are the first state guests of the  administration of President Bill Clinton since he took office in  January 1993.    In Atlanta, the emperor and empress will meet former  President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, widow of  assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King, government  officials said.    They will be in Washington for four days from Saturday, and  will meet President Bill Clinton, lay a wreath at Arlington  Cemetery and visit an elementary school.    Clinton will hold a welcoming ceremony for the imperial  couple Monday at the White House.    The couple will also travel to New York, St. Louis, Longmont  and Denver in Colorado, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu.    In New York, they will meet UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus- Ghali, and in Los Angeles, former U.S. President Ronald  Reagan.    In Honolulu, they will lay a wreath at the National Memorial  Cemetery of the Pacific but will not visit Pearl Harbor, on  which Japan launched a devastating attack on Dec. 7, 1941.    The government dropped plans for the emperor to visit the  USS  Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from  conservative Japanese circles, who fear the emperor would be  expected to make an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S.  into World War II.    It is the second visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S.  Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Emperor Showa, made the  first such visit in 1975.    It is also the imperial couple's first U.S. tour since the  emperor succeeded his deceased father in January 1989, and their  third official visit to the U.S., which they visited twice as  crown prince and princess.    The couple will return to Tokyo on June 26.</p>

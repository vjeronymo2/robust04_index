			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ibeth Vega G.] </F>   [Excerpts] President Guillermo Endara yesterday expressed  his agreement with the Supreme Court's opposition to the  constitutional reforms that grant the Electoral Tribunal the  power to interpret the Constitution on electoral issues.    Endara indicated that if the Electoral Tribunal members "do  not make the corrections quickly, I believe the bill (with the  constitutional reforms) is in danger of failing."    Endara's remarks come after the Supreme Court announced its  opposition to the constitutional reforms that permit the  Electoral Tribunal to interpret the Constitution on electoral  issues. The Supreme Court considers the reforms "inadvisable"  for the administration of justice.    "I know the court's opinion, and I personally agree with  it,"  added Endara. [passage omitted]    The executive branch presented to the Legislative Assembly  two constitutional reforms to grant autonomy to the Electoral  Tribunal and to eliminate the possibility of an army existing in  the country.    Nevertheless, according to Supreme Court President Arturo  Hoyos, the justices unanimously agree that the first reform is  inadvisable.    "In the way it has been proposed, this reform might be a  source of constant conflict between the Electoral Tribunal and  the Supreme Court of Justice," Hoyos added.</p>

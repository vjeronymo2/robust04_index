			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATING MODERN POETS OF THE AMERICAS;  </P> <P> READINGS: SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN POETS SHARED SELECTIONS FROM THEIR WORKS IN  THREE ORANGE COUNTY CITIES. THE RECITALS ARE PART OF A WEEKLONG FESTIVAL  ORGANIZED BY CAL STATE FULLERTON.  </P> <P> But the lords of darkness (the censors) said, "Let no one approach this tree.  Let no one dare pick this fruit." And a girl whose name was Blood Girl knew  this history. The maiden bravely asked, 'Why can't I know this tree's miracle?'  And she jumped over the oppressor's words of warning and approached the tree.  She approached the tree so that the myth could bring us together in its image.  Because the woman is the freedom that provokes action. And the hero is the  unhindered will."  </P> <P>  -- From "The Calabash Tree"  </P> <P> by Pablo Antonio Cuadra  </P> <P> Quito Downs, a writer and artist who lives in El Toro, grew up in Nicaragua  during the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. As a teen-ager, he voiced  his discontent by writing letters to the editor of La Prensa, the country's  only independent newspaper. Several of the letters were published, but Downs  left Nicaragua before he got to meet the editor, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, an  internationally known poet and journalist who was imprisoned twice by Somoza.  </P> <P> Downs was among the first to arrive to hear Cuadra, now 78, and other poets  give recitals Wednesday night at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library.  </P> <P> Cuadra, who combines the pre-Mayan myths of his homeland with the modern  folklore of Central American Indians, read three poems, including "The Calabash  Tree," dedicated to Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the publisher of La Prensa whose  assassination in 1978 was a catalyst for the 1979 Sandinista revolution.  </P> <P> Cuadra originally was a Sandinista supporter but became disillusioned with the  movement's policies and eventually backed the Contras. In retaliation, the  Sandinistas shut down La Prensa for 15 months in 1986-87.  </P> <P> He said that the new government -- headed by Chamorro's widow, Violeta Barrios  de Chamorro, who defeated Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in the February  presidential election -- presents another opportunity for Nicaragua to achieve  democracy. The Nicaraguan people, he said, have always loved freedom, but in  the past, totalitarian governments have risen from the very revolutions that  promised a better life.  </P> <P> Cuadra hopes that this time it will be different, since more countries are  turning to democracy. The Eastern Europeans, he said, have helped pave the way.  </P> <P> Cuadra was a member of the 1920s' Vanguard literary movement, which sought to  create a poetry indigenous to Nicaragua, free from European influences imposed  by Modernism. He was influenced by the poet and revolutionary Augusto Cesar  Sandino, who fought off a U.S. Marine occupation of Nicaragua during the 1920s  and 1930s.  </P> <P> Cuadra stepped down recently from his position as editor of La Prensa but still  edits the newspaper's literary supplement.  </P> <P> Colombian poet Juan Gustavo Cobo Borda also read Wednesday, along with Daphne  Marlatt of Canada. The readings were part of La Terra Nova 1990, a weeklong  festival organized by Cal State Fullerton to celebrate contemporary poetry of  the Americas. The festival is a co-production of the Los Angeles Festival and  the 1990-1992 Orange County Festival of Discovery.  </P> <P> While Cuadra, Cobo Borda and Marlatt read in San Juan Capistrano, Guatemalan  poet Carlos Illescas read at the La Habra Library along with Peruvian poet  Blanca Varela. Veronica Volkow of Mexico, Alfonso Barrera Valverde of Ecuador,  Gonzalo Rojas of Chile and Eduardo Mitre of Bolivia read at the Corbin Center  in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The lineup, selected by organizers Florinda Mintz and Paul Vangelisti, drew  criticism from the Southern California Salvadoran community because it  originally included David Escobar Galindo, a Salvadoran poet linked to the  right-wing Cristiani government. Galindo eventually canceled so he could attend  the United Nations peace talks that resumed this week.  </P> <P> "We never meant to offend anybody," said Mintz, an Argentine writer who lives  in Santa Ana. "The goal was to bring the poets here as individuals and artists,  as world citizens."  </P> <P> The festival closes today after an all-day student poetry workshop at Cal State  Fullerton.  </P></p>

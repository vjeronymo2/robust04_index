			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EAST TO WEST, WOODLAND HILLS TRIUMPHS;  </P> <P> WEST: DEFENDING WORLD SERIES CHAMPION OPENS LEGION PLAYOFFS WITH A 10-7  VICTORY.  </P> <P> What, Woodland Hills West worry?  </P> <P> The defending American Legion World Series champion moved out to a 3-0 lead  over Lancaster in the first inning of its first-round District 20 playoff game  Tuesday afternoon at Pierce College and never looked back.  </P> <P> Despite giving up four runs -- two unearned -- in the ninth, Pat Treend (4-1)  lifted West to a 10-7 win, the team's 16th victory in a row and 19th in 20  games. West (20-4) now will take on Quartz Hill, a 5-3 winner over Panorama  City on Tuesday, in a second-round game at 4:15 p.m. Thursday at Pierce.  Lancaster faces Panorama City in a losers' bracket game at 4:15 p.m. today at  Pierce.  </P> <P> "Pat pitched a good one today," West Coach Don Hornback said of Treend, the  City Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year at El Camino Real in the  spring. "The only inning he didn't look good was the last one. He was in  control most of the time."  </P> <P> West racked up 17 hits to stake Treend to a 10-3 lead before Lancaster rallied  in the top of the ninth.  </P> <P> Tyrone Murphy, a younger brother of former Oakland Athletics' star Dwayne  Murphy, led off the ninth with a double to the center-field fence, followed by  a hard-hit single by George Boykins.  </P> <P> Although Treend seemed to be tiring at that point, Boykins' single was the last  solid hit of the inning.  </P> <P> Mark Hartman hit a slow roller to shortstop Gregg Sheren, whose throw was too  late to catch Hartman as Murphy scored.  </P> <P> Chad Eberhardt then beat out a drag bunt down the first-base line that loaded  the bases. Lancaster third baseman David Looke struck out for the first out,  swinging at a curve in the dirt, a high fastball, and another curve, bringing  up Aaron Searcy.  </P> <P> Searcy hit a high bouncer fielded by West third baseman Del Marine, whose throw  sailed over first baseman Jason Cohen's head for a two-base error, scoring two  runs.  </P> <P> Erroll Sprago then hit a sacrifice fly to left and Brandon Newcomb followed  with a high fly to center for the final out.  </P> <P> "We waited too long," said Lancaster Coach Mike Eberhardt.  </P> <P> "Treend pitched a good game until the end when he got tired. That's what  happens to pitchers this time of year. He's pitched a lot this year."  </P> <P> Hornback was pleased with Treend's effort.  </P> <P> "I wanted to keep Pat to 110 pitches and when he got the last batter, he  (finished at) 106," said Hornback. "We have four other guys who can come in and  throw strikes so I wasn't worried."  </P> <P> Lancaster missed right fielder Heath Fine, who is on vacation. West's eighth  and ninth runs scored in the seventh inning when right fielder Jake Cox, who  entered the game in the top of the inning, let Marine's fly ball drop behind  him for a three-base error, scoring two runs.  </P> <P> Lancaster committed three errors -- two of which contributed to runs -- behind  starter and loser Kevin Branch.  </P> <P> Marine and designated-hitter Greg Lederman each went three for four with two  runs batted in for West. Catcher Bobby Kim also had two RBIs.  </P> <P> Chad Eberhardt led Lancaster with three hits and three RBIs.  </P></p>

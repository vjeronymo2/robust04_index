			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Observer: Roundabout U-turns are becoming a fact of life for the prime minister, John Major. But in excluding John Butterfill, the portly MP for Bournemouth West, from the committee charged with scrutinising the finance bill, the government has surpassed itself. This was a U-turn on a U-turn. When Butterfill's name was missing from the list of committee members originally published earlier this month, it was described as an 'oversight' and the omission swiftly rectified. But Butterfill has been dropped again. This time, according to one committee member, 'a shady deal' had been hatched between the whips offices excluding one MP from both leading parties. Who is supposed to be deceived? All Westminster knows Butterfill is no friend of the government's planned reform of the North Sea tax regime. His presence on the committee - which began its deliberations yesterday - would have resulted in an apparent majority for his proposed changes.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chrysler triples earnings to Dollars 356m in final quarter CHRYSLER, the US motor manufacturer, yesterday underscored the gradual recovery in the North American vehicle market and its own sharply-improved performance by announcing fourth-quarter net earnings more than tripled from 1991. Chrysler, the smallest and most financially vulnerable of Detroit's big three manufacturers, had net earnings of Dollars 356m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with Dollars 97m, or 33 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 10.2bn, up from Dollars 8.2bn. The figures were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, which had been pitched around Dollars 1.05 a share. Chrysler had forecast profits of more than Dollars 300m as part of the regulatory filings for its current offering of 40m shares. The company's shares to closed up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 in New York, which would allow its share issue to raise Dollars 1.59bn gross. Chrysler is the first of the Detroit companies to report fourth-quarter figures. Ford Motor has already signalled it expects a loss - largely due to problems in Europe - which analysts think may total between Dollars 250m and Dollars 450m. General Motors, which is undergoing a drastic restructuring of its lossmaking North American operations, could produce figures ranging from a small profit to losses of Dollars 300m before special charges. Chrysler, whose long-term survival was questioned two years ago, reported 1992 earn ings of Dollars 723m, or Dollars 2.21 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 795m, or Dollars 3.28, in 1991. Revenues rose from Dollars 29.4bn to Dollars 36.9bn. Its share of the North American car and truck market rose from 12.4 per cent in 1991 to 13.4 per cent, helped by the launch of new vehicles. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, and Mr Robert Lutz, president, said volumes and margins were up for the year and discounts to sell vehicles were lower. However, they said the company had to continue to improve its product launches, cost reduction efforts and quality and productivity gains. 'The economic recovery in the US continues to be slow and neither our balance sheet nor our credit rating are where we want them to be,' they added.</p>

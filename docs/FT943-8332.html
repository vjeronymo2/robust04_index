			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Ukraine settles gas dispute Russia and Ukraine reached a new agreement yesterday on the repayment of debt to Moscow for the supply of gas. Ukraine agreed to pay over 25 per cent of its Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 779m) gas debt to Gazprom, Russia's largest gas company, over the next three months. The remainder will be recouped by selling Gazprom an ownership stake in Ukrainian gas enterprises. This has averted, for the time being, Russian threats to cut Ukraine's gas supplies. Ukraine has already reneged on two previous debt agreements in April and June, but the Russians have adopted a lenient line. Previous attempts to cut gas supplies have failed since Ukraine can siphon off gas from other supply routes - 90 per cent of Russia's supplies to the West flow through Ukrainian territory. The cash-strapped Ukraine is struggling to stabilise its economy.</p>

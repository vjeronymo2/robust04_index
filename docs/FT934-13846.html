			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Interest in new town property up sharply THE Commission for New Towns yesterday reported a doubling of inquiries during the past six months from potential purchasers of land and buildings, Michael Cassell writes. The commission, which is responsible for selling the assets of the 21 former English new towns, said improved marketing techniques and a revival in economic confidence had led to a revival of interest in its property portfolio. Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman, said that nearly 1,800 specific inquiries had been received since April, more than double the total recorded during the same period a year earlier. He added: 'After several years of uncertainty and depressed property markets, it is encouraging to report some signs of an upturn. This is in no way to suggest unalloyed optimism about the future of asset sales, but it is an indication that perhaps the worst is behind us.' Sir Neil said interest from overseas companies had strengthened in recent months, not just from traditional sources such as the Far East but also from continental Europe. He cited one Taiwanese manufacturing company which is to close its plant in Germany and relocate at an existing facility in Telford, Shropshire, 'because of lower costs and a more supportive environment'. The recession, however, ensured that receipts from property and land sales in 1992-93 fell to their lowest level since the mid-1980s. The commission registered 435 sales of land and property during the year to April compared with 837 in the previous year. The value of commission sales including commercial property, development sites and housing land totalled Pounds 136.5m against Pounds 177.4m for 1991-92. Sales to date, which have raised more than Pounds 2bn in the past decade, leave the commission with a portfolio of 18,000 acres of housing and commercial land spread throughout England. Half of it has planning permission. There is also 2.5m sq ft of available commercial premises for sale. The commission announced earlier this month that it is to be split into two agencies.</p>

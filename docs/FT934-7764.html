			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentina issues Dollars 500m in 10-year global bonds ARGENTINA is to issue about Dollars 500m in 10-year dollar-denominated global bonds next month, refinancing debt falling due in December. Mr Daniel Marx, finance under-secretary, said yesterday the new bonds would 'be an updated model of Argentina's traditional Bonex (external bonds) and a blend of global Eurobonds'. Argentina had Dollars 3.82bn in dollar-denominated Bonex outstanding in July 1993. They enjoy an unrivalled reputation in the local market since the government has never skipped an interest payment and never postponed repayment. Argentine private and government borrowers have been issuing record volumes of bonds on the Euromarket. However, the federal government has been rolling over redemption, existing debt or reshaping its debt profile rather than raising fresh funds. Mr Marx said the new fixed interest Global Bonex would be priced early next month. The issue is being handled by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers of the US and Argentina's Banco Rio. The bonds will be listed in US, European, Asian and Latin American markets. They will also be registered with the US Securities Exchange Commission. Mr Marx said previous Bonex issues had been cumbersome, with settlement requiring physical exchange of certificates, which inhibited trading. The new global Bonex should benefit from improved settlement procedures and therefore become more liquid.</p>

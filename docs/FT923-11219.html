			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Ideas that progress to the past: What shocks people most is not always obvious or maybe it was the bladder  - of the BBC's Broadcasting House. I was taking part in a studio discussion. Two topics came up. First, was Lady Thatcher wrong to take up a post - as the press say she is - with the American cigarette company Philip Morris. Second, on the 25th anniversary of the British campaign to legalise cannabis, should we now decriminalise that drug? The first question was easy to answer: of course Lady Thatcher should feel no pangs of conscience in taking up such an appointment. The smoking of cigarettes I said, was a time-honoured and inoffensive habit, which gives pleasure to millions. Cars kill people, I pontificated, but no-one would complain if Lady T had taken up a directorship with Rover or General Motors. On the question of Cannabis, I nervously suggested that legalisation might not be a terrible thing. I then awaited what I thought would be a barrage of calls from angry Radio 4 listeners, castigating me for daring to suggest that hippy drugs should be made freely available. There was a barrage of angry calls. So much so that while we were still on air the producer of the programme urgently requested the presenter - I could hear his headphones buzzing - to correct some of my remarks. But not one of the irate complaints was about the dangers of cannabis. They were all denouncing my toleration of the smoking of commercial cigarettes. In 25 years the world has turned upside down. Even in the heart of England, what was once mind blowing is now mainstream; what was once acceptable is now anathema. The same is true in the US. If Ross Perot had a politician's sensitivity to this sea change, he would still have his hat in the presidential ring. But two weeks ago he referred to American blacks as 'you' rather than 'we' and from that politically incorrect moment he did not stand a chance. A senior English politician recently marvelled to me at the speed which received wisdom is turned topsy-turvy. His mailbag has been filled with correspondence from constituents about the threatened closing of London Zoo. Almost all of the letters are anti-Zoo, denouncing the whole business as cruel and unnatural. The MP was amazed. Ten years ago he said, such views were held only by the loony eco-fringe of the Liberal Party. I had the same feeling of bewilderment when I picked up a remaindered book in Bath the other day. It is called Pregnancy and it is written by Dr Gordon Bourne, consultant gynaecologist to the Royal Masonic Hospital. This is what Dr Bourne has to say on a rather sensitive matter: 'From a purely biological aspect the masculine type of female and the effeminate type of male are not good vehicles for reproduction and the procreation of the human race. Nature caters for these phenomena by introducing female homosexuality, or lesbianism, which is the association of woman with woman and is partly confined to the masculine type of female. 'Male homosexuality is the association of man with man and is usually, but not always, confined to the effeminate type of male. Associations of this nature are, of course, reproductively sterile which is the obvious biological solution to the problem in so far as it automatically eliminated such particular human types from procreation.' This passage, archaic yet convincingly logical, was written only 20 years ago. At that time the book was reviewed favourably by The Guardian (and has been widely respected for its medical counsel.) But what would Guardian Woman say now about the good doctor Bourne's advice to women after giving birth to 'put on some make-up and tidy your hair.' Indeed, what would Guardian reviewers say about a book which damned masculine women and effeminate men as biologically inferior? The biggest mistake of all is to conclude that we must be right about everything now, and were wrong about everything then. In another 20 years the next generation will laugh at our fixed ideas. They may even have rediscovered the toleration of smoking, the joy of zoos, and the wisdom of Dr Bourne. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

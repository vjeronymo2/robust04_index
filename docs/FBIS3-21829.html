They arrested the 15 members of the crew.  The drug was discovered inside a container during the  preliminary search at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay,  Cuba. The ship was due for a more thorough search on 6 March  upon its landing in the Florida Everglades. Of the 15 people  arrested, 12 are of Colombian nationality and the three others  are from Peru. Their identities were not revealed.    Twelve kg of cocaine concealed in plastic containers was  intercepted on 5 March at the international airport. The  national anti-drug brigade proceeded to arrest the two  smugglers, a U.S. citizen of Haitian origin and a Haitian woman  named Joanne Francois. The drug seized at the airport is  assessed at 12 kg.    Furthermore, a small boat carrying 50 bags of marijuana  wrecked in Torbeck in the Port-Salut region and was discovered  by the anti-drug brigade. However, the smuggler was concealed by  the population that had seized the boat. Two men from Colombia,  who were still aboard the boat, were arrested.</p>

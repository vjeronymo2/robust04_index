			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELLFLOWER ANTI-REDEVELOPMENT PETITION DRIVE FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> A citizens' group has failed to garner enough voter support to challenge the  recent creation of a Community Redevelopment Agency in this mostly residential  town.  </P> <P> But leaders of the small group vowed to continue their fight against the agency  through the ballot box.  </P> <P> Officials of Citizens Against Another Redevelopment Plan, which unsuccessfully  fought three pro-redevelopment initiatives approved by voters in November, said  last week that they were short of the required signatures to either force the  council to repeal the month-old ordinance that created the agency or call a  special election in the spring.  </P> <P> The group launched a petition drive last month, the day after the City Council  exercised its newly acquired power to create an agency. The group needed to  gather 2,800 signatures -- 10% of Bellflower's registered voters -- by the end  of last week.  </P> <P> The organization collected only 2,200 signatures through its mail-in petition  drive, and did not bother to deliver them to City Hall, group officials said.  </P> <P> "We really thought the signatures were out there," group treasurer Ruth Gilson  said. "We thought for sure enough would come back (through the mail)."  </P> <P> Organization members mailed out blank petition forms to most households in  Bellflower, asking registered voters to sign the one-page document, gather five  more signatures and return the form by mail to the Gilson home.  </P> <P> "We'll wait until the (redevelopment) plan is set up," said former Mayor James  Earl Christo, a Bellflower Boulevard businessman and a group member who was  defeated in his 1986 City Council reelection bid. "Then we'll take an active  role in taking it to the voters again."  </P> <P> Although a proposed area has been earmarked for future redevelopment projects,  city officials said that a comprehensive redevelopment plan will not be  completed for six to nine months.  </P> <P> City officials said they were relieved that the signature-gathering effort  failed. They estimated that a special election would have cost the city between  $20,000 and $30,000.  </P> <P> "People don't understand that these elections cost a lot of money," said Mayor  Kenneth J. Cleveland, who supported the creation of a redevelopment agency in  this city of 61,000 residents. "I hope (the long-running controversy over the  creation of an agency) is finally over."  </P> <P> The often bitter dispute over whether a redevelopment agency would benefit or  hurt the city began in the early 1980s when the council first proposed a  sweeping redevelopment plan that put almost one-third of the city in a  redevelopment area. The current proposed plan earmarks only 605 acres of the  6-square-mile city as a redevelopment zone.  </P> <P> Christo was swept into city office in 1982 on an anti-redevelopment platform.  The next year, he led a petition drive to force a special election. Voters in  that election, apparently fearing their homes would be threatened by an  agency's land-taking power, overwhelmingly voted to prohibit the council from  creating a redevelopment agency without voter approval.  </P> <P> But voters rescinded that restriction in November by passing three  pro-redevelopment initiatives by narrow margins.  </P> <P> The initiatives, which restored the council's power to create an agency without  voter approval, also banned condemnation of residential property and outlined a  proposed redevelopment area that includes the commercial and industrial  corridors along Artesia, Bellflower and Lakewood boulevards.  </P> <P> Citizens Against Another Redevelopment Plan officials attributed the failure of  their petition drive to the lack of signature-collecting manpower and the  possibility that many residents may have considered the petition form as "junk  mail" and thrown it away without studying it.  </P> <P> "The mail-out is never as effective as going out to markets and the street to  collect signatures," Christo said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residents Accept It  </P> <P> But Cleveland said that the drive failed because residents have now come to  accept that Bellflower needs redevelopment to stay competitive with other  cities for sales tax revenue.  </P> <P> Redevelopment agencies sponsor renewal projects in aging sections of cities by  offering developers incentives, such as low-cost land, to build commercial and  industrial projects.  </P> <P> The city benefits from increased sales tax and property tax revenue generated  by the renewal projects.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of people who were against it (redevelopment)," Cleveland said.  "Now they come up to me and ask, 'When are you going to get moving on this?' "  </P> <P> "We were waiting for this thing (the petition drive) to pass," Cleveland said.  "Now I expect we will be moving on it in an orderly fashion and get a project  under way as soon as possible."  </P></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Fiddler on the Roof' revived - Theatre Any musical whose first three numbers are 'Tradition', 'Matchmaker, matchmaker' and 'If I were a rich man' is unstoppably airborne from curtain up. For its first half at least, Fiddler on the Roof is an example of that apparent oxymoron, a great musical. Like some of my colleagues, I believe that serious subjects should be treated as opera or stay as spoken theatre; anything in between tends to turn out shallow and bathetic. But throughout Act 1 of this classic 1964 show, currently revived at the London Palladium, the impetus of words and music are enough to quieten doubts; even to overcome the occasional hint of under-rehearsed dance or over-relaxed star. For Topol is back in the town which launched his international fame in this role. As noted in the Manchester revival half a dozen years ago, his familiarity with the part of Tevye the milkman has led to effortless mastery. He can express more with eyes wordlessly widened in mock-modest amazement than most other actors do by tearing a passion to tatters. Although he still begins 'If I were a rich man' with rapt, pent-up glee (is it lese-majeste to see a line of descent from Fagin's 'I'm reviewing the situation', another sinuously rambling wishful fantasy, in Bart's Oliver?), his relationship with God (still situated in the gallery, house left) has grown more casual with the years. The respectful man-to-man tone of Tevye's grumbles, queries and gentle reproofs to the deity has taken on a genially hectoring note that suggests he might withdraw his allegiance if pushed too far. Whose show is it anyway? Ultimately Shalom Aleichem's, of course. His short stories about the Jewish communities in small-town Tsarist Russia provided the basis for Joseph Stein's book and Sheldon Harnick's lyrics; a cultural framework that enables Jerry Bock's music to tap a rich mine of musical reference in eastern European modes, oriental rhythms, a touch of the gypsy; a ready-made idiom that combines gaiety with minor-key melancholy and the constant possibility of tribulation. The first act's strength lies in its consistency. In Act 2 Broadway comes to Anatevka: a number like 'Now I have everything' could belong anywhere on the Great White Way. And for a while the piece shows its padding; the plot by now is episodic, no more than the story of how Tevye's daughters find unsuitable attachments, one after the other. But Tevye's unforgiving attitude to Chava's love for a goy adds grit to the soft centre; and this production (Sammy Dallas Bayes, reproducing Jerome Robbins' Broadway original) gains from excellent casting that differentiates between the girls  -the timidly proud eagerness of Jacquelyn Yorke's love for her poverty-stricken little tailor, Jo John's sturdy determination to join her student radical in Siberia, the bookish quietness of Adi Topol-Margalith's Chava. Admirable support, among others, from two ex-Royal National Theatre players: Peter Darling, whose militant young idealist is a trial run for the Chekhovian eternal student, and Sara Kestelman, beautifully restrained and touching as Tevye's sharp-tongued, loyal wife. And only the most rigidly orthodox will object to casting, as the butcher, an actor called Bacon . . . The set bears Boris Aronson's name, as in the original production, but looks rather more like a Christmas card than the Chagall it once evoked. Small quibbles apart, the show is confirmed as simply one of the best Broadway musicals, with a courageous ending that makes West Side Story look sickly-sweet in comparison. The Jews are expelled again. The coloured backdrop is blank, suddenly abstract. Matchmaker Yente cheerfully decides to aim for the Holy Land: 'Next year in Jerusalem'. Others go to America. Some make for Cracow and Warsaw, perhaps westernised Germany. Are they the lucky ones? Fiddler on the Roof offers no easy comfort for what may lie in the years ahead.

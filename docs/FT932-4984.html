			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Italians punish established parties at the polls ITALY'S Christian Democrat and Socialist parties yesterday appeared the principal victims of the political corruption scandal with a collapse in support at partial administrative elections involving 10.5m voters. Exit polls from Milan, Turin and Catania, the three biggest cities voting to elect new mayors and councils, showed support for the two parties had crumbled against an upsurge by the autonomist Lega Nord in the northern cities and the anti-Mafia La Rete (Network) movement in Sicily. Exit polls immediately after voting closed at 10pm gave the Lega Nord 41.7 per cent of the vote in Milan, 23.6 percentage points above its showing in the April 1992 general election. It also performed strongly in Turin, doubling its share of the vote to 22.1 per cent. Support for the Christian Democrats fell to 8.5 per cent in Milan, almost 8 percentage points below their showing last year, while the Socialist vote crashed to just 2.2 per cent, 11 percentage points down. In Catania, La Rete almost pushed the Christian Democrats into second place, with 17.2 per cent of the vote according to exit polls. This compared with 18.2 per cent for the Christian Democrats, whose share of the vote dropped by almost 16 per cent since last year. The elections, involving 1,192 towns, six provinces and the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, provided the first indication of the country's political mood. Since the last general election, voters have been fed an almost daily diet of revelations of political corruption. A new general election, based on a reformed voting system, is expected next autumn. Yesterday's elections have broken new constitutional as well as political ground, with polling being held on one day, rather than carried over to Monday. The communal elections mark the first time Italians vote directly for their mayor, while in many parts of the country the polling system has been altered to create more stable administrations. The present, transitional, nature of Italian politics and breakdown in traditional party allegiances was underlined by the quantity and variety of candidates. Twelve contenders were competing to be mayor of Milan, while over 1,000 candidates were contesting the 60 seats on the city council. The mayoral battles in Milan, Turin and Catania are widely expected to go to a second round run-off on June 20 as none of the leading contenders is expected to obtain an absolute majority this time. In Milan the contest will be between Mr Formentini and Mr Nando dalla Chiesa, a left-wing sociologist and MP supported by La Rete and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former Communists. Favourite in Turin is Mr Diego Novelli, a former mayor supported by La Rete and the hardline Restructured Communism movement, who is likely to face Mr Valentino Castellani, backed by a local voters' alliance and the PDS, Republicans and Greens. The Catania poll is also expected to involve a run-off between candidates backed by parties outside the established spectrum, in this case the Democratic Alliance and La Rete respectively.</p>

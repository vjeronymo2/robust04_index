			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Sunday trading There will be much ranting and raving before Parliament changes the legislation affecting Sunday trading. But whatever the outcome, investors in the retailing sector will lose little by plugging their ears. Some evidence suggests total consumer spending would rise as a result of deregulation. A contentious study, commissioned by the Home Office, forecast that 19,000 jobs would be lost and prices would fall as more sales were won by efficient multiple chains. Even if correct, these considerations are marginal when set against the bigger forces shaping the industry. The overall impact of deregulation is likely to prove inconsequential. That is clearly not true for some individual sectors, such as DIY. But despite the moralistic rationalisations, the main division between retailers about whether to open boils down to crude self-interest. By and large, those shops which find it economic to trade on Sundays are already doing so. In Scotland, where Sunday trading is unrestricted, only about 25 per cent of retail space opens on the sabbath. In England and Wales, that figure now amounts to about 29 per cent. Deregulation would probably just formalise the existing arrangements. The big grocery chains would continue to open seven days a week to help defray the heavy overhead costs of their superstores. But the exercise is proving only marginally profitable. Other big retailers, such as Marks and Spencer, Sears, and Burton, which trade chiefly on the high street, may only find it worthwhile to open on Sundays in the run-up to Christmas.</p>

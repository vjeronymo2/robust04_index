			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (17): Liquidity, security and equity  -Portfolio planning CONSUMERS normally acquire investments on a haphazard basis: a word from a friend here; a newspaper article there; the persuasion of a salesman somewhere else. But how does one work out a sensible portfolio of investments and policies which actually meet your needs? There is no magic formula that applies to everyone, which is why advisers and salesmen have to take you through a fact-find when they first meet you. John Cole, of financial advisers Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says that investors should sit down with a blank piece of paper and write down all their sources of income and their normal expenditure, and see what money is surplus and thus available for investment. Then they should think about their ultimate objective, whether it is providing for school fees, retirement or a daughter's wedding. Most people have an inflated idea of what their pension will actually be worth; just finding out what your pension benefits are is a useful exercise in itself. Make sure you have the basics in place. If you have dependants, do you have life insurance? You may find this is provided by your work; if not, then term assurance is the cheapest way of providing what you need. There is no investment element to term assurance; it is just like house or car insurance. If you do not make a claim, you do not get any premiums back. Savers should also decide what level of risk they are happy with. Mr Cole says it is vital that the investor understands the product he or she is buying and is comfortable with it. Once you have a clear idea of your current financial position, your financial goals, and your attitude to risk, then you can start to think about your portfolio. Mr Cole says any portfolio should have three elements: liquidity, a backbone of guarantee and security, and equity-related growth products. Broadly speaking, the younger you are, or the longer term your goals, the greater the proportion of your portfolio that should be in shares. This is because, over the long term, equities have provided the best returns. But shares can, of course, be risky in the short term. So anyone saving for the next holiday, or an elderly person who needs income, should limit the equity proportion. The best way for the small investor to get into shares is via a unit or investment trust. These buy a widespread portfolio of stocks, and thus reduce the risk of one company going wrong. If held in a personal equity plan, all income and gains are tax-free. Again, the advantages of a Pep show through in the long term; in the short term, the charges can easily destroy the tax benefits, especially for a basic-rate taxpayer. Buying an indexed fund which grows in line with the FT-SE 100 or the All-Share wipes out the risk of picking a poor-performing fund manager. The charges are lower, too. For the cautious, guaranteed equity products provide a way to get some of the benefits of share investment without risking your original capital. Turning to the 'secure' portion of the portfolio, investors could consider the following: National Savings. Decent returns if held for five years, often with tax advantages. Gilts. Bonds issued by the UK government, which offer a fixed income and a fixed repayment value on a fixed date. Index-linked gilts. Repayment value and income grow in line with inflation. Very tax-efficient, because most of the return comes in the form of capital gain. Guaranteed income bonds. These pay a fixed income (after basic rate tax is deducted) and return your capital after a set period of years. Zero dividend preference shares. Issued by investment trusts, these pay no income but will be repaid at considerably more than their face value. Profits are subject to capital gains (not income) tax, which few people pay. With-profits policies. These are issued by insurance companies and should normally only be considered if you can wait at least 10 years for your return. They give poor value if surrendered early. Finally, on the liquidity element of the portfolio. There can be more imaginative choices than just the building society. Money market funds offer competitive rates, and two (Fidelity and M &amp; G) give chequebooks to those with over Pounds 5,000. A Tessa gives tax-free interest if held for five years; all that happens if you withdraw money early is that you pay the tax you would have paid in the first place. It makes sense to get financial advice, although make sure that you know on what terms you are paying for it. Most FT readers should consider paying a fee, so that the adviser is paid by you, rather than by the product provider. But whether fees or commissions, go to an independent adviser in preference to a tied agent who just works for one company.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> CURBS ON PLO TALKS SOUGHT  </P> <P> The Senate, under pressure from the Bush Administration, has agreed to postpone  consideration of a bill that would place new restrictions on Washington's  dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the New York Times  reported. Israeli officials are putting increased pressure on the  Administration and Congress to stop the meetings, which began after PLO  Chairman Yasser Arafat stated late last year that the group had renounced  terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist. The legislation, sponsored by  Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), would bar U.S.-PLO  talks unless President Bush certified that participants had no connection to  acts of terror. The measure is reported to also have bipartisan support in the  House.  </P></p>

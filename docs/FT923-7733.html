			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Georgia rebels free minister as fighting flares DISSIDENTS in the former Soviet republic of Georgia freed a government minister and most other hostages yesterday, as troops and police clamped down on their rebellious region, agencies report from Tbilisi. Mr Roman Gventsadze, the interior minister, who was seized on Tuesday along with 11 police officials, returned to Tbilisi by helicopter late last night, looking pale and tired. He said his captors released him because they were afraid of the big force being deployed against them yesterday. The Georgian government based in Tbilisi sent more than 3,000 national guardsmen and more than 400 police to seal off the rebellious Abkhazia region in the west of the republic to prevent the hostages being spirited further away. The hostages were reportedly held in a village 170 miles from Tbilisi. The guardsmen blocked bridges, roads and railways throughout Abkhazia, at times running into resistance. The sharpest flare-up of fighting came as they swept into the Black Sea resort of Sukhumi, the regional capital. National Guard helicopters were reported to have opened fire on Abkhazian forces near the region's parliament building, and rockets destroyed a runway at Sukhumi airport. At least 10 people were killed, according to an Abkhazian official, although other reports spoke of three dead and many wounded. Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia last month, angering hardliners in Georgia's provisional government, which is led by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister The hostage-taking has presented Mr Shevardnadze with his most serious crisis since returning to his native Georgia in March as political leader. Mr Shevardnadze said the 'bandits' were still holding Mr Alexander Kavsadze, a deputy prime minister taken hostage several weeks ago, and two police officials. He said the militants at one stage promised to free all hostages yesterday but changed their minds after talking by phone to Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has taken refuge in Russia. Abkhazian leaders apparently did not organise the hostage-taking or have direct control over the hostages. But the hostage crisis has turned into a larger political dispute. Abkhazia's parliament ordered a general mobilisation of citizens to resist the troops.</p>

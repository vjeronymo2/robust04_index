			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BODY EXHUMED; MAY BE HEIRESS  </P> <P> Investigators removed a body from a pauper's cemetery in the suburb of Willow  Springs today and plan to examine it to determine if it is that of candy  heiress Helen Brach, who disappeared 13 years ago.  </P> <P> The investigators want to run genetic tests on the body of a woman found dead  in the woods near suburban Calumet City in 1978, according to reports in the  Chicago Tribune.  </P> <P> Although Cook County Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein concluded in 1978 that  the body was not Brach's, "We developed additional information, which we felt  significant enough to warrant a re-examination of the body," Jerry Singer, a  spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Monday.  </P> <P> Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, disappeared when she was 65 in  1977 in Rochester, Minn. Her net worth then was estimated at $17 million. Her  estate is now valued at more than $50 million. After she was declared dead in  1984, most of her money went to the Helen Brach Foundation.  </P></p>

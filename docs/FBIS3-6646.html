			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Mar 18 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas, speaking before 23 Portuguese of East Timorese descent  said Indonesia did not need to "annex" another half of Timor  Island in the 1970s because it had an abundance of natural  resources and a vast territory. "We are not an impoverished  country which needs part of another country," Alatas said here  on Friday.    East Timor Province is geographically part of Timor Island,  while another part of it belongs to East Nusa Tenggara Province.    In 1975, East Timorese issued a declaration, the so called  Balibo Declaration to express their desire to integrate with the  Indonesian nation. One year later, East Timor integrated with  Indonesia, making it the country's 27th and youngest province.  "It's impossible for a country which has 17 thousand islands to  look for additional island," he said.    The 23 Portuguese arrived here on Thursday night for a  one-month long visit in the country in what many saw as a family  reunion. Upon their arrival at Sukarno-Hatta Airport, they were  welcomed by Fransisco Xavier Lopez Da Cruz, a respected senior  East Timorese politician and Indonesia's ambassador at large for  East Timor affairs, and a number of activists of the  Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association (PPIP).    According to the plan, they will visit Yogyakarta and  Salatiga, two cities in Central Java where many East Timorese  youths study, on Saturday, afterwards they will proceed their  trip to Denpasar, Kupang, and Dili.    Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the daughter of President Suharto  who chairs the PPIP said the visit was aimed at meeting with  their relatives whom they had separated each other for tens of  years. [sentence as received] She expressed the hope that the  visit would help expedite the solution of East Timor question  through a number of international fora under the auspice of the  United Nations. It was the common people who would suffer the  most if the East Timor question remained unsettled, she said.    The visit is a follow-up to the historic meeting in London  between East Timorese leaders in East Timor and those living in  exile last December.    Lopez said the participants at the London meeting agreed  that  goodwill should be promoted and this visit is a manifestation of  the goal set at the meeting. The one-month long visit was  merely socio-cultural in nature and there was not another motive  behind it, Lopez said.    In the meantime, Alatas also expressed his hope that the 23  Portuguese of East Timorese descent would be free to visit  various places in Indonesia.</p>

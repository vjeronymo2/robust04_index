			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / FO paper sought secrecy on Iraq THE Foreign Office was prepared to approve the export to Iraq of machine tools which were later used to make armaments during the Iran-Iraq war, provided the deal was kept secret, according to a confidential document produced in court yesterday. The document, written by a senior official in the Middle Eastern department, confirmed that the Foreign Office knew that equipment to be exported by Matrix Churchill, the Iraqi-owned machine-tool manufacturer, could be used to make munitions. It advised that the arms embargo would not be broken. The shipment would not prolong the war since the Iraqis would use the tools as a substitute for Soviet supplies - a view disputed by the Ministry of Defence. However, urging secrecy, the document said that if the deliveries became public, they would have to stop. The document was produced during the Old Bailey trial of three former Matrix Churchill directors accused of deceiving the Department of Trade and Industry by pretending the equipment was for civil use. Mr Alan Clark, then a trade minister, also urged Matrix Churchill and other machine-tool makers to keep quiet about deals with Iraq, the court heard. Export licences for some of the company's exports were frozen after intelligence reports suggested they would be used for military purposes. Mr Clark met Mr Paul Henderson, the Matrix Churchill managing director and one of the defendants, and other representatives of the machine-tool industry in early 1988 to discuss the problems of restoring the licences. The licences were approved by ministers soon after. A minute of the meeting, read out in court, said Mr Clark told them press stories about the deals would jeopardise restoring the licences. When someone expressed concern that the Daily Telegraph was showing a close interest, Mr Clark said he would contact Mr Max Hastings, the editor, since he was a personal friend. Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham, a former Matrix Churchill commercial director, and Mr Peter Allen, a former sales director with the company, all deny breaching export regulations. The trial continues today.</p>

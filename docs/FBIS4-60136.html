			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In a commentary on the situation in Yemen, JANA's  Arab Affairs editor said that the collapse of the union in Yemen  was undoubtedly the work of a reactionary and imperialist  conspiracy. It is well known that the reactionary and  imperialist forces, with the blatant hostility they harbor for  Arab unity, have put a veto on the unity of the Arab nation and  any unionist achievement between any two or more Arab countries.  Our contemporary history is full of recent living examples, the  abortion of the union between Egypt and Syria in 1958, embodied  in the Arab united republic. Reactionary and imperialist  schemes were behind the collapse of this union after only three  years of its foundation. These schemes have also aborted the  experience of the Arab-African union between Libya and Morocco;  and there they are today carrying out their scheme against  Yemen's union and is held responsible for the collapse of this  four-year old union.

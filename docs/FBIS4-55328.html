			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] spokesman for the Sector South M. Roberts said that the  peacekeepers have started deployment Thursday [12 May] to take  over full control of the demarcation line between the republic  of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia.    The RSK was declared in 1991 by the Serbs on their ethnic  and  historic lands in the former Republic of Croatia in response to  the latter's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and the  downgrading of the Serbs in Croatia to a national minority.  Since the spring of 1992 RSK has been declared a U.N. Protected  Area (UNPA).    UNPROFOR troops have been sent to locations where some units  of the conflicting sides still remain, Roberts told a regular  press conference. This marks the beginning of the  implementation of the Akashi-Martic agreement reached in talks  held on May 9 in Knin. Under the agreement the remaining troops  of the two sides should fully withdraw by May 20. Speakivg  about Akashi's visit to Knin and his talks with the RSK  leadership there Roberts confirmed that the U.N. special envoy  was satisfied with the results of the talks and that he had the  impression that great progress had been made in the last 15 days  towards the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, reached  on March 30 in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb.    Roberts also pointed to the difficulties in clearing up the  mines on the main communication links, as well as on local  roads, and that it was still unsafe for the population to return  to the villages in Ravni Kotari. People nevertheless come to  inspect their houses and land and some have started clearing up  the debris, he added.    Roberts said that special Canadian units with 35 experts  would be dispatched to speed up the mine-clearing process and  warned that the work could not be accomplished if both sides did  not submit detailed maps of the mine fields. So far only the  North Dalmatian Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army has done this,  Roberts said adding that the maps supplied by the Croatian side  were inaccurate. Since the beginning of the implementation of  the cease-fire agreement the UNPROFOR has set up 69 observation  posts along the 310-km long demarcation line in Sector South. A  Jordanian battalion is now being deployed on Mt Velebit where  observation posts already exist to monitor the cease-fire. The  peacekeeprs are also setting up observation posts on Mts Dinara  and Svilja.</p>

Explaining, on the first subject, that the  government's "firm intention" is to "avoid any increase in the  general social contribution," Mr. Sarkozy said: "Hospitals take  up 49 percent of health insurance spending and have too many  underused beds. We will have to act accordingly."    The budget minister also discussed "social VAT" both as a  possible solution to the problem of funding social security and  as an incentive to job creation. Expressing the view that it  "could be an interesting solution," he nonetheless added: "VAT  is a tax on the consumer. We must be careful not to slow down  the beginning of a return to growth!" Finally, he asked "how  can we be sure that in exchange for this huge reduction in  contributions the majority of enterprises will start hiring."</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Japan closes nuclear chapter Japan's sole nuclear-powered vessel, the Mutsu, was taken out of commission yesterday, closing its 23-year history as an experimental ship, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The end of the controversial Mutsu project symbolises the failure by the Japanese government to reach consensus on nuclear energy within the country. The 8,242 ton Mutsu was launched in 1969. The vessel's maiden voyage, in 1974, was a disaster. Within minutes of the first test, a radiation leak was detected and the voyage was abandoned, amid damning publicity.</p>

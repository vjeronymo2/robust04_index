			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BURROUGHS, INJURED IN GAME, TOLD TO END FOOTBALL CAREER  </P> <P> Derrick Burroughs, a starting cornerback for the Buffalo Bills who was injured  Sept. 24 in a game against Houston, will not play football with the Bills again  after doctors discovered a spinal condition.  </P> <P> Burroughs, who was temporarily paralyzed after colliding with Oiler receiver  Curtis Duncan and teammate Leonard Smith while making a tackle, has been  advised by team physician Dr. Richard Weiss to retire.  </P> <P> Doctors have warned the team that if Burroughs continues to play, he risks  permanent paralysis.  </P> <P> "It's not a result of the sport, but something he brought to the sport," said  Weiss on Wednesday. "With no injury, it would have gone undetected."  </P> <P> Burroughs was discovered to have cervical stenosis, a condition that has ended  the careers of other NFL players, including Houston linebacker Frank Bush,  Green Bay defensive back Tim Lewis and New England linebacker Don Blackmon.  </P> <P> "Derrick has a cervical spine with two small rings, 64% of the size of normal  rings," Weiss said. "When he hyperbends or hyperextends, it pinches the spinal  cord and causes quadriplegia."  </P> <P> Burroughs made it clear that while his career in Buffalo is over, he might play  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "In the off-season, I might decide that I want to try it again with another  team."  </P></p>

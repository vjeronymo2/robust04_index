			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bid for east German rolling-stock group The Royal Begemann group of the Netherlands emerged yesterday as the leading contender to take control of Deutsche Waggonbau, the east German rolling-stock maker owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency. The company said it had reached agreement on the outlines of a deal under which it would take over 74.9 per cent of DW stock, while the balance would remain with the Treuhand for the time being. The Treuhand, taken unawares by the Begemann announcement, stressed that a heads-of-agreement paper, containing details of points subject to further negotiation, would not hinder continuing discussions with other potential investors. However, the Dutch group's statement appeared designed to deter any other would-be investors. Begemann and the Treuhand intended to develop the heads of agreement into a legally-binding deal, it said. A deal, which the bidder expects to be completed this year, would mark the end of a long period of uncertainty for the barely profitable DW, which supplied most of the former Comecon area's railway goods wagons and carriages.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Iran has launched mediation  efforts to end the conflict between the Islamic opposition and  the government in Tajikistan, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas  Maleki [spelling as received] said Saturday.    Iranian officials had already held talks with Tajik  opposition representatives and were due to meet with Tajik  government officials on January 24 or 25, he said.    The initiative followed a request from four Moslem Central  Asian states -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and  Kazakhstan -- for Iran to play a more active role in ending the  conflict, during a visit to the region by Iranian President 'Ali  Akbar Hashemi- Rafsanjani in October.    Maleki said Iran was concerned about the situation and was  determined to use its influence to restore security to  Tajikistan.    The results of the discussions would be conveyed to the four  Central Asian states, Maleki said, and if necessary a summit  meeting would be held.    Pro-communist forces seized power in Dushanbe in December  1992, toppling the ruling coalition of democratic and Islamic  forces.    Uzbek President Islam Karimov has called for direct talks  between the communist-dominated Tajik government and the  opposition, mediated by "influential Moslem states such as Iran,  Pakistan and Afghanistan."    During Rafsanjani's regional tour Kyrgyz President Askar  Akayev also asked Iran to help end the crisis in Tajikistan.    However, Iran has adopted a low profile toward the conflict  to avoid antagonising the former Soviet Central Asian countries,  with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural  ties.    A Russian special envoy, Yevgeniy Primakov, visited Iran in  August for talks with Iranian officials on defusing tension on  the Tajik-Afghan border.    A UN special envoy also visited Iran for talks on the  conflict last August.</p>

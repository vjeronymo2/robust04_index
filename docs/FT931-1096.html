			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Fires in the Mirror - Theatre In August 1991 there were riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. They were not the conventional race riots between black and white, or a black rebellion against the police and white authority, but between local blacks and the Hasidim, a group of Jewish mystics which originated in Poland in the 18th century. Not much was heard of the affair outside New York, and certainly not outside America, because the peak of the riots coincided with the coup in Moscow against Mikhail Gorbachev. But in Brooklyn the incident lingers on. Anna Deavere Smith has written a play about it. Or rather, and this is the problem, it is not a play at all. Fires in the Mirror is a documentary on stage. Others will reach their own conclusion. I enjoyed it because the material is riveting, but I wonder if the stage is the right place for it. Fires is part of a series called On the Road: A Search for American Character. It is a one woman show. Ms Deavere Smith, an actress and writer, did all the research herself. She interviewed those involved in the riots, whether participants, observers or guardians of the peace. And she plays all the parts, black, Jewish, male, female and anyone who fits in, with the occasional use of film in the background. The story that emerges is complex. The riots began with an accident. A seven-year-old black boy was killed by a Hasidic man whose car jumped the kerb. Nearby blacks retaliated and attacked a Hasidic scholar, stabbing him to death. The rioting followed. The accidental nature of the affair is never far from Mrs Deavere Smith's account. On the other hand, the tinder was plainly there in advance. The Hasidim, we learn, make up only about 10 per cent of the neighbourhood, but seem to have an advantaged position compared to the blacks. On the Sabbath and other holy days, the New York City authorities close a number of streets to traffic, much to the inconvenience of the blacks. Other resentments are not far from the surface. Ms Deavere Smith's purpose is not to blame, but to explore. Robert Sherman, of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, is quoted as saying that Eskimos have 70 different words for snow, then adds: 'We probably have 70 different kinds of bias, prejudice, racism and discrimination.' The message of Fires seems optimistic: try and understand. Ms Deavere Smith performs more than 20 roles with great restraint. Some might say that she underacts, but I think that is part of her purpose: not to be overdramatic. I should like to see the show on television. The author is now working on what happened in the Los Angeles riots last year. Royal Court Theatre (071) 730 1745</p>

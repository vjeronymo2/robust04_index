			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (2): Engines for faster economic development - The build-up of Asian power THE reforms sweeping through developing Asia's state-dominated electricity supply industry are expected to spur demand for more western-supplied power equipment well into the next century. The shakeup centres on the restructuring and commercialisation of largely inefficient state utilities and the entry into the electricity supply field of independent power producers to compete with national power companies. Hand-in-hand with this is an accelerated programme to cut electricity tariff subsidies and make such tariffs more commercial. These reforms are being actively promoted by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the various bilateral aid institutions, such as Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund. They stress that growing commercialisation of Asia's power sector will broaden the financial base of those countries most in need and will make it more possible for them to continue to build up their power programmes to fuel economic growth. The ADB recently pointed out that developing Asia's electricity capacity will have to be increased by 300,000 MW in the 1990s if the region is to maintain its economic growth, now running at around six per cent a year. This would mean a doubling of existing capacity for a region comprising 3.1bn people, 58 per cent of the world's population. By comparison, the US has 600,000 MW of capacity, and its population is 240m. Mr James Rockett, the ADB's senior energy specialist, recently said this would require a capital investment of about Dollars 501bn each year, all the more reason for spurring privatisation. The ADB had lent Dollars 9.2bn to the energy sector since 1969, and annual lending to the sector was now so large that this figure would be eclipsed in only a few years at current rates of lending. The share of all Bank funds for the sector last year climbed by 10 percentage points to 36 per cent compared with 1990, Mr Rockett said. World Bank lending last year to the power sector stood at Dollars 992m, and its Asian energy loans this year were surging ahead and should easily surpass last year's. The various reforms imply that private sector growth will come from thermal power stations, which can be put up relatively quickly by independent power companies, depending on size. There will be much thermal power growth under the long-range plans of state utilities as well. Nuclear, particularly in the cash-rich Asian Far East, and hydro-electric capacity, notably in China and India, also will be expanded. But these also are longer-term projects that must run the gamut of regulatory approvals. They are not private-sector friendly. The pro-privatisation legislative changes have been spearheaded by Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, all of which are now pushing open their doors, to varying degrees, to independent power producers. For its part, China in recent years has contracted out to several Hong Kong companies, particularly Hopewell Holdings and New World Development Group, the construction of coal-fired power stations in Guangdong province. Almost without exception, the reforming nations have announced plans to nearly double capacity by the end of the century. The challenge was underlined by India's Energy Minister, Mr Shri Kalp Nath Rai. He told a recent Financial Times electricity conference in Singapore that India needed to add 48,000 MW of capacity (it now has 69,000 MW) in the next five years, but only 31,000 could be afforded out of state funds. 'The rest will have to come from the private sector.' The combination of big aid flows and the new ingredient of privatisation is prompting aggressive sales drives by the world's leading producers of turbines and boilers. The usual modus operandi of such companies as Siemens/Kraftwerk Union of Germany, the European ABB group; the Anglo-French GEC/Alsthom, the American majors Westinghouse Electric and General Electric has been to establish joint ventures with regional companies, such as India's Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (Siemens), for local manufacture of low- to medium-technology turbine equipment. This would ease pressure on foreign exchange. This practice is now about to change, with big equipment suppliers now poised to start taking equity stakes in Asian private power projects. Mr. According to Andreas Kley, group executive manager for Siemens/KWU: 'The trend towards non-utility power plants ..has encouraged our group to augment our traditional role as a builder and now to participate actively as partner and investor in the planning and development of independent power plants.' The emerging consensus is that Asia's growth will focus on gas turbines and combined cycle, largely because of speed of installation and gas's emergence as the most environmentally friendly fuel for power plants. Mr DW Williamson, vice-president, GE Industrial and Power Systems, says the Asia-Pacific region will account for 29 per cent of the world's capacity additions. 'Japan, Korea and Taiwan alone represent nearly 60,000 MW of new orders between now and 1995,' he says. India is also a major market 'where an emerging middle class of nearly 200m people is driving new load growth, which will require 26,000 MW of uncommitted capacity additions over the next decade'. He sees gas turbines and combined cycle as accounting for 45 per cent of global additions, with steam turbine plants holding at 35 per cent, and hydro and nuclear playing a more limited role.

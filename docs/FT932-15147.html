			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Building societies look for security in their funding: The reasons why mortgage lenders are considering a fresh method of raising finance FIVE years ago the concept of repackaging mortgages for sale as securities was anathema to most building societies. Now, many societies are preparing the ground so that they will be ready to securitise their mortgages, if the need arises. The Leeds Permanent building society may go ahead as early as September, and other societies, such as Nationwide and Bristol &amp; West, are making adjustments to their computer and administrative systems to ensure that they can cope with the logistics of securitisation. So what lies behind this change of heart? Not, as in the case of some foreign banks, the need for capital. Securitisation allows financial institutions to remove assets from their balance sheets, reducing the amount of capital they have to hold for regulatory purposes. But the constraints facing building societies have actually diminished in recent years. The real reason for the change is that societies have become increasingly worried about their ability to meet their funding needs through traditional channels when the housing market starts to improve. During the housing boom of the late 1980s, centralised mortgage lenders, such as The Mortgage Corporation, were able to win market share using securitisation as their main method of funding. At present building societies have two main sources of funds, and both appear constrained. The most important is retail deposit accounts, but falling interest rates have prompted a withdrawal of funds. The other mainstay is the wholesale market, where building societies can raise up to 40 per cent of their funding, under Building Societies Commission rules, through bonds and loans. In practice, however, the average limit, dictated by the BSC on an individual basis, is closer to 20 per cent, and many building societies are already approaching their limits. 'Any society in the top 20 that is wholesale-funded up to 25 per cent or more must be looking at the prospect of securitisation out of necessity,' said Mr Simon White, assistant treasurer at the Halifax building society, which has only 15 per cent wholesale funding. Any increase in deposit rates, in order to attract more retail funds, would squeeze building societies' margins - or push up mortgage rates. Securitisation is off-balance sheet financing, which does not count towards the 40 per cent funding rule, and allows building societies to lock in a profit margin. At present there is a differential of about 2 percentage points between Libor (the London interbank offer rate, the main reference for wholesale funding) and the mortgage rate. If building societies were able to finance securitised mortgages at, say,  3/4 of a point above Libor, they would still have locked in a margin of more than a point. Securitisation has other advantages: the maturity of mortgage-backed securities is matched with the life of the mortgage, so that, unlike other types of funding, it does not leave building societies with any exposure when refinancing is necessary. Clearing banks are also looking at securitisation, but only Barclays Bank plans to securitise both mortgages and two to five-year consumer loans this year. It is 'highly likely' that the bank will securitise about Pounds 300m of mortgages this year, according to Mr Brian Worsley, deputy treasurer. Apart from Barclays, which already securitised one batch of mortgages four years ago, building societies are expected to lead the way. But for all its theoretical attractions, some societies such as the Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leicester do not believe that securitisation is commercially viable for them. The start-up costs are extremely high - one Swedish bank is estimated to have spent Dollars 1m on its first issue of mortgage-backed securities. When mortgage-backed financing was first introduced in the US, the result was cheaper housing finance in some areas as the available pool of mortgage funding was spread more evenly. Even the most optimistic observers see little prospect of any benefits to homebuyers here. At best it may provide 'a new source of funding at levels not significantly higher than . . in the wholesale market,' according to Mr Mark Stadler, director in charge of securitisation at Merrill Lynch. All the same, if the long-awaited recovery in house prices finally materialises in the next year or so, at least the building societies will be ready, and able, to lend.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Upton warns of deeper losses at Reject Shop Shares in Upton &amp; Southern Holdings dived 12p to 14p yesterday after the Middlesbrough-based department store group sounded a warning over the trading position of The Reject Shop, its recently acquired furniture and household goods chain. Upton said it had become apparent since the acquisition of the USM-quoted group that the financial and trading position of Reject Shop was materially worse than had been represented at the time of the recommended offers. This had resulted in a cash shortage of about Pounds 2.75m, the directors said, and it was anticipated that losses of Reject Shop for the period to July 31 would now be significantly greater than anticipated. Reject Shop, which had suffered mounting losses in recent years because of the reces-sion, was acquired by Upton in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper deal in March. Upton, which itself has recently undergone a period of reorganisation, had been looking at Reject Shop since July last year. The directors believed that the business had lost its way by trying to move upmarket. Following its acquisition, Upton planned to reduce prices and rationalise the product range with the intention of making Reject Shop its core business. Reject Shop incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.39m on turnover of Pounds 10.3m in the 28 weeks to October 3 1993, while Upton - which has changed its year end to July 31, in line with that of Reject Shop - reported losses of Pounds 321,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.67m in the year to end-January 1994. Despite yesterday's announcement, Upton said the group continued to operate within existing banking facilities, and retained the support of its banks. Reject Shop was beginning to see an upturn in sales as the steps taken by the new management began to have effect, the directors said. However, in order to meet cash flow requirements and to provide working capital for the development of Reject Shop, Upton was actively seeking additional equity funding, they added. They were also investigating the possibility of instituting proceedings against certain former directors of Reject Shop, and a further announcement would be made as soon as possible.</p>

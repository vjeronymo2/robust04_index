			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli  Rivas, the election of a new Colombian president will not change  relations between Venezuela and Colombia.    Burelli has said Venezuela is quite pleased with the results  of the Colombian election in which Liberal Party candidate  Ernesto Samper was elected president.    The foreign minister said the fact that the marine and  submarine area delimitation issue in the Gulf of Venezuela had  not been discussed as part of the election campaign is a very  encouraging sign for bilateral relations.    The new Colombian president, Ernesto Samper, will take  office  on 7 August.</p>

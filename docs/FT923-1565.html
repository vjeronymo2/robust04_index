			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Police fire on Columbus rally POLICE in the Dominican Republic opened fire on a rally to protest at government plans to mark the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the country 500 years ago, writes Canute James in Kingston. One person was killed and several injured in the incident on Sunday. Demonstrators oppose the amount of money the government is spending on the event. The violence and plans for further protest will raise doubts about the Pope's visit to the republic next month. He had been invited to mark the anniversary. Besides the cost, there is growing opinion in the country that planned events do not attempt to portray the social and economic consequences of Columbus's arrival.</p>

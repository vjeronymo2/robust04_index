			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5054 of OBRA 90 amended section 402(a)(16) of the Social Security Act to require that each State agency report, to an appropriate agency or official, known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect of a child receiving AFDC. A conforming change was made to section 402(a)(9) to allow the release of information to appropriate individuals. The amendment includes as ``instances'' of abuse and neglect situations where a child experiences physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment or maltreatment under circumstances which indicate that the child's health or welfare is threatened. To implement these statutory changes we have amended &sect;233.90(a)(2) and revised &sect;205.50(a)(1) by adding a new paragraph (G).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Disclosure of Information About AFDC Applicants and Recipients for Purposes Directly Connected With Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Programs (Section 205.50 of the Final Rule)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the enactment of OBRA 90, the use or disclosure of information concerning AFDC applicants and recipients was restricted by section 402(a)(9) of the Social Security Act. Information on AFDC recipients and applicants could only be used for purposes directly connected with: (1) The administration of the AFDC program or several other specified Social Security Act programs; (2) any investigation, prosecution, or criminal or civil proceeding conducted in connection with such programs; (3) the administration of any other Federal or Federally-assisted program providing assistance or services to individuals on the basis of need; and (4) any audit of such programs (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 1990) p. 913).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section of the Social Security Act did not contain a specific reference to title IV&hyph;E, which covers the foster care and adoption assistance programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5055 of OBRA 90 amended section 402(a)(9)(A) of the Social Security Act by adding an explicit reference to title IV&hyph;E in the list of programs for which information about AFDC applicants and recipients may be made available. We have amended &sect;205.50(a)(1)(i)(A) to reflect this statutory change. In addition, the reference to title IV&hyph;C was deleted from 45 CFR 205.50(a)(1)(A), since the WIN program is no longer operative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received; therefore, these rules reflect no changes from the provisions previously published in the interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that these rules are consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final rules do not require any information collection activities and, therefore no approval is necessary under section 3504 (h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these final rules is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they effect benefits to individuals and payments to States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

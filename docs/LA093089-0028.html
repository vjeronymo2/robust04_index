			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALEMANY RIDDLES PALMDALE, 35-15  </P> <P> The Palmdale High defense -- what defense? -- was reminiscent Friday night of  the stunt man in the beer commercial who gets shot up in the saloon.  </P> <P> It was full of holes and sprang touchdown-size leaks all night.  </P> <P> Alemany quarterback Joey Rosselli was the gunfighter with the smoking pistol as  he threw for 338 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Indians to a 35-15  victory in a nonleague game at Alemany.  </P> <P> Rosselli, who completed 18 of 27 passes and threw one interception, lofted a  pair of 69-yard touchdown tosses (to Terry Barnum and Greg Benitez) in the  second half as Alemany expanded on its 14-3 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "Rosselli is a hell of a quarterback. He put the ball in there all night,"  Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn said.  </P> <P> The senior quarterback's heroics bailed out the Indians (2-2), who were limited  to 31 yards rushing by Palmdale (0-4), a Division II semifinalist last season.  </P> <P> Rosselli threw first-half touchdown passes of 13 and 12 yards to Mark  Dannemiller and Benitez.  </P> <P> Dannemiller also returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown in the third  period as Alemany took a 28-3 lead after three quarters.  </P> <P> Benitez had four catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Both teams were penalized for more than 100 yards -- Alemany 13 times for 122  yards and Palmdale 10 times for 108 yards.  </P> <P> Palmdale turned the ball over five times. Quarterback Joe Pica threw two  interceptions and completed 12 of 34 passes for 196 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Rosselli completed his first eight passes and finished 11 of 13 for 124 yards  and two touchdowns in the first half.  </P> <P> Tom Leite's 23-yard field goal gave Palmdale a 3-0 lead late in the first  quarter, but Rosselli responded by leading Alemany on a 74-yard drive that was  capped by a 13-yard touchdown pass to Dannemiller as the Indians took the lead  for good.  </P></p>

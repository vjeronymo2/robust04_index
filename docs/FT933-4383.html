			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Government clash over hazardous waste THE government is heading for another clash over European environment policy after it yesterday defended its methods of disposing of hazardous waste, Bronwen Maddox writes. If Britain loses its battle over the form of a proposed European Commission directive, it might have to incinerate waste now disposed of in landfills or rubbish dumps, adding significantly to costs. It argued that the practice of mixing industrial and household waste on the same site - co-disposal - is safe. Co-disposal is used for 70 per cent of 'difficult' industrial waste - 2.8m tonnes a year.</p>

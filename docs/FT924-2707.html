			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Bombs injure 10 people at N London shopping centre TEN PEOPLE were injured yesterday by two bombs that exploded in a north London shopping centre. The small devices went off at Wood Green Shopping City at 9.30am and 9.35am as police and shop staff were evacuating the area. They were planted in rubbish bins, 50 yards apart, outside branches of Argos and WH Smith. Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said: 'I have no doubt this is the latest in the mainland campaign by the IRA.' The attack followed an explosion on Wednesday night in a car parked near the Woodside Park Underground station, also in north London. No one was injured. Mr John Major, the prime minister, commenting yesterday on the explosions, said: 'It is vitally important that people remain vigilant in the period up to Christmas.' Mr Major, who was speaking in Edinburgh on his arrival for the EC summit, said a great deal had been done to improve security across the UK. The Wood Green blasts, which caused limited damage to shops, were preceded by warning calls that the police described as a deliberately misleading trap for officers clearing the area. Scotland Yard said that three warning calls were made at 9.15am, 9.16am and 9.18am. The first call, using an IRA code word, was made to a news agency and said the bomb would explode in 20 minutes. The injured, four police officers and six members of the public, were taken to North Middlesex Hospital suffering from shock and cuts. The Association of London Authorities last night called on the home secretary to meet the costs of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations. Mr Derek Sawyer, association policing spokesman, said London taxpayers should not have to meet the full cost of tackling the IRA's latest campaign. Mr Sawyer said: 'It is important that the Home Office recognises the amount of extra police time and resources which the spate of terrorist incidents requires and provides the Met with extra money to cope with these extra responsibilities.' He said a meeting with police had disclosed that the police overtime budget was expected to rise by more than 7 per cent next year, after having fallen for several years.</p>

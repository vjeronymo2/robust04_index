			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council, </F> at the swearing-in ceremony for new President Liamine Zeroual in  Algiers--live]    [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Liamine Zeroual has now been sworn  in according to Articles 72 and 73 of the Constitution, as well  as to Article 8 of the national dialogue document [as heard].  Right now, Mr. Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council,  whose official functions have just ended after President Liamine  Zeroual's swearing in, is going to the platform, and it seems  that he is getting ready to make a speech. He is now asking the  guests, who have been standing up during the swearing in, to sit  down.    [Ali Kafi] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [Koranic verse] Dear brothers, we meet on this  historic day in the march of modern Algeria. This is the first  time in Algeria, and perhaps in many countries, where  alternation of political power is taking place in a civilized  way, which honors the Algerian citizen and puts him in the  position he deserves.    Brothers, the Higher State Council, true to its pledge,  hands  power over satisfactorily and on time to its replacement. The  Higher State Council, as you know, took office in difficult  conditions and stopped the danger.    Today we have to give hope to the Algerian people who  suffered during these last years. These people have been crying  silently and patiently.    We all must bring smiles and joy back in order to save our  nation and people, who have waited for this occasion for so  long. Therefore, we must not waste time in restoring smiles to  lips and in traveling the road to construction where the  aspirations of this nation, these people, and the growing  generations will be reflected.    Brothers, I am not standing before you today to deliver a  long speech, but I stand here to end my task as chairman of the  Higher State Council and the task of the members of the Higher  State Council, and to hand over this trust to one of the sons of  deep-rooted, revolutionary Algeria, one of the sons of the 1  November Revolution; I mean brother Liamine Zeroual [applause],  who takes this heavy task upon his shoulder. The members of the  Higher State Council and I wish the brother President Liamine  Zeroual well in discharging this task, but we do not say to him  what the Israelites said to Moses, peace be upon him: You and  your God go and fight; we are staying right here [Koranic verse].    In fact we say to him: Proceed with God's blessings; we are  all recruited and mobilized for the sake of making the country  successful and taking it out of this tribulation. [applause] I  wish, through this gathering and this honorable ceremony, to  praise and thank the authentic Algerian people for being patient  and steadfast in the face of these shake-ups which from time to  time placed us in a critical position. I hope that we will come  out of these shake-ups because we are all rational and because  of our love for our homeland. I would also like to thank all of  the cadres and all who cooperated with us in order to arrive at  this great event. May Almighty God render us all successful and  may God give President Liamine Zeroual success in this task.  Thank you. [applause]</p>

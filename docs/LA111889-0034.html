			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FOLK BALLET OF YUGOSLAVIA AT UC IRVINE  </P> <P> If all had gone as planned, the Doina Romanian Folk Ballet would have danced  Thursday at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine. But that company was not  permitted by the Romanian government to leave its homeland, according to Bren  Center officials. So the National Folk Ballet of Yugoslavia was booked in its  place.  </P> <P> No need to apologize.  </P> <P> The Yugoslavs brought an engaging, varied program that ranged from lighthearted  social vignettes to works of genuine mythic depth and power, and they danced it  with freshness, sweetness, eagerness and skill.  </P> <P> Branko Markovich, principal choreographer for the company, crafted a clever  piece to introduce his brilliantly costumed company, and to assert -- according  to the printed program -- the "unity and fraternity of all the Yugoslavian  people."  </P> <P> It also previewed, among its fluidly forming and dissolving circular patterns,  many of the signature motifs to be seen later in individual regional dances.  </P> <P> Here were the upraised, goal-post arms in the Montenegrin dance; the women and  men twirling together in the Dalmatian "Linjo"; the quick gliding, toe-slapping  steps in the dances from Posavina; the high-held bent-leg kick that recurred  frequently.  </P> <P> But in addition to the social and recreational pieces, two works stood out for  historic resonance.  </P> <P> One was the noble, heroic Montenegrin dance, in which the men thrust their arms  in battle poses (to "Sacre"-like rhythms) or practiced knife fights while the  women applauded encouragingly, hands above their heads.  </P> <P> But the real knock-out was a line dance for men from Macedonia. Here, the  dancers revealed a dignity, seriousness, weight and power that showed us that  folk traditions remain viable not because they entertain tourists, foreigners  or even a country's own people, but because they connect to deep needs and  memories that transcend individual cultures.  </P> <P> Throughout, the dancers were accompanied by a nine-member band that played with  virtuosity and appealing gentleness.  </P> <P> Additionally, Slavko Antovich proved a powerhouse drummer, threading himself  among the dancers. Tanya Obrenovich was the throaty soloist in Gypsy songs.  </P> <P> The company will appear tonight at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. CHRIS  PASLES  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley lifts income by 18% in second quarter MORGAN STANLEY, the New York investment bank, yesterday reported an 18 per cent rise in second-quarter income as it joined other Wall Street houses in profiting from the continuing boom in new securities issuance. Its results fell short of analysts' average expectations but the shares closed up Dollars  1/4 on Wall Street at Dollars 49 7/8 . The company reported income of Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.36 a share, against Dollars 100.9m or Dollars 1.26 in the same period last year. Wall Street forecasts had been pitched around Dollars 1.47 a share. Net revenues - gross revenues minus interest expense - rose to Dollars 764.1m, from Dollars 669.1m. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, president, said the firm had continued to perform well throughout the quarter, 'reflecting the company's global positioning and a strong market for our underwriting services'. Investment banking revenues rose from Dollars 190.5m to Dollars 284.2m. Secondary revenues - combined trading revenues, commissions and net interest  -had declined, 'reflecting fixed income and commodities results below 1991's high levels, which were partly offset by increased foreign exchange revenues'. Principal trading - trading on the company's own account - produced revenues of Dollars 204.3m, down from Dollars 323.6m, but the company booked Dollars 20.6m in revenue from investments, compared to nil a year ago. Commissions rose from Dollars 55.6m to Dollars 77.4m, while asset management and administration revenues were up from Dollars 37.7m to Dollars 53m. Six-month income totalled Dollars 258.1m, or Dollars 2.98 a share, against Dollars 221m or Dollars 2.80 in the first half of 1991.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Summary] Prior to the Spring Festival soybean prices  remained stable at 1700 yuan per ton, but prices are expected to  increase. Compared to last year export prices have increased  250 yuan per ton because the state procurement price increased  more than 10 fen, and domestic and international demand has  increased. The forward price for April and May is 2300 yuan per  ton. Because demand for red bean exports has increased, and  output has declined in some areas due to natural disasters, the  price has risen to 5400-5600 yuan per ton. The price of mung  beans has remained stable, at present it is 2800 yuan per ton.</p>

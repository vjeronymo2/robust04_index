On 11 February a group of  people tried to enter the U.S. offices and incidents developed.    According to eyewitnesses, an unknown number of Cubans tried  to enter the U.S. Interests Section offices in Havana and this  resulted in the arrest of approximately 10 persons. The  eyewitnesses reported that no one entered the U.S. offices and  added that some people were injured in the attempt.    DPA reporters visited the site of the incident located on  Havana's Caribbean seashore drive [Malecon], and saw that police  surveillance had been heightened in the area. However, the  situation is one of complete calm.    Members of the Cuban National Police are asking the people  who have to pass through the area to do so quickly. They are  also asking drivers not to park their vehicles in the area.  Traffic is normal.    Persistent rumors spread in Havana on 10 February. The  people were told that the U.S. Interests Section would approve  visas for all Cuban citizens who requested them. A U.S.  Interests Section spokesperson told DPA that these rumors are  "totally and absolutely false" and that no Cuban citizen had  entered the U.S. offices.</p>

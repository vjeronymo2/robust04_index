			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 17 (AFP) -- French General Jean Cot,  recalled as commander of UN forces in ex-Yugoslavia after  outspoken calls for NATO airstrikes in Bosnia, was lauded and  decorated here Thursday [17 March] by Defence Minister Francois  Leotard.    Leotard presented a visibly moved Cot with the Medal for  Military Valour and praised the general's "pugnacity and  determination."    Cot, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] commander for eight  months, left office Tuesday -- four months early -- after being  effectively sacked by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  for surpassing his mandate.    The move followed a string of virulent attacks by Cot on UN  decision-making, including demands late 1993 and early 1994 for  the right to launch air strikes in Bosnia.    Cot also denounced the "humiliations" suffered by UN troops  prevented by UN rules from properly defending themselves.    France over the weekend criticised UN indecision over  launching reprisals after a series of attacks on French UN  troops by Bosnian Serb forces in the northwestern Bihac area.    Asked Thursday about his future, Cot said he intended to  "take a month off."    Observers noted that at his level -- a five star general --  there were few opportunities for advancement in the French Army.    If he were to follow the example of General Philippe  Morillon, the former commander of UN troops in Bosnia, Cot could  become a government adviser, or could ask for early retirement,  18 months ahead of the scheduled date.</p>

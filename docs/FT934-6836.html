			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: Troubled waters Hard to know whether Bob Thian's abrupt ousting from North West Water says more about Thian himself or about the company's newish chairman Sir Desmond Pitcher. Both have pretty inflated opinions of themselves. Thian, who joined at the beginning of 1990, prides himself on his international outlook, and, having spent most of his working life abroad, despises little Englanderism. Sir Desmond, angling for the job of Mr North West (region, as well as water) in his third age, recently observed that he was 'a natural' for the chair of the region's largest company. Littlewoods staff remember him fondly as both a grandee and a bit of a meddler. The company denies any personal spats, claiming that as it 'matures' it needs someone with a less centralised, tight-reined approach. Let's hope the maturation process will include keeping the next chief executive a bit longer.</p>

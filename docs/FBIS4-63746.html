			<p>BFN     [Text] The removal of export quotas and licences so as to  help readjust prices and duties on crude oil and oil products is  to the benefit of oil producers, President of the Rosneft state  company Aleksandr Putilov told INTERFAX.    He said Yeltsin's decree was prepared along with a  government  resolution to halve export duties from 30 to 15 ecus (or 5 to  2.5 dollars per barrel) per one tonne of crude. Duties on oil  products must also be halved, Putilov said.    "If implemented, the resolution will help producers secure a  more acceptable level of export prices and increase their  foreign exchange revenues," he stressed.    Oil and gas experts say that the producers are keen to  increase their share of oil exports to countries other than the  republics of the former Soviet Union. Russia sells crude oil to  other CIS states at a price of 65-70 dollars a tonne compared  with the world's price of 110 dollars.    Rosneft experts believe that some of the losses that the  producers will have to sustain from taxes on the exports of 25  million tonnes of crude on government orders can be offset by  benefits arising from fixed duties and higher exports to the  West.</p>

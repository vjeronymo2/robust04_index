			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI surges The release of the pathfinder prospectus for the demerger of ICI's bioscience business Zeneca coincided with a jump in the share price. The rise of 41 to 1236p on healthy turnover of 4.4m shares was, however, inspired by US buying rather than new information. US brokerage houses PaineWebber and Goldman Sachs were both bidding aggressively for stock. UK analysts said they had discovered no new causes for optimism in the prospectus and many argued that by the close ICI shares were at best very fairly valued. In fact the performance was a sign of things to come, being more driven by reconsideration of the pharmaceuticals sector than corporate fundamentals. The reconsideration was prompted by an easing of fears over US drug price reforms. There were reports that Ms Donna Shalala, new US secretary of health and human services, had reacted favourably to a proposal by Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group, that prices should be held to within one percentage point of inflation. This compared to some estimates of 30 per cent price cuts and helped stocks pick up across the board. Glaxo moved ahead 19 to 599p, Wellcome added 30 at 764p and SmithKline Beecham gained 24 to 468p in the 'A's. The combined rises accounted for around 9.3 points of the gain in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday.</p>

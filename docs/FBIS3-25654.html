Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo confirmed one man had been  arrested and two were being questioned in connection with  Saturday morning's attack on a group preparing for a voter  education workshop.    One was due to appear in Ixopo Magistrate's Court on  Thursday  afternoon, police said.    In a statement, the IFP condemned "the arrest of three  prominent IFP leaders", describing the police action as a  "transparent attempt to placate the African National Congress  leadership". The arrests were a "cynical political ploy by the  South African Police's [SAP] Gen Johan Meintjies (Natal's CID  [Criminal Investigation Division] chief) to appease the ANC and  take the pressure off the SAP".    "This token action by the SAP not only poses a grave threat  to the IFP in the region but also has important political  implications given other actions by the SAP in this area against  the IFP and its leadership," it said.    The three leaders had repeatedly been harassed by an SAP  unit  based in Port Shepstone, the IFP claimed.    "The IFP calls for the release or charging of its leaders  and  the immediate replacement of the head of the investigation team  responsible for this absurd action."    ANC Midlands Secretary Sifiso Nkabinde said he was pleased  with the arrests: "The whole world is now going to see who is  behind these massacres."    Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the matter now lay  with  the court.</p>

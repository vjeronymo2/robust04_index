			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In Shabwah Governorate, our  Armed Forces have continued, with the effective and decisive  support of our Air Force, their determined battle against the  hostile forces on whom they have inflicted strong blows. The  masses effectively support the Armed Forces in that brave  governorate which Sanaa claims to control. It is completely  ridiculous for the al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa to claim that it shot  down one of our fighter planes in Shabwah, just as it claimed  yesterday that it downed a plane in Abyan. Perhaps tomorrow, it  will claim it has shot down another plane in Hadramawt or  al-Mahrah.    This is in keeping with its particular misleading style of  lies and deception. Our brave Armed Forces, which are engaged  in ferocious defensive battles for the 27th successive day  against the al-Ahmar forces which planned to seize the southern  and eastern governorates within a few hours or in a day or two  at the most, are still quite capable today. The defense forces  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, with their unbending  strength, have the capacity to cleanse our pure territory from  the filth of the al-Ahmar family and their clique and to teach  this gang of warfare, terrorism, and criminality a deserving  lesson. Many a small group has overwhelmed a bigger one  [Koran], with God's will.</p>

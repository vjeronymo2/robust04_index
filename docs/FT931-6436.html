			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Second economy minister quits Franco team BRAZILIAN economic policy was thrown into further confusion yesterday with the resignation of Mr Paulo Haddad, the second economy minister in three months to quit the government of President Itamar Franco. Mr Haddad resigned after the president refused to grant him more time to present an economic stabilisation plan and publicly criticised him for failing to reduce spiralling inflation. Mr Gustavo Loyola, the governor of the central bank, also resigned yesterday, along with the bank's entire directorate. Within hours Mr Franco named Mr Eliseu Rezende, head of the state-owned electricity company Eletobras, as the new economy minister. Although not an economist, Mr Rezende has a long history of public-sector experience. Mr Haddad's decision heightened fears that the government would resort to a shock economic plan, including a price freeze, in an attempt to bring down inflation from current levels of 30 per cent a month. But a presidential spokesman denied any economic shock plan was being considered. Mr Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman and former planning minister, predicted an immediate rise in inflation. 'I think Itamar wants the best for the country but just doesn't understand the significance of his actions,' he said. He added: 'How can anyone take us seriously when we are now on our eighth economy minister since the start of civilian government in 1985? Instead of the peace and caution we need, we are changing ministers quicker than the movement of lovers through a motel.' The news hit Brazil's financial markets as the country returned to work after week-long carnival celebrations. The main Sao Paulo bourse dropped 6 per cent, before recovering to 4.6 per cent down after Mr Rezende's nomination. Mr Rezende, an engineer, was minister of transport during the military regime of 1979-85. A friend of Mr Franco, he is from the president's home state of Minas Gerais. He described himself yesterday as 'a soldier of Itamar'. Given Mr Franco's past interference in economic matters and his preference for policies such as price freezes, Mr Rezende is expected to have considerable difficulty attracting good economists to his team. Mr Haddad said he had resigned not because of his failure to reduce inflation but as a protest against political interference in the central bank. Mr Franco wants to leave the nomination of central bank directors up to Congress. Mr Haddad's resignation coincided with the arrival in Braslia of a team from the International Monetary Fund to assess the economy prior to negotiations on a new accord, necessary for the closure of a deal with foreign creditors to restructure Brazil's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 30.9bn) commercial debt. The team is now expected to fly back to Washington.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: Chamber music in the north - Kuhmo Festival / . . . the far north, that is. A new hall in the Arctic Circle with many visitors from distant places - is now hearing the last of its 24th Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival. There the cellist Seppo Kimanen founded it in 1970; his keen instinct for programming and for tempting the right artists to come has ensured that this super-abundant festival has gone from strength to strength. For lovers of chamber music, to visit the Kuhmo festival is to court instant addiction. This year's festival, however, has been marked by a glorious transformation. Until now, concerts have always been held in the gymnasium of the local school, in Kuhmo Church and in other less gracious places. Kuhmo town is after all barely more than a glorified crossroads, amid unspoiled Northern lakes. The new municipal library was its first seriously modern building; the Arts Centre, newer still - finished just days before the current festival began - is a specifically Finnish triumph, a modest marvel of practical design. Canny finagling by Kimanen must have been crucial. Though every Finnish town with a population of at least 20,000 is entitled to a nationally funded music-school (yes]), Kuhmo town has only 13,000-plus. Its case surely rested upon the ever-growing festival, a vision of what an Arts Centre might bring to the town and region, and a plan of intensive music-teaching for the wider Kuhmo area. A part of the centre will be the quarters of the new music-school; and if the main concert hall seats fewer than 700 people (albeit in roomy comfort), it boasts a stage large enough to accommodate a full orchestra, or any big local show. It is beautiful. The external silhouette - music-school, auditorium with sloping roof, the backstage extension - is unshowily elegant, not grandiose. Inside, the foyer is coolly airy and lofty (clean lines, dovetailed stone and wood), with a luminous view of the Lammasjarvi lake, pines and silvery willows beyond its great glass wall. The Lentua concert hall, however, is all of blond Kainuu pinewood - the stage, the house, the seats - and it glows, in moulded curves and walls of vertical strips. The ceiling is ornamented with what look like up-ended, dozen-legged stools (a deliberately homely touch), and with starry clusters of tiny lights hung in the pattern of the Great Bear. The acoustic is warm, lively, intimate and lucid, flatter=strings and voices: nothing is ever so good as wood. Altogether, this must be one of the friendliest and most successful concert halls in Europe. There is a smaller Pajakka hall too, and a dance studio. (Architect, Matti Heikkinen; acoustician Alpo Halme.) It remains to be seen whether the town can really make sufficient use of it, outside the two-week Music Festival. I fancy, though, that in two or three years Kuhmo will wonder how it ever managed without it. This a slight humidity problem still: from time to time a concert would be punctuated by a dry, woody crack] - but we were assured that nothing will fall down. That was particularly noticeable in the new Icelandic music (expounded by native devotees), for much of it kept falling into long, mortified silences: one had always supposed that life in Iceland would be like that. The newer the music, the more 'intuitive' and formally exiguous it seemed, with an air of introspective melancholy. I was most taken with the revolving patterns and folk-dance rhythms of Karolina Eiriksdottir's mixed-quartet Renku. Among rediscoveries, the Petersen Quartet from Berlin brought a delectably witty Five Movements by Erwin Schulhoff, a Czech Jew who died in a concentration camp. A string quartet by the Swedish composer Laura Valborg Aulin (1860-1928) was gracefully appealing; but an A minor piano quintet - same instruments as Schubert's 'Trout' - by the Parisian Louise Farrenc (1804-75) made a great impression. Well-crafted and finely sonorous, with a hyper-active piano part, it belongs to a very substantial oeuvre: I hope that someone may even now be copying out the parts for one of her three unpublished symphonies. Musical feminists have a composer worth championing here. Last year the festival added an 'International Forum of Young Violinists' to its menu, and the 20-year-old Armenian Nikolai Madoyan reappeared now to display a truly sensational technique (he and Maxim Vengerov had the same teacher). This year it was the turn of young pianists. I missed a much-praised recital by 15-year-old Albert Kim, but heard two astonishing 12-year-olds. From Kazakhstan came Dasha Rabotkina to play a recital including Schumann's Faschingsschwank and several of her own compositions with unwinking musicianship and aplomb. As for little Jonathan Gilad from Marseilles, his calm maturity in Mozart and Schubert was uncanny, and the breadth and power of his Brahms - the 'Handel' Variations &amp; Fugue, no less - scarcely credible. There must be a prodigious career in the offing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Over the last few years Ukraine  has unilaterally "privatized" buildings, structures, engineering  equipment, property, and ammunition belonging to the Black Sea  Fleet worth some 94 billion rubles at today's prices. This was  stated today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at a news  conference in Sevastopol when the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the  problems of the Black Sea Fleet ended.    According to the Russian minister, besides 126 ships and  vessels of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  has seized 38 moorings with a total length of 3,457 meters,  which is 10 percent of the entire mooring front of the Black Sea  Fleet.    Besides this, Ukraine's military department has seized 2,245  buildings and structures belonging to the Black Sea Fleet. All  this, stated Pavel Grachev, should be taken into account during  the forthcoming dividing up of not only the vessels, but also  the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

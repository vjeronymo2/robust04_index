			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] The official reply of PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat to the agreements made in Cairo last week were faxed to  Israel in a two-page letter from Nabil Sha'th -- chairman of the  Palestinian delegation for the committee on the implementation  of the Gaza- and Jericho-First agreement -- to Sha'th's Israeli  counterpart Major General Amnon Shahaq.    In the letter, Sha'th details Chairman 'Arafat's remarks  regarding the border crossings and the territory of Jericho  which were discussed in the Cairo meetings. At the conclusion  of the letter, Sha'th asks Shahaq to meet him on 3 January in  Taba to continue negotiations on other matters.    On the morning of 30 December, Sha'th sent a fax to  Jerusalem  in which he detailed the understandings made at the meetings of  the Liaison Committee in Norway, France, and Egypt. The  formulations were edited, but contained no substantive changes.  In his second fax, sent in the evening of 30 December, Sha'th  rejected the agreements described in the first fax, on 'Arafat's  behalf. [passage omitted]    The PLO chairman demands that when Palestinian residents of  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region go through the border  crossings, they are to be inspected at the Palestinian counter,  and not even see Israeli officers and policemen when they enter  the self-government district. He is willing to accept that  residents of the West Bank, outside the Jericho region, undergo  an Israeli inspection as well. [passage omitted]    'Arafat demands that a multinational force be present at the  border crossings, and that a Palestinian policeman with a  Palestinian flag be placed on the Jordan River bridges.  [passage omitted]    In his reply, 'Arafat rejects the agreement regarding the  size of the Jericho district, according to which the  Palestinians will assume control over the Musa 'Alami farm, east  of Jericho, the village of al-'Awja', and the Qarantal monastery  -- a total of 55 square km. The Cairo agreement stipulates that  the self-government will be given management rights over  religious affairs at the al-Nabi Musa site and the right of  pilgrimage under a Palestinian flag to the Muratas site of  Jesus' baptism. The Cairo agreements also spoke of the  establishment of joint projects on the Dead Sea shores.    'Arafat demands that all the places mentioned in the Cairo  draft be subject to full "administrative control" of the  Palestinian authority: al-Nabi Musa, the baptism site, and an  area on the north western shores of the Dead Sea. 'Arafat also  wants to connect the Jordan crossings to Jericho with routes  that will have a special status.    In his letter, Sha'th refers to "crossings," and not just to  the Allenby Bridge. Israeli sources have said that the PLO  wants similar status on the Damiya Bridge and, in the future, on  the 'Abdallah Bridge, the reconstruction and reopening of which  is currently being discussed.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by "old.": "Medium-Sized Industry Waiting </F> for Debt Agreement With Russia"]    [Text] Berlin -- The Committee for Trade With the East of  German business and industry intends to bring about, as soon as  possible, a financial arrangement for German companies whose  deliveries to Russia are not covered by Hermes [credit insurance  company] export guarantees of the Federal Government. This is  what Karl-Hermann Fink, the manager of the committee, said at a  conference on financial and advisory assistance for East Europe.    According to Fink, 400 firms are involved with unsecured  claims totaling 700 million German marks [DM]. Roughly half of  them are medium-sized companies, for which a satisfactory  arrangement with Russia is of existential importance. Fink  admitted, however, that the negotiations with Russia, which will  be resumed no later than the middle of next month, are  difficult. In some cases, the Russians suggested separate  options and wanted to make down payments to the German companies  concerned. However, this was not desirable from the German  point of view. Fink said a comprehensive option had to be found.    According to Otto Wolff von Amerongen, chairman of the  Committee for Trade with the East, above all realistic financial  concepts for trade with the East European states had to be  developed. "Otherwise, we will have a bottomless pit,"  Amerongen said. Basically, the task was also to finance  projects through close cooperation between banks and industry,  he said. In addition, barter deals would serve as complementary  instruments.    Approximately 200 industry and policy representatives took  part in the conference, which was sponsored by Berlin Governing  Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. The participants primarily discussed  the question of to what extent the activities of the private  sector could be connected more closely with public financial aid  for the reconstruction of East Europe.    According to Board Chairman Manfred Gentz of Daimler-Benz  InterServices (Debis) AG, Berlin, there are still fractional  losses between private banks and the banks of the European  Community. In addition, bureaucratic obstacles in the East  European countries have to be eliminated, he said.    According to Gentz, the opening of Western markets is one of  the most important conditions for a successful transformation of  the system in Central and East Europe. "The West must  contribute its share to create, over the long term, the  desirable political, economic, and social conditions," said  Gentz, who is also chairman of the working group dealing with  "general financing and consultation problems as well as problems  concerning contracts" in the Committee for Trade With the East.  German industry and the Committee for Trade With the East  advocate in particular the association of Central and East  Europe with the European Union.    For the German national economy, the East European neighbors  already play an important role today. For all the problems,  their weight will increase, said Gentz. With DM43 billion, more  than 7 percent of German exports went to the East European  region in 1993, while almost 7 percent of German imports also  came from East Europe, accounting for DM36 million.    The most important trading partner is Russia, closely  followed by Poland. German exports to Poland alone accounted  for DM9.7 billion last year; they were thus higher than exports  to China, the Asian country which is marked by an "economic  miracle." Last year, 10 percent of the overall German direct  investment was made in East Europe -- compared with just 1  percent in 1990. East Europe was the only region in the world  where new German investment increased in recent years. An  important motor in this respect was opening up of market and  utilizing the considerable wage and production cost advantages.    According to Gentz, tying in the young market economies and  utilizing their wage cost advantages will also increase German  competitiveness. "Our response to NAFTA and ASEAN could be  close cooperation with East Europe," said Gentz.    In the scope of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit, the  Committee for Trade With the East organized a meeting between  the Russian leadership and German business and industry  representatives in which the strategic modernization of the  Russian national economy was discussed. Some pilot projects  were suggested. Specifically, the projects include the  modernization of conventional power plants and the more  effective utilization of Siberian natural gas resources.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> 25TH ANNIVERSARY LOGO PRIZE AWARDED  </P> <P> A graphic design professor at Golden West College has won a $2,500 contest for  designing a logo for the school's 25th anniversary, which will be celebrated  beginning next September.  </P> <P> The professor, Jack Heard, is also director of the campus Fine Arts Gallery.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that I won," said Heard. "I expected a lot of pros to be working  on this. I'm not into contests that much. I'm used to working on logos with a  client where there is a lot of give and take. A contest is a one-shot deal."  </P> <P> Heard's winning design, picked by a panel of judges as the best among 80  entries, shows a sleek numeral 25 in semicircles and stripes.  </P> <P> According to Fay L. Hendry, the campus public relations director, the $2,500  contest award comes from private funds and not taxpayer dollars.  </P> <P> One of the judges, Frank Hopkins, owner of an advertising agency in Fountain  Valley, said: "This (winning entry) is one of the most original designs I have  seen for combining a 2 and a 5."  </P> <P> The new commemorative logo will start appearing on college publications next  spring, said John Wordes, chairman of the college's silver anniversary  committee.

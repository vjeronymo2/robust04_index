			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Long View: Gilts regain an edge Curious statistic number one: the gilt-edged market turned over Pounds 6.7bn on average every working day of the last financial year. The Pounds 160bn-worth of UK government securities are held on average for only a few weeks before being churned. Investors in HM Government do not take a long-term view. There are teasing numbers galore in the Bank of England's annual review of the gilt market, a new publication which is part of the Bank's campaign to market the UK's suspect paper into a fickle global market for government bonds. In the 1993-94 financial year, the sales drive was heroically successful, a net Pounds 49bn of gilt-edged securities being unloaded - and at rapidly declining interest rates until February this year. But the reliance on foreign investors left the gilt-edged market vulnerable to sudden changes in sentiment. Last year, the wide spread between the yields on gilts and on better-fancied government bonds, such as German bunds and US Treasuries, narrowed sharply. Then, the gap opened up quickly once more in the first quarter of 1994 when the market collapsed. This is a typical phenomenon as bull markets turn sour: investors retreat to their core investments and the differentials for risk widen out again. Nevertheless, foreigners mopped up Pounds 17.5bn of gilts in the financial year, out of the total net issue of Pounds 49bn. Domestic non-bank buyers absorbed only slightly more, at Pounds 23.5bn. Curious statistic number two: on February 24, a record 235,000 gilt futures contracts, worth some Pounds 12bn, were traded. The underlying foreign buying might have been even larger than reported, given the volume of futures activity. Overseas purchases tailed away in the troubled January-March quarter but did not turn into net selling. The Bank estimates that foreigners now own 23 per cent of all the gilts on issue. Coming right up to date, the gilt market has had a couple of good weeks, helped by the recovery in the US Treasury bond market. Investors have realised that a yield of 8.5 per cent on long gilts was unreasonably out of line with 3.7 per cent on equities; in the event, the gilt yield has come down rather than the equity yield gone up. The Bank, however, is facing a tougher challenge this year. The Pounds 2bn auction next Wednesday, for instance, involves not a straightforward gilt but a convertible - a three-year maturity switchable to 18 years - showing how the Bank is having to duck and weave in order to hold down its funding costs. Past sins have to be paid for. Over the past 10 years, sterling has depreciated by on average 4 percentage points a year against the D-Mark and 7 points against the yen. Ten-year gilts now yield 1 1/2 per cent more than bunds and 4 1/4 per cent more than Japanese government bonds which, on the historical evidence, is rather charitable. The government, however, is now proposing to hold inflation at 2 1/2 per cent or less, against 5 per cent on average since 1984. You can laugh if you like, but it puts the Bank in an embarrassing position when it has to sell bonds yielding over 8 per cent, because the implied real interest rate is over 5 per cent. It has responded by confining its offerings to fairly short-dated paper on the view that, eventually, the debt can be re-financed much more cheaply. If things go wrong, though, that could create a re-financing crisis in a few years. In fact, it can be argued that the problem is not a temporary one but an enduring consequence of a declining rate of savings in the UK - not in the personal sector but the economy as a whole, where the deficit of the public sector is eating up private savings. A timely study from the securities firm Robert Fleming this week showed that the UK is right at the bottom of the international savings league table. Instead of selling to foreigners, the Bank could market government securities more aggressively to domestic buyers. Why, for instance, is it aiming to raise only Pounds 3 1/2 bn through National Savings? Presumably, because a tougher campaign would damage the building societies, which are already suffering a net drain of retail deposits. Its softest target must be the Pounds 400bn occupational pension funds, which are the biggest domestic institutions but own only 15 per cent of the gilts in issue. At the beginning of the 1980s, they had 25 per cent of their assets in gilts; now, they have only 6 per cent. They could be offered specially-tailored gilts to match their pension liabilities, and they could easily be buyers of Pounds 50bn of gilts over two or three years. But they would have to sell equivalent quantities of equities, which would devastate the stock market. There are just not enough savings to go round. Judging, however, by the way Treasury minister Stephen Dorrell is shaping up with his review of savings and investment flows, an official attack on 'excessive' dividend payments and a tax-based diversion of institutional funds from equities to bonds is visible on the horizon. At the very least, the Treasury might consider levelling the tax playing field for private investors buying gilts. Even with official headline inflation at an historically modest 2.6 per cent, a higher-rate taxpayer is liable to an effective tax charge of 59 per cent on real income from gilts: it might be better, in the long run, to buy German bunds and expect some profits on the exchange rate. Not-so-curious statistic number three: the Pounds 23bn fall in the Bank's provisional gilt sales target to Pounds 26bn net this financial year - a bigger change than the Pounds 17.5bn sales to overseas investors last time - implies that the Bank might get by without any foreign sales at all. Given that the hedge funds have dumped gilts and moved merrily on to trade in copper and cocoa futures, perhaps that is just as well.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Observer: Early promise Juvenilia have a habit of reappearing at embarrassing times, as Jack Straw must be reflecting in his grown-up role as Labour's environment spokesman with responsibility for presenting the party's housing policies. The housing magazine Roof has unsportingly dredged up an article he wrote for it in 1980 setting out a 'draft Labour housing manifesto'. In those heady days of clause four socialism, the promises were simple. One, repeal the law which allowed tenants to buy their council houses. Two, increase public subsidies to hold down council rents. Three, phase out tax-relief on mortgage interest. Twelve years on, Labour's new realism means that Straw's main task is to present the party as the friend of home-owners and the enemy of profligate councils. But if it causes him to drop the pledge of abolishing tax-relief in particular, it is not only the left who'll be sorry. Housing experts are almost unanimous in agreeing that getting rid of this expensive subsidy to mortgages is the key to putting the housing market on a more even keel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has  presented counterproposals in reaction to the political plan of  a group of Haitian parliamentarians. He would require first the  departure of the military who overthrew him, then his return to  power within 10 after the designation of a prime minister. In a  letter to the UN Security Council, a copy of which AFP acquired  on 23 February, Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz  Longchamp presented the sequence proposed by President Aristide  for an irreversible resolution of the Haitian crisis.    This sequence provides first for the departure of the  leaders  of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, as stated in the Governors  Island accord. This can be obtained through the adoption of  more severe sanctions against Haiti by the UN Security Council  along with efforts to put an end to the flood of goods entering  the country through the border with the Dominican Republic, the  document adds. President Aristide's proposal then provides for  the adoption by the Haitian parliament of some measures  including an amnesty for the military and a law on the creation  of a new police force. The following steps include the  deployment of the UN technical assistance mission, the  designation of a new prime minister, and the return of President  Aristide 10 days after this appointment. Finally, Mr. Aristide's  plan provides for the lifting of the sanctions adopted by the UN  Security Council, the prime minister's taking the oath, and the  resumption of economic assistance to Haiti.    These counterproposals have been presented by President  Aristide following the plan proposed in Washington last week by  a group of Haitian parliamentarians. This plan, which is  actively supported by the United States, provides first for the  appointment of a prime minister and the creation of a government  of concord, but does not specify a date for Aristide's return to  Port-au-Prince.    According to Mr. Longchamp, it would be irresponsible to  proceed to designate any prime minister -- who would risk his  own life -- before the deployment of the UN mission. UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who talked on the phone  with Aristide on the evening of 22 February, had no comments to  make for the moment on Mr. Longchamp's letter, stated UN  spokesman Joe Sills. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly  supported this week the plan of the parliamentarians. The  secretary general invited President Aristide to come quickly to  UN headquarters to continue the discussions with representatives  of the friends of Haiti -- including Canada, the United States,  France, and Venezuela -- in an attempt to look for a solution to  the crisis, Mr. Sills added. However, Mr. Aristide, who has to  go to Europe in the next few days, advised Mr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali that he would contact him on his return scheduled  for 5 March. This answer has given rise to a certain irritation  among UN officials in New York.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DEA PAID DELIVERERS OF ALVAREZ  </P> <P> The Drug Enforcement Administration paid $20,000 to the people who brought a  Mexican doctor to U.S. soil to face charges in the murder of an American drug  agent, the DEA said today.  </P> <P> "We did make a payment of services of $20,000," DEA spokesman Frank Shults  said.  </P> <P> The money, he said, was not a reward or a bounty for the delivery of Dr.  Humberto Alvarez Machain.  </P> <P> Shults would not specify the services rendered for the $20,000. However, he  said, it could have covered such things as the rental of the plane that flew  the Guadalajara gynecologist to El Paso.  </P> <P> Alvarez was arrested April 3 to face charges in the 1985 kidnaping, torture and  murder of DEA Agent Enrique (Kiki) Camarena. The alleged kidnaping of Alvarez  has strained relations between the United States and Mexico.  </P></p>

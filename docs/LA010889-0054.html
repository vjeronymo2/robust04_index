			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER DISTRICT'S DECISIONS QUESTIONED  </P> <P> If this week's Three Valleys Municipal Water District's board meeting is a  harbinger for what's ahead in 1989, I am extremely concerned for our consumer  welfare, our water quality, and the quality of the board's decision-making  policies.  </P> <P> Clearly the new board, which looks to be spearheaded by Director William Koch  of Pomona, will support issues that have no real bearing on water quality or  delivery. His and Muriel O'Brien's discussion of their reasons for not  supporting the California Health Department's State Drinking Water Program was  reprehensible. In their shortsightedness, they fail to understand the  importance of a regulatory agency working in tandem with the EPA as well as the  full water industry to help clean up much of our underground supply.  </P> <P> Countless times, Mr. Koch has sought measures that would add to his personal  financial gain and his political platform. Currently he is doing everything he  can to discredit the general manager, Richard Hansen, and the present board. He  continues to fuel the fire to the E. F. Hutton investments issue rather than  attempt to recover the lost monies for "we the people he serves." I am saddened  to see that one man like Mr. Koch could bungle the district's ability to  recover the lost monies. Had he not prematurely publicized the matter, the  district probably would have recovered the full amount.  </P> <P> If Mr. Koch is able to get the votes to oust the present general manager, I am  certain the district will be further crippled in its ability to provide quality  service to us, because there will be no real sanity at the helm of this ship.  </P> <P> Now is the time that all of us get involved by either attending each and every  board meeting or reading the board minutes available upon request to protect  the quality of our water service ahead. We cannot afford the politics and the  sleazy tactics that Mr. Koch and his ilk have already demonstrated.  </P> <P> JOY SARAFIAN  </P> <P> Claremont  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley section of The Times welcomes all viewpoints about  issues in the San Gabriel Valley.

There have been many protests by people either in favor or  against dialogues with the EZ [not further identified], which  are being held at the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral.  Bishop Samuel Ruiz has received death threats. There is a lot of  activity in Chiapas State.    Let us hear from Mary Carmen Camacho, who is in Tuxtla  Gutierrez, the Chiapas State capital. Good evening, Mary Carmen.    [Camacho] Good evening, Pepe. Here is my report. Today,  eight masked men killed Mariano Perez Diaz, regional leader of  the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization. Francisco Meneses  Gazon, municipal president of Simojovel, reported that the  peasant leader was killed this morning on the doorstep of his  home in El Carmito, 15 km from Simojovel. The son of the [word  indistinct] leader in northern Chiapas was wounded in the attack.    Meanwhile, approximately 70,000 workers, members of the  Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM], have threatened to break  with the national CTM leadership if Fidel Velasquez does not  accept the Chiapas workers' proposal that a CTM congress be held  in Chiapas and that the state's CTM executive committee be  elected here. At a meeting in Tuxtla Gutierrez in which  representatives from almost 400 Chiapas labor union  organizations participated, the participants ratified Carlos de  Jesus Nataran Cordoba as CTM leader in Chiapas and expelled  Javier Proter Maldonado, who yesterday was assigned to the post  by CTM national leader Fidel Velasquez without the knowledge of  the Chiapas workers.    Nataran Cordoba, the acknowledged leader, said the Chiapas  workers had thought about breaking with the CTM and forming  their own labor federation. CTM workers said they will use force  to keep the people appointed by Fidel Velasquez to the CTM state  executive committee from taking office. This is what has  happened in Chiapas.</p>

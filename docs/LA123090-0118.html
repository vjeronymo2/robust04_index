			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KATELLA KLASSIC;  </P> <P> WESTERN HAS OFF NIGHT, LOSES, 70-39  </P> <P> For the past three weeks, the Western High School boys' basketball team turned  hustle and hard work into 10 consecutive victories -- tops in Orange County.  </P> <P> Saturday night, hustle didn't cut it as Western lost, 70-39, to Long Beach  Millikan in the championship game of the Katella Klassic at Katella High  School.  </P> <P> For Western (10-1) it was a big-time plummet.  </P> <P> "We played very well for 10 straight games," Western Coach Greg Hoffman said.  "But these are only high school kids. When they fell, they fell hard."  </P> <P> Certainly, no team challenged Western as Millikan did Saturday. Before the  game, Hoffman said he was concerned about the Rams' quickness, height and  tenacious defense, and all proved true.  </P> <P> Although they played well in the first quarter -- the Pioneers matched Millikan  basket for basket, ending the quarter tied, 12-12 -- the second quarter  signalled the beginning of the end.  </P> <P> Millikan (12-3) outscored Western, 16-7, on six points each by Jamie Davis and  Dante Powell. Then Western became plagued by shots that bounced in and out of  the net, several turnovers and mental mistakes.  </P> <P> Still, the second half did in Western. Trailing, 28-19, entering the third  quarter, the Pioneers did not make a field goal until midway through the fourth  when Josh Byrd scored inside.  </P> <P> By that time, though, Millikan was putting on a show and took a 54-27 lead.  </P> <P> Before Byrd's basket, Western had missed 20 consecutive field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> The Pioneers finished six of 31 in the second half, 13 of 61 (21%) in the game.  Millikan shot 27 of 52 (52%) from the field.  </P> <P> "I'm not unhappy with my players," Hoffman said. "Millikan's the best team  we've played -- definitely."  </P> <P> In the third-place game:  </P> <P> Katella 66, Inglewood 60 -- Roger Arias (22 points), Vince Encarnacion (12),  Kevin Carlson (11), Brian Carlson (11) and Eric Martinez (10) all scored in  double figures for Katella. Encarnacion made six of seven free throws in the  final minute.  </P> <P> In the consolation championship:  </P> <P> Servite 52, Bishop Montgomery 47 -- Adam Anderson scored 25 points for the  Friars, who led, 24-23, at halftime. Greg Jacobus had 15 points and Bill Butier  14 for Bishop Montgomery.  </P></p>

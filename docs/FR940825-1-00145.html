			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Upon expiration of the proposed SFAR, [Insert date 3 years after date of publication of the final rule], the Mode C transponder requirement would become effective for aircraft operations to and from the designated airports. However, during the effective period of the SFAR, the FAA will continue to conduct field evaluations, as the remaining Class B airspace areas receive and commission the new radar systems, to reassess the radar coverage within the associated Mode C veil. Additionally, the FAA will explore the feasibility of making permanent exclusions based on safety, operational impact, and radar coverage. The public will be invited to provide comment on any such proposals through further notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO), it is the FAA policy to comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable.

The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this proposed rule are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (December 1990), the FAA designated 306 airports located within the 24 Class B airspace Mode C veils at which the Mode C requirement would be temporarily suspended. SFAR No. 62 allowed aircraft operations into and out of these designated airports without an operable Mode C transponder if these operations were conducted at and below the altitude specified, within 2-nautical miles from the airport's center, and along a direct route (or as directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. In this evaluation, the term ``Designated Airports'' refers to those outlying airports located within the 24 Class B airspace areas Mode C veils where local airport operations were beyond or below ATC radar coverage and, as such, were temporarily suspended from Mode C requirements by the forerunner of this SFAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits in the form of: (1) Increased convenience to pilots operating aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders, and (2) enhanced operational efficiency to FAA air traffic control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to SFAR No. 62, aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders could operate at an airport within a Mode C veil only after receiving ATC authorization. This requirement was valid at all airports within the Mode C veil, even those airports that were located beyond existing ATC radar coverage. Because ATC authorization can only be granted on a case-by-case basis, the process of obtaining ATC authorization can be inefficient and time consuming for pilots, as well as the FAA. The benefit of this proposed rule would be temporary relief from the burden of obtaining individual ATC authorizations for those aircraft operations at airports located beyond existing radar coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FAA air traffic control, this proposed rule would provide benefits in the form of enhanced operational efficiency. Such enhanced efficiency would be the temporary relief of ATC from assigning authorizations, particularly during busy periods. This proposed rule would allow TAC to allocate temporarily its personnel and equipment resources to more productive functions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the benefits of this proposed rule have not been quantified, they are expected to be large for both aircraft operators and the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule is not expected to impose costs on the FAA or society. In addition, this proposed rule would not impose significant costs on the aviation community (namely, fixed based operators). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

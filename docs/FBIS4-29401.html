			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea on Friday  cautiously welcomed North Korean leader Kim Il-song's  indications that his country would remain in the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  spoke over the phone with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher early Friday morning and was briefed about former  President Jimmy Carter's meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, ministry  officials said.    "We consider Kim's remarks as an indication that North  Korea is willing to resolve the nuclear problem through  dialogue," a Foreign Ministry official said in reaction.    "We will, of course, have to wait until we hear directly  from  Carter on his talks with Kim," the official said, "but we  cautiously welcome North Korea's gesture."    Kim was quoted as telling Carter in their first meeting  Thursday that his government has changed its mind and will let  two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) remain in North Korea.    Another ministry official called this a highly symbolic move  on Pyongyang's part, since permission for the inspectors to stay  suggests North Korea will remain in the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime.    Carter and Kim are to hold a second meeting Friday before  the  former U.S. President returns to Seoul.    Pyongyang has threatened repeatedly to bolt the NPT if the  U.N. Security Council went ahead and adopted a sanctions  resolution. A draft of the resolution was circulated Thursday.    CNN reported that Kim said North Korea would not engage in  any reprocessing or refueling, the two core activities involved  in producing plutonium.    "We have yet to verify this part, but if true, we certainly  welcome that," the ministry official said. "This is the right  way to guarantee transparency in present and future nuclear  activities."    Of minor concern here was Kim's failure to mention anything  about clarifying his country's past nuclear activities. "But  this does not have to be done before North Korea-U.S. high-level  dialogue. This issue was to be discussed at the high-level  dialogue, anyway," the official said.</p>

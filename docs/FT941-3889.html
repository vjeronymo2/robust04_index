			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft to test PC network Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, plans to test its new cable television network dedicated to personal computing in April, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said over the weekend: 'We'll set up five or six pilot stations, one of them definitely in Europe. The first tests should take place in April 1995.' He told a news conference at a seminar in Lisbon that locations for the other channels had not yet been decided. Plans for setting up the new channel, which is being formed with Tele-Communications, the largest cable TV operator in the US, were announced last week. The cable network will review new types of software, video games and financial software, and is expected to be available within 18 months. 'We want to create an easy-to-use interface on a lot of applications. Next year's pilot will see if its worthwhile aggressively building the rest of a high-speed optic fibre network,' Mr Gates said. 'We're betting on the market and investing over Dollars 100m a year.' He said that Microsoft would not make any programmes for the channel but would provide software applications. The two companies also plan to test a joint interactive cable TV system based on Microsoft's software and Tele-comm's digital interactive network. Europe provided a growing market for home personal computers, Mr Gates said. 'The market has already taken off in the United States and we're anticipating that in Europe over the next several years.' He said that Microsoft was looking into ways to boost distribution, availability and exposure of personal computer products in the European market. 'The PC user is different from the corporate one. These are not things we'd do for our historic products,' Mr Gates said.</p>

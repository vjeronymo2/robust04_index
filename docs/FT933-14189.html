			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Games side boost for Prism A STRONG performance from its computer games division helped Prism Leisure report record profits for the 12 months to March 28. Shares of the USM-quoted group rose 10p to 150p after the announcement of pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.33m, up 37 per cent on the comparable Pounds 975,000. Turnover improved to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.5m). Mr Geoff Young, chairman, said the computer games side had exceeded expectations: 'The customer profile has continued to improve and now covers many major retailers,' he said. The audio and video operation maintained profits in difficult trading, but the German subsidiary, which began trading last July, produced an 'encouraging' profit, Mr Young said. Cash balances at the year-end amounted to Pounds 1.5m. A proposed final dividend of 2.37p brings the total to 3.27p - a 20 per cent rise - covered over three times by earnings of 10.4p (8.4p) per share.</p>

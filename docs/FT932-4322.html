			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Clarke stresses growth as key to economy MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday set sustained economic recovery as the 'first aim' of his chancellorship, holding out the prospect of a significant shift in the balance of Treasury policymaking. Emerging from two weeks of self-imposed purdah, the new chancellor stressed that the core of the welfare state would emerge unscathed from the government's public spending review. He flatly rejected suggestions that he was already considering raising taxes in his November budget. In his first detailed policy statements since replacing Mr Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke insisted he would not abandon his predecessor's commitment to controlling inflation and cutting the budget deficit. Low inflation and sound public finances were a prerequisite for sustained recovery. But, setting out his priorities in a series of speeches and interviews, he indicated that his chancellorship would be guided by his desire to strengthen the 'real' economy - with industry, employment and providing the opportunity for people to 'make a living' the main concerns. Exhibiting a streak of populism long absent from the Treasury, Mr Clarke told the parliamentary press gallery: 'That's the point of the whole thing - growth and employment'. The chancellor was opaque on the prospects for a further cut in interest rates but did little to damp speculation at Westminster that if the recovery falters he will be prepared to cut rates. Against that he also underlined his public commitment to relative stability of exchange rates - even though he expects sterling to remain outside the European exchange rate mechanism during the rest of this parliament. Last night Mr Eddie George, who be-comes governor of the Bank of England next month, delivered a veiled warning against imminent cuts in interest rates. Mr Clarke, while keeping his options open for the November Budget, left the firm impression that he intends to rely on sustained economic growth rather than further large tax increases or swingeing spending cuts to erode much of the Pounds 50bn annual public borrowing requirement. Mr Clarke said it was essential for the government to agree a tight spending round in this summer's negotiations. But he added: 'Anybody who thinks I came into politics in order to dismantle the welfare state knows nothing of me nor my record.' His objective was to constrain tightly the growth of public spending rather than impose absolute cuts. Breaking with the government's insistence up to now that it would not rule out individual possibilities, he mocked suggestions that it was planning to introduce 'hotel' charges in NHS hospitals or to remove the exemption from prescription charges of the elderly. Mr Clarke dismissed as equally 'absurd' reports that he was already planning tax increases in the November budget. Though he refused to close any options he said: 'I'm not in favour of raising income tax. My instincts are tax cutting . . . certainly I would not increase taxes that might cause damage to our industrial recovery because my first aim is to sustain that.

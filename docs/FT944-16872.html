			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal traders warned of speculative sell-off A warning was given yesterday that non-trade investors, such as investment funds and banks, might drive London Metal Exchange prices lower than many market watchers would expect as the world economy turned down. Mr Alan Heap of County NatWest Securities Australia, said that, by their involvement in the LME, funds and banks had increased metals prices and the volumes traded and sometimes caused prices to anticipate improvements in the fundamental supply-demand balances. But all the evidence showed they had not increased volatility or instability. The impact on prices of their withdrawal would depend on the supply-demand balance and market liquidity but in the early stages it was likely that fundamental strength would be enough to absorb their selling. 'Later in the cycle short-selling by non-trade players may push prices lower than many market watchers would expect,' said Mr Heap at an LME seminar at the start of London Metals Week. He said that banks held metal in LME warehouses as collateral against loans and also as a revenue-earning investment. This metal was therefore not available for immediate delivery. He estimated that nearly half of LME metal stocks were tied up as collateral. As for that held under revenue-earning arrangements, the recent rises in prices had changed the economics and deals would be progressively unwound in coming months. However, he dismissed suggestions that this would take place swiftly and consequently depress prices. 'A progressive release of metal (from LME warehouses) in response to high prices seems more likely.' Mr Heap's generally bullish tone was echoed by most other analysts at the seminar. The exception was Mr Stephen Briggs of Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services, who said years of high prices had resulted in a big increase in copper production capacity. He forecast at net 4.5 per cent rise in capacity in 1995 followed by one of 7.5 per cent in 1996. Consumption would not keep up and Mr Briggs suggested that the copper price, at present about USDollars 1.13 a pound, would drop below Dollars 1 in the second half of next year. Aluminium, in contrast, was likely to perform better than any other LME metal during the rest of the decade, according to Mr Nick Moore of Ord Minnett. He suggested demand would grow by at least 4 per cent annually in 1994-1996. Supply would be constrained in 1995 but there would be 'a mighty turnround in 1996' with up to 1.2m tonnes of capacity being added in that year. Nevertheless, aluminium prices in 1995 were likely to average 20 per cent more than those seen so far in 1994 and rise to Dollars 1,720 a tonne and then climb to an average of Dollars 1,875 in 1996. Nickel's price was also forecast to rise rapidly between 1994 and 1997 on the back of increasing demand for stainless steel, the main user. Mr Heinz Pariser, of Heinz Pariser Alloy Metals &amp; Steel Market Research. predicted nickel prices would average Dollars 2.90 a pound in 1994 and rise to Dollars 3.20-Dollars 3.50 next year. They would then accelerate to Dollars 4-Dollars 5 in 1996 and to Dollars 5-Dollars 6 the following year. Nickel stocks would be at 'dangerously low levels' in 1997, Mr Pariser warned. Lead stocks would fall substantially because of strong demand growth, said Mr Angus MacMillan of Billiton-Enthoven Metals. Consequently prices were likely to be Dollars 700 a tonne next year against an estimated Dollars 550 this year and Dollars 420 in 1993. But very high stock levels would constrain zinc prices. Billiton was forecasting an average Dollars 1,100 a tonne next year compared with Dollars 990 in 1994 and Dollars 980 in 1993. Mr Fidelis Madavo of CRU International, suggested tin stocks should start to fall from this year because of producer cuts and a 'modest 2 to 2.5 per cent' annual growth in consumption. The LME cash price was likely to average Dollars 2.43 a pound this year and would break through Dollars 3.50 'by the end of the 1990s'.</p>

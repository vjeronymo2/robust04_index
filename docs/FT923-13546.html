			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Algerian Moslem leaders sent for trial THE two paramount leaders of Algeria's major Moslem fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), were committed to trial yesterday at the military court in Blida, south of Algiers, writes Francis Ghiles. Mr Abassi Madani, 61, and Mr Ali Benhadj, 35, face the death penalty if convicted on charges alleging conspiracy against the state. They, five other FIS officials and their lawyers, walked out of the court after failing to obtain permission for the trial to be transferred to a civil court. Foreign journalists were banned, as they were two weeks ago when the trial was initially due to start. Mr Madani and Mr Benhadj, who was renowned for his fire-and-brimstone speeches, were arrested in June 1991 after FIS-led riots protesting against alleged constituency gerrymandering stalled plans for Algeria's first multi-party elections.</p>

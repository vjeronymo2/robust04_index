			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / French inflation falls to 3.2 per cent French inflation slowed slightly last month, but economic growth is also lagging, according to provisional figures, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent in March, giving an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent, down slightly from the previous month's 3.5 per cent, says the state statistics body, Insee. The improvement is greater than some economists were forecasting, though at least half comes from a drop in domestic fuel prices. This continues the gentle convergence of French inflation towards the German level.</p>

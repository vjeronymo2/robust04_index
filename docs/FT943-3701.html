			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Mortgage lenders prepare to follow suit The announcements yesterday of rises in variable mortgage rates by Nationwide Building Society and Abbey National seem certain to be the first in a wave of statements from lenders over the next couple of weeks. Northern Rock Building Society, the 11th largest, said it would be raising rates from 7.74 per cent - probably to 8.10 per cent to 8.14 per cent. Most if not all of that would also be passed on to savers. National &amp; Provincial Building Society, the UK's eighth largest society, is expected to announce new rates today. Other lenders, including Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the sixth largest, and Britannia Building Society, the ninth largest, are expected to announce new rates next week. Many high street banks are also waiting until they see what Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, says within the week. But Barclays Bank announced increases in the range of 0.25 per cent to 0.75 per cent for some savings accounts. From today the start rate for the 90-day savings account rises to 4.75 per cent gross. The bank's mortgage rates are under review. Yorkshire Bank also increased some savings rates. Alongside its 0.4 percentage point increase, taking the basic variable rate to 8.14 per cent, Nationwide announced some increases - of up to 0.5 percentage points - in certain rates available in its CashBuilder instant access account. Abbey National said its 0.35 percentage point increase from early October would mean a standard variable rate of 8.09 per cent for mortgages below Pounds 60,000 and of less than 8 per cent for larger mortgages. However, the rate rise is seen as an encouraging sign of the government's determination to keep inflation down and this could lead to slightly lower rates on longer-term fixed-rate mortgages, for which funds are raised on the wholesale money markets.</p>

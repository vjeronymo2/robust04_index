			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> 'Ido Baum; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Peres] During my visit to  Morocco we agreed on four conferences to be held in Morocco with  Israel's participation. One, the multilateral economic meeting  to be held next month, in the beginning of June [as heard]; two,  a conference dealing with desertification initiated by us;  three, a conference on Middle East development scheduled for  late October or early November. The Americans are deeply  involved in preparing this conference. There will also be a  business conference between Israel and Morocco.    Most of us are obsessed with the past, with symbols and  gestures. There is a different world out there, however, with  different rules, and I see things differently.    [Baum] Will future political relations be facilitated by the  economic relations to be forged in these conferences?    [Peres] If you really want to understand, allow me to  explain with these phrases. The idea is that American,  European, and the Japanese governments grant their companies  guarantees for investments in the Middle East. We will give all  these companies a list of proposals for factories in the entire  Middle East -- both regional and national factories. When they  decide on a certain factory, their government will guarantee  their investment. This is unprecedented--an extremely original  idea that Clinton and other leaders have accepted. You should  not compare this to anything else, because it is not similar to  anything else. This conference, which will be held in  Marrakech, is being organized by two companies, one European and  one American, along with the U.S. and Israeli Governments. A  senior U.S. Administration representative will participate in  the conference, apparently Christopher himself. Some 1,500  companies worldwide will participate.    We have to realize that at the present time the main problem  worldwide is economic prosperity, education, and health. This  is what people are interested in. People are sick and tired of  all this diplomatic business, of the outworn diplomatic minutiae.    [Baum] Mr. Foreign Minister, if we are speaking about the  economic issue, I would like to address Yasir 'Arafat's economic  problems. He is complaining that he is not receiving the aid he  was promised.    [Peres] He, too, is not doing what he has to do. We are  trying to help in this respect, too.    [Baum] Do you think foreign countries could provide more  aid?    [Peres] They can do so and are willing to do so. 'Arafat,  however, must establish institutions that have what is known as  transparent bookkeeping. No democratic country will give even  one penny unless it knows precisely where and for what purpose  it is being used. Look, no country will donate toward vague and  unclear aims. The truth is, however, that we are going to lose  the world. Look, the world is big and does not revolve around  us. We are not the only country in the world. Many places in  the world are crying out for help and aid. This is one of the  reasons why we should act more quickly. There is still a lot of  goodwill toward us, but it will not hold out for ever. We must  harbor no illusions about this. We must act more quickly in this  issue; we are trying to facilitate this process as much as  possible, but we are encountering considerable difficulties from  all sides. You know, there is an American expression entitlism,  I am entitled to [last five words in English], and 'Arafat for  some reason seems to subscribe to this view. We have to realize  that the world is built on mutuality, on give and take. Nobody  deserves to receive bread from heaven; this happened only once  to the Jewish people, when it kept them going for 40 years in  the desert.    [Baum] Turning to another issue, Mr. Foreign Minister, while  you were abroad the press was rife with speculations regarding  your reaction to the fact that no one from your camp was  appointed as a new minister.    [Peres] I am not advancing a camp, I have colleagues and I  like to advance all of them. You know, people are trying to  depict me in a completely unrealistic way. I am totally  engrossed by the peace process. I support the advancement of  young colleagues, but I am against appointments done on a  factional and cliquish basis. I have advanced many young  colleagues. I have never posed any conditions and I do not  intend to do so in future.    [Baum] Is there no rift between Yitzhaq Rabin and yourself  regarding this issue?    [Peres] There is no rift. The only issue that can cause a  rift is the peace process. I already said as much at the  beginning of my career in the government and I keep repeating  this. Nobody can make me deviate from my path. I am not  interested in press speculations on power games and on who  screwed who. I will aid any young and talented Labor Party  member, and those outside the party too.    [Baum] Is there any particular candidate for such aid?    [Peres] I will issue an announcement when I have something  to announce.</p>

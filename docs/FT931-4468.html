			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Milan election to test opinion after corruption probes ITALY'S first big test of public opinion since revelations of widespread political corruption gathered pace this year has dawned with the prospect of elections in Milan, its second biggest city. The move follows the decision by the majority of councillors to resign on Tuesday night following widening rifts within the coalition administration and the arrest of one member following investigations into kickbacks. The Milan poll, which may be held in June, could offer the first big test of public support for the parties before widely expected general elections later in the year. Coming in the city where magistrates first stumbled on the trial of what has become a national corruption scandal, the vote will put all the main parties to the test. It would indicate the level of support for the discredited Socialists, whose former leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, based his power in Milan. Early elections could also prove an important challenge to the autonomist Lombard League, which captured about a third of the vote in nearby Varese last December. Securing the mayorship of Milan would be a big prestige boost for its leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, who is thought to have set his sights on control of the former Socialist fastness. The collapse of Milan's administration after weeks of agony follows growing political problems in Rome, Turin and Naples, where the mayors have stepped down and attempts are under way to form new coalitions. However, Milan is the first case where councillors have opted for elections, rather than using the statutory 60-day period to form a new administration. The resignation of the council coincided with a decision, yet to be formalised, to drop Milan's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2000. Although never a front runner, officials had until recently insisted Milan would press ahead with its bid despite the growing political scandals. Italy's Olympic committee may consider re-bidding for the Games in 2004.</p>

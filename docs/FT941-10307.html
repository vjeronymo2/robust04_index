			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Venables sued for Pounds 66,000 by bank National Westminster Bank yesterday issued a High Court writ against Mr Terry Venables, the England football coach. The bank is claiming Pounds 66,493 it says is due under a guarantee given by Mr Venables for the repayment of a Pounds 185,000 loan taken out by a company called Recall City, a customer at the bank's branch in Romford, east London. The sum claimed is said to be the balance owing when the bank called in the loan on October 28 last year, plus interest, which is mounting at the rate of Pounds 18.78 per day. Mr Venables took the Pounds 160,000-a-year job as England coach two weeks ago. The writ states that by a written guarantee, dated December 5 1991, Mr Venables guaranteed the payment of all sums due at any time under the loan, plus interest at 5 per cent annum above base rate from the date of the bank's demand for payment. Mr Venables's involvement with Recall is thought to relate to the ownership of two public houses. He is expected to contest the bank's claim.</p>

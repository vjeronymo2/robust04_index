			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 455] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, March 11, ELTA -- A Lithuanian-Danish  agreement on military co-operation was signed on Friday [11  March] which was evaluated by Lithuanian National defence  minister Linas Linkevicius as one more step towards the  structures of NATO.    The agreement was signed between Linkevicius and his Danish  counterpart Hans Haekkerup who was on visit in the Baltic state.    With the help of Denmark which is a member of NATO,  Lithuania  is going to create and develop its armed forces and voluntary  service of national defence, to train servicemen, to make up a  peacekeeping corps.    Linkevicius said Denmark was participating most actively in  forming units of "blue helmets". A company of Lithuanian  soldiers has already been trained in Denmark, another one is due  to leave in the nearest days. In August, Lithuanian  peacekeeping contingent is going to go to Croatia together with  Danish battalion.    No doubt, the agreement pushes Lithuania nearer to the  Western Europe, Haekkerup said. Denmark is taking part in  preparations of a programme introducing Lithuania to NATO, joint  exercises of military units of both states are planned. Late in  January, Lithuania became the second state after Romania to sign  a NATO initiative "Partnership for peace".    In March 18, representatives of Scandinavia, Germany,  Britain, the U.S. and the three Baltic states are going to meet  in Copenhagen and consider assistance to Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia creating their own peacekeeping forces. A joint  battalion of the three countries is planned to set up with its  training centre in Lithuanian southern city Alytus, in a former  military basis of Russian paratroopers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hans-Inge Olsson: "Kazakhstan Privatizing Mines </F> Worth 55 Billion"]    [Text] Mining giants in the West will now have a chance to  buy themselves into former Russian mineral deposits.  Kazakhstan's plans for a vast privatization program include the  sale of the country's mining deposits worth up to 55 billion  kronor [SKr].    "Taking over the mines will probably not involve large  costs;  the big money is needed for the investments to start the  operations," Trelleborg Group CEO Kjell Nilsson said.    Previously inaccessible markets are now being opened up. One  of the reasons is that the authorities need foreign capital for  the investments required by their projects. The long-discussed  privatization plan has now been presented by the Kazakhstani  authorities. It seems set to become the largest privatization  operation ever in any of the former Soviet Republics.  <H5>  A Region Rich in Minerals </H5>   The program involves 14 of the largest mining deposits in  the  richest mineral region in the world. Outside experts have  estimated the deposits to be worth $7 billion. In other words,  the value of these privatizations is five times higher than the  estimated value of the Trelleborg-owned Falconbridge Company.  These planned sales could thus have momentous consequences for  the mining industry throughout the world.    "But it is not necessarily a bad thing for interested  parties  from the private sector to get into the mining industry. It  would make people start thinking in terms of profitability and  kindle an awareness of unprofitable areas," Kjell Nilsson said.    He pointed out that a lot remains to be done in the former  Soviet mining industry before foreign investors begin lining up,  not least a change in the laws to provide a clear definition of  ownership.  <H5>  Many Different Projects </H5>   "We are discussing a number of different projects, but there  are no concrete talks about any projects in Kazakhstan," Kjell  Nilsson said. Kazakhstan, however, is nothing new, because the  Trelleborg group and its subsidiary, Boliden Contech, are in the  process of building a precious-mineral processing plant for  Balkhashmed.    The Balkhashmed copper mine, with 13,000 employees, is one  of  the concerns earmarked for sale. Another project is the largest  chrome deposit of the former Soviet Union, in Donskoy. "If one  really gets one's teeth into a good one, there is an excellent  chance of finding interesting morsels among these projects,"  Boliden Contech CEO Staffan Jaehkel said. Boliden Contech  specializes in selling Swedish technical solutions abroad. This  year's turnover appears set to reach SKr250 million, and news  about the outcome of plans for a giant project for Norilsk on  the Kola peninsula is expected soon.    Boliden Contech, together with the Norwegian companies Elkem  and Kvaerner, has submitted the best offer for a project that  may be worth SKr2 billion over a four-year period.    Some 5 km from the Norwegian border, the main task will be  to  stem the discharge of sulphate dioxide from the nickel-smelting  plant. This plant discharges six times more sulphate dioxide  than the whole of Sweden in a year.</p>

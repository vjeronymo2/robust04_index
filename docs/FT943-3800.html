			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (10): Contractors to the rescue - A model remedy for infrastructural ills Huge resources will be needed to overcome the infrastructural inadequacies that could threaten the Philippines' economic growth. The country has a poor record in construction and maintenance, largely because insufficient money was available following the economic slowdown in the 1980s. Even foreign loans, made available from traditional official creditors, could not be mobilised, for lack of counterpart local funds. Although there have been some improvements recently, things are far from ideal. The supply of electricity, after the frenetic activity to put up new generating plants during the past two years, now slightly exceeds demand. The new capacity, however, consists mainly of oil-fuelled power stations that incur high costs. There is a strong need to build up new baseload capacity to lower these costs and make the investment climate more attractive. Telecommunications, although improving fast, still need to be upgraded. Telephone density in the country is still 1.4 units per 100 inhabitants, among the lowest in the region. Main roads in metropolitan Manila are often clogged, stretching travel times for commuters and commercial deliveries. For example, the 15-kilometre drive to Makati, the business and financial centre, from the outskirts of the metropolis takes between 60 and 90 minutes. These problems are beyond the financial capability, or even the competence, of the government. However, the solution could come from a scheme, introduced three years ago, that involved the participation of the private sector in the construction of power plants. During the frequent disruptions to the electricity supply in 1992-93 (when working capacity could meet only up to 60 per cent of demand, so that rationing was necessary), the government invited private-sector groups to put up within short periods new power stations under build-operate-transfer (BOT) arrangements. Under this concept, private companies are contracted to construct the facilities at their own expense; operate them after completion for an agreed period, giving them an opportunity to recover their investment and also make a profit; and then hand ownership over to the government at the end of the period. Through BOT, 14 fast-track power plants with a combined capacity of nearly 1,580 megawatts have so far been established - enough to cope with current demand. Other projects under way, including base-load facilities, bring total capacities contracted to private groups to some 6,000MW, involving costs of at least Dollars 5bn. The success of the programme has encouraged the government to widen its approach. Under the Philippine Infrastructure Privatisation Programme (Pipp), the BOT system now applies to other areas: highways, ports, airports, canals, dams, water supply, irrigation, telecommunications, transport, reclamation, industrial estates or townships, government buildings, tourism, slaughterhouses, warehouses, waste management, information technology networks and database infrastructure, education and health facilities, sewerage, drainage and dredging. The Pipp, believed to be the first programme of its kind in the world, has made the Philippines a model for BOT undertakings in Asia. It now offers various financial incentives for projects that entail costs of over 1bn pesos (Dollars 38m), with reasonable rates of return on investments. Among the biggest power projects is the 770MW Pagbilao plant, in Quezon province, south-east of Manila. Hopewell Holdings, of Hong Kong, is undertaking the project through a BOT arrangement with National Power Corporation. It is likely to cost Dollars 973m, of which Dollars 235m will come from equity contributions. Apart from Hopewell's equity of Dollars 205m, contributions were also made by the International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank; the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the UK's overseas development finance institution; and Asian Development Bank. To tackle the telecommunications gap, meanwhile, the Philippine government has introduced what it believes to be another world first. It divided the country into 11 service areas, and assigned these to telecommunications operators that were given specific performance targets. The programme aims to increase the telephone density to about 6.7 units per 100 inhabitants by the end of the decade. Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) has been the dominant telecommunications company in the country, accounting for 93 per cent of all telephones. However, it also has a huge backlog of applications, and receives many complaints of poor service and line breakdowns. The opening up of the sector started with the government's grant last year of licences for the operation of cellular mobile telephone systems, with which PLDT was ordered to interconnect. It also introduced the service-areas concept, to hasten the installation of new land lines. To make the service areas attractive, each was allotted a potentially profitable core in an urban centre - but also certain depressed areas, untouched by economic progress because of poor communications. The programme requires that 300,000 land lines be built in each area within the next five years. The operators were given two years to demonstrate progress, or face cancellation of their grants. The huge costs of these projects have encouraged contractors to link up with foreign companies, either as investors or suppliers of equipment. Consequently most of the big names in world telecommunications are involved in the Philippine programme. Meanwhile, PLDT is trying to eliminate its backlog. By 1996, it aims to have installed 1m new lines in its franchise areas.</p>

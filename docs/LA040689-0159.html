			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME GUY  </P> <P> Like the young man he plays in director Michael Hoffman's off-beat comedy "Some  Girls," Patrick Dempsey has experienced rejection where he wanted acceptance,  and found love where he least expected it.  </P> <P> In the critically acclaimed film (showing exclusively at the Beverly Center  Cineplex), Dempsey's Michael accepts an invitation to spend the Christmas  holidays with his girlfriend's family, only to discover when he shows up that  she no longer cares for him.  </P> <P> Desperate and confused, Michael stays with the close-knit family anyway,  eventually receiving love and an invaluable life lesson from his girlfriend's  elderly grandmother.  </P> <P> The desire for acceptance against seemingly overwhelming odds is a feeling  Dempsey says he has experienced often in his own life.  </P> <P> "Growing up, I longed for acceptance," said the 23-year-old actor, recalling  his childhood in rural Maine. "I felt like a misfit, an outsider. I was a  failure in school as well as socially and I'm still trying to shake some of the  insecurity left over from that."  </P> <P> Curled up barefoot in a big easy chair in the living room of his comfortable  Santa Monica home, Dempsey appeared anything but insecure.  </P> <P> Two affectionate Yorkshire terriers jumped in and out of his lap; his friend,  Rick Stevenson, the producer of "Some Girls," jogged by the house and was  persuaded to stay for a piece of pie; a photographer snapped pictures as he  spoke; his wife-manager-coach, Rocky Parker, popped into the room periodically  to offer gems of insight and wit. And Dempsey maintained an air of pleased  contentment throughout it all.  </P> <P> Dempsey is quick to credit his wife of two years with his growing sense of  security. She is a petite, vivacious woman who comes across as glowingly  confident and not self-conscious about the fact that she is about 30 years  older than her husband.  </P> <P> With graying hair, without makeup or pretense, she makes no attempt to disguise  her age, and though they kept their marriage secret for two years, neither she  nor Dempsey is uncomfortable discussing their age difference.  </P> <P> Dempsey jokes about the fact that Rocky's three grown children are all older  than he is and refers to one of her sons as his best friend. He also notes with  humor that his career has been launched playing characters who have affairs  with older women. He played Sonny Wisecarver in "In the Mood," the true story  of a Los Angeles teen-ager who ran off with two older women (one at a time)  during World War II, and in the upcoming "Loverboy," he plays a pizza delivery  boy who delivers more than pizza to an assortment of lonely older women.  </P> <P> Dempsey and Parker met 3 1/2 years ago when both were touring in "Brighton  Beach Memoirs".  </P> <P> "We were on the road for a year," Parker said, "and since it was a young cast,  I kind of became the mom. I had taught acting for years so we would all get  together when we weren't working and do scenes or rent videos and watch old  films."  </P> <P> "That 'mom' word scares me a little bit," Dempsey interjected, teasingly.  </P> <P> She laughed, "Well, I've been a mom for so long . . ."  </P> <P> When asked how they came to marry, Parker threw up her hands.  </P> <P> "I don't know how it happened," she said. "I thought it was insane when a young  cousin of mine got involved with an older woman years ago. But then when it  happens to you . . .," her voice trailed off. "You certainly don't look for it,  but it teaches you to never say 'never.' "  </P> <P> "I like being in a relationship with someone who's lived through more than I  have," Dempsey volunteered. "If I was with someone my own age, I don't think it  would work. We'd both be too inexperienced, too caught up in our own stuff.  Rocky has helped me tremendously just by assuring me that I'm OK and not  stupid."  </P> <P> Childhood feelings of stupidity were not uncommon for Dempsey.  </P> <P> "I had learning difficulties that made me think I was mentally inferior," he  said. "I was in the seventh grade before my parents found out I was dyslexic  and by then my self-esteem was really low. Even now, I sometimes get nervous  around very intelligent people, wondering if I'll be able to hold a  conversation, or worried that I'll get stuck if I feel pressured to read  something.  </P> <P> "I used to have to prepare a week in advance for a script reading. Rocky got me  to practice reading out loud every day. She taught me to relax about it, take  it easy. Now I do a lot of meditation to get calm, then I can go in and read it  over once and I'm OK."  </P> <P> In "Some Girls," Dempsey has a film encounter with an older woman unlike any  he's played before. The relationship that develops between his character,  Michael, and Granny, played by Lila Kedrova (Oscar winner for her supporting  role in "Zorba the Greek"), provides the most touching moments in the film.  </P> <P> Granny, who is senile and near death, is convinced Michael is her dead husband  come to rescue her. When she escapes from the hospital, Michael finds her in  the snow-covered forest, wet and cold, trying to find her way to the home she  had shared with her husband.  </P> <P> He takes her to the house, gently helps her to undress, wraps her in warm  blankets and allows her to fall peacefully asleep in the cradle of his arm. The  next morning, he follows her to a nearby abandoned chapel where she talks to  him (thinking he is her husband) about God and about their life together.  Dempsey said these scenes changed his life.  </P> <P> "Whenever Lila came on the set it was magical for me; she was so natural and  real. While we were doing the scene in the chapel it hit me that I didn't  really believe in God, didn't really trust, and that it has been a major  problem throughout my life. I saw that I need to trust, to be willing to get  out of the way and allow it to happen.  </P> <P> "The character I play feels lost, unconnected, because his girlfriend has  rejected him. Then he learns from Granny that you feel wholeness in God, not in  another person. In our society, we're led to believe that if you sleep with a  certain amount of women, you'll find self-worth, or that if you have a gorgeous  girlfriend, life will be perfect. But it's not true."  </P> <P> In a scant two years, Dempsey has gone from an actor who couldn't get film work  ("I first had to learn how to be comfortable with a piece of paper in front of  me -- cold readings were a nightmare") to one who enjoys the luxury of as much  work as he wants. He's made six films almost back-to-back, and has two more  coming out this year -- Joan Micklin Silver's "Loverboy" for Tri-Star and  "Happy Together," (Apollo Films) a romantic comedy set for fall release.  </P> <P> Dempsey's directors have high praise for his ability to swing between comedy  and drama in the same role with the ease of a much more seasoned actor.  </P> <P> "I really didn't know how gifted Patrick was when we signed him for 'Some  Girls'," director Hoffman said. "I had seen glimmers but I had no idea of his  emotional range. Because our film starts out as a comedy of sexual manners and  then starts to look deeper, expanding out to explore family, memory, work and  God, Patrick's role requires great range and believability. His talent for  projecting this wonderful bemused, bewildered 'everyman' image is what made it  work."  </P> <P> Silver said she was impressed by Dempsey's talent for physical comedy, "which  is very rare to find in a young actor. He is exceptionally inventive,  constantly coming up with ideas. Audiences respond immediately to his innate,  innocent charm and his fabulous use of body language."  </P> <P> In "Loverboy," Dempsey delivers pizzas and romance to beautiful, lonely women  played by Kirstie Alley, Carrie Fisher, Kim Miyori and Barbara Carrera. The  film is a light comedy romp that allows Dempsey to demonstrate the balance and  coordination skills he learned as a boy by mastering downhill skiing, unicycle  riding and juggling.  </P> <P> His graceful clumsiness reflects a vulnerability producer Gary Foster wanted.  </P> <P> "Patrick has a Buster Keaton comedic quality that gets the audience's sympathy  while they're laughing at his predicament," Foster said.  </P> <P> Next, Dempsey will play a less innocent character "with more of an edge" in  "Coupe de Ville."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Dempsey fills his days with his favorite pastime -- acting -- in a  small studio behind his home that serves as his workshop.  </P> <P> "This is why I bought the house," he said, guiding a visitor through the  studio. "Rocky teaches here, and we have a group that gets together to do  scenes. I'm not into Hollywood partying. I'd much rather be here, surrounded by  creative people who generate a positive energy. It keeps me tuned up."  </P></p>

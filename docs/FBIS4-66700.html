			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Shaykh Ahmad Bin-Farid </F> al-Suraymah, leader of Shabwah Tribal Grouping in 'Ataq, by  'Abdallah Hammudah in London; date not given: "Ahmad Bin-Farid  Supports Local Authorities, Yemeni Unity; Accuses Governor,  Police Chief of Using Their Positions To Entrench  Partisanship"--first four paragraphs are AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  introduction]    [Text] Now that Yemen's map of political forces has changed  after unification and the adoption of a multiparty system,  certain Yemeni figures have returned after years outside their  country, to participate in building the new state, starting from  the positions they left when they departed during the years  following South Yemen's independence on 30 November 1967.    Among the major post-unification returnees who has recently  played an important role is Shaykh Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah,  leader of the Tribal Grouping, which currently backs the  Socialist Party in Shabwah governorate. Considered one of the  most powerful figures there, he was a figure in the episodes of  confrontation that took place in the region during the past two  weeks.    Against charges of "regionalism" and "traditionalism" that  some have leveled against tribal figures in the governorates,  Shaykh Bin-Farid declares that he supports the local authorities  in their support of the unified state. However, he rejects the  use of the organs of that state for narrow partisan purposes. He  is placing his resources as a businessman in the Arab and  international arena at the service of the people of Shabwah in  the context of a new alliance with the Socialist Party that will  restore rights to their true holders and release their energies  to participate in public work.    Shaykh Bin-Farid spoke for the first time to the Arabic  press--AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--by telephone between 'Ataq, the  capital of Shabwah governorate, and London. The following  conversation took place.    [Hammudah] What is the real situation now in Shabwah as you  see it?    [Bin-Farid] The situation in Shabwah now is that the great  majority of citizens, tribal and nontribal, support the  Socialist Party--in other words, the local authority that is an  accomplished fact.    Certain episodes have taken place in the area, as you have  heard. This was because of provocative elements of the [General]  People's Congress. Foremost among them were Ahmad Musa'id  Husayn, the former governor of Shabwah in 1972 and also the  former minister of state security, and a group from Shalal  province who entered an area on the edges of Shabwah. There were  also attempts to smuggle in arms and explosives in Mercedes  trucks belonging to Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, the Shabwah  police commander. But elements from the Tribal Grouping, which  backs the local government--the Socialist Party--in Shabwah,  confronted them and stopped them.    This flows from our faith and agrees with the Pledge and  Accord Document, which provided for the principle of  decentralization and established the foundations of local  government. We are on the way to implementing it in fact.    In my opinion, as long as the political leaders in Aden and  Sanaa have been unable to implement the local government  provided by the charter, it is reasonable and practical for us  to begin implementing it on the scene. We are not against 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih as a person or the People's Congress as a party;  we are for the Charter of Treaty and Agreement. It must be  translated into action.    That is why this Tribal Grouping, which includes 90 percent  of the people of Shabwah governorate, came into existence.    The situation two months ago was that people in Shabwah were  suffering from confusion and vacillation, unable to distinguish  between true and false. So we explained these matters to them.  They understood them, and we gained control. Conditions  stabilized completely, except when elements intent on sabotage  occasionally tried to smuggle arms and explosives into Shabwah.  I regret to say that they were coming from Sanaa.    Now, however, we have set up tribal check points in Wadi  Markhah under the al-Nisiyin tribes, in Wadi Khawrah under the  leadership of the Al Dayyan tribes, and in Wadi Hammam under the  control of the Hammam tribes. We have also managed almost to  cordon off the roads into 'Ataq under the leadership of Shaykh  'Awad Husayn 'Ashim al-Kawkabi. He is certainly the number-two  figure in the Tribal Grouping and one of Shabwah's most  important shaykhs.  <H5>  Events in 'Ataq </H5>   [Hammudah] What exactly happened in 'Ataq? Did you besiege  the headquarters of the governorate and the police  administration?    [Bin-Farid] That is correct--when we arrived. The reason was  because Governor Dirhim Nu'man and Police Commandant Ahmad 'Ali  Muhsin turned these offices, which are official offices that  represent the state as a whole, into headquarters for organizing  the People's Congress, inciting the people against the Socialist  Party, and entrenching the Congress's control.    We said to them: "You represent a state, not the People's  Congress or the Socialist Party. The governor represents the  authority of the state, and the police director performs the  duty of a man in government service." We insisted that they  clear the buildings of the armed elements that were intimidating  citizens into joining the People's Congress by force. This is  the reason.    [Hammudah] But they say that they are the last symbols of  the  People's Congress in the southern and eastern governorates and  that their expulsion could somehow be considered as putting an  end to unity and entrenching secession. How do you reply to this?    [Bin-Farid] We say that the presence of the two ought to  represent the united state, not the People's Congress.    [Hammudah] You seem to be working on the assumption that you  have no objection to their remaining if they represent the  united state, and not a particular party.    [Bin-Farid] Yes, exactly.    [Hammudah] They still have not left the two buildings. Does  that mean that they have carried out what you asked them to do?    [Bin-Farid] They appear to have carried it out temporarily,  because the joint military committee has arrived. But I suspect  that when the committee leaves, they will return to their  activities as before.  <H5>  Persona Non Grata </H5>   [Hammudah] What danger did the return of Ahmad Musa'id  Husayn  represent?    [Bin-Farid] He really is persona non grata. In his personal  and tribal capacity he represents no danger at all to the  Shabwah area, because he belongs to the Jabwan [as  transliterated] tribe, one of the smallest tribes of al-'Awaliq,  representing perhaps no more than 3 percent of the total  tribespeople of Shabwah.    However, he does represent a danger because he claims to  represent the People's Congress and claims that he has been sent  officially by them. Indeed, he brought about 20 armed crews with  him, armed with such weapons as the Dushka. That is the source  of the danger. But when we arrived, his influence and moves  shrank to the valley to which he belongs, a small valley no more  than 10 square kilometers in area. He has not left it from the  time we arrived until the present moment.    [Hammudah] Is he besieged in this area?    [Bin-Farid] He is not besieged, but he is forbidden from all  the tribes surrounding him. One can therefore say that he is  besieged according to tribal customs--in the sense that the  tribes are boycotting him.    [Hammudah] What is the nature of the relationship between  you  and Colonel 'Awad al-Safidi, commander of the central military  axis of the Socialist Party's southern forces? General People's  Congress communiques say that he backed you with armored  vehicles and forces in the operation of encircling governorate  and police headquarters.    [Bin-Farid] That is absolutely untrue. We did not see him  all  that week, which indicates that there is no connection between  us.  <H5>  Change of Positions </H5>   [Hammudah] Some people, attempting to review the pages of  history, say that you were a foe of the Socialist Party in the  past, but that now you support it. How would you reply to them?    [Bin-Farid] This is a true charge in its place. I indeed was  a foe of the Socialist Party, or what used to be called the  National Front, after my house was demolished and I was evicted  from it in November 1967. We have continued to disagree with  them in opinion and principle throughout the past 25 years. We  indeed have fought them. However, the balances have changed, as  we now know. We are sure that they have abandoned their old  methods and ideas.    [Hammudah] Is that why you think that joint action with them  has now become acceptable?    [Bin-Farid] Yes. Yes, because participation and dialogue are  necessary in order to implement democracy somehow. I believe  they have good intentions. Time will tell. We hope that what we  have in mind is correct.    [Hammudah] How do you assess the strength of the General  People's Congress and the Yemeni Grouping for Reform in Shabwah  governorate?    [Bin-Farid] The fact is that the People's Congress and the  Reform Grouping were rejected by many groups from various  classes of the people.    The two of them have spent tremendous sums--money, weapons,  and vehicles. This is a pity, because general elections were  held on 27 April last year and expressed the will of the people  of each governorate. The people of Shabwah governorate elected  the Socialist Party's candidate from among the other candidates.  This is democracy.    The Congress and Reform ought to have stepped in again only  when it came time for the next elections. That is when they  should have made their contribution. But they have tried to  impose their presence by force of arms, which is a mistake.    [Hammudah] People are saying that the People's Congress and  the Reform Grouping are trying to develop their own local forces  in Shabwah and that at the same time the Socialist Party has  turned to you. Is that correct?    [Bin-Farid] It is not correct. We came to Shabwah as  ordinary  citizens, to visit family and kin, to rebuild our demolished  homes, and to begin implementing the building and settlement  projects we had promised. We in fact began to repair schools and  hospitals. A week ago we began constructing a 35-kilometer road  between 'Ataq and al-Musayni'ah at my personal expense. This  shows that we love peace. We do not advocate fighting, and we do  not carry weapons unless we are forced to do so.    [Hammudah] Since the events of January 1986, Shabwah and  Abyan governorates have been a virtual silent opposition to the  Socialist Party. The People's Congress is said to have tried to  benefit from this in order to detach al-Mahrah and Hadramawt  governorates in the east from Aden and Lahij governorates in the  west. [sentence as published] Is this correct?    [Bin-Farid] Yes, this is indeed the strategy of the People's  Congress. The implementation plan for it included pushing seven  brigades from Ma'rib to split Shabwah to the sea by way of  Mayfa'ah and Bi'r 'Ali. Thus they would gain control of Shabwah  and detach Hadramawt and al-Mahrah, where the oil fields are  located. However, when the 30th Brigade reached Shabwah early in  January, we also arrived, completely thwarting this strategy.  The balance has shifted. However, that is what they might have  done.    In my opinion, that strategy has failed, and they no longer  have any hope of accomplishing it.  <H5>  Conditional Support </H5>   [Hammudah] To what extent do you think the tribes of Shabwah  support the Socialist Party?    [Bin-Farid] The fact, as you know, is that if the Socialist  Party proves its good intentions and translates them into  deeds--and we have proposed to them that they restore private  property to its owners, resume respecting tribal figures, and  turn over sensitive positions to the people of Shabwah in  managing their affairs, not making the holding of these  positions conditional on being Socialist Party members, but  giving them to generous, sincere, and honest persons, regardless  of their previous political affiliations--I think that if they  act in accordance with this view and continue in it, success  will be theirs, and the majority will be on their side.    [Hammudah] Does that mean that talk about how the tribes in  Shabwah are submissive to the Socialist Party is a mistaken  assertion?    [Bin-Farid] Yes.    [Hammudah] Tension has largely returned in recent days. What  are the facts about this?    [Bin-Farid] No, it has not returned. Nothing new has  happened  since the incident that took place in Bayhan.    [Hammudah] What happened there?    [Bin-Farid] About 10 large Mercedes trucks came loaded with  food for the military economic installation in 'Ataq. They tried  to bring them in by force, without submitting them to inspection  by one of the army posts in al-Sulaym district. A group of  tribesmen affiliated with the People's Congress, led by 'Ali  Bin-Rashid al-Harithi, then attacked. A clash took place. Five  members of the army were killed, and three of the Ba al-Harith.  The trucks were seized and brought to 'Ataq. They are now  undergoing inspection, because weapons are suspected to be among  the sacks of rice and flour.    [Hammudah] Are you in daily contact with the governor and  police chief?    [Bin-Farid] Yes, we are in contact--not daily, but every few  days. We are not hostile to them personally, but we are hostile  to the style they are following.    [Hammudah] Do you think there has been an improvement in  their style, so that it has become more acceptable to the people?    [Bin-Farid] As I said previously, while the military  committee is present, the two of them are implementing certain  demands about not gathering together certain elements that  support them in the People's Congress. However, I fear they may  return to the old way of doing things after the committee  leaves--and if they go back, we will too!</p>

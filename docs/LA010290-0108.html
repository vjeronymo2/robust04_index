			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION SPENDING AT 10-MONTH HIGH  </P> <P> Construction spending jumped 1.5% in November, rebounding from a 0.1% decrease  in October and reaching a 10-month high, the government said today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government  construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $421.7  billion in November.  </P> <P> It was the highest level of spending since last January's $423-billion rate.  </P> <P> Total spending in October was revised downward from the 1% increase reported  initially.  </P> <P> The November surge was due to a 7% jump in government spending, which  represents about 20% of construction spending, combined with a 0.6% gain in  residential construction, which accounts for about 50% of the total.  Non-residential spending was off 0.7%.  </P> <P> Construction spending fell to a yearly low rate of $410.3 billion last July. It  has been among the sectors of the economy hardest hit by higher interest rates  earlier this year, brought about by the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to  restrain inflation by tightening credit.  </P> <P> But as inflation moderated, the Fed began last June to let short-term rates  drop and analysts have been saying the lower rates should result in increased  construction.  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgages declined from a peak of 11.22% last March to 9.74% at the  end of November, according to a weekly survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corp.  </P></p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Observer: Mates forever Very interesting that Michael Mates should be the one sent to counteract the Irish republican propaganda being touted by Gerry Adams in the US. Mates is a generous man. He it was who gave Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck boss currently gracing Scotland Yard's 'Wanted' notice board, a wristwatch on which was inscribed: 'Don't let the buggers get you down.' He won't be extending the same gesture to Gerry Adams, that's for sure. For one thing, what on earth could he have carved on the watch? 'Tempus fugit' wouldn't have quite the same panache. But 'Permanently yours' might work.</p>

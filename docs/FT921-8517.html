			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Vukovar adapts to post-war 'normality': Neither Serbs nor Croats are yet committed to the city's renewal LIFE in Vukovar, scene of the worst fighting during the seven-month war in the breakaway republic of Croatia, is returning to normal. That is according to Serbia's state-run media. In the streets, the picture is different. The federal army has cleared the corpses from the streets. It has bulldozed away the rubble left by the war. But the charred skeletons of buildings bear testimony to last year's three-month-long battle for control of Vukovar between Serb irregulars backed by the Yugoslav army and the Croat national guard. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, has promised to help rebuild this city. Serbian news reports boast of progress in the renovation of Vukovar, currently under federal army control. But neither Serbia nor Croatia will commit themselves to rebuilding Vukovar, set on the banks of the River Danube in the contested fertile plains of eastern Croatia, until the question of borders is settled. Not a single structure in the city centre escaped damage. The trees are blackened by battle. The altar of the Catholic church stands at a bizarre angle. The rest of the building has crumbled under grenades. An army officer married a local Vukovar bride at the weekend in the Serbian Orthodox church. The priest says a bomb planted in the church last November tore away the roof and destroyed all but one of the 250-year-old frescoes. 'I have lost everything. All I own are the clothes on my back' says Mr Jovan Njegic, weeping in the church. Mr Njegic, a 63-year old retired accountant who is a Serb, says: 'Before the troubles started, we never asked about people's nationality. Now there there is no one left to ask.' His wife, a Croat, fled to Croatia last autumn. Two of his three children, who married Croats, have abandoned the town fearing reprisals by Serb fighters who seized control of the local government. One of Mr Njegic's sons, an architect, remained to help in the rebuilding of Vukovar. But the buildings which can be restored, even if funds were available, are a tiny minority. The people who have remained in Vukovar have nowhere else to go. Mr Zeljko Vicetic, a former factory worker now a policeman, is clearing out refuse, the destroyed belongings of the former tenant. Mr Vicetic, a Serb, says the local government gave him permission to restore the flat for his aunt. The fate of Mr Andrija Sabosos, a Croat who used to occupy the flat is unknown. 'He is either dead or in prison. He was Ustashe,' says Mr Vicetic, referring to the brutal Croat fascist regime during the Second World War. From his swaying balcony the once-pretty view is one of ruin. Next door, Mrs Marija Lukic, a 51-year-old Croat factory worker, says: 'During the fighting I huddled in my fourth-floor flat with my Serbian neighbours. I told my children to leave, that my fate was to protect the little we had.' Mrs Lukic, who was seriously wounded when mortars shattered the walls of her flat, just one week before Vukovar fell to the army on November 18, is uncertain about her future. The fighting destroyed the Borovo rubber factory where she was employed. She receives no benefits from Croatia or Serbia. She and the few thousand people who have returned to Vukovar survive on handouts from the army. They take their meals at the local barracks, which despite claims of a Croat siege were barely damaged during the fighting. Army check points at every village leading to Vukovar require inhabitants to show a special pass. Many of Vukovar's inhabitants appear to welcome the arrival of the UN peacekeepers who will replace the army. But they are clearly unaware of the terms of the UN plan. Uncertain about a life under UN protection, they say the peacekeepers should not be stationed in Vukovar. But most people do not leave Vukovar. Mr Njegic says he has no money to travel anywhere. Waiting for help, he will remain amid the ghosts of a once harmonious population. He says: 'No one will give any real aid until they decide who Vukovar belongs to.'</p>

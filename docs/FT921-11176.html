			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Habash detention causes political crisis THE hospitalisation in Paris of Mr George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), has precipitated a political crisis almost bound to inflict grave domestic political damage on France's socialist government. Last night, doctors appointed by a French judge ruled Mr Habash was medically unfit to be questioned on terrorism investigations. A justice ministry official said earlier that an aircraft was standing by to fly Mr Habash out of France early today in the event of such a ruling. The Palestinian leader's presence created serious diplomatic embarrassment for France, between the indignant protests from Israel and the Jewish community in France, that he should ever have been admitted, and the swelling chorus of Arab demands that Mr Habash should be freely allowed to leave. The Damascus-based PFLP yesterday demanded the release of its ailing leader, while Tunisia and Algeria both offered to receive him. On Thursday night, immediately on his return from a official visit to Oman, President Mitterrand moved rapidly to pre-empt the emerging wave of protests, by securing the resignation of a close adviser and three very senior officials in the foreign and interior ministries, who were implicitly held responsible for admitting Mr Habash without political authority. In addition, Mr Habash was placed under arrest in his hospital room at the request of the French counter-intelligence service. He had been expected to be interviewed by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's leading anti-terrorist investigating magistrate, once his medical examination was completed. Mr Habash, 64, was refusing to co-operate with police at the Red Cross hospital. His wife, Helda, said she had refused to allow medical professors appointed by the judge to examine her husband. She denied PLO reports that he had suffered a stroke and said he had come to Paris for a routine check-up. According to Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, social affairs minister, no-one at a senior level of government was informed of the arrival of Mr Habash until his aircraft was about to land. But the curious fact is that the French Red Cross claims to have requested authorisation for the admission of Mr Habash on Monday, before Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister departed with President Mitterrand for Oman. Conservative opposition parties have refused to be satisfied by the resignations of the officials, whom they describe as scapegoats, and have demanded instead the resignations of Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, and Mr Philippe Marchand, interior minister. Dr Habash, the 64-year-old PFLP veteran is a member of the PLO's leadership, and is respected throughout the organisation. A founder of the Arab nationalist movement, Dr Habash has assumed the role of leader of the 'loyal opposition' to Mr Yassir Arafat within the PLO. Until the early 1970s, Mr Habash was closely associated with the late Mr Wadi Haddad, who was the mastermind of a series of spectacular terrorist coups, including plane hijackings. Mr Habash broke with Mr Haddad over indiscriminate terrorism against western targets after a rash of hijackings to Jordan in September 1970 helped fuel the civil war.</p>

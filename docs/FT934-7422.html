			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nutricia seeks recall damages NUTRICIA, the Dutch food group, will go to court to seek damages from a supplier of meat that allegedly contained traces of disinfectant, prompting the recall of more than 1m jars of baby food this week. The Dutch company also said it will be looking for a new meat supplier. The meat company, Hillegerbergsche Vee-en-Vleeshandel of the Netherlands, declined to comment on the pending law suit. On Tuesday night, Nutricia announced the recall of some lines of its Olvarit brand of baby food because Dutch inspectors had found traces of a disinfectant widely used in cleaning slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. The recall sent Nutricia's shares tumbling by Fl 13.80 (Dollars 7.25) on Wednesday, but yesterday they recouped some of these losses to close up Fl 1.30 at Fl 139.50. The rebound was helped partly by news of a proposed two-for-one stock split. This move is part of wider measures to simplify Nutricia's ownership structure and to limit its defences against potential hostile takeover attempts, in line with new rules on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Nutricia will, for example, drop its priority shares and liquidate a bourse-listed vehicle which owns 18.5 per cent of the company. At the same time, a separate class of shares will be created for Nutricia's main shareholder, the UK foods group Unigate, in order to preserve Unigate's existing rights and privileges as a major investor.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Spanish judge probes bankers The present and former chairmen of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, the Spanish bank, were yesterday questioned by a Madrid high court judge over large payments made by BBV to a consultancy company that allegedly illicitly financed the ruling Socialist party in the late 1980s. Investigating judge, Mr Marino Barbero, is due to question senior Socialist party officials later this month and he could wind up a two-year inquiry into the corruption scandal before the end of the year. Mr Emilio Ybarra and his predecessor as BBV chairman, Mr Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, are among several top Spanish executives linked to Filesa, a Barcelona-based firm of consultants run by senior Socialist officials that took receipts totalling some Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5bn) in return for sector reports which in most cases have failed to materialise.</p>

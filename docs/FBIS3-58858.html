According to various surveys, 54 to 60 percent of Americans say  they are satisfied with their 42d President. This is a dramatic  recovery after a difficult summer during which George Bush's  successor had fallen lower in his fellow citizens' esteem than  any President since World War II.    "America first," such was the tireless rallying cry of  democratic candidate Clinton throughout his electoral campaign.  The promise was kept. Mr. Clinton managed to get Congress to  approve a budget that is a first step on the deficit-cutting  road. He also pushed through a plan for penniless university  students to retroactively finance their education through  community service. Above all, he saw to the passage of the  Brady Bill, which imposes a five-day wait on gun sales in order  to check the buyer's criminal record and which had been stalled  for years.    A blueprint for health care reform -- the President's grand  design, and that of his wife Hillary -- was unveiled. Mr.  Clinton did not wobble on the essential aspect of it, which is  offering health insurance to all Americans, regardless of their  financial resources. Debate in Congress on the ambitious  project will likely take up the better part of 1994. Even if  the final result does not fulfil all hopes placed into the  reform, M. Clinton can at least be credited with tackling a  vital issue which his predecessors had cagily eschewed.    The year 1993 ended with two successes as regards  international trade liberalization: The passage by Congress of  the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico,  and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT. Mr.  Clinton's intensive last-minute canvassing of Congress members  in the former case and his ability to demonstrate a measure of  flexibility so as to carry the day in the latter were major  factors in these two victories.    This year's weaknesses are to be found on foreign policy,  with the exception of trade matters. In Bosnia and Haiti, after  looking determined to act, Mr. Clinton backed down. He also let  himself be foiled by General Aidid's stubborn resistance in  Somalia. However, all this -- including his perhaps  indiscriminate support to Boris Yeltsin -- hardly matters in the  eye of his fellow Americans. Most important is the fact that  Mr. Clinton's first year in the White House was also the one  during which America reacquainted itself with economic growth.</p>

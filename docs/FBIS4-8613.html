			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the Day of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army, Army General Rasim Delic, supreme commander of the General  Staff, has sent Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister a note of  congratulations, which, among other things, says:    We are convinced that this year's marking of the Day of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- when we recall all the difficulties  and casualties but also the results we have achieved -- will be  a great motivation to all of us to continue the war of  liberation in an even more organized and effective way, with  dignity and courage to persist in the establishment of a just  peace.    In that respect, we are aware of the moral obligation we  have  toward the casualties among the population, the killed fighters,  our sehids [Muslim fighters killed in battle], our invalids, and  [word indistinct].    I would like to use this opportunity to express my  satisfaction and gratitude to you -- your personal stature and  results, particularly in the diplomatic sense -- for being a  significant force in preserving and strengthening the moral and  combat effectiveness of the units and commands of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.    This is said in the note of congratulations from Army  General  Rasim Delic to Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the occasion of  15 April, the day of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.</p>

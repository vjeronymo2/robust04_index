			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Fashion: Suit yourself for Pounds 50 - or 13 times as much - Daniel Green dresses up - and down - to discover the details that make tailoring for gentlemen a potentially costly affair IN What they Don't Teach You at the Harvard Business School, Mark McCormack says: 'It is desirable to have your business dress say nothing about you - other than perhaps that your clothes fit.' If that is so, the grey suit should be the perfect business dress. But why pay Pounds 700 for a designer label when a discount shop will give you something that fits for less than a 10th of that figure? At stake were some hefty reputations. Could the seamstresses of the eastern bloc match the couturiers of Paris? Could the buying power of Marks &amp; Spencer compete with the delicate touch of Savile Row? I needed help. Enter Henry Rose of Rose, Kent and Stephens, a man with 32 years in Dover Street and, latterly, Savile Row, a man who could assess a suit if anybody could. We took four off-the-peg, single-breasted grey suits ranging in price from Pounds 59 (two for Pounds 100) to Pounds 735. The Yves Saint Laurent, the most expensive, was dark grey with a subtle, almost invisible check that Henry called 'window pane.' The jacket had the fashionable three buttons, rather than the two on the other suits. The cloth was the softest of the four and felt expensive. Henry warned that softer cloth wears out faster and does not hold a crease long. Apart from that, he was ecstatic: 'I'm gobsmacked. This is the kind of suit that worries tailors.' He praised the materials (cotton for pockets, rather than nylon) and the care taken in putting the suit together. The check lined up precisely at all seams and the pleats were folded towards the fly in the classic Savile Row English style. Details not on the other suits included an inside pen pocket and D-shaped stitching to reinforce pocket corners. More sober was the stolid dark grey of Austin Reed 'hand tailored by Chester Barrie.' At Pounds 625 it was a decent suit, said Henry, made of 'bread and butter Savile Row cloth.' He liked the well-finished buttonholes, precise cut of the sleeves and the underarm triangles of cloth to absorb perspiration. But the rest of the cut did not please him. 'The trouser pleats are too close together; it gives a feminine look.' The cost-cutting measures, too, were disappointing: the buttons looked like a bit like plastic and there were only three on each cuff. The worst criticism was that the jacket pockets did not have 'jets' - a strip of cloth above the pocket flap that looks neat if the flap is pushed inside the pocket. And the lapels were last year's width. 'Not a young man's suit,' was Henry's verdict. Marks &amp; Spencer was next: a mid-grey herringbone at Pounds 160. 'You wouldn't have got quality like this for the price five years ago,' said Henry, running his thumb over the edge stitching along the lapel. The trouser pleats, a masculine distance apart, met with his approval, as did the fake horn buttons. But there were signs of cheaper manufacture. The jacket cloth was 'fused' - that is, the two layers of cloth were glued together to add stiffness and make sure they fell into shape when the wearer stood up. 'The Yves Saint Laurent and Chester Barrie are well enough made not to need fusing,' said Henry. The suit felt bigger to me then did the first two, even though I had asked for the same sizes from each supplier. 'Marks usually cuts them generously. They play it safe with a lack of shape,' said Henry. He also pointed out that the material was bunched at the shoulder. 'There should be more cloth just at the shoulder.' Finally, it was the turn of a 'Ronnie Wiseman' Bulgarian-made suit at Pounds 50 apiece (if you buy two) from Hadleigh, Cheapside, in the City of London. 'Amazing,' said Henry, 'You can't get a metre of cloth for Pounds 50 in Savile Row.' Costs clearly were cut in several places. There were no trouser pleats and the jacket was fused, while viscose lined the breast pocket. 'But these are just details,' said Henry. And the side pockets were jetted, unlike the Chester Barrie. It felt a tough beast, a mixture of polyester and wool with a vaguely canvassy touch. The style was hardly chic, but I did not feel I looked like a newly-arrived east European emigre. After three hours of exhaustive study, we totted up the results. Henry and I agreed that while Marks &amp; Spencer and Chester Barrie were safe bets for those with the McCormack tendency, we were more impressed with the very different efforts of Yves Saint Laurent and Ronnie Wiseman.</p>

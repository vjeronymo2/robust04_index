			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN MARTYR MOURNED; UKRAINE PARTY ASKS SECESSION  </P> <P> Several thousand people turned out in Lithuania on Monday to mourn a man who  became a martyr of the republic's bid for independence by burning himself to  death in a Moscow square last week.  </P> <P> Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis was among 5,000 people who filed  through the center of the capital, Vilnius, behind the coffin of Stanislovas  Zhamaitis, 52.  </P> <P> "This is one of the greatest sacrifices that could have been made for  Lithuania," Landsbergis said of Zhamaitis, who poured gasoline over himself  outside the Bolshoi Theater on Thursday and died later the same day.  </P> <P> In a note to his wife and two children, Zhamaitis said he could not go on  living in an occupied country. Moscow has sent troop reinforcements to  Lithuania and imposed a partial economic blockade on the republic.  </P> <P> The fresh sign of popular support for Lithuania's March 11 bid for independence  coincides with conflicting signals over the possibility of a solution to the  seven-week-old crisis between Vilnius and Moscow.  </P> <P> Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas declared in a Danish newspaper interview  published Monday that Lithuania is ready to freeze its declaration of  independence to bring Moscow to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> However, at a news conference later in Vilnius, Ozolas appeared to contradict  his earlier remarks, saying Lithuania is prepared only to suspend laws passed  since the independence declaration.  </P> <P> In the Ukraine, meanwhile, hard-line dissidents decided to form the republic's  first major non-Communist political party with a program calling for secession  from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> A congress of the Ukrainian Helsinki Union, founded as a human rights group in  1976, voted late Sunday to rename itself the Ukrainian Republican Party.  </P> <P> The congress adopted a program calling for "the creation of an independent  Ukrainian state" as the new party's first goal.  </P> <P> It also called for a market economy with both public and private property and  the step-by-step closure of nuclear power stations.  </P> <P> In Latvia, leaders of the Latvian Popular Front blamed a local whiplash of fear  over the Lithuanian criss for the nationalist group's poor showing in key  runoff elections.  </P> <P> "I think it's a fear of Moscow and more economic sanctions," Popular Front Vice  President Ivars Godmanis said.  </P></p>

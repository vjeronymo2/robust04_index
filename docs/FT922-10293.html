			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Vauxhall aims to raise output 18% VAUXHALL, the UK sub-sidiary of General Motors of the US, is aiming to increase its car production by about 18 per cent this year to a record 310,000 vehicles. Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, said that the company's Luton, Bedfordshire, assembly plant had improved its productivity by more than 60 per cent in the past four years. Mr Ebbert said Vauxhall had closed the earlier competitive gap with GM's continental European plants. 'We are competitive with the Continent,' he said. 'It is not an issue any more. We are competitive on all measures of quality, productivity and cost.' Vauxhall said it had become 'more optimistic' about the outlook for UK new car sales for the remainder of 1992 and forecast that new registrations in April - to be reported officially next week - would show the first year-on-year rise for 30 months with an increase of between 3 and 5 per cent. New car sales for the full year were expected to rise by 6 per cent to 1.69m from 1.59m last year, implying an accelerating rate of recovery in the second half of the year following the 11.1 per cent year-on-year decline in the first quarter. Vauxhall said that its pre-tax profit last year fell by 44.5 per cent to Pounds 132.6m from a record Pounds 239.1m in 1990 on a turnover which declined marginally to Pounds 2.57bn from Pounds 2.62bn. In spite of the decline it still achieved its fourth-best profit, however, in a year when the UK new car market suffered its steepest year-on-year decline since 1974. Vauxhall was easily the most profitable carmaker in the UK last year. Ford of Britain, the UK market leader, plunged to a record loss last year of Pounds 470m (on ordinary activities and excluding Jaguar), while Rover suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83m. GM's Vauxhall operations have been transformed in recent years and have played a significant role in the emergence of GM Europe (Opel in Continental markets) as the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe. In contrast to much of the UK motor industry Vauxhall avoided lay-offs and short-time working last year, most importantly because of a big rise in exports. Vauxhall embarked in 1990 on its first significant export programme for more than 15 years, and last year its exports rose to 104,390 cars and car-derived vans from 29,523 in 1990. Exports this year are forecast to fall to 84,000, but this would be compensated by higher UK sales. Vauxhall forecast an increase in its UK new-car market share to close to 17 per cent from 15.6 per cent last year. The company expects to begin volume production at its new Pounds 190m V6 engine plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, late this year with pilot production due to begin this month. Including the engine plant, Vauxhall will have invested Pounds 375m at Ellesmere Port since the end of 1989. It has invested Pounds 650m in the past decade in improving and re-equipping its plants. Vauxhall paid a dividend of Pounds 116m to its loss-making GM parent company last year, bringing the total dividends paid to Detroit to Pounds 495m in the past three years. Before 1989 Vauxhall had not paid a dividend to the US for more than 20 years after decades of losses.</p>

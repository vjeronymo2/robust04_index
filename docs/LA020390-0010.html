			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : A LITTLE STAGE MAGIC  </P> <P> Performers talk about the magic of the stage, but Madge Sinclair is taking it  seriously for her role tonight in Los Angeles Theatre Center's world premiere  of Anna Deavere Smith's "Piano."  </P> <P> Though her character, a maid named Suzanna, may seem to have a humble position  in the Cuban family household at the center of Smith's play, she is a woman of  great power. Sinclair says: "She is a priestess in santeria, the earth-based  religion that is very extensive throughout Latin American and the Caribbean.  The story is set in 1898, when Cubans were fighting their Spanish occupiers,  and the family is torn apart by the arrival of a brother, who is in the Spanish  army. She uses santeria to help the family."  </P> <P> What some perjoratively label as voodoo, the Jamaican-born Sinclair knows from  some personal experience. "In Jamaica, it's called Pocomania -- little madness.  It's a cross between the holy roller church and African santeria beliefs. My  grandfather was a practioner, an obeah man, who used herbal healing methods."  </P> <P> Sinclair was drawn to acting in school, but in the '60s Jamaica had no  professional theater so she headed for New York.  </P> <P> It's been uphill since: acting at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre in the early  '70s ("the Public was just starting then, and we would do fundraising shows on  an outdoor flatbed truck"); landing the role of Bell in the first edition of  "Roots"; garnering three Emmy nominations as nurse Ernestine Shoop in "Trapper  John, M.D.," and winning a 1987 Los Angeles Emmy for PBS' "Look Away." She  played Eddie Murphy's mother in "Coming to America."  </P> <P> "Some people get snooty about it," she says, "but I like working for TV. I can  finish something and see it the next week." But Sinclair remains with the  theater and the chance to "speak wonderful language. And I've been with LATC  for four years because it reminds me of the Public Theatre. You may either hate  or love the shows, but there's always something interesting going on." ROBERT  KOEHLER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alice F. Cabotaje] </F>   [Text] The country is not totally unprepared for a more  liberal trade environment under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (Gatt).    Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said that the  National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) has made  initial moves with Congress to amend the necessary laws to  concur with the principles of the Gatt accord.    Gatt members, for instance, will have to rewrite or enact  national laws that will protect patents, trademarks, copyrights,  industrial designs and trade secrets.    "We are all for the Gatt. The president has given us  instructions to do the necessary consultations and  communications on the impact of the Gatt," he told the INQUIRER.    Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada earlier expressed  alarm over the "state of unpreparedness" of the country in light  of a new trade order under the Gatt.    "I have not seen any organized program, written or  un-written, on how the country can take advantage of the  so-called liberalization of the global economic order under  Gatt," he said in a privilege speech.    Meantime, the Pambansang Ugnayan ng Mamamayan Laban sa Gatt  [National Association of Citizens Against Gatt] (Pumalag), an  anti-Gatt coalition of 12 agricultural sector organizations,  continued to lobby against the ratification of the accord.    "Third World countries are neither technologically nor  financially equipped to benefit from competing head-on with  their foreign counterparts," the coalition said in a position  paper.    Citing an Asian Development Bank report, the coalition  pointed out that the country is bound to gain a minimal 0.5  percent increase in trade under the Gatt.    The Gatt accord, signed 15 April Marrakech, Morocco, calls  for the cutting of tariffs on industrial products by an average  of more than one-third. Domestic and export subsidies given to  agricultural goods will also have to be reduced.    Phasing in of these commitments will be over five to 10  years  starting 1 July next year.    Aside from the Gatt, the Philippines is also set to overhaul  its tariff system to meet the requirements of the Asean Free  Trade Agreement (Afta).    A number of industries already raised concern about the  possible impact of a liberalized trade among members of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    They noted that the country had already reduced a number of  tariff lines on several import products upon the proddings of  its major creditors.</p>

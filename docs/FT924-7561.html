			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The investment cult Within hours of my predicting that this would happen, Norman Lamont floored an interviewer on the BBC's Today radio programme by asking whether he was being accused of stimulating the economy too much or too little, or whether he should have borrowed more or less. My own immediate answer was that the chancellor was stimulating too little on the fiscal side, but taking too many risks with monetary policy and sterling. I am always relieved to find some City analysts agreeing with me. The prize this time goes to Keith Skeoch of James Capel, who writes that Norman Lamont's 'non-membership of the Magic Circle may have to be reconsidered in the light of the Autumn Statement where, with the aid of mirrors, the chancellor presented what amounted to a discretionary tightening of fiscal policy as part of a recovery package. As we suspected it might, the new growth-orientated policy consists of more of the same - cuts in interest rates and a depreciation in sterling. Mr Lamont implicitly admitted as much by cutting rates by 1 percentage point at a time when sterling's index was at an all-time low.' The risks were also admitted by the Treasury in forecasting a stalling of the fall in inflation, at around its present level, despite the fourth year of recession or abnormally low growth and an above-equilibrium unemployment rate. The hiccup is obviously owing to a minimal allowance for sterling's latest depreciation. The realism of the government's commitment to maintain inflation within the target 1 to 4 per cent band, still more to reduce it eventually to its lower end, depends on this devaluation being the last of many since 1967, and probably on its being partially reversed. This is just as much the case if the government operates through domestic monetary targets, which in an open, non-continental economy have a large part of their effect via the exchange rate, as if it is operating an overt sterling objective. The Bank of England takes the inflation commitment and its forthcoming quarterly inflation reports extremely seriously. A technically competent analysis involves, however, not just past numbers, but a political judgment on how far to believe government statements of future intentions. This will be an extraordinarily embarrassing judgment to make - especially on medium-term issues which the governor has promised to cover - while the Bank remains a member of the official family, but has no direct responsibility for decisions. Meanwhile, there is the question of how the chancellor managed to produce an apparent growth package within tight public spending guidelines. Michael Saunders of Salomon Bros estimates the cost of the package at just over Pounds 1bn in the current fiscal year and nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993-94. The abolition of car tax should not, however, have been included, if one takes seriously the chancellor's commitment to raise petrol tax or vehicle licence duties as an offset next March. Perhaps the ideal is more vehicles piling up in garages to provide orders for the motor industry. The real package looks as if it has been paid for by the 1 1/2 per cent public sector pay limit, which I favour as a crude substitute for the market pressure restraining pay in private business. But I fear that this has not been enough and that detailed scrutiny will show some painful cuts concealed elsewhere. The heart of the measures is in the investment stimulants. They embody the conventional wisdom that the economy must be stimulated through investment and not consumption. Yet I was always taught that investment is only worthwhile if the total costs of production with the new equipment were less than the direct costs of producing with the old. As yet no one has shown that it is wrong, or that the community gains from subsidised investment. The investment cult is a combination of different confused ideas. First, business cycles have traditionally been associated with investment fluctuations. But whatever the proximate cause, in a prolonged slump it is demand that is lacking and a boost to spending in the shops is just as good. Second, investment provides more scope for creative accountancy. The paradigm case is the hire instead of purchase of railway rolling stock to save government borrowing costs. A sensible business would decide on the prevailing balance of financial advantage, and not on crude cash flow. Third, there is an old confusion that because countries with rapid growth rates tend to have high investment ratios, the way to growth is to subsidise investment. Fourth, spending on, for example, the Jubilee Line is said to be less import intensive than consumer expenditure, which is really covert protectionism. We are left with the fifth argument, that industries like construction now have unusually large excess capacity and that it is good business to place contracts with them early. There is something in this; but on its own it would not be enough to justify the investment fetish.</p>

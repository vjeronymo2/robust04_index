			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW COULD YOU . . .  </P> <P> Thanks for finally including one of my productions in Pop Eye's Bottom 10 list  ("The Worst of 1988," by Patrick Goldstein, Jan. 8).  </P> <P> After so many years of having one popular group after another receive a  critical bashing from The Times, only to miss the Worst 10 list, I finally made  it with Poison. Guess this goes to show that four Top 10 singles and 5 million  copies sold won't hurt an album's chances of earning a spot on your list.  </P> <P> Perhaps next year Poison will be lucky enough to come in higher than No. 9: A  spot in the list's Worst-5 might mean sales of 10 million!  </P> <P> TOM WERMAN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P> <P>  A case of different strokes for different folks. Goldstein's list was the  result of a poll of 40 writers, deejays, record executives and others in the  music industry.  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Busier M62 wins Pounds 540m development boost THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday announced plans to spend Pounds 540m improving the M62 trans-Pennine motorway to cope with congestion and increasing heavy-goods traffic between Liverpool, Greater Manchester, Yorkshire and the Humber ports. The proposals are to spend two tranches of Pounds 270m. One would provide a relief road parallel to the M62, where the M61, M63, M602, A580 and M66 all feed into it. This causes chronic congestion at present as local and through traffic merge. The other Pounds 270m would go on widening 21 miles of the M62 to four lanes in each direction between the M66 Bury-Manchester motorway and Huddersfield. The relief road would merge into the main motorway at the point it becomes four lanes wide. A process of public consultations was announced yesterday in Manchester by Mr Robert Key, the roads minister. Mr Key also announced he was dropping plans for a new link road between the M56 and M62 through green-belt areas near Warrington after protests. Exhibition of plans and consultation will take place over the next few weeks. Objections - which would trigger public inquiries - are thought inevitable because the relief road will run through several Greater Manchester suburbs and hundreds of houses and other buildings will have to be demolished. Mr Key said designers hoped to minimise the environmental impact by building 25 ft high mounds on each side of the new motorway and planting trees to screen it. Because they are classed as improvements to existing infrastructure, the relief road and M62 widening plans would be financed from the normal public-sector roads programme, the Department of Transport said yesterday. There is no provision yet in government spending plans for either project, which - if finally approved - may therefore have to wait several years to get on the programme. Greater Manchester's motorway ring should be completed in about three years, when the M66 links with the M63 in the conurbation's eastern suburbs. The proposed relief road would separate trans-Pennine through traffic from local users where the M62 forms part of the ring. Heavy goods traffic has been increasing steadily as the M62 has formed a land bridge for trade between Ireland, northern England and northern Europe. The ports of the Mersey and the Humber are handling record levels of cargo. These have continued to increase, even in the recession.</p>

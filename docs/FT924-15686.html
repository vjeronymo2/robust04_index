			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: City leaders bemoan the lack of a clear government policy BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe could damage the country's prospects for economic growth. They urged the government to rid the country of uncertainty by adopting a clear economic strategy. Some said that it would take a new chancellor to implement it. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, called for a clear commitment to Maastricht. Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group, which has extensive European activities, said it was essential for the government to re-establish order in its management of exchange rate policy. 'In the absence of that we have huge movements of cash swinging around the world not driven by trade but by people speculating in money. That volatility is hugely damaging,' he said. Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US minicomputer manufacturer, said of the UK government: 'They have got themselves in a ridiculous situation. They had the chance to rebalance the economy and they threw it away.' Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive of chemicals group MTM, said: 'The new row between the German and British authorities is the final nail in Mr Lamont's coffin. We need a new face who can make some difficult decisions.' Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, also thought Mr Lamont had to go 'if the government is to come up with a clear-cut statement on economic policy'. Fear was expressed, too, that foreign companies could become nervous about investing in a country whose position and influence in Europe was questionable.</p>

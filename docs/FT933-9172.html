			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / People: Engineering a future at Simon It's goodbye for a week to my spouse, For the pleasures of yachting at Cowes. I'll be hosting all day At our corporate chalet And each night I'm obliged to carouse. Two years after penning this winning entry for a competition in The Independent, the author is moving to a company where severe belt-tightening rather than carousing will be the order of the day. Maurice Dixson, who in addition to being a keen limerick writer, has had a distinguished career with British Aerospace (owners of the above-mentioned corporate chalet) and GEC, is moving to Simon Engineering as its new chief executive, in succession to Brian Kemp.

Prior to that he had been at BAe, latterly as managing director of the commercial aircraft side and before that as chief executive of Royal Ordnance. His name, together with that of Dudley Eustace, now finance director of Philips, was at one time in the ring as a possible successor to former chairman Sir Raymond Lygo.

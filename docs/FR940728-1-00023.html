			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Current Requirements for Opening and Maintaining Deposit Accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under our present regulations, the requirements for opening and maintaining a Deposit Account are that the holder make an initial deposit of at least $250.00, and that later replenishment amount to a minimum of $250.00. The Deposit Account holder is also obliged to make at least 12 transactions a year, to provide the exact name and number of the account on all applications for registration or requests for service, and to maintain a sufficient balance to cover all charges against the account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Deposit Account Services Provided by the Copyright Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basic Services <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . There is substantial workload involved in the initial establishment of a Deposit Account. A great deal of recurring clerical and accounting work is also required in maintaining and servicing accounts after they have been established: producing and mailing monthly statements of account; keeping account information up to date; entering replenishment checks; responding to inquiries from account holders; and providing additional statements of account or transaction histories upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Insufficient Funds and Uncollectible Checks <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In the case of a Deposit Account holder whose account does not have sufficient funds to process new requests for services, or whose checks are returned as uncollectible, the Office faces a substantial burden of staff time and expense in handling both the Deposit Account and the fee service requests to be charged against it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When funds on hand are insufficient to process new claims or other fee service requests that are to be charged against a Deposit Account, the Office must put a hold on the account, identify and store the pertinent material, and notify the applicant by telephone, telefax, or mail that the account is depleted. When the account holder deposits additional funds, the Office staff must re-activate the account, update it to show the replenishment, then find the material, stamp the application with the ``funds received'' date, and forward the claim for regular processing. This is a substantial extra workload. In recent experience, the number of claims received for which there are insufficient funds available in the Deposit Account has grown to the point where a large-scale tagging and shelving system has been devised to keep track of the material and the account with which it is associated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is also added work involved when replenishment checks are uncollectible. We must then remove the amount from the account balance, inform the Deposit Account holder of the problem, and solicit a replacement check which, when received, involves still more processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Summary of Copyright Office Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, we are proposing to amend our regulations to establish a schedule of fees for various Deposit Account benefits and services;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An initial fee for opening a Deposit Account;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An annual service fee for maintaining and servicing a Deposit Account;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A handling fee in cases of insufficient funds; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A fee for uncollectible replenishment checks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

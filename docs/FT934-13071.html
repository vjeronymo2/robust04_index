			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UN chief visits Mogadishu and Baidoa MR Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali, the UN secretary general, sought to retrieve the diplomatic initiative on Somalia yesterday with unannounced visits to the towns of Baidoa and Mogadishu. The secretary-general insisted on going against the advice of senior UN and US officials, who feared his presence might fuel unrest. It did. In Mogadishu, supporters of Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the rebel warlord, greeted the secretary general's arrival with burning barricades and well-organised anti-UN demonstrations. Mr Boutrous-Ghali did not leave the airport, where he remained for just two hours. During his last visit to Mogadishu in January, he was pelted with stones and abused by hostile crowds. 'With the ceasefire in Mogadishu barely two weeks old, we thought the secretary general was taking unnecessary risks,' a western diplomat in the Somali capital said. But Mr Boutrous-Ghali clearly felt he had to re-establish his authority over the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) following the success of Mr Robert Oakley, US special envoy, in securing release of an American pilot and a Nigerian peacekeeper last week. The UN military and civilian chiefs in Somalia, Gen Cevik Bir and Admiral Jonathan Howe, met Mr Boutrous-Ghali in Baidoa, where the UN is well-liked. Baidoa, known as the 'city of death,' has recovered from starvation and civil war thanks to western charities and UN agencies. Back in Nairobi, the secretary general said he had met UN generals in Somalia to discuss the future of the peacekeeping operation after the departure of US, French and Belgian troops due in the next six months. Mr Boutrous-Ghali said he hoped Arab and African states would volunteer extra troops and funds. Some UN officials, however, fear UNOSOM will fall apart without logistical support of the 5,000-strong US contingent. Mr Boutrous-Ghali insisted that the UN Security Council had not lifted the arrest warrant against Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the slaying of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June. However, he said the UN was willing to find a commission of inquiry that was acceptable to the fugitive general. He did not rule out further military sorties with the aim of capturing Gen Aideed. The UN, he said, was keeping all its options open. Mr Boutrous-Ghali said peace prevailed over 90 per cent of Somalia, hailing this as a success for the UN. As for Gen Aideed's defiance, he said the UN could not impose peace 'if there is no political will among the protagonists of the conflict.' Mr Boutrous-Ghali is trying to organise a Somali reconciliation conference with the help of Eritrea and Ethiopia.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: More tales of unseated diplomat Sir, Like your correspondent, Philip Whiteley (Letters, September 14), and as a future neighbour of the Bolivian naval base at Tiquina on Lake Titicaca, I, too, enjoyed Christina Lamb's dispatch ('The Navy lark', September 11/12). Some variations on the story behind Queen Victoria's demand that Bolivia be expunged from British maps are even more curious than that recounted by Mr Whiteley. The reason for the British ambassador being ignominiously removed from La Paz, tied backwards on a donkey, is said to have been his refusal to accede to President Malgarejo's insistence that the diplomatic corps drink from the same bowl as his favourite horse, Holofernes, which regularly attended the bibulous banquets frequently offered at the palace. Queen Victoria's initial reaction is alleged to have been 'send in the navy'. It was on being told that Bolivia was a landlocked country that she changed the punishment to deletion from the map. As I pointed out in my book, 'Gate of the Sun', however, this must be an apocryphal story since Bolivia had not then lost its coastline, an event that happened a few years later.

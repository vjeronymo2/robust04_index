			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: Hoover's dust-up HOOVER'S DISMISSAL of three senior executives allocates responsibility for a promotional campaign so disastrously managed that it promises to live on as a cautionary tale in business textbooks. The errors included designing a scheme so generous that it was bound to attract enormous interest - Hoover offered a prize in free air tickets worth more than the promoted appliance itself. Then the arrangements for distributing tickets crumbled as local managers and their agents struggled to contain the emerging and unsustainable financial liability. Once inside this hole, Hoover continued digging. It became surly with the press and denied a catastrophe which was in full public view well before Christmas. It has taken head office in the US four months to order a change in tack. In these days when brands are traded like any other asset, this suggests another point. Hoover has acquired its reputation for reliability over decades - that is why even a too-good-to-be-true offer was credible to consumers. Maytag, which bought Hoover in 1989, is an established US appliance maker which should know all about maintaining brand value. On this occasion, however, it appears to have been driven by the recession to focus on improved financial performance at the expense of common sense and in violation of a core value for consumer companies: plain-dealing and integrity. The damage to the Hoover brand is certainly greater than the Dollars 30m charge to be taken against profits. Even in the most decentralised and entrepreneurial company, head office needs to disgorge more than financial targets.</p>

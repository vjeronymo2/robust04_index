			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anna Kozyreva article under the "Partnership" rubric: "Our </F> Diplomacy Is Wavering Between Pyongyang and Seoul"]    [Text] The forthcoming official visit to Moscow by ROK  President Kim Yong-sam, scheduled for 1-4 June, has again drawn  attention to the problem of Moscow's mutual relations with the  two Korean capitals, Pyongyang and Seoul.    The ROK ranks among the 10 leading trading powers in the  world and, in some economic sectors, is even a serious  competitor to the West. Furthermore, a number of experts  believe that South Korea's experience is more appropriate for  Russia than America's or Europe's. If you take into account the  geographical proximity of Russia to South Korea, too, it is  perfectly possible to talk about the highly favorable  opportunities for cooperation between the two countries.    Despite that fact, business contacts between Moscow and  Seoul  have been developing less successfully than expected after the  establishment of diplomatic relations in September 1990. And  the plans were ambitious. The sides gave each other  most-favored nation trading status, established telegraph and  telex communications, and opened direct air communication  between the capitals and sea communication between Vladivostok  and Pusan. As a result trade turnover increased rapidly.  However, in 1992 it had already begun to decline and in 1993  South Korea's total volume of trade with the CIS countries  amounted to just $2 billion. Russia, meanwhile, exports mainly  raw materials and the South Koreans, despite having a high  regard for its high-tech goods, are in no hurry to buy them.    As a result, a series of highly promising projects have not  been implemented. For example, Hyundai and Lucky Goldstar  International proposed taking part in oil exploration work in  Kalmykia, in laying an oil pipeline from Yakutia via the DPRK to  South Korea and China, in modernizing the Izhorskiy Plant in  Leningrad Oblast, and in investing $53 million to create a  number of joint ventures with Soviet partners. In addition,  there was a proposal to build a business center and a large  hotel in the region of Nakhodka and Vladivostok ($50 million)  and a polypropylene plant in Tobolsk ($30 million), and to  develop a coal mine in the settlement of Yelginskiy ($200  million). And so on. Now Seoul's decision to allocate the  former USSR $3 billion is viewed in South Korea as a mistake by  the then President No Tae-u. And part of that money remains  frozen.    This topic was discussed at the Institute of the Far East  and  the following aspect was noted. When it established official  contact with us, the ROK expected that Moscow would be able to  put pressure on the DPRK in the ROK's interests. Seoul would  also have been happy if Russia had made a statement on the  USSR's involvement in the launching of the Korean War of  1950-1953. But those hopes were not fulfilled and interest in  Russia began to wane.    "Life shows that mutual relations with Seoul cannot be built  without taking into account Pyongyang's opinion," Roald  Savelyev, acting director of the Center for Korean Studies,  believes. "Bias in favor of one of the partners could weaken  our position in the region as a whole."    Roald Vasilyevich stresses in this regard that observing  balance in mutual relations with the two Koreas is especially  important for Russia. Take, for instance, timber procurement  work in the Far East. For a long time North Korea's forestry  workers treated our timber reserves quite barbarically. Thus it  was decided to entrust this work to the South Koreans. The  logic behind it was this: The South has more sophisticated  timber felling techniques and has a more solicitous attitude to  nature. That was indicated by the following fact: Just  previously the ROK leadership had suspended the activity of  Dusan Elektro Matriyel [name as transliterated], a leading firm  in the microelectronics and computer industry, for dumping over  300 tonnes of phenol in the Naktong River. A country which  takes such care to protect the natural environment, it was  thought, will set a good example to all timber producers. In  fact it all proved otherwise. The international environmental  organization Greenpeace, which monitored the work of the South  Koreans, sounded the alarm: Russia's forests are still being  plundered.    Of course, facts such as these are not meant for analysis  at top level. We have the relevant articles in the criminal law  which are supposed to prevent excesses of this kind. But the  example is instructive. It testifies eloquently how dangerous  illusions can be.    Political confusion also slowed down the construction of the  oil pipeline from Yakutia via North Korea to South Korea.  Pyongyang took a highly negative view of the fact that the USSR  established diplomatic relations with Seoul. As a result the  North Koreans sharply curbed their relations with us. Moscow  played its part here, too, which led to the creation of a  certain tension on the borders and in the region as a whole.  Today Russian diplomats tend to blame it all on the USSR  Foreign Ministry. However, in recent years they themselves have  been pursuing the same line.    "Our interests, first and foremost the interests of  security," Roald Savelyev says, "demand very precise and  verified actions in dealings with the two Korean states. Yes,  Pyongyang has North Korean interests to care about, Seoul has  South Korean interests. But Moscow too must defend Russia's  national interests. In the past we gave the North strenuous  support in the spirit of internationalism but then we began to  support the South equally determinedly. And as a result we  reduced our ties with Pyongyang without acquiring new ones with  Seoul."    The breakdown in economic relations was especially painful  for us, my interlocutor believes. We built quite a few  industrial facilities in North Korea, including  battery-production and miniature electric motor plants, in the  expectation of receiving output for our own needs. Now the  agreements have been suspended and in Russia there is a shortage  of vehicle spares, miniature motors, and many other products.    Are improvements possible? Undoubtedly. For that to happen,  in the opinion of our experts, it is necessary to remove the  seat of tension on our borders where there is permanent  confrontation, not just political but military, too. There is a  35,000 strong U.S. corps in the South, and Patriot missiles are  being brought in there now. There are also disputes over  Pyongyang's nuclear program. The unification of the two  countries, not as "total" as in Germany, of course, would lead  to an improvement in the situation in the region. But even  before that Russia must not lose the positions that it has won  both in the north and the south of the Korean Peninsula.    I should like to hope that Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit  will take place in the spirit of the establishment of truly  equal and mutually beneficial relations. There is a Korean  proverb: "They dug the well together, but only one drinks." We  must make sure that we are not the partner who is left out.</p>

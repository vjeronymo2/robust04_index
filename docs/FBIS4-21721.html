			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 23 Mar (EFE) -- National Police  Director General Octavio Vargas Silva today said Colombian  police have uncovered a plot to carry out attacks in Sante Fe de  Bogota and other cities against the campaign headquarters of  certain political parties, including the headquarters of Liberal  Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano.    Gen. Vargas added that the terrorist plot was uncovered on  22  March after police searched a hotel in downtown Santa Fe de  Bogota. Following a shoot-out, four people, whose names were not  released, were arrested, while five others escaped.    The police director noted that, during the operation, police  found blueprints of several buildings in which political parties  are headquartered. The only headquarters specifically mentioned  by Vargas were those of Ernesto Samper, one of the favorites to  win the May elections.    Vargas underscored that the terrorists, whose names are  being  withheld, were arrested thanks to ``intelligence operations.''  He added that police are also working to identify the group  plotting to sabotage the elections. Vargas contended that this  group could be part of an ``organized crime ring or a subversive  organization.''    The Colombian National Police director added, ``This is a  very important case that will require exhaustive analysis.''</p>

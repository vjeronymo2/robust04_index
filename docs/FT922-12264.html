			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (3): A traditional image appeals to Anglophiles - Barbour/Fortnum's/Gloverall PRODUCTS reflecting the traditional British image and way of life are selling well all over the world, but particularly in Japan. You can't get more traditionally British than the royal family, and one reliable sign of a long-established British product is the presence on the label of the crest which indicates a royal warrant of appointment, awarded to products favoured by the royal family. J Barbour and Sons, best known for waxed jackets which cope with the worst of British weather, is one company that will be adding the Queen's award for export logo to the three royal warrants of appointment it already displays. Its garments are sported by several members of the royal family, and its brochure even advertises a Mark Phillips jacket for riders. Barbour has found that Britain does not have a monopoly on the need for bad-weather clothing, judging by the boom in sales across Europe, America and Japan. The company started towards the end of the last century making oilskins for the North Sea fishing fleets. Now its 'Thornproof' waxed cotton jackets have become a widely-imitated classic of country style. During the 1980s the range expanded to include every kind of outerwear, from hats to socks and all-in-one wading outfits. Most items are intended to be worn for hunting, fishing and riding but in fact are often seen on the streets of London and other cities. Barbour garments are exported from the company's base in South Shields and sold to 25 markets across the world, through wholly owned sales subsidiaries in the main markets and a network of distributors and agents. Fortnum and Mason is the biggest name in luxury foods in the UK, and because of its royal warrant of appointment to the Queen it is often referred to as the Queen's grocer. Although Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly, London, is its only store, Fortnum's food products are stocked by many other department stores and specialist food shops in the UK. In 1981 the company set up a separate export division to cope with the growing international demand for tea, biscuits and preserves carrying the Fortnum name. 'The company's products have been enjoyed outside England for more than two centuries, but in the last five years controlled expansion of sales by the export division has achieved worldwide recognition for our range of quality food products,' Fortnum and Mason says. Export earnings represent a significant and increasing proportion of total turnover. In Japan, Fortnum's has become known as a specialist tea house, and its attractively packaged own-brand varieties of tea have high prestige value as gifts. They are sold from concessions in many department stores including Mitsukoshi, the 'Harrods of the East'. Japan is also an important market for duffel coats made by Gloverall of London, which also wins an export award. The duffel, a practical, warm hooded coat, originated in Belgium, but was British military issue in World War II, and became popular with students in the 1950s after Gloverall was approached by the Ministry of Defence to sell off the military's surplus coats. Forty years later the duffel is still Gloverall's main product, and is available in countless variations of style and colour. Gloverall describes the duffel as 'the epitome of British style', but says its appeal is now totally international. Gloverall has a 1.5 per cent share of UK clothing exports to both Japan and France. 'Despite the current economic climate we are constantly setting new export sales records,' said Mr Roger Morris, the chairman.</p>

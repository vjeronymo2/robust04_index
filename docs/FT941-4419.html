			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Legal aid curb may hit privacy cases Cases brought under the government's proposed law on privacy may be made ineligible for legal aid. The law would create criminal offences covering electronic eavesdropping and long-range photography on private property. Ministers are considering the curb on aid as part of a renewed onslaught against the legal aid budget, which is set to climb to Pounds 1.4bn in 1994-95 in spite of steps last year to restrict eligibility. Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, is questioning the extent of legal aid provision in several areas as part of the review of spending by the Lord Chancellor's Department. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said earlier this year that the government was proposing to withdraw legal-aid funding for cases which could be resolved without going to court. Some ministers are worried that too heavy-handed a clampdown will increase pressure for a contingency-fee system for lawyers (no win, no fee) to safeguard access to the courts for the less well-off. They are concerned that this might lead to an increase in legal actions.</p>

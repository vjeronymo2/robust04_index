			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (13): Structural reform gathers pace / Assessing the capitalist revolution in eastern Europe FINANCING the transition from central planning to privatised market economies is all about creating capitalism without capital. Not surprisingly this unprecedented task has spawned some unprecedented 'solutions', not all of them very healthy. A recent study by Salomon Brothers of New York, for example, found that mutual default on payments between enterprises was the main source of financing economic activity in Russia during the first half of 1992. According to the June edition of Salomon's Russian Economic Issues, inter-enterprise debt rose 82-fold from Rbs39bn on January 1 to Rbs3,200bn on July 1 last year. This uncontrolled explosion of funny money made a mockery of attempts to moderate inflation and obliged the government to permit the central bank to issue a surge of new money or face the consequences of forcing 90 per cent of industry and the financial sector into bankruptcy. But the decision to print more money did nothing to help the grass-roots transformation of the economy which is taking place, but virtually in spite of government actions. Nearly half the new credits were used to prop up the discredited collective farm and agro-industrial sector and much of the remainder to sustain the military factories, the study concluded. The growth of unregulated inter-enterprise debt is a problem throughout the former communist bloc and will remain so until a combination of bank reform, bankruptcy legislation and privatisation, separates out the hopeless loss makers from the basically sound enterprises which can be re-financed, down-sized where necessary and re-floated. But this process is gathering pace, starting with the three central European states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. These are the most advanced along the path to privatisation and structural reform and the most attractive to foreign investors. But similar moves, albeit at an earlier stage, are also taking place in Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states. Despite the low level of average incomes the past three years have seen a widening of income differentials and a growth of personal savings which has surprised most observers. After an initially hesitant start the mass privatisation programmes pioneered by former Czechoslovakia and Poland have also been enthusiastically received, turning millions of citizens into small-scale shareholders at an initial cost of a few weeks' wages. The foundations of a domestically-generated investment capability are thus being laid. But increasingly, economic policy-makers and advisers are emphasising the crucial importance of transforming primitive Soviet-style banking systems into effective conduits for the finance of industry and commerce. The central European states in particular are also forging ahead with the development of pensions funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors, hitherto totally lacking. Much still has to be done on the banking front. But heavy investment in personnel training and on new equipment and premises, coupled with much foreign advice and extensive remodelling of banking laws on European Community lines, is changing the face of what is becoming an increasingly privatised and modernised sector. Most banking business is still transacted by the big state-owned banks. But many are earmarked for privatisation and dozens of smaller private banks, unburdened by the bad debts of the past, have sprung up, although most remain small and under-capitalised. The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have singled out the banking system as a priority for reform throughout the region, with both helping various schemes to re-finance balance sheets stripped of inherited bad debts. The EBRD, for example, recently took a 28 per cent stake in Poland's Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy, the first of nine hitherto state-owned commercial banks hived off from the central bank three years ago to form the basis of a new, private, commercial banking system. The much-criticised EBRD has been most active in Poland where more than 100 investment projects are in the pipeline. Most are for fledgling Polish private companies unable to obtain finance for expansion from the banks, although the bank's earliest operations throughout the region concentrated on co-financing deals involving foreign investors with track-records and wide experience in funding matters. After a slow start the pace of foreign investment in the region is climbing steadily, although this complicated area, artificially cut off from the real world of financial and capital markets for decades, is having to compete against fast-growing Latin America and south-east Asia where market mechanisms already exist and where returns are usually quicker. Foreign investment commitments totalling Dollars 28bn were chalked up last year, although that figure, compiled by East Europe Investment Magazine, is somewhat artificially boosted by large, long-term energy projects in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and a few mega-investments such as Volkswagen's DM7bn commitment to Skoda in the Czech Republic and Fiat's Dollars 2bn project in Poland. Strip out the energy deals, where spending will be over decades, and the actual equity capital inflow to the region since the fall of communism is Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn. Investors have learned to distinguish between the former Soviet states, with the partial exception of the Baltic states and Kazakhstan, and former communist central Europe. Russia and most of the former Soviet states are for patient, long-term investors willing to ride with the punches and re-invest rouble profits for long-term growth and market penetration. Central Europe on the other hand is already well on the way to developing fully-fledged market economies with relatively stable political structures and western-style legal systems. Hungary, which began market reforms 20 years ago and punctiliously services its large foreign debt, remains the favourite target for foreign investment, attracting more than Dollars 5bn since 1989. Earlier this year it pulled off a significant coup when Audi-VW decided to locate its new engine plant in Hungary rather than former east Germany. But Poland, with its large internal market growth potential and entrepreneurial ways, is rapidly emerging as a potential 'Italy on the Baltic', with a fast-growing private sector shrugging off occasional political turbulence like post-war Italy. Big German investment in the Czech Republic, spearheaded by Volkswagen, has brought a wide spread of collateral investments by component companies and similar developments are taking place in Hungary, where Suzuki is a rare Japanese investor, and Poland where Fiat's commitment is also drawing in substantial collateral investment. Heavy investment by the multinational car companies seeking low cost production facilities and potential market growth is mirrored by a wide spread of multinational consumer goods corporations. They are bringing the joys of western-style detergents, tobacco, processed food and drink to the whole of central and south-east Europe, with the exception of war-torn former Yugoslavia which faces economic meltdown if the ethnic conflicts are not resolved.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 5 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Issei Inoue (vice chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]) and leader of the SDPJ Diet members  delegation who visited China from 1 to 3 April, and other  members of the delegation held a news conference at the Diet  building on 4 April. At the news conference, they revealed the  contents of their talks with leading figures of China on such  issues as the DPRK's (North Korea's) refusal of inspections of  its nuclear facilities. Mr. Inoue revealed that during talks  with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April, the delegation had  indicated the SDPJ's intention to support the UN Security  Council [UNSC] presidential statement and to attach importance  to cooperation with the United Nations. He said he had told the  foreign minister that "because the SDPJ is one of the ruling  parties, it intends to abide by the UN policy" on the issue.  Moreover, he showed eagerness to develop diplomatic activities  of ruling party members for solving the issue at the "diplomatic  forum" which is to be set up on 5 April by Diet members of the  ruling parties.    According to Mr. Inoue and other delegation members, while  the SDPJ delegation indicated the party intention to seek a  solution of the DPRK nuclear issue through dialogue during  series of meetings with Chinese leaders, it said that the SDPJ,  in its capacity as a ruling party, has no intention of deviating  from the Japanese Government's policy. Moreover, in connection  with the UNSC's mildly worded presidential statement which was  recently adopted, the delegation urged China to take a positive  part in efforts to solve the issue, saying: "We suppose that  China also bears a responsibility (for implementing the contents  of the statement)." However, Foreign Minister Qian insisted on  the view that China "is not a party directly involved." During  the meeting, they reportedly could not reach an accord on the  issue.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: France may sell CNP stake in September The French government could sell off part of CNP Assurances, the country's biggest life insurance company, as early as September. Mr Patrice Ract Madoux, finance and international director, said continued weakness in the French equity markets might make the part-privatisation of CNP more feasible than that of Assurances Generales de France, the large composite insurance company which is also scheduled to be sold. The government sold off Union des Assurances de Paris, its biggest insurer, earlier this year. Mr Ract Madoux is expecting the government to sell a stake of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent of CNP, raising between FFr5bn and FFr6bn (Dollars 899m-Dollars 1.1bn). The group hopes to attract an overseas investor and has been targeting potential parties in North America and Europe. The state would retain a 40.5 per cent interest, with the savings banks owning about 10 per cent and the post office about 17.5 per cent. 'If the market is soft we may be a test for government. We are planning to be ready by early September,' said Mr Ract Madoux. 'Given the state of the market it may be easier to sell a medium-sized company. It would be more digestible.' CNP has grown rapidly in recent years, increasing its sales by 50 per cent in 1993 alone. Mr Ract Madoux said the group's sales through 17,000 post offices, 6,000 savings bank branches and 4,000 tax offices had all increased, partly because of the effectiveness of training programmes. CNP, which specialises in a relatively simple life insurance savings product, has a market share of about 17 per cent. The commission payments it makes to intermediaries are much smaller than those paid by France's composite companies.</p>

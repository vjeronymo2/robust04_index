			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / People: Hambros Lord Kingsdown, the recently ennobled Robin Leigh-Pemberton who retired as governor of the Bank of England four months ago, is not settling back to life as a gentleman farmer. In addition to a directorship at Glaxo, Lord Kingsdown has accepted an invitation to join the board of HAMBROS, the merchant bank, as a non-executive director. How much of a distraction from more gentlemanly pursuits the task will prove remains to be seen, but with his own secretary and office at his disposal, he may feel obliged to make fairly regular appearances. 'We look forward to him contributing in many areas to all the work we will be doing,' says Sir Adam Ridley, Hambros' PR director. Lord Kingsdown will take up his appointment, approved at a Hambros board meeting yesterday, on November 1. His appointment brings the number of non-executive directors at Hambros to four.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOLPHIN GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF SEA WORLD  </P> <P> A Miami-based environmental group on Monday called for a boycott of all Sea  World parks and all products produced by Anheuser-Busch because the company has  refused to rid its five marine theme parks of "petting pool conditions" that  the group says endanger dolphins.  </P> <P> The call for the boycott was made by the Dolphin Project, which was joined by  three other animal protection groups, all of which allege that the giant beer  company's parks regularly violate government restrictions by overcrowding  dolphins in the pools and by putting too much chlorine in the water.  </P> <P> Speaking at a news conference at a Beverly Hills hotel, Scott Trimingham,  president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a group participating in  the boycott, claimed that dolphins in cramped tanks constantly injure  themselves as they butt up against each other, and that inordinately high  chlorine levels have been causing the animals to go blind.  </P> <P> Sea World executives contested the allegations, saying the pools meet  government standards.  </P> <P> Sea World parks' assistant zoological director, Brad Andrews, speaking at  another news conference at the hotel, called the allegations false and said the  activists are not qualified to comment on whether the dolphins' living  conditions are unsafe.  </P> <P> "The claims appear to be fabrications," Andrews said. "In the industry, the  people making these comments are nonentities. . . . We would not allow anything  abnormal to happen to the dolphins. The pools are adequate."  </P> <P> Andrews cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture letter addressed to Trimingham,  who requested an investigation into the alleged suffering of dolphins being  kept in petting tanks.  </P> <P> In the letter, USDA officials said a pool at Sea World in San Diego complies  with the agency's space stipulations. Still, Trimingham claimed that a pool at  Sea World in Orlando, Fla., has failed to meet regulations. USDA officials also  said the chlorine level in the two pools was acceptable by their standard.  </P> <P> Even when government regulations are met, Trimingham contended, there is no  guarantee the animals are being protected.  </P> <P> He referred to USDA officials who formulate safety guidelines as "prostitute  scientists" -- those working for, or associated with, the marine park industry.  </P> <P> "By visiting Sea World, children have the opportunity to become acquainted with  marine mammals and other ocean life, which is important in developing an  awareness and concern for the future of these animals," said Michael J. Roarty,  a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis.  </P> <P> "The educational benefits of the interactive pools -- indeed all Sea Worlds'  operations -- are important. . . . Sea World regularly receives letters from  children saying that one of the things that they appreciate most about a visit  to the parks is the chance to reach out and feed or touch a dolphin."  </P> <P> One of the strongest voices calling for the removal of the petting tanks has  been Richard O'Barry, the trainer of dolphins that appeared in the 1960s  television series "Flipper."  </P> <P> " 'Flipper' was one of the best and worst things that has happened to  dolphins," he said. The five dolphins O'Barry trained for the series helped to  "create an awareness about dolphins and the ocean," he said, but they also  "created an unnatural desire to hold and caress them."  </P> <P> When several of the dolphins he trained died due to "captivity stress," he  began lobbying against those who continued to train the animals.  </P> <P> "For 10 years, I was part of the problem," O'Barry said. "Now I'm on the other  side of the fence."  </P> <P> O'Barry said the boycott was raised after a yearlong call for the end of the  petting pools.  </P> <P> "We are now going after Anheuser-Busch in a way that they must take heed,  through their consumers."  </P> <P> He said the Anheuser-Busch marine parks have been reluctant to discontinue use  of the petting pools, because of their appeal to an estimated 12.5 million  visitors per year. Sea World officials acknowledged that the dolphin exhibits  are among the parks' most popular.  </P> <P> The brewing-industry giant bought Sea World in December, 1989, from Harcourt  Brace Jovanovich for $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> The boycott is aimed at the company's 17 different beer products, as well as  its Eagle brand snack foods.  </P> <P> In addition to the Sea World parks in San Diego and Orlando, Anheuser-Busch  owns Sea Worlds in San Antonio, Tex., and Akron, Ohio. Dolphin Project  representatives said the boycott also extends to Anheuser-Busch's other theme  park in Tampa.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRY BALKS AT PROPOSED TANKER LAW;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS SAY DOUBLE HULLS WOULD TRIPLE HEADACHES, SCUTTLE REBOUND  </P> <P> Shipping and oil industry executives said Monday that a possible law requiring  double hulls on oil tankers would come at a time when the shipping industry is  just beginning to recover from years of losses and would complicate plans to  replenish the aging tanker fleet.  </P> <P> In addition, any such law would be costly and could have unintended effects on  an industry dominated by foreign carriers, executives said.  </P> <P> Because old tankers would be exempted from the requirement, it is conceivable  that foreign shippers might opt to send their older ships to U.S. waters, while  building new, cheaper, single-hull tankers for use elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Mandating to the international community without broad support from the  international maritime community creates problems that may be hard to sort  out," said Douglas Wolcott, president of Chevron Shipping Co., the marine  transportation unit of Chevron U.S.A.  </P> <P> A bill introduced by Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) would require all new oil  tankers over 20,000 tons dead weight to be equipped with double hulls. That  would include both U.S. and foreign carriers operating in U.S. waters.  </P> <P> The bill already has cleared one Senate panel. Adams said oil spills are  inevitable. "So you try to avoid that by making your vessels safer, your  response time quicker, and having equipment at hand to begin the cleanup  immediately," said Adams, a former Transportation Secretary and longtime  proponent of regulations requiring double-hulled tankers.  </P> <P> Of the world's estimated 3,200 tankers, oil companies operate about 332 ships  of at least 10,000 tons dead weight each; foreign governments and their  companies operate 799, and independent companies -- including giants in Hong  Kong, Japan and Europe -- operate the rest, said Arthur McKenzie, a tanker  consultant and director of the Tanker Advisory Center.  </P> <P> Only a fraction of the tankers are registered in the United States. Far more  common are so-called "registries of convenience" in countries from Liberia to  Panama to Uruguay.  </P> <P> Studies by the Coast Guard, the Office of Technology Assessment and others have  reached varying conclusions about whether a double-hull design would lessen the  effects of spills like the one at Valdez, Alaska, or those that took place in  the waters off Pennsylvania, Rhode Island or Texas over the weekend.  </P> <P> But shipping analysts agree that requiring new tankers to have double hulls  would add significantly to the cost of building new tankers.  </P> <P> A new supertanker of 250,000 tons costs about $70 million to $80 million,  analysts said.  </P> <P> "It's quite expensive to add a second skin," said James Winchester, shipping  industry analyst with Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. in New York. "It would add on the  order of another $16 million," he estimated.  </P> <P> Requiring that new tankers have a second hull could affect the shipping  industry's decisions about replenishing its aging tanker fleet. For many  operators, "freight rates do not even justify building a single-hull tanker,"  Winchester said.  </P> <P> The pace of new tanker building is far below that of the late 1970s, when a  supertanker building boom resulted in overcapacity, helping to drive shipping  rates to rock-bottom. A few years ago, freight rates were running about $5,000  to $6,000 per day and shippers believed that they were better off selling their  tankers for scrap than operating them, observers said.  </P> <P> Now, "The overbuilding that occurred in the 1970s is being used up quite  rapidly, and probably we'll see some building beginning," said Jerry Aspland, a  tanker captain and president of Arco Marine Inc., the shipping unit of Atlantic  Richfield Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $30,000 or More Per Day  </P> <P> Shippers are encouraged in part by freight rates that have begun climbing again  as the surplus capacity has shrunk to 42.4 million tons in February from 93.6  million tons in 1985, McKenzie reported. At the same time, the tanker fleet is  aging -- the average age of a tanker is about 13.5 years, McKenzie said.  </P> <P> Chevron, which owns 41 tankers and charters another 20 to 30, has four new  tankers on order at the moment, Wolcott said.  </P> <P> Still, to cover the costs of building a new freighter, a shipper must charge  freight rates of $30,000 or more per day, Winchester estimated. Current rates  are averaging about $16,000 per day, he said.  </P> <P> "If the international oil industry and the tanker market were to agree from now  on to build only double-hull vessels, we would see the ultimate freight rate  build that much higher, somewhere around $40,000 a day. The market absolutely  won't support that," Winchester said.  </P> <P> As a result, the new law "would make the U.S. market a different market than  other foreign markets, unless other countries follow suit," one shipping  executive said. "And that could mean . . . that the U.S. gets the older tankers  . . ."  </P> <P> "If (a foreign shipper's) choice is to spend a considerable amount more for a  double-hulled vessel or to save the money and simply send their new  (single-hulled) vessel somewhere else, economically, they may be forced to send  the old grandfathered vessels here, because someone else will do that and  undercut them."  </P> <P> Requiring double hulls could ultimately reduce the available shipping tonnage,  with resulting increases in freight rates, said Karl Meyer, chairman of Marine  Transport Lines, one of the larger independent shippers in the United States.  </P> <P> "Any kind of environmental or safety response, any way to upgrade vessels . . .  (will be) passed on to the end user, and that will be the oil company,"  McKenzie said.  </P></p>

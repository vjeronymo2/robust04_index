			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol, ROMPRES, 22/06/1994 -- General Lebed  again criticized the Tiraspol leadership in the newspaper  DNESTROVSKAYA PRAVDA. He stated that "the current Dniester  leadership has exhausted all its possibilities: it can be  changed through anticipate elections in the presence of  observers of international organizations." Lebed insists that  such elections be held at all management levels. In his  opinion, a referendum on the confidence to president Igor  Smirnov should be held. Lebed stated that the Tiraspol leaders  have no future as "they quarreled with everyone: their friends  did not come at power in Russia and they destroyed the economy."  Commenting on the terrorist act against prosecutor Luchik,  Lebed alleged that the attempt could have been framed by certain  Tiraspol officials. "The assassin will not be traced out because  he is among us," stated Lobed. He mentioned that everyone  points to Bergman to deceive the public. He also stated that  Dniester's entry into the Union of the Unrecognized Countries  along with Abkhazia, Crimea and other republics will condemn  Tiraspol to an eternal unrecognition. Referring to his  relations with the Moldovan leadership, General Lebed pointed  out that "as long as Mr. Snegur who instigated the fratricidal  war is at power I have nothing to talk with him regardless of  how much I should be provoked to do this." According to him, the  only Moldovan official with whom he discussed was Varnia mayor  Cornescu. Lebed discussed with him the fate of the military  subunit located near this village.</p>

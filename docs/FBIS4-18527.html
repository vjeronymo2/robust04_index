			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkish officials told Robert Lamb, U.S.  coordinator for Cyprus Affairs, in Ankara yesterday that the  Turkish Cypriot side will not make any concessions.    Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin held talks with Robert Lamb  yesterday morning and informed him that the changes made in the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] are unfair. He also  informed Lamb that it is impossible to agree to the changed CBM  package.    Meanwhile, Ambassador Tugay Ulucevik, deputy under secretary  of the Turkish Foreign Ministry who is also responsible for  Cypriot affairs, said that the Turkish Cypriot side must not be  expected to make additional sacrifices.

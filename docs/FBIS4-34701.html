			<p>BFN     [Text] Francisco Caraballo, the top EPL [People's  Liberation Army] leader and one of the most wanted guerrillas in  the country, reportedly was captured near Santa Fe de Bogota a  few hours ago.    Emisoras Caracol Network has learned that in an operation  conducted near the capital -- either in Chia or Cajic -- seven  people, including Caraballo, were apprehended. The Army, with  the assistance of the National Registrar's Office, is now  attempting to confirm whether the captured individual is indeed  Caraballo. A news conference will be held within the next few  hours by the 13th Infantry Brigade to report on the details of  this operation.    Caraballo, who was active in Cordoba and Antioquia's Uraba  region, has long been involved in the EPL's war against  Patriotic Unity in Uraba. He is Fidel Castano's No. 1 enemy  and, we reiterate, one of the Colombian Army's most wanted  guerrillas.</p>

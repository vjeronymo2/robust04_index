			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Trouble brewing The decision of Foster's to write down the value of its UK assets by one-third calls for a stiff drink. In some respects Foster's is only catching up with its peers. Its stake in the Inntrepreneur pubs venture has been written down to a level already used by its partner Grand Metropolitan, but the red ink in brewing underlines that the outlook on this side of the business is as cloudy as ever. The inflow of cheap cross-channel lager has only added to the wider problem of overcapacity. Yet any lingering hopes among its competitors that the Courage subsidiary of Foster's would be the first to crack and start closing capacity should be dispelled by yesterday's figures. Its market share increased modestly last year and, thanks to cost savings, the operating performance was respectable. Excluding the impact of changes in excise duty and currency translation, profits were flat. Since the wholesale price war has failed to produce clear winners or losers, the question remains whether the big brewers will be forced into a sober reassessment of strategy. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the last two months have seen a pause in pricing hostilities, but that could simply be a result of stronger beer sales during the summer months. The long-term trend towards lower beer consumption has not changed. If the autumn brings a seasonal decline in sales, discounting could return with vengeance. It is difficult to see why margins should improve until capacity is withdrawn, which makes Grand Met's decision to sell its brewing interests to Courage three years ago look increasingly well judged.</p>

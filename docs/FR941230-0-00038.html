			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission thus determined to adopt interim rules that will go into effect when the provisions of the URAA amending section 337 become effective and will remain in effect until the Commission can adopt final rules promulgated in accordance with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's authority to adopt interim rules without following all steps listed in section 553 of the APA is derived from three sources: (1) Section 335 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1335); (2) section 103 of the URAA and the Statement of Administrative Action approved by the URAA; and (3) provisions of section 553 of the APA which allow an agency to dispense with various steps in the prescribed rulemaking procedure under certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 335 of the Act authorizes the Commission ``to adopt such reasonable procedures and rules and regulations as it deems necessary to carry out its functions and duties.'' 19 U.S.C. 1335. Similarly, section 103(a) of the URAA authorizes federal agencies to ``issue such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that any provision of this Act, or amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date [of] any of the Uruguay Round Agreements entered into force with respect to the United States is appropriately implemented on such date,'' and section 103(b) of the URAA directs that ``[a]ny interim regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out any action proposed in the statement of administrative action approved under section 101 [of the URAA] to implement an agreement described in section 101(d) (7), (12), or (13) [of the URAA] be issued not later than 1 year after the date on which the agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission determined that the need for interim rules is clear in this instance. The Commission noted that the new legislation alters section 337 practice and procedure and that the existing Commission rules do not encompass certain procedures required by the new legislation. The Commission found that rulemaking was essential for the orderly administration of section 337 as amended by the new legislation. Furthermore, since the legislation was to become effective very shortly after enactment, the Commission concluded that it was imperative that implementing rules be in place on the effective date of the new statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission noted that an agency may dispense with publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking when the following circumstances exist: (1) The proposed rules are interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure or practice; or (2) the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and that finding (and the reasons therefor) are incorporated into the rules adopted by the agency. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). An agency may also dispense with the publication of a notice of final rules thirty days prior to their effective date if (1) the rules are interpretive rules of statements of policy or (2) the agency finds that ``good cause'' exists for not meeting the advance publication requirement and that finding is published along with the rule 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this instance, the Commission determined that the requisite circumstances existed for dispensing with the notice, comment, and advance publication procedure that ordinarily precedes the adoption of Commission rules. For purposes of invoking the section 553(b) exemption from publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking which solicits public comment, the Commission found that (1) the interim rules are ``agency rules of procedure or practice''; and (2) since the new legislation is projected to become effective very shortly after enactment, and the time or fact of enactment could not be predicted in advance, it clearly would be ``impracticable'' for the Commission to comply with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure. For the purpose of invoking the section 553(d)(3) exemption from publishing advance notice of the interim rules thirty days prior to their effective date, the Commission found that the fact that the new legislation is expected to become effective very shortly after enactment made such advance publication impossible and constituted ``good cause'' for the Commission not to comply with that requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

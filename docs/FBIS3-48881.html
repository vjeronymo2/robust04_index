			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], indicated at a late-night news  conference on 28 January that his party will agree to  considerable revisions to the political reform bills that would  bring them closer to the bills proposed by the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]. The chairman made his decision so the  party can avoid being isolated in the coalition alliance. It  will be difficult for pro-reformist SDPJ members, not to mention  those advocating taking cautious stance on reforming the  electoral system, to accept easing the ban on corporate  donations. However, Murayama judged: "The party could not gain  the support of voters if it were to oppose the revisions at this  time," since the bills were rejected at the upper house plenary  session due to a considerable number of party dissidents who  voted against them. But even if the party executives made such  a decision, it is likely "there will be more than 10 dissidents  opposed to the single-seat constituency system" (as stated by a  senior party official). Thus, it seems inevitable the SDPJ will  further lose its influence among the coalition parties, and  Murayama and other party executives may inevitably have to  resign.    At the news conference, Murayama said: "Since Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono have reached an  agreement following lower house Speaker Takako Doi's proposal,  the party will support this." "Regarding corporate donations,  it is disappointing we inevitably had to accept the designation  of one fund-raising body to receive such donations, but that  cannot be helped from a general standpoint," he added, as he  tried to hide his regret. Regarding his future course of  action, Murayama said: "I plan to make a progress report at the  party's general meeting of members of both houses of the Diet on  29 January and also at the Central Executive Committee meeting  which will eventually be held." He thus hinted he may resign  after taking care of necessary matters in the aftermath.    The SDPJ seems to be holding itself together through a  delicate balance between those advocating taking a cautious  stance on reforming the electoral system and the pro-reformists.  On such an understanding, Murayama sought for a way to avoid  having to accept drastic concessions on the political reform  bills that could cause the party to fall apart. At a meeting of  senior party officials held inside the Diet building in the  early hours of 28 January, Murayama indicated he wished to  prevent Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono from  holding their top-level meeting which would likely lead to the  coalition having to make considerable concessions to the LDP.  As a "third alternative," Murayama hoped to settle the  deadlocked situation by having the house speaker act as a  mediator. In this way, he resorted to "asking help from Ms. Doi  in times of trouble," although to no avail. The top-level  meeting was held, and the coalition made considerable  concessions, just as Murayama feared.    Only the "left half" of the SDPJ tried to prevent the  coalition from having to make considerable concessions on the  political reform bills. Party members in favor of reforming the  electoral system were already prepared to accept the expected  concessions, saying: "It is possible that discussion on  revisions which could supersede the coalition proposal presented  at the meeting of the joint committee of both houses of the Diet  may be held at the top-level meeting" (as stated by SDPJ  Secretary General Wataru Kubo).    Pro-reformists, led by a policy group called the  "Democrats,"  have campaigned to collect signatures for a proposal to oust  from the party those "dissident Diet members" who voted against  the political reform bills at the recent upper house plenary  session. They have thus put a check on Murayama, who has been  supported by those advocating taking a cautious stance on the  political reform bills. As of 28 January, the pro-reformists  have obtained signatures from 35 lower house members and 32  upper house members from the SDPJ, excluding cabinet ministers  and Central Executive Committee members. Senior party officials  belonging to the pro-reformist groups are confident of rallying  together a majority, saying: "The proposal to oust dissident  members and efforts to promote political reform are just the  opposite sides of the same coin. Since our party is responsible  for the bills being rejected at the upper house, it has no right  to complain about revisions to key points of the bills. There  also are many members who have not signed the proposal but  support it. There may be only 20 opponents in the lower house  at the most."    Under such circumstances, Murayama decided to accept the  revisions. However, it is inevitable that the party's status  among the coalition parties will now grow weaker.</p>

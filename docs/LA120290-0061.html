			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARING SET ON 2 PLANS TO IMPROVE HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> A public hearing on two plans dealing with the revitalization of Hollywood  Boulevard and Hollywood's chronic traffic problems is scheduled Thursday before  the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's Board of Commissioners.  </P> <P> The hearing will start at 11 a.m. in the fourth-floor boardroom at CRA  headquarters, 354 S. Spring St. in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The proposed Hollywood Boulevard District Urban Design Plan and Hollywood  Transportation Plan will become key elements in the $922-million redevelopment  of the city's blighted movie capital, CRA officials said.  </P> <P> Following the CRA hearing, the urban-design draft will be submitted to the city  Planning Commission and City Council for review and comments before CRA  commissioners consider its adoption.  </P> <P> The transportation plan, which is expected to provide the basis for a  transportation ordinance, also will be reviewed at City Hall, submitted to the  CRA board for its final approval and then sent to the City Council to be  written into law.  </P> <P> Following a public review and revision process, both plans are expected to be  ready for adoption in 1991, CRA officials said.  </P> <P> Major components of the draft transportation plan include roadway improvements,  proposals to improve traffic management and protect neighborhoods from  increased traffic intrusion, expanded and improved public transit, reduction of  adverse impacts from the proposed Metro Rail subway construction, and added  parking.  </P> <P> The proposed urban-design plan makes recommendations to enhance and preserve  the architectural and functional character of the landmark boulevard. One goal  is to encourage pedestrian use. It emphasizes residential and mixed-use  development and contains incentives aimed at rehabilitating and reusing  buildings of historical or architectural significance, according to the CRA.  </P> <P> Copies of both plans are available for review at several locations in Hollywood  and at CRA offices in downtown Los Angeles. A list of locations can be obtained  by calling the CRA Hollywood site office at (213) 461-1066, or visiting the  office at 6255 Sunset Blvd., Suite 711.  </P></p>

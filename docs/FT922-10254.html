			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: McLaughlin &amp; Harvey Pounds 5.4m loss IN THE most difficult year in its history, McLaughlin &amp; Harvey, the construction group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.4m and passed its dividend. This followed losses of Pounds 4.9m at the half-way stage, when provisions of Pounds 4.05m were made for bad debts and write-down for construction work in progress. The company said that conditions in the industry had worsened in the second half, but although further provisions had been made they were on a much reduced scale. Mr Charles Denny, chairman, said that the Northern Ireland division had secured a substantial workload this year. However, turnover in south-east England was expected to be diminished as the company was not prepared to accept work at negative margins. Sales fell to Pounds 98.4m, against Pounds 110m in 1990 when there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 727,000. Losses per share jumped from 11.6p to 80.3p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx proposes to list for trading options on the Big Cap Index, a stock index to be calculated and maintained by the Phlx. The Index will be composed of 50 of the largest and most widely-held U.S. common stock issues representing a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, technology, manufacturing, and the service industries, 49 of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), and one of which is listed on the Nasdaq National Market. The Phlx will use a capitalization-weighted methodology to calculate the Index. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See infra Section II.C., entitled ``Calculation of the Index,'' for a description of this calculation method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of December 1, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from a high of $81.8 billion to a low of $7.4 billion, with the mean and median being $25.6 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the Index was $1.3 trillion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Index ranged from a high of 2.3 billion shares to a low of 1.03 million shares. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the period between June 1, 1992 and January 31, 1994, ranged from a high of 4,179,900 shares per day to a low of 241,900 shares per day, with a mean of approximately 1,168,000 shares. For the same period, the average monthly trading volume of the stocks in the Index ranged from a high of 87,778,300 shares per month to a low of 5,081,800 shares per month, with a mean of approximately 24,523,000 shares. Finally, no one stock comprised more than 6.38 percent of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 27.62 percent of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted stock was 0.58 percent of the Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 3.05 percent of the Index's value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index will be maintained by the Phlx. The Phlx will make special adjustments to the securities comprising the Index to reflect such events as stock splits or reverse splits, spinoffs, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and similar events, upon their occurrence. In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index that is caused by delisting, merger, acquisition, or otherwise, occurs which would change the overall market character of the Index, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this Index component stock from the Index. Such Index component stock would be replaced by another Index component stock which the Exchange in its discretion believes would be compatible with the intended market character of the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If at any time less than 90 percent of the component stocks in the Index, by weight, are eligible for exchange options trading, or if the number of stocks in the Index ever increases to more than 60 or decreases to less than 40, the Exchange would submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act prior to opening any new series of options on the Index for trading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Calculation of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The representation of each security in the Index will be proportional to the security's last sale price multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding, in relation to the total market value of all of the securities in the Index. The value of the Index was set to equal 200 on March 31, 1994. As of April 5, 1994, the Index value was 193.12. The formula for calculating the Index value is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w150,d37 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN05MY94.119 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Where: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Total Capitalization = Sum of Market Values (price &times; shares outstanding) for all component securities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Divisor = The number which, when divided from the total capitalization when the Index was initially calculated (on March 31, 1994), yielded an Index value of 200 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index divisor will be adjusted for changes in the capitalization of any of the component securities resulting from mergers, acquisitions, delistings, substitutions, and other like corporate events. The formula for adjusting the divisor is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w145,d49 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN05MY94.120 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (price &times; shares outstanding) of the relevant issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

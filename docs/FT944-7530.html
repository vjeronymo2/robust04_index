			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: Slow dawning of electronic risk - Why Japan's financial services industry is still struggling with new technology In Japan's financial services industry, information technology boffins tend to work in back rooms developing computer systems to help traders and fund managers make the best of a changing investment world. Much of their work is a mystery, even to their colleagues in the trading rooms. The pace of technological development has been slower than in the US and Europe, and the pattern of computerised applications has been strongly influenced by Japan's recent boom-bust experiences. In the early 1980s, Japanese analysts and brokers relied on paper and intuition to make their decisions in what was a less sophisticated financial environment. Their counterparts in New York and London were already investing in IT. But as investment opportunities in overseas markets have increased, Japan's financial sector has tried to match competitors abroad. Nikko Securities, Japan's second largest brokerage, was one of the first into the fray. Its computer model for picking the best-performing stocks, developed jointly with Barra of California in 1986, has become the standard for Japanese equity analysis. Most investment houses still use variants of it. Its application took off as the stock market boomed in the 1980s. Brokerages making large profits from index-linked funds saw opportunities in computerised analysis. 'For brokerages, computer modelling and quantitative analysis came to mean index funds,' said Hirofumi Yagi, general manager of Nikko's investment technology research department. Computers virtually ruled the trading rooms from 1987. But faith in electronic analysis was undermined when shares tumbled in 1990 and financial houses shifted the application towards risk control. 'Brokerages began to re-evaluate what they used their models for,' says Yagi. 'We saw that our computer models could be used to control risk.' Now Nikko uses computer techniques primarily to measure risk in investment funds, to construct portfolios and for investment in overseas markets. The company says it is still a long way behind the Americans and Europeans, but it has started to hire graduates with higher degrees in mathematics and physics to boost its 100-strong research operation. Nikko is looking at neural networks and artificial intelligence for asset management and allocation. It is also trying to enhance existing models that analyse the performance of individual stocks. Japan's life insurance companies have reached similar conclusions on the use of computer models. Life insurers are some of the largest investors in Japanese financial markets and most were using computer models for portfolio risk analysis and allocation by the late 1980s. Asahi Mutual Life Insurance, Japan's third largest insurer with assets of Y10 trillion (Pounds 6.2bn), uses two types of model to support its fund managers. The first is for risk analysis based on US techniques, and the second is a locally developed product that gives the optimum weights for stock and bonds in domestic portfolios. The local model took the company around a year to develop, according to Kouichi Kurata, manager of Asahi's quantitative research division. It uses Sun workstations to crunch data on company earnings growth, valuation, historical stock price momentum and P/E ratios to pick equities, and price momentum information for domestic bonds. Kurata rates the model as quite successful, although he says it often underperforms when used on investment strategies for periods of less than six months. Kurata and his five research staff are likely to start work soon on new models for asset allocation and overseas equities. Kurata shares the view that computer trading models were overused in the boom years of the late 1980s. 'There was a lack of understanding of how these things worked at that time,' he says. 'Now we are learning how to use them properly.' Government concerns also limit the use of advanced IT in Japan. The Ministry of Finance does not forbid the trading of derivatives by law, but it has 'guidelines' that deter financial institutions from trading in the more exotic types of product such as equity-linked index swaps. The ministry, the financial industry watchdog, is worried that unregulated trading of derivatives may lead to bankruptcies, and heavy losses for investors. Japan does not yet have markets for most of these financial products, but Japanese institutional investors have set up trading operations in London and other offshore centres where they can take part. The result is that most of their best quantitative analysts are working overseas. Yagi believes the government will eventually allow investment houses to trade in new financial products locally, which may spur investment in software and hardware.</p>

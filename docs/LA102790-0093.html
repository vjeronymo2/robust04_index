			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMITH RALLIES CRESPI PAST ALEMANY, 21-10  </P> <P> Crespi High, which confined its scoring to the middle quarters Friday night,  rallied to post 21 consecutive points and defeat Alemany, 21-10, in a Mission  League football game at Alemany.  </P> <P> Alemany took a 10-0 lead on its first two possessions, but the Indian defense  could not contain Crespi quarterback Cody Smith, who threw two third-quarter  touchdown passes and completed 15 of 22 passes for 194 yards.  </P> <P> Smith was quick to call the win a team effort, however.  </P> <P> "I had all day to throw the ball; the line did a great job," he said. "And  (Ryan) Kieling and (Frank) Romano were coming back for the ball all night."  </P> <P> Kieling's 32-yard touchdown catch gave Crespi a 14-10 lead less than a minute  into the second half. Kieling caught six passes for 99 yards.  </P> <P> Romano's seven-yard touchdown grab on Crespi's next possession gave the Celts a  comfortable 21-10 lead with 4 minutes 27 seconds left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Romano finished with five catches for 73 yards.  </P> <P> Alemany wasted little time in getting on the scoreboard to start the game.  Crespi's Dereck Williams fumbled while running back the opening kickoff and  Vince Zacone fell on the loose ball at the Crespi 37.  </P> <P> It took the Indians just two plays to get into the end zone. Quarterback Adam  Romandi threw a 24-yard pass to Richard Dice, who was wide open in the left  flat.  </P> <P> From there, running back Terry Barnum took the ball into the end zone on a  13-yard dash to give Alemany a 7-0 lead 69 seconds into the game.  </P> <P> The Indians scored again on their next possession after their defense forced  Crespi to punt after three plays. Travis Russell's 38-yard field goal made it  10-0.  </P> <P> Dice, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound tight end, caught 10 passes for 116 yards. Romandi  completed 17 of 35 for 208 yards and one interception.  </P> <P> Crespi (7-1, 4-0 in league play) cut Alemany's lead to 10-7 when Torie Lee  scored on a one-yard run on the first play of the second quarter. Lee finished  with 63 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> Barnum rushed for a game-high 72 yards in 16 carries for Alemany (4-3, 3-2).  </P></p>

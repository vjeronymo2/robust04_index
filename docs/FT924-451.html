			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Banks take control of Magnet in rescue move THE MAIN bank lenders to Magnet yesterday took control of the fitted kitchens retailer in a move they said would preserve the business and protect the position of customers. The banks' decision to put Airedale Holdings, Magnet's heavily indebted holding company, into administrative receivership almost certainly means subordinated creditors and shareholders involved in the controversial Pounds 700m management buy-out in 1989 will have to write off their investments. Most of the investors and lenders have already partially done so. Bankers said customers and trade creditors would be secure. Mr John Foulkes, the Magnet chief executive who was brought in by the banks three years ago, will remain in charge. He will still receive this month a Pounds 2m bonus payment from Airedale, as agreed when he was appointed to turn around the company. GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric of the US, is the largest subordinated creditor, with Pounds 70m outstanding. It is seeking to upgrade its position through legal action. Airedale Holdings, owed an estimated Pounds 450m by the Magnet holding company, will also only retrieve a proportion of their outstanding loans. They are Bankers Trust, Standard Chartered, Hill Samuel, Bank of Scotland, Austria's Credit Anstalt, Bank of America, Continental Bank and the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan. The banks said their vehicle, Magnet Group, had purchased the Airedale subsidiary which controls the Magnet business, from the receivers, BDO Binder Hamlyn, for a sum believed to be in excess of Pounds 10m. Insiders said about Pounds 25m of the senior debt had been swapped for equity in the new vehicle. A spokesman for the Magnet Group stressed that none of the banks had injected any new money. The banks say they intend to float or sell Magnet Group within two to five years. The proceeds will be paid as a deferred consideration to Airedale's receiver, which will pay off its creditors in order of priority. The first to be paid will be the eight banks which currently control Magnet Group. Insiders said yesterday that it was highly unlikely that a sale or flotation would recoup the full Pounds 450m outstanding to senior creditors.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eli Bohadna] </F>   [Text] Over the past few years, 12 employees of the  Nuclear Research Center in Dimona developed cancer and three of  them died.    The families of 10 employees who got cancer have appealed to  the courts to order the center's management to divulge all the  material required to investigate the circumstances leading to  the illness.    The Atomic Energy Commission claims that the incidence of  cancer among reactor employees is no higher than among the  population at large.</p>

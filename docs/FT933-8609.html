			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wm Baird acquires Racke for Pounds 18m WILLIAM BAIRD, the textile manufacturer, has become Britain's third largest supplier to high street retailer Marks and Spencer with the acquisition of Richard I Racke, the ladies' wear and casual clothing company, for an initial Pounds 17.8m. The market welcomed the move and Baird's shares closed 15p higher at 275p. Mr Nicholas Webster, chief executive of Baird Textiles, the main subsidiary, said the deal would enhance earnings immediately. Racke would contribute more than four months profits to the current year. He stressed that Baird was not 'wholly dependent' on Marks and Spencer with a maximum of 30 per cent of its annual sales going to the retailer. Mr Webster said the deal would yield some cost savings: 'Like Baird, Racke's factories are located in Scotland and the north east of England. We will be looking to gain better efficiencies and factory utilisation.' Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman, said: 'Racke is a design-led business with modern, flexible production facilities. The linkage with Racke will provide significant synergy benefits and extends the company's interest in fast growing areas of ladies' casual wear.' For the year to end-December 1992 Racke made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.75m, after non-recurring charges, on turnover of Pounds 29.1m. Net assets at year-end were Pounds 4.6m, before deduction of a dividend of Pounds 4m paid this month. Consideration is being satisfied via the allotment of 683,594 shares, Pounds 14.8m in guaranteed loan notes and Pounds 1.18m cash. There is an additional profit-related consideration of up to Pounds 3m.</p>

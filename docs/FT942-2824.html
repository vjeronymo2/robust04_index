			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / The naked civic servants Britain's Tories are in trouble because they are not thinking clearly. Their curse is not the recession; nor is it inept administration. It is intellectual. They suffer from what Mr David Willetts, a backbencher with a brain, calls 'a dangerous uncertainty about the nature of modern Conservatism'. You and I might have thought that the Tories are no longer useful because they behave as two parties, in two minds about what they stand for. Mr Willetts puts it differently. 'The real problem,' he writes in a pamphlet* out today, 'is that Conservatives have become wary of relying as heavily on the free market as we appeared to do in the 1980s.' Or, as Mr Daniel Finkelstein of the Social Market Foundation observes in a foreword, 'the counter-revolution against a rationalist, abstract and universalist free market triumphalism continues to gather pace'. Tell us another one. Of course that is what is happening. Capitalism unfettered is being blamed for all our anxieties. The Thatcherite 1980s eroded the power of many respected institutions. Lady Thatcher acted on the advice of, among others, Mr Willetts himself. Much of the medicine was necessary, but there are these dratted side-effects. In the present decade we fear an unravelling of our polity, a disconcerting process whose end is not in sight. Everything is undermined - the civil service, the system of justice, the monarchy, the professions, the BBC. Mr Willetts defends market economics against these charges, but he does not exonerate 'neo-Liberals'. The trouble with them, he says, 'is that they simply think in terms of the individual economic agent without any understanding of the institutions, values and ties which are not just good in themselves but are anyway essential for any real free market to thrive'. Ah yes, but that is not what the gentleman intimated last night. 'Conservatives have made a useful alliance of convenience with the free-market neo-Liberals and fought many of the battles of the 1980s with them,' the ungrateful brute confesses this morning. He didn't say that when he was enjoying his alliance of convenience. His song now is about enduring institutions, such as the family and the nation, not to mention important lasting values, such as honesty, prudence and generosity. These are as much part of the make-up of a true Conservative as good management practice, fiscal prudence, voluntary societies, a proper legal framework - and the free market. 'The challenge facing both our main political parties,' he writes, 'is to formulate a coherent set of policies which shows that, as well as for the individual, there must be a role for collective action, but that collective action does not necessarily mean state action.' Mr Willetts has produced a robust defence of this currently apposite proposition. It is closely argued, often thought-provoking. 'Civic conservatism' could catch on, as a phrase. Alas, the substance of his thesis is undermined by what he leaves out. He clearly favours local self-determination, but dodges the issue of local government, which his lot have all but destroyed. He defends the health and education reforms, but does not address the dangers of corruption inherent in appointments from the centre, made by ministers of his party. He warns of the 'damage which enormous concentrations of economic, political and legislative power in the hands of government can do', but appears not to understand that over the past 15 years it is his, Conservative, government that has wielded that power. Someone equal to the task should be brought forward to rebut him. Enter Dr John Gray, a political theorist and, once, a fellow-traveller among neo-Liberals. Dr Gray's pamphlet**, due next week, is advertised in Mr Willetts's as 'one of a pair', which could be said of either Punch or Judy. Punch Gray will argue that the destruction of institutions and values has now gone so far as to be irreversible. We let the free market rip and now we must pay the price. There is no turning back to one-nation Toryism. The only remaining undisputed value in our society is choice, self realisation, individual advancement. You cannot recreate the traditional family, or a sense of duty and loyalty. It is too late. As Mr Willetts reminds us, Dr Gray is apt to quote Wittgenstein's remark that 'trying to repair a broken tradition is like a man trying to mend a broken spider's web with his bare hands'. It could be that a reassembled tradition is offered by Mr David Selbourne's The Principle of Duty, published this week by Sinclair-Stevenson. This is one of those essays that most of us know is important but cannot quite understand. It is described as 'the most comprehensive theory of civic society in English since Locke', and perhaps that is so. Mr Selbourne attempts to shift the basis of political theory from talk of rights to an equation, in which the duties of society to the citizen are matched by the duties of the citizen to society. As I read him, he challenges 'self realisation through unimpeded freedom of action' as an overriding goal, but also rejects the notion that welfare and work are natural rights. His principle, he tells us, 'remains in essence a principle of moral expectation  -the expectation that the citizen will respect the civic bond and voluntarily accept co-responsibility for the civic order - and of anticipatory moral disapproval if he does not'. What beats me is how the ethical expectations of any of these three contemporary political philosophers can be met in a secular society. On the other side of the Atlantic there is talk of certain values, such as 'fairness' and 'justice', as natural to the human condition. You do not need a religion to sustain them. They simply arise because, as conscious beings, we see the utility of them. This may be so, but every night the TV news suggests otherwise. We can be sure that to declare a belief in minimal government and the free market is an insufficient response to the need of most human beings to be part of a stable family in a settled community. Mr Willetts is right about that; so is Dr Gray. So, for that matter, is today's Labour party, which is another reason why the Conservatives are in such a deep hole. *Civic Conservatism, by David Willetts. **The Undoing of Conservatism, by John Gray.

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT CIA WATCHDOG BACKED  </P> <P> The Senate approved legislation to create an independent inspector general for  the CIA who would be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At  present, the inspector general is appointed by the CIA director and reports  only to him. The measure is a reaction to the impression that the agency  watchdog may not have been aggressive enough in ferreting out the CIA's role in  the Iran-Contra scandal. The bill to which the legislation is attached was  passed on a voice vote. President Bush is strongly opposed to both the Senate  measure and a different House-passed version and has threatened a veto.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GAY FESTIVAL ALTERNATIVE FALLS APART;  </P> <P> ORGANIZERS REVERT TO ORIGINAL PLAN FOR SANTA ANA PARK  </P> <P> Plans to move a gay-pride festival and parade out of a Santa Ana residential  neighborhood and into the city's Civic Center Plaza fell apart Wednesday, and  the event may now be held at its original site, Centennial Park.  </P> <P> Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, charged that the leader  of a fundamentalist Christian group never wanted the proposed compromise and  instead pressured City Manager David N. Ream to reverse his decision to allow  the group to use the plaza.  </P> <P> The Rev. Lou Sheldon, leader of the Anaheim-based California Coalition for  Traditional Values, denied pressuring Ream but said his group will oppose the  gay-pride event "right to the end." He contends that efforts and money to  organize the event are coming from outside the county and said the event is  "being forced down the throats of residents. Our life and culture are at  stake."  </P> <P> Ream said that because of Sheldon's continued public opposition, it appeared  that nothing would be accomplished by moving the event to the civic center. So  he suggested that gay-pride leaders stick to their initial plan for a two-day  festival in September in Centennial Park. The schedule includes a film  festival, historic displays, live entertainment, food and merchandise booths  and a dance pavilion.  </P> <P> Avery said her group has approval to hold the event in Centennial Park and that  is where it will be held.  </P> <P> "One can only assume that Rev. Sheldon was not seeking solutions to the issues  he thrust upon the city administration," Avery said. "One could only assume  that he wants to fan the fires of this controversy for his own personal  satisfaction and glory."  </P> <P> Avery said Ream notified her Wednesday afternoon that the group should stay  with the original park site.  </P> <P> Plans for the event were first announced in February. Conservative Christian  leaders and neighborhood residents responded with complaints, contending that  the gay group should not be allowed to hold the event in a family-oriented  park.  </P> <P> Sheldon opposed allowing the event at Centennial Park because the property sits  in the middle of a residential area. He said the civic center is an appropriate  place because it is an enclosed area and children would not be able to view the  activities.  </P> <P> But when Sheldon learned that the festival includes a gay-pride parade on  downtown streets, he replied angrily: "I want to tell you this. If they parade  on the public streets around the plaza, there will be thousands of people there  protesting."  </P> <P> Months ago, the city's Recreation and Community Services Agency issued approval  for a gathering at Centennial Park, and Avery said organizers will soon pay the  required $15,000 in city permit fees. "I will not participate in any more  negotiations," Avery insisted. "The event will be held at Centennial Park on  Sept. 9 and 10."  </P></p>

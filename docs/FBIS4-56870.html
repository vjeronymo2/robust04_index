			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 4 May (EFE) -- Commenting on a court  decision acquitting 32 presumed drug traffickers, Judge Mildred  Camero denounced on 4 May that drug trafficking has infiltrated  all levels of the Venezuelan judicial branch.    Camero, judge of the Second Trial Court, said the judicial  branch has lost credibility in Venezuela.    "Drug trafficking is everywhere and is increasingly  corrupting those institutions that were once untouchable. We  must adopt a firm position on the drug problem," she said.    Camero said there is money laundering and the legalization  of  drug-related capital in Venezuela. She added there seems to be  a heavy flow of money into the country, but a high rate of  poverty prevails, because a false economy is what really exists.    Camero had issued arrest warrants against 32 presumed drug  traffickers, including Rafael Alcantara, president of the  exchange house "Cavelba," who spent four and one-half months in  prison for alleged money laundering. Alcantara was acquitted  yesterday by Judge Luis Contreras Ramirez of the Second Trial  Court.    Alcantara said he will sue Camero for abuse of authority and  the huge losses he incurred when he had to close his business.</p>

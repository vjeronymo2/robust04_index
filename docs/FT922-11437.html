			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price Yesterday's Opec meeting in Vienna was always unlikely to produce a significant shift by the cartel. Long before it happened, the meeting had served its purpose of reassuring the market that Opec wanted to defend an oil price floor. After February's chaotic meeting in Geneva, prices first stabilised and then rose moderately, so that Brent crude has recently been hovering below Dollars 19 per barrel. While many of the smaller producers would doubtless prefer still higher prices, the Saudis remain reluctant to cut their production. This is partly because there have been tentative signs that demand is beginning to recover, partly because Russian output is still tumbling. Firmer evidence of economic recovery is unlikely to have arrived before next month's meeting to set third quarter production targets. All the same, the fundamentals look slightly more promising than for a while.</p>

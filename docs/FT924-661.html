			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / OFT to examine computer complaints THE Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it had received 'one or two' complaints about Microsoft, the world's largest microcomputer software company. But the OFT added it was too early to say whether the inquiries would lead to a full investigation. The company, which made pre-tax profits of Dollars 209m on sales of Dollars 818m in the first quarter of its current financial year, has been under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission in the US for the past 30 months over alleged uncompetitive behaviour and abuse of its dominant market position. The allegations in the UK relate to a new form of licensing agreement that Microsoft is offering manufacturers who wish to supply Microsoft's market-leading MS-DOS operating software with their machines. Under the terms of the new agreement, smaller manufacturers will be able to offer the software ready loaded on to their machines. Some are complaining that the terms of the agree-ment are onerous and commit them to paying for an MS-DOS licence for every machine they ship  - even if it uses another operating system. Mr Bill Inglis, Microsoft UK sales director, rejected the complaints, saying that neither pricing nor conditions had been altered.</p>

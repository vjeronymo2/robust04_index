			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part" of news conference by President Alfredo Cristiani </F> with unidentified reporters at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  headquarters at the Hotel Presidente in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] [Cristiani] I think we can eliminate the word  possible from the results as we have sufficient evidence of the  voting trend. We have a new president and vice president. We  are very pleased, particularly about the way in which the  Salvadoran people once again expressed their feelings  peacefully. We hope that from now on the country will be able  to do everything that is required. The political campaign is  over. I will continue working for the benefit of the Salvadoran  people.    [Unidentified reporter] What about the people not (?liking)  the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] [words  indistinct]?    [Cristiani] We must not necessarily view it as the people  either liking or disliking the FMLN. The people simply  preferred another political force. We must realize that there  are always some people who receive more votes than others and  [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Cristiani] We have had reports of some irregularities.  Generally speaking, everything went very well. There was one  incident in Pasaquina, but we do not have the details. We will  have to check that out, but I do not think it will affect the  elections.</p>

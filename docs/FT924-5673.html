			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (9): A sharper marketing message - Derby, The Toyota factor The City of Derby is slowly stirring from its slumbers. For many years, the Derby economy did reasonably well as one of the country's biggest railway engineering centres and, later, as the home of Rolls-Royce aero-engine manufacture. These were, and still are, leading employers in the area. Power engineering in the form of boilers and pressure vessels is centred on the Derby plant of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI is now part of Rolls-Royce). Engineering is complemented by printing (Bemrose Security and promotional Printing), chemicals (Courtaulds), china (Royal Crown Derby), public clocks (Smith of Derby), all with a long history in the area, and many other activities. The decision of Toyota to locate its first European car assembly plant just outside the city took most people by surprise, even those in the city council who had worked hard at luring the prized outsider to the area. City leaders were jerked into action. Could Derby capitalise on the Toyota factor? What did it need, to project itself to other potential inward investors? What were the consequences of just going on as before? The Conservative-led council, prompted partly by local property developers keen to get the city on the move, appointed consultants Braxton Associates - who had worked for Toyota - to summarise Derby's strengths and weaknesses, and recommend a strategy. Braxton, reporting in autumn 1990, identified a city with little recognition outside Derbyshire and the East Midlands; small - population static at nearly 218,000; more dependent on manufacturing than the country as a whole  -36.4 per cent against a national average of 25.5 per cent; few good office sites; a rather shabby city centre; roads in need of improvement; and no academic institution above a college of higher education. In Derby's favour, however, were its central location, fairly good 'quality of life', relatively low labour costs, and plenty of land available for development. Two years on, and Derby is changing. The college has become a university. The roads programme which will improve access to the MI, and upgrading of the A38 south Derby bypass, which goes past the new Toyota plant, have started, or are ready to begin. Pedestrianisation has made the city centre more welcoming, even if its shops are festooned with out-of-season sales, and some have closed. Not visible, but equally worthwhile, is a greater sense of the leading players in Derby pulling together more than they did. They include the council - still Conservative, although now with a wafer-thin majority - the business community, the Training and Enterprise Council, and the county council, which is Labour-led, but now less stridently left-wing. All of the big employers have shed labour. Rolls-Royce is nearly 2,000 down in two years, employment at Brel - now part of Asea Brown Boveri - reflects the low rate of investment in Britain's railways. Officials hope that the worst is over, that it will be more of a trickle than a cascade in the months to come. Male unemployment in the city was 15.5 per cent in July 1992, up by 20 per cent in 12 months. Better-planned marketing of the city to outsiders by the city council and the business community had been recommended by the consultants. The proposed relocation of the Home Office Prison Service to Derby, which would have brought about 1,000 civil servants to the area and another 1,000 or so jobs to be filled locally, was a significant step in that direction. But in the summer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, announced that the Pounds 70m project would not be going ahead. Derby's best hope now is that it will be in line for other civil service relocations from London, although downward rents and climbing unemployment in the south-east have cut the cost benefits of other places. The precise effect of Toyota on Derby cannot be assessed yet. This will have to wait until the Impact Study, commissioned by the government, completes its work. An earlier estimate put the possible employment generation at about 3,000 in addition to the 1,700 jobs by 1994 created by the first phase of the plant, which goes into production in December. The second phase is scheduled for 1997, when employment would expand to 3,000. Component makers have not been queueing up to locate close to the plant. Derby's easy access to suppliers in the West Midlands, and improving links to East Coast ports, were obvious clinching points for the Japanese manufacturer's decision to go to the area in the first place. The proportion of recruits to work in the assembly plant who will come from the city is not known. The only crude indicator is that about half of the applicants for the first tranche of jobs came from within 15 miles of the plant. Not in doubt is that Toyota has sharpened the marketing message that Derby plans to launch early next year. The city is more sure that it can come out from under the shadow of its bigger neighbours in the region.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals ahead 19% Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and specialist chemicals manufacturer, shrugged off the effects of depressed prices and intense competition by yesterday reporting a 19 per cent increase in half year profits. The Leeds-based group saw pre-tax profits climb to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 6.02m) as its heavy investment programme in new equipment and increased capacity began to pay off. The improvement - achieved on turnover of Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 55.6m) in the six months to June 30 - prompted a 29p rise in the share price to 421p. Mr Phillip Lowe, chairman, said the group had overcome fragile trading conditions in the UK and continental Europe by 'producing and selling more at lower price levels'. More than Pounds 13m was spent last year to increase capacity, and Mr Lowe said a further Pounds 12m would be invested before the current year end. The investment programme, funded with cash left over from last year's Pounds 24.3m rights issue and banking facilities, is expected to centre on Yorkshire Colours, the UK dyestuffs division, where the group plans to increase capacity by 25 per cent. Although the division increased turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, price cuts averaging 5 per cent left its operating profits virtually unchanged at Pounds 3.82m. That flat performance was offset by improved results at Yorkshire Speciality Products - the tanning agents manufacturer - and Yorkshire Australia, the overseas dyes sub-sidiary. They proved more resilient to price pressures and increased operating profits to Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 1.25m) and Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.36m) respectively. Operating profits fell, however, to Pounds 447,000 (Pounds 513,000) at Yorkshire Americas after the group decided to withdraw its distribution operations for US chemical manufacturers in favour of using its own products. Mr Lowe said there signs of an upturn in Europe and forecast steady growth in Australia and the Asia Pacific region. 'We shall continue to offset the pressure on margins by further improvements in efficiency, and by increased production and sales volumes,' Mr Lowe added. Earnings per share rose to 11.2p (9.8p), and the interim dividend is increased to 2.75p (2.6p).</p>

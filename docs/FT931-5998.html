			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: FMC to buy Siemens offshoot KONGSBERG OFFSHORE, the Norwegian-based supplier of undersea oil and gas production systems, is to be acquired by FMC Corporation of the US. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Siemens of Norway, the offshoot of the German group which owns Kongsberg, expects the deal to be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year. FMC, which supplies chemicals and equipment to the oil, gas and agriculture industries, said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the underwater systems market. The US group has co-operated with Kongsberg Offshore since 1987, with the latter supplying electronic controls for FMC-produced underwater oil and gas production equipment. Siemens Norway said undersea production technology was not a core business area of the group, which had decided to concentrate on its core businesses. The deal is subject to approval by the two companies' boards of directors and Norwegian authorities.</p>

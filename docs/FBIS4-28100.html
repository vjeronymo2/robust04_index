			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan will extend emergency  aid of 4 million dollars to the World Food Program (WFP) to help  people in Sudan facing serious starvation from civil war and  drought, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday [7 June].    The money will be used to cover the WFP's shortage of funds  to transport food to the southern region of Sudan, where some  2.2 million people are said to be confronted with imminent  starvation, according to the ministry.    The region's agricultural production has greatly  deteriorated  as a result of changeable weather, insects and the country's  civil war which broke out in 1983.    The main mode of transportation for food is by air because  the region lacks law and order and has poor infrastructure such  as roads. But a shortage of funds has forced the suspension of  two of the three possible air routes.    According to a survey conducted by the WFP, the death rate  per day in southern Sudan stands at 11.2 people per 1,000, a  "major catastrophe" by the standards of the World Health  Organization (WHO), the ministry said.    Japan suspended extending official development assistance to  Sudan in October 1992 due to the African nation's violation of  human rights.</p>

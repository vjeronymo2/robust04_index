			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / G7 summit squares up to jobs crisis Finance and employment ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations gathered in Detroit last night for a two-day brainstorming session on tackling the unemployment that besets their economies. Although US officials insist there will be no final communique or any attempt at formal policy co-ordination, President Bill Clinton wants to use the conference conclusions as the basis for the July G7 summit in Naples to agree on a jobs plan. For Mr Clinton, who will open the conference this morning, the meeting provides an opportunity to focus on themes central to his administration's programme, after weeks of being dogged by the Whitewater affair. The ramifications of Mr Clinton's investment in this Arkansas property venture in the 1980s brought about the resignation a week ago of Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the White House counsel, and on Friday dragged White House and Treasury officials before a grand jury for questioning. Ministers from other G7 countries expect the Detroit meeting to agree on the need for labour market flexibility, education and training investment, and open trade. Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, says the employment issue is critically important for all G7 countries. 'If you asked on what criteria these democratically elected governments were going to be judged by their electorates, the answer was jobs. If they don't succeed in achieving that, they are very unlikely to achieve whatever else they want to achieve,' Mr Summers said last week. But the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus, through lower interest rates or tax cuts, should play in jobs policy. US officials do not want to turn the Detroit meeting into a shouting match with Germany's Bundesbank, but they continue to argue that Europe needs further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation. Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, says she is yet to be convinced that Europe's unemployment problems are as much explained by structural problems, such as rigid labour market rules, as her European counterparts argue. 'Between 1986 and 1990 the European G7 countries added about 5m jobs and the unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6.9 per cent. Since 1990 the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9.2 per cent and the level of employment has gone down by about 2m,' said Ms Tyson. 'Unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved a lot between 1986 and 1990 and then got worse again, a lot of that deterioration has to be cyclical.' With Whitewater still dominating conversation in Washington, Mr Lloyd Cutler, the veteran lawyer brought in as the new White House counsel to help clean up the mess, yesterday promised 'a good deal of disclosure'. But he said he thought the investigation would uncover little in the way of wrongdoing. Rare consensus, Page 4 Michael Prowse, Page 13</p>

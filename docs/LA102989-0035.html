			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC SPECIAL;  </P> <P> THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH  </P> <P> The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the  music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a  third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for  even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for  consumers' attention.  </P> <P>  These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial  interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush.  The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop  music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to  rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob  Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt,  Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks  (Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked).  </P> <P>  The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one  is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input.  </P> <P>  The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin,  Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna,  Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don  Waller.  </P> <P> ** 1/2 GRATEFUL DEAD, "Built To Last,"Arista. The best songs are the three  valedictory numbers sung and co-written by Jerry Garcia. When it's Uncle  Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when he steps back and lets  the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides into something less durable.  (Boehm)  </P> <P> *** BILLY JOEL, "Storm Front,"Columbia. He's obnoxious, derivative, almost  always playing to the grandstand with oversized gestures. But that can be  overlooked when the craftsmanship and tunefulness are as strong as they are  here. A rock-oriented treat for Joel's fans, and maybe even a guilty pleasure  for those who think of him as an obnoxious, derivative grandstander. (Boehm)  </P> <P> ** 1/2 ELTON JOHN, "Sleeping With the Past,"MCA. The album is dedicated by John  and Bernie Taupin to soul pioneers, but it's no juicy soul update. Instead,  it's a savvy piece of smooth pop craft, with warm singing, consistently  hummable melodies and as strong a sequence of tunes as John has put together  since his mid-'70s days as a dominant force on the pop charts. (Boehm)  </P> <P> ** 1/2 THOMPSON TWINS, "Big Trash,"Red Eye/Warner Bros. While nothing here is  as good as the Twins' mid-'80s hits, "Big Trash" does serve as a credible  comeback album. Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie don't have anything deep or  original to say, and they are fairly shameless about stealing from such sources  as the Doors and Talking Heads, but they offer more humor and vitality than  most of the dance-rock competition. (Boehm)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coming Up:  </P> <P> Other albums scheduled for release in the coming weeks include:  </P> <P> ABC, Art of Noise, Basia, Bobby Brown (dance mixes), Club Nouveau, Phil  Collins, Erasure, Gipsy Kings, Ofra Haza, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Joan Jett,  Quincy Jones, Kid Creole, Kris Kristofferson, Yngwie Malsteem, Roches,  Shinehead, Keith Sweat, Tiffany, the Time, Jody Watley (dance mixes),  Whitesnake and Peter Wolf.  </P></p>

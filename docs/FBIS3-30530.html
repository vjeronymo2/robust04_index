			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cezary Gmyz: "The Church Is Regaining Its </F> Property"]    [Text] Of the 180,000 hectares of farmland nationalized  from 1945 onwards, the church has so far regained 16,000. The  Property Commission dealing with this issue has already  initiated proceedings concerning half the compensation claims  filed by church authorities.    The return of church property is taking place according to  the provisions of the law "on the relationship of the state with  the Catholic Church."    The Property Commission has so far received 2,985  applications for the return of church property. Although the  deadline for the receipt of such applications expired on 31  December 1992, fresh applications are still being received by  the Commission, but they will not be considered.    By the end of 1993, the Commission had initiated proceedings  on 1,560 claims, over 50 percent of the total received. Some  684 claims have been settled, 573 of them in favor of the  church, in other words in favor of a parish, diocese, monastery,  or church foundation. But the size of the property regained by  the church is often less than the amount claimed by it.    Until now, the church authorities have regained 16,000  hectares of farmland and forest land. After the war, the church  lost about 130,000 hectares of land out of the 180,000 it held  at the time, and that does not include prewar territory east of  the Bug River, nor parts of Poland that formerly belonged to  Germany. Of its so-called built-up property, the church has  regained slightly less than 200 hectares, the largest of which  are the monastery in Henrykow and the church estate in Frombork.    Even though the law allows the payment of compensation for  lost land out of the state treasury, not once has the Property  Commission applied this solution. That does not mean that the  church has not received any money. In some cases, instead of  the actual property, church authorities received a financial  settlement from a local government body or other corporate user  of the property in question. Such settlements total 2 billion  zlotys so far.    Some 111 church claims for compensation have been rejected  or  postponed, mainly in cases where the return of church property  would have been in breach with the law.    Boguslaw Skreta and Dr. Jan Chmiel of the Property  Commission  have assured me that in reaching a decision the Commission takes  care that neither the interests of the church nor those of the  state are jeopardized.    The Property Commission was set up in 1989. It consists of  12 members, six on the government side and six on the church  side. Four members constitute the so-called adjudicating body,  which decides on the outcome of a case by means of a vote. The  Commission's meetings take the form of a court hearing, at which  each side presents documentary evidence and employs legal  arguments. The Commission tries to reach an amicable settlement.  It may restore the original property to the church, or it can  offer the church an alternative property. There is no appeal  against the Commission's rulings.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark loses recent gains THE D-MARK lost more of its recent gains against European currencies yesterday, as the foreign exchange market's fears about European Monetary Union (Emu) temporarily faded away, writes James Blitz. Sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo regained some of the ground that they had lost to the German currency in the wake of Denmark's rejection of Emu one week ago. Both the Italian lira and the French franc also recovered ground, but by not quite as much as the other high-yielding currencies. It is unlikely that any of these recoveries marked a significant shift away from the market's perception that Emu is in serious trouble. Instead, analysts are putting yesterday's D-Mark's losses down to profit-taking. 'Nothing has changed as far as the Maastricht worries are concerned,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp, in London. 'It is only short term position taking that has caused the D-Mark to suffer.' Sterling made the best gains of the day, rising  1/2 a pfennig to close at DM2.9200. It also ended a little more relaxed in the European Monetary System grid, finishing the day third from bottom. Worries over the Spanish peseta also faded a little as the currency ended the day at Pta62.91 to the D-Mark from a previous close of Pta62.98. The Italian lira was a little stronger at Lira755.8 to the D-Mark from a previous close of 756.4. But it was still at the bottom of the EMS grid and its long term prospects continue to worry the market now that Emu is in such big difficulties. The dollar appreciated slightly against the German currency at the start of European trading, and reached a high of around DM1.6005. But it slid down in the afternoon on the back of soft US housing completion figures. These dropped 8.5 per cent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.026m. The market will probably wait for the arrival of today's figures for May producer prices and retail sales before deciding whether to invest further in the US currency. The current forecast is for a rise of 0.3 per cent in the producer prices and a 0.7 per cent rise in May sales after a 0.9 per cent gain in April. Last night, the dollar closed in Europe at DM1.5930 from a previous close of DM1.5900. In late American trading, it was up to DM1.5940. The Japanese yen was weaker against the D-Mark as the market took a gloomy view of the possible contents of tomorrow's Tankan quarterly business survey, issued by the Bank of Japan. Dealers fear that the survey might be weak enough to persuade the BoJ to weaken policy. The D-Mark ended the day at Y80.03 from a previous close of Y80.27.</p>

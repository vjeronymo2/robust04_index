			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] China says that the U.S. Government should take  concrete action to fulfill its promise to support China's  rejoining GATT. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made  this remark on Thursday [14 April] in Beijing during the  ministry's weekly press conference. Li Peichun was there:    [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] Spokesman Shen Guofang's  remarks came just after the Chinese and American trade  negotiators reportedly encountered difficulty in their talks on  China's re-entry into GATT in Morocco. Although the specific  difficulty has yet to emerge, the Chinese representative has  reiterated that trade should not be mixed up with social issues.  Meanwhile, U.S. trade negotiator Mickey Kantor said that China  has to make more efforts before it is accepted by the  multilateral trade agreement.    [Shen Guofang in Chinese] The U.S. Government has promised  on several ocassions its firm support for China's re-entry into  GATT, we hope that... [fades into Li Peichun's comments]    [Li Peichun] The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said  Beijing has noticed the importance of the U.S. in GATT, but he  has stressed that the U.S. is merely one of the 105 contracting  countries and should not be equated to the international body  itself.    Shen Guofang said the U.S. Government has repeated its  promise to support China's re-entry, and it should make real  efforts to materialize its commitments. China's re-entry is one  of the main issues of the GATT ministerial meeting in Morocco.    On another subject, spokesman Shen Guofang criticized a  report published on Wednesday by the House of Commons on  London's ties with Beijing. Shen Guofang said the part  concerning the Hong Kong issue disregards facts and defends  Governor Chris Patten's erroneous approach to his political  reform. Commenting on London's desire to hold talks with China  on human rights, which is expressed in the same report, Shen  Guofang said that Beijing is willing to talk with any country,  but on the basis of equality and mutual respect.    Finally, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said China hopes  that  relations along the Taiwan Straits will not be adversely  affected by the Qiandao Lake case, in which 24 Taiwan tourists  died in Zhejiang last month. Reacting to Taiwan's suspension of  various exchanges with the mainland, Shen Guofang said closer  links along the Taiwan Straits are in the interest of all  Chinese. He added Beijing will listen to proposals from Taiwan  in handling the case.    For China Radio International, I am Li Peichuan. [end  recording]</p>

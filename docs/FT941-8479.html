			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Luxury for the not-so-old and stately: The world's elite hotels continue to attract commercial interest The moneyed guests who pass through the marble lobbies and ankle-deep carpets of the world's luxury hotels will have felt a tremor of apprehension at the news that the Aga Khan's sumptuously appointed Ciga group of Italy is to pass into the hands of the Sheraton chain. How such venerable establishments as the Grand in Rome and the Danieli in Venice will fare as part of an international chain is as yet unclear. So is the question of how Sheraton can make a financial success of a deal for which it is paying L900bn (Pounds 365m) - a sum that has astonished the industry. Forte, the UK hotels group which together with international financier Mr George Soros offered Pounds 270m for Ciga, conceded defeat when it heard how much Sheraton was prepared to pay for a company which lost L195.43bn last year. Mr Alan Hopper, chairman of leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster, said: 'We just cannot see the commercial logic of the Sheraton offer.' Many in the industry wonder whether Sheraton, which is owned by ITT of the US, was simply seduced by the prospect of adding prestigious Ciga hotels to its portfolio. ITT says it will not talk about Ciga until the deal is finalised, which it expects to take a few weeks. Other hoteliers have found the allure of the world's elite establishments too great to resist. Lord Forte, founder of Forte, spent much of the 1980s in a battle to buy the Savoy group, which owns properties including the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught in London. Forte ended up with a majority of Savoy's shares but a minority of voting shares and continues to express a desire to take full control. It is not just the commercial logic of owning Ciga that can be questioned, however. Some industry observers wonder why anyone would want to own luxury hotels at all. With companies insisting on tighter control of travel costs, many executives are avoiding the best-known luxury properties and opting instead for more modest hotel accommodation. A senior manager at one of London's most prestigious establishments says it does not matter what discounts or special deals he offers guests: the hotel's name is so redolent of expensive living that no cost-cutting campaign could remain credible if word got round a company that its chief executive was staying there. While other luxury hotel groups have done better than Ciga, few have turned in strong financial performances recently. The Savoy group announced a Pounds 1.75m pre-tax loss for the first half of 1993. Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotel operator, saw net earnings for the first three-quarters of 1993 fall to CDollars 5.2m (Pounds 2.65m) compared with CDollars 6.1m the previous year. The company said it planned to sell six hotels, including the Four Seasons, formerly the Inn on the Park, in London, to reduce its CDollars 350m debt. And Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel company, announced a 2 per cent profits increase to Dollars 19.5m for the first half of last year, which was below expectations. Some of the luxury hotels' weaknesses are cyclical and attributable to the recession in North America and Europe. Mr Roger Garland, Four Seasons executive vice-president, says: 'It's been a miserable market for three years. The Gulf war disrupted business travel and it didn't come back quickly.' Mr Giles Shepard, the Savoy's managing director, adds that it is more difficult to trim a luxury hotel's operating costs than those of cheaper establishments. He says: 'Providing services such as valeting, beds being turned down and curtains being drawn all costs money and needs people to do it.' Luxury hotels cannot cut staffing levels or refurbishment costs without losing guests. Mr Shepard adds: 'In an ideal world, when you walk into a hotel room you want to feel you are the first person to use it.' The question for luxury hotel operators is whether guests will return and rates rise as the world economy improves, or whether companies' travel cost-cutting has become permanent. Mr Garland says there are already signs of guests returning. Four Seasons, the world's biggest luxury hotel operator, saw such an improvement in North American business last year that it increased room rates by up to 12 per cent. The group's hotels in Asia have also enjoyed an improved performance. Mr Hopper of Pannell Kerr Forster says that, in spite of the Savoy's troubles, business is also looking up for London's luxury hotels, although continental European cities are still depressed. He says that London's luxury hotels made Pounds 30,000 operating profit per available room last year, up 25 per cent on 1992. London luxury hotel occupancy was 67 per cent last year - 8 percentage points up on 1992. However, achieved room rates - the prices guests actually paid - fell to Pounds 178 a night from Pounds 184 in 1992. But the crucial measure for hoteliers is the revenue divided by the total number of rooms, whether occupied or not. In London's luxury hotels, this increased last year to Pounds 120 a night from Pounds 109 the year before. Mr Hopper says the average for all London hotels was only Pounds 55. Mr Richard Lovell, executive vice-president for northern Europe and Asia at business travel agents Wagonlit, says there will always be guests who want luxury. He adds, however, that the luxury market will be far more competitive than in the 1980s and hotels will have to provide something special to succeed. Ms Jill Kluge, Mandarin Oriental's group communications director, says her company has introduced exclusive business floors at its hotels in Singapore, Manila and Jakarta. These have their own check-in and check-out facilities, lounges providing complimentary food throughout the day, and facsimile machines in every bedroom as a matter of course rather than on request. In spite of the difficult conditions faced by operators in Europe, Mr Garland believes it needs additional luxury hotels - but of a different sort. Too many European hotels are old, stately and badly run, he says. 'The problem is that the customers are not old and stately. They are aggressive, hard-working people who need faxes that work and their suits cleaned overnight and sandwiches at 2am.'</p>

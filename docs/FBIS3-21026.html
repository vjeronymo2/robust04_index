			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Paris--Two ESA astronauts will represent Europe this  year in space, by flying with Americans and Russians this fall  aboard NASA shuttles and the Mir station.    For the European Space Agency (ESA), the two flights are a  way of showing that the world's third-ranking space power,  Europe, fully intends to defend its place in space exploration,  and that its personnel and technologies qualify it to  participate in building the international space station R-Alpha.    Europe's collaboration with Russia will begin with the first  departure of an ESA astronaut--either the Spaniard Pedro Duque  or the German Ulf Merbold--aboard the Soyuz-TM-20 bound for the  Mir station. The flight, which will probably take place in  October, will be similar to Jean-Francois Clervoy's on Columbia  and will help give European astronauts' the broadest possible  experience living in space.    The designated astronaut will be named in May or June and  will spend a month aboard the Mir with the Russians. In 1995,  another European, either Thomas Reiter or the Swede Christer  Fuglesang, will spend 135 days on the Mir and will even leave  the station for a walk in space.    These EuroMir-94 and -95 missions were planned before the  final decision to shelve the West's space station Freedom, but  after the Hermes spaceplane was "scrapped."    Jean-Francois Clervoy will be the fifth ESA astronaut, after  Ulf Merbold (Germany, two flights, in 1983 and 1992), Wubbo  Ockels (the Netherlands, 1985), Claude Nicollier (Switzerland,  1992 and 1993), and Dirk Frimout (Belgium, 1992), to fly.    Clervoy will be a mission specialist, which means his  responsibilities will equal those of Nicollier when he  jettisoned the EURECA platform two years ago, or recovered the  Hubble Space Telescope last December using the Endeavor  shuttle's robot arm.    Currently there are no plans for another European astronaut  to fly on American shuttles. But with the Italian Maurizio Cheli  training as a mission specialist in Houston, surely there will  be again.  <H5>  Flights of ESA Astronauts or Associates </H5>   Ulf Merbold:    - 1st flight from 28/11 to 8/12/1983, first Spacelab    flight, on Columbia;    - 2nd flight from 22/01 to 30/01/1992 on Discovery.    Wubbo Ockels:    - from 30/10 to 06/11/1985 during the Spacelab-D1 flight  (Germany) on the Challenger.    Dirk Frimout:    - from 24/03 to 02/04/1992 on Atlantis.    Claude Nicollier:    - 1st flight from 31/07 to 08/08/1992 on the Endeavor    (EURECA mission);    - 2nd flight from 2 to 13/12/93, on the Endeavor (Hubble  mission).</p>

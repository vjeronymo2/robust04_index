			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] According to a report from the Business Economic  Department, the Commerce Ministry has received complaints from  local manufacturers of dumping of hydrogen peroxide by India.  After an investigation, it was found that the product was  exported to Thailand at a price lower than the price charged  consumers in India. In retaliation and in order to offset the  impact, the Commerce Ministry has made hydrogen peroxide  originating in India subject to a surcharge of 30 percent of FOB  [freight on board]. The special surcharge has been in effect  since 14 June. Importers of hydrogen peroxide are required to  declare their surcharge payments using application forms which  are available at the Foreign Trade Department. [Passage omitted]</p>

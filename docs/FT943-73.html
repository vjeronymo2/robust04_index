			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA falls sharply British Airways, beset by air fare competition, received a further jolt yesterday with the news that a major US trade investment was deferring a quarterly dividend. The culprit is USAir, 25 per cent owned by BA, which is passing a quarterly convertible preference payment at a cost to BA of Pounds 16m. BA slid 16 to 344p in 7.7m volume. The fear among traders is that USAir's dividend announcement is the prelude to what could, conceivably, prove to be even more dramatic news given the parlous condition of the North American airlines business. The suspicion is growing that BA's supposed springboard into the US market could shortly involve the UK airline in heavy write-offs of its Dollars 400m investment. Hotels group Forte was one of a handful of stocks that managed to resist the market slide, as dealers celebrated a better than expected set of interim figures. The shares closed 3 1/2 ahead at 222p after the group reported a profits rise to Pounds 60m, from Pounds 37m a year earlier. There was heavy trading in the stock and volume jumped to 11m. UBS, the company's broker, was said to have been an aggressive buyer of the shares. Relief at the lack of a pred-icted rights issue also boosted sentiment. Several brokers raised full-year profits expectations by a modest amount. Kleinwort Benson, which increased its full-year estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 135m, called the figures 'encouraging'. Analysts at BZW lifted their forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 126m, but they remain sellers of the stock because 'the cash flow recovery will not be as strong as earnings recovery, thus dividend growth is likely to be constrained'. Redland blew hot and cold, initially racing up to 529p after the better than expected interim figures but then going into reverse and closing a net 29 off at 493p as analysts emerged from the post-results meeting with news of higher tax charges, resulting from higher German corporate taxes and exhaustion of capital allowances. SG Warburg shares suffered on two counts, with worries about possible losses in international bond and equity markets affecting sentiment and Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage, said to have been heavily involved in the stock via an OTC option. Warburg settled 19 1/2 lower at 681p.</p>

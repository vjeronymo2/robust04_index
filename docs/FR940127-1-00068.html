			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting by physicians and other health care professionals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adverse experiences associated with the administration of most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products is strictly voluntary. As the agency's primary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adverse event information, this voluntary reporting system has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revealed significant adverse events and drug interactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with products that could not be identified during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preapproval testing. There are many instances of important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health actions that have been the direct or indirect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of information provided through voluntary reporting by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual health professionals. The removal of the antibiotic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temafloxacin (Omniflox) from the market, research concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> danger of concurrent use of the antihistamine terfenadine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Seldane) when taken with either the antifungal ketoconazole or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the antibiotic erythromycin, and the warning labeling requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for latex products are just a few examples that demonstrate why  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA strongly encourages voluntary reporting by physicians and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other health professionals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a major effort to increase voluntary reporting of serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse events by health professionals, FDA recently announced a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new reporting system called MEDWATCH. This program is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it easier for health care providers to report serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse events and to clarify what type of information should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported. The agency believes that preserving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality of the identities of the patient and of third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties involved with an adverse event report, such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician or others identified in the report, is essential to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success of the adverse event reporting system. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the substantive content of adverse event reports is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 552, FDA regulations have long protected the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality of the patient, reporter, and institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in the adverse event (&sect;20.111 (21 CFR 20.111)). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, which have been in place since 1974, have enabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA to obtain voluntary reports of adverse events and to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the confidentiality of information that could identify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although these regulations protect the release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidential information by FDA, they do not protect the release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the same information contained in reports held by drug,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biologic, and device manufacturers. Various State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments have laws, regulations, or rules that permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure of this information in litigation, through discovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or otherwise. Recently, plaintiffs in several product liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and medical malpractice cases have attempted to discover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identities of reporters and patients named in adverse event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports in the possession of the product manufacturers. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, this same information is protected from public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure when it is contained in similar or identical reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to FDA and in FDA's possession. To avoid jeopardizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the willingness of the health care community to make reports of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse events to manufacturers and FDA, the agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a similar confidentiality rule is needed to prevent disclosure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats of disclosure of the identity of reporters or subjects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse event reports in the possession of manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure meaningful reporting under the new MEDWATCH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, FDA believes that additional steps must be taken to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguard the confidentiality of the identities of those involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with adverse event reports. State and local laws, regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or rules that permit or require the disclosure of patient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporters' identities interfere with the agency's objective of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to prohibit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disclosure of such information contained in reports held by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA, as provided currently, and similar information held by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. The proposal also would preempt State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laws, regulations, or rules that permit or require such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure. Disclosure would be permitted if both the reporter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the person identified in the report consent to disclosure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if there is a discovery order in malpractice litigation between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subject of the report and the reporter of the adverse event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. FDA Adverse Event Reporting Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Drug and Non-Vaccine Biological Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA receives postmarketing adverse drug reaction (ADR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports directly from manufacturers, health professionals, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers. An adverse drug or biologic experience means any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse event associated with the use of the product in humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the drug or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biologic. Included are events that occur in the course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional use, from drug overdose (whether intentional or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental), from drug abuse, from drug withdrawal, and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of an expected pharmacological action (&sect;314.80 (21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 314.80(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA regulations require drug manufacturers to report to FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious and unexpected adverse reactions and increased frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of serious expected reactions. These reports must be filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a specific time after the manufacturer receives the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Manufacturers are also required to submit periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports of all adverse reactions (&sect;314.80). FDA has proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar adverse experience reporting requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers of licensed biological products (March 29, 1990, 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 11611) and expects to publish final regulations in the near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future. The reporting of these adverse reactions by health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals to either manufacturers or FDA, however, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strictly voluntary. (Health care providers are required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report certain adverse events associated with specific vaccines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.B.3 of this document.) The agency is also preparing a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to require adverse drug reaction reporting by manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nonprescription drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

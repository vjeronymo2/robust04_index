Specifically, the MOU assigns responsibility for carrying out animal damage management (ADM) primarily for protection of livestock, including compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the issuance of records of decision to APHIS. Under the current MOU, BLM and APHIS divide ADM responsibilities, with BLM preparing site-specific environmental analyses. The proposed MOU recognizes the State's responsibilities for management of resident wildlife populations and the need for communication among the parties, the States, and other affected agencies such as the Forest Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of this MOU will place responsibilities where they logically belong and streamline the conduct of ADM. It will allow BLM to focus money and time on its own responsibilities and initiatives and allow APHIS to better carry out its responsibilities under the Animal Damage Control Act in compliance with NEPA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this draft MOU must be submitted in writing by October 4, 1994.

This MOU pursues both those goals by consolidating responsibilities for ADM in APHIS, thereby avoiding redundancy and expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C. section 1701  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The Secretary, in managing the public lands, is subject to other applicable law, such as the Animal Damage Control Act. The FLPMA also allows the Secretary to permit other Federal agencies to use public lands through cooperative agreements. 43 U.S.C. 1732. The FLPMA does not enlarge or diminish the responsibility and authority of the States for management of fish and resident wildlife. 43 U.S.C. 1737. However, the Secretary may designate areas of the public lands where hunting and fishing are not allowed for reasons of ``public safety, administration or compliance with provisions of applicable law.'' 43 U.S.C. 1732(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Animal Damage Control Act, 7 U.S.C. section 426, 426(b), gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to conduct campaigns for the destruction or control of predatory animals on public and private lands. 7 U.S.C. 426, 426(b). It also provides that the Secretary may cooperate with public agencies, States and others. Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this MOU is to consolidate program responsibility for ADM for protection of livestock with APHIS. Currently, APHIS creates an ADM plan and submits it to BLM. The BLM is then responsible for preparing environmental analyses (EA's) and records of decision authorizing APHIS's action on BLM lands. This dual-agency process is cumbersome for both agencies, unnecessary, and expensive. It places BLM in the position of analyzing the environmental consequences of another agency's action on public lands and issuing a record of decision to allow APHIS's action to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in 1991 and extending through 1993, many administrative appeals were filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals challenging the legal sufficiency of BLM's NEPA documentation on the APHIS's activities. In response, BLM issued an Instruction Memorandum in 1993 (IM No. 93-199), ordering all field offices to allow full, programmatic animal damage control only where NEPA documentation was complete and up to date. (The directive did not affect case-by-case emergency control, based on proof of kill.) The BLM continues to work on updating every District's EA and to deal with administrative appeals and Federal Court litigation on both sides of the issue for a program it does not administer. This process is an inefficient way of carrying out APHIS's mandate under the Animal Damage Control Act. By transferring NEPA compliance and decisionmaking authority to the action agency, administrative efficiency will be enhanced, and costs reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following is the draft MOU on which the public may comment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mike Dombeck,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

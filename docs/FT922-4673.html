			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sharp futures drop STERLING futures contracts traded at considerably lower levels yesterday as uncertainty swept the money markets about the future of European Monetary Union. The decision of the Danish people not to participate in EMU caused uncertainty in all sterling futures trading, as dealers questioned the principle of monetary convergence in the long term and the strength of sterling in the immediate future. Fears that EMU is in danger encouraged foreign exchange traders to invest heavily in the D-Mark, and pushed sterling briefly below DM2.92 in the afternoon. Believing that a weaker pound may hinder the possibility of a base rate cut in the Autumn, futures traders pushed contracts down. Trading in an 11-tick range, the September contract closed at 90.25, having closed at 90.35 the previous night. Yesterday's closing price suggests that the market believes that the 3-month interbank rate in September will be at 9.75 per cent. The December contract was even more heavily affected. Trading in a 12-tick range, it ended the day at 90.48 from a previous close of 90.60. That suggests that the market believes that 3-month Libor at the end of the year will be at 9.52 per cent. Rates in the cash markets were less heavily affected, because the Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 100m. The Bank did not operate at all during the day. As a result, money remained cheap, with most players able to square their books at an overnight rate of 8 per cent. That cheap rate fed through to the short periods. 1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent,  1/16 per cent softer than the previous night's close. However, 3-month money, a key indicator of the way the markets think rates are moving, ended at 10 1/16 per cent, up  1/16 on the previous close. The cash market in Danish krone was strongly affected by the referendum decision. Denmark raised the 14-day Certificate of Deposit rate from 9.85 per cent to 10.5 per cent. In Germany, call money eased slightly after the Bundesbank made a generous allocation of funds in this week's tender for repurchase funds. A net DM8.3bn flowed into the market, and call money eased to 9.65 per cent from 9.70.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull privatisation launched The French government yesterday launched the privatisation of Groupe Bull, inviting candidates to submit offers to buy stakes in the loss-making computer group. A joint statement from the economy ministry and the industry ministry said the government's objective was to give Bull a 'private, coherent and stable' shareholding structure which would allow it to strengthen its industrial strategy. The French government, which holds 76 per cent of Bull's shares, is seeking to reduce its stake to a minority by early next year. According to the statement, the principal of the operation is to establish a majority shareholder or several significant shareholders, each holding at least 10 per cent of Bull's shares. So-called 'partner-shareholders', seeking an investment of less than 10 per cent, would also be permitted. The sale is expected to be the most difficult so far in the government's plan to sell 21 public-sector companies. Unlike previous privatisations the computer group is loss-making. In the past three years it has incurred losses totalling more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.8bn) and has required subsidies of FFr11.1bn since the beginning of 1993. However, losses have been curbed through a restructuring and cost-cutting plan by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman in October last year. Under the terms of the offer, the potential investors should apply for a stake in the company by December 9. The planned privatisation has already drawn interest from potential investors. NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull, has said it wants to increase its stake, while AT&amp;T of the US is planning a joint bid for a stake of up to 40 per cent with CSEE, the French electronics group. IBM of the US, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull, has declined to comment on its intentions. The operation is also expected to prove sensitive, pitting rival bids against each other and involving a possible shift in strategy for the computer company. The proposal from CSEE and AT&amp;T, for example, may involve the shift towards systems integration and information services. AT&amp;T wants to invest in Bull to gain access to the French telecommunications market. France Telecom, which holds 17 per cent of Bull, has a monopoly on fixed-line services. Under the terms of the application procedure, details of which will be announced today, candidates will submit proposals which include their financing plans and industrial strategies. A first selection will then be made after consultation with the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of public sector assets. The remaining candidates will then have six weeks to proceed with a detailed examination of Bull's condition, after which they may make an irrevocable offer.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Seoul doubts N-bomb claim Officials in South Korea yesterday expressed strong doubts about a claim by a senior North Korean defector that his country possesses five nuclear bombs, John Burton reports from Seoul. They said there was no evidence to support the claim by Mr Kang Myong-do, the son-in-law of the North Korean prime minister. Seoul says North Korea has the plutonium but has been unable to convert it into bombs. Similiar assessments were offered by officials in Washington and Tokyo, although they did not totally dismiss Mr Kang's information.</p>

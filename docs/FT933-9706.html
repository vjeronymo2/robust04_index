			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Millionaires in Monte Miraculously, dealers are reporting sales at Monte Carlo's tenth Biennale des Antiquaires, held in Monaco's International Sporting Club until August 15. Inaugurated by Prince Rainier, Prince Albert and a crush of very sunburnt Riviera socialites this year's event is the biggest ever with 30 dealers, seven from outside France, who have brought the very best the international trade has to offer. Flemish painting socialist Monica Kruch from Paris is showing several outstanding works - the first flower painting by Jan Brueghel the elder to have come on to the market in many years, a mystically luminous 'Road to Emmaus' by Paul Bril and 'Solomon and the Queen of Sheba' by Frans Francken. colouring. Mario Bellini from Florence, a friend of the late Paul Getty, is showing Italian primitives alongside his personal collection of 16th century Italian animal bronzes and a curiously elongated Venus by 15th century artist Paolo Schiavo. Giovanni Sarti from London also has Italian primitives prices at around FFrs1m including a stark crucifixion by the 15th century Bolognese artist Pietro di Giovanni Lianori, and three rare grisaille panels of sea monsters by a contemporary of Mantegna's. Michael Goedhuis from London, at Monte Carlo for the first time, is showing ancient Chinese bronzes including two particularly fine wine containers - a second century BC Han period, and a 3rd to 4th century BC Fang Hu model. Resident Monaco dealers Ribolzi boast a pair of solid gold Puiforcat dinner plates for FFrs200,000 and subtler objects such as a splendid rare lion aquamanile from northern Germany circa 1200 and a late 18th century inkstand made in the royal porcelain factory of Naples.</p>

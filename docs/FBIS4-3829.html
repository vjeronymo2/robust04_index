As a result, in the past three months, 12 major coastal  provinces, autonomous regions and cities cracked 2,348 cases of  smuggling, involving goods worth 830 million yuan.    Compared with the fourth quarter of last year, the first  quarter of this year dropped 23 percent in smuggling cases  smashed and decreased by 34 percent in the total value concerned.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Dragoslav Avramovic Speaks With </F> Montenegrin Energy Officials: 19 Million Dinars for Power Plant  Repairs"]    [Text] The governor requested a precise specification  of costs; national income must double over the coming months;  demand that petroleum be exempted from all duty.    Niksic, 6 Jun--In order to perform essential repairs on  Montenegrin electric power plants--at Perucica, Pivo, and  Pljevlja--19 million dinars must be secured in the shortest  term. The electric power industry does not have the money, and  if all the deposits in Montenegrin banks were devoted to the  repairs, the electric power installations would barely be put in  order. But the demand that prices be increased will not be  popular with the government.    The governor of the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia], Prof.  Dragoslav Avramovic, listened politely to energy officials and,  wielding figures, he "slightly lowered" their demands as he  went. Because the repairs must be made to the installations,  Avramovic and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Krunoslav  Vukcevic said that the energy officials should precisely  calculate the costs and send those figures to the government and  governor so that this work, which cannot wait, is done solidly  and on time.    The energy officials also mentioned the possibility of  paying  off debts by increasing the price of electricity. However,  Avramovic said that his program looked at the infrastructure as  a whole, but that it is now obvious that there are major price  imbalances in this area. Although prices of electric power are  low (one-third of the world price), the prices of  telecommunication services and railroad transportation are  equally above prices in the world, and something must be done in  that sector.    One of the sore spots in Montenegrin economic life is  petroleum. Energy officials are seeking to secure from the  national energy pool the quantity of petroleum provided for  Montenegro, while "Jugopetrol" director Nikola Dragomanovic put  forward the demand that petroleum derivatives, which we import  at prices two to five times higher than the price on the world  market, be exempted from customs duty and that the market for  petroleum in our country be free.    "If we got rid of customs duty, excise taxes, and controls  over petroleum, what would happen then?" the governor asked.    "The supply would probably be better, with lower prices,"  Dragomanovic responded.    In response the comment by some of the participants in the  meeting that food is expensive in our country, more expensive  than in the world, Avramovic said that those calculations are  not accurate, which does not mean that food cannot be cheaper.    There was also discussion of wages, whereby the governor  said  that it is inexplicable that wages have risen enormously for  some structures in Serbia, even though they are still low  compared to world levels.</p>

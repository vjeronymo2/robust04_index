			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: Hang loose, old boy Phew, thank God that's over. Except it isn't. The Scott inquiry into arms-for-Iraq - already more than a year old - still has a week's oral testimony in May and then must be written up by Scott himself; no finer way of ruining a summer. Meanwhile, hacks covering the story are producing a necktie for distribution to various Whitehall and government officials. It will feature the Roman numeral III, representing the guideline the government allegedly breached; a serpent, signifying Whitehall; and the motto 'distorted, wild, prejudiced', words used by Sir Robin Butler, head of Britain's civil service, to describe the British media's reporting of the Scott inquiry. Since when was a tie judged a suitably satirical device? A very masculine gadget, its choice hints rather strongly of the old-school-tie cohabitation so often prevailing between accusing hack and accused minister. Very cosy.</p>

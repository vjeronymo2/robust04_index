			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Alberta's premier wields his axe: Budget pain is being inflicted but nobody is crying out yet Mr Ralph Klein is succeeding where most politicians have failed. Determined to balance Alberta's budget within the next two years, the premier of the oil-rich Canadian province is chopping government programmes left, right and centre. His government has closed thousands of hospital beds, eliminated almost two-thirds of the province's school boards, and turned to private enterprise to run services as diverse as liquor stores, lawn-mowing and the issue of birth certificates. What is most remarkable, however, is that the deeper the cuts bite, the more popular Mr Klein becomes. According to an opinion poll published in late August, 61 per cent of Albertans approve of the Conservative government's performance, up from 51 per cent four months earlier. Mr Klein, a forthright man who acknowledges putting his foot in his mouth at times, says the secret of his success is that 'we're keeping promises'. 'People might not like what we're doing, but they all say at least: 'You're keeping your promise',' he said. Mr Mike Percy, finance spokesman for the opposition Liberals, concedes that Mr Klein has struck the right chord: 'It's the temper of the times here,' Mr Percy says. 'People won't believe you unless you say it hurts.' Mr Klein, who was a Calgary TV reporter before entering politics, at first won voters' confidence by putting himself and other politicians at the front of the firing line. Soon after taking over as premier in December 1992, he abolished the provincial legislature's pension plan. Mr Klein says he has sacrificed almost CDollars 60,000 (Pounds 28,300) in accrued pension benefits himself. He has also given up his CDollars 5,000 a year allowance for clothing and other expenses. Cabinet members took a 5 per cent pay cut. The pain now being inflicted on Albertans is largely the result of earlier governments' misplaced optimism about the course of oil and natural gas prices. Alberta prospered when oil prices rose sharply in the late 1970s. By 1985, the province had accumulated a surplus of almost CDollars 12bn. Oil royalties were squirrelled away in a Heritage Savings Fund, to be used for long-term infrastructure investments. But the previous government failed to trim its sails when oil and gas prices fell. Resource revenues plummeted from almost CDollars 5bn in the fiscal year to March 1986 to less than CDollars 2bn the following year, and then stagnated. At the same time government spending grew by an annual average of 5.1 per cent in the five years to 1992. The budget surplus turned into a deficit, reaching CDollars 3.8bn last year. Alberta's debt is expected to rise to CDollars 32bn at the end of the current fiscal year, in effect mortgaging the Heritage Fund. Alberta has now lost its coveted triple-A credit rating. A carefully-timed government commission, comprised mainly of business leaders, laid the ground for the cuts early last year by warning that 'many of the present systems were designed to serve the province during an era of abundance, and the current times of economic difficulty necessitate major changes'. Mr Klein looks easily set to reach his target of a balanced budget by 1996/97. The government recently forecast the current fiscal year's shortfall at CDollars 1.35bn, or CDollars 205m lower than the 1994/95 budget estimate. Unexpectedly strong oil and gas revenues make up the bulk of the windfall. But programme spending cuts, projected at 20 per cent over four years, remain on target. Mr Klein has promised to reach that target without raising taxes. Alberta remains the only Canadian province without a retail sales tax. But the government has sharply boosted revenues from public user fees. For example, public funding of kindergartens has been cut from 100 per cent to 58 per cent. The austerity drive has drawn loud protests from some groups, notably the elderly, who worry that healthcare standards are slipping, and trade unions. But they are a diffuse group. 'He's got a coherent strategy, and there's no coherent opposition,' says Professor Alan Tupper, a political scientist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Domestic and foreign investors however, are cheering. Moody's, the credit-rating agency, noted in a recent report that Alberta's deficit-reduction plan is the most aggressive among Canada's 10 provinces. The provincial treasurer recently brought together a high-level group of academics, public-service officials, business leaders and unionists to chart a course for fiscal policy once the balanced-budget target has been achieved. A generous tax cut is a near-certainty before the next provincial election in three or four years' time. 'There will be something,' Mr Klein says. But he insists that the government will be careful not to create the expectation that 'we're just going to start throwing money at things again'.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Germany escaping stranglehold Sir, Your stimulating leading article, 'In Germany, it may get worse' (February 15), seems to portray the looming labour dispute in west German metal engineering as a threat to a possible recovery. However, it could also be seen as the birth pangs of a most beneficial revolution. The labour market is finally escaping the traditional stranglehold of big labour organisations and big business. The profound change is driven by west Germany's deepest postwar recession, a structural shift from industry to less unionised services and a growing awareness of the disaster that Germany's corporatist organisations caused in east Germany with excessive wage accords. This January's pilot agreement in the west German chemicals sector not only delivered an effective wage increase of 2 percentage points below current inflation. It did away with more labour market taboos than even the most ardent optimists had hoped for. The 35-40 hour corridor for the working week, more leeway from bargaining at company level, and lower wages for long-term unemployed re-entering the labour market are among the achievements. Even IG Metall, once the most powerful union in the non-communist world, has yielded a lot. It may still try to fight a lamentable rearguard action against the trend. But if it indeed took an open conflict to clear the way for a more flexible and efficient labour market, the economy should emerge stronger rather than weaker from it - apart, of course, from a short-term dip in a quarterly gross domestic product growth rate. And even if, for whatever reason, the final settlement in metal engineering would not deliver the needed extra flexibility, the change would most likely come about nonetheless. The present stream of companies leaving the employers' association and striking their own tailor-made deals with the workforce would probably swell to a flood, making the outdated central bargaining ritual more and more obsolete.

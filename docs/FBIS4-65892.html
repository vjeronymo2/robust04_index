			<p>BFN     [Text] Oslo, May 25 (AFP) -- A top level Norwegian Foreign  Ministry advisor on the Middle East was asked to become UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's deputy, the Foreign  Ministry said here Wednesday [25 May].    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvar Havnen said Butrus-Ghali  requested Monday that Terje Roed Larsen become his deputy on  Middle Eastern issues.    "Mr. Butrus-Ghali contacted us last night about this offer  and the Norwegian government expresses its support for Larsen's  candidacy," Havnen said.    Larsen, 47, has accepted the offer, the Norwegian new agency  NTB reported from Washington.    He was scheduled to meet Wednesday with officials at UN  headquarters in New York, Havnen said.    "We see this as a recognition of the Norwegian Government's  role in the peace process in the Middle East," he added.    Larsen is head of the Oslo-based Institute of Applied Social  Sciences, which was instrumental in setting up the first secret  meetings between Israeli and the PLO in Norway in 1993.    The meetings led to the accord signed September, 13, 1993,  granting Palestinians limited autonomy in the occupied  territories.    Larsen, a sociologist, was advisor on Middle East issues to  the late Foreign Minister Johan Joergen [Holst], one of the  architects of the accord.    He is currently advisor to Larsen's successor, Bjoern Tore  Godal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Furayh Abu-Middayn, minister  of justice in the Palestinian National Authority [PNA], has  stated that it is important to have legal control over the  Palestinian streets and enforce the sovereignty of the law in  all spheres, including traffic regulations, respect for private  property, and other affairs. He pointed out that this is  necessary after the past four years, during which there was a  clear lack of control.    In an exclusive interview with MENA in Gaza, Abu-Middayn  said  that this control has actually begun and that after the  Palestinian police arrived, carrying weapons in public has  disappeared, apart from those who possess licensed arms.    He explained that another new phenomenon has been the  holding  of the Egyptian-curriculum general secondary education  examination in a legal manner without cheating and other  irregularities that had plagued past examinations.    Concerning education in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said it  has always been linked with Egypt. He pointed out that the  golden age of Gaza education was in the 1950's and 1960's when  Palestinian graduates of Egyptian universities spread in the  world bearing their degrees. He said 1,500 Palestinians  graduated annually from those universities.    He asserted that Egypt has always remained committed to the  maintenance of high standards of education in Gaza and the  curricula taught were Egyptian curricula. He explained that  with regard to the general secondary education examination,  Egypt handles the entire supervisory process and corrects the  examination papers.    Abu-Middayn said that this educational link with Egypt has  strengthened the bond with that fraternal country, a sentiment  that is clearly felt in Gaza's streets. He noted that this  cultural link strengthened Palestinian steadfastness during the  years of occupation.    Abu-Middayn told MENA that during this week's general  education examination in Gaza, the Palestinian police oversaw  the examination committees in an outsider supervisory capacity  and this ended the cheating that used to take place in the past  few years.    Asked what laws were being used in Gaza now, the PNA justice  minister said that the central law now used is the Constitution  of 1962, which separates the executive, judicial, and  legislative powers and lays down the legal provisions of these  powers. He noted that the Constitution also details the  provisions of individual liberties. He explained that this  Constitution, which was drawn up during the late President Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir's tenure, is still in force. He also said there  are Palestinian laws dating back to Ottoman times but the major  part of the laws were enacted during the British mandate.    Furayh Abu-Middayn said that during the Egyptian  administration of the Gaza Strip these laws were amended to meet  the wishes of the Palestinians. The legislation was based upon  the desires of the Palestinians.    He clarified that the effort exerted during the 18 years of  Palestinian administration was destroyed completely during the  past 27 years because Israel passed 1,200 military orders that  govern all aspects of daily life, from security restrictions  down to educational controls. These orders included all aspects  of daily life, which was "the most dangerous issue confronting  us."    The minister of justice in the PNA said that the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement did not in fact cancel all these  orders. He noted that there are texts stipulating, for example,  that if there are any differences regarding certain issues, they  will be referred to legislators of the highest order, and so on.    Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will not abide by the  military orders except as they benefit the Palestinian people  because there are trade and material dealings that have taken  place during the past 27 years which we cannot erase with the  stroke of a pen.    To illustrate this point, he gave the example of the  securities and traffic law which was being applied in the Gaza  Strip. He pointed out that these progressive laws could be  reformulated and made use of once again.    He said that the laws we will respect, as stipulated by the  agreement, are those laws dealing with external security and the  security of the settlements. He clarified that these are things  they will not interfere in. However, contrary to this point, we  will cancel all laws that go against the wishes of our people,  in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids  the occupier of a land from enforcing any laws except for those  dealing with security only.    He gave the example of the value added tax Israel enforced  on  the Gazans amounting to 17 percent on all goods. He affirmed  that the PNA will cancel any laws violating the Geneva  Convention and going against the interests of our people.    Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We are also reorganizing the  judiciary so that it would become an independent and sovereign  entity that does not submit to any organization because this is  the only guarantee that could safeguard us against deviations.    The Palestinian justice minister added in his interview with  MENA: We are also reorganizing and arranging the general  prosecution and adding new branches to it. He said: We might  turn to legal experts from sisterly Egypt for help in this task  because until 5 June 1967 the prosecutor general was from Egypt.    The Palestinian official said: We will also try to avoid the  state security and military court. But there have been cases of  spying. We are not talking about agents who have stopped their  activities, but about those who opt to continue cooperating with  the Israelis. We will not allow that at all.    He said there are those who are putting pressure on us to  form a military court. But President 'Arafat and I personally  prefer to refer such cases to a civilian court.    He clarified that this is a sensitive topic that we will  address with wisdom. However, we consider the continuation of  cases of spying for Israel a violation of the peace agreements.    He affirmed that we will condemn any individual who causes  the death of a Palestinian citizen, because such an individual  will be working for a third party.    Continuing his remarks in the interview, PNA Minister of  Justice Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will begin from scratch.  We need narcotics laboratories to analyze drugs so that all  criminals will be brought to justice. We also need to conduct  post-mortem examinations in homicides cases. We still do not  have archives for fingerprints and criminal evidence. We need a  lot of things.    Abu-Middayn added: We have enough Palestinian  qualifications, but we are still short of capabilities and  material prerequisites. We are still just beginning and we are  short of everything. We have been completely linked to Israel  during its 27 years of occupation. There is no infrastructure in  Gaza and we must be self-sufficient or we will remain tied down  by the occupation. Europe and the United States must help us to  face the circumstances.    In his interview, Abu-Middayn said that Europe was rebuilt  after World War II with the Marshall Plan. The West established  Israel here. When [Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir  nationalized the Suez Canal [in 1956], the French supplied  Israel with atomic capabilities. But we are only demanding  bread.    Abu-Middayn asserted that the Europeans must understand that  the Palestinian people are determined to make the Middle East  peace a success. He added: However, we do not need peace on  paper or artificial security. We need genuine peace. The new  Middle East cannot be built at the expense of our rights. The  world must help the Palestinians so that peace will be achieved  in the region. We want to close the file on this cause.    Abu-Middayn added: We are trying to tell the Israelis to  leave the Palestinians alone so that new relations can be set  up. We have offered 65,000 martyrs over the past 45 years.  Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria also offered thousands of  martyrs. This file must be closed.    Abu-Middayn pointed out that the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement is not the dream of the Palestinian people. It is  also unfair. But it is the best that we can get.    As regards the agents collaborating with Israel, the  Palestinian official noted that those who ceased their  cooperation with Israel after the signing of the agreement in  Washington on 13 September will not be sought. He denied that  there are 22,000 agents. We know all the agents, he added.  Abu-Middayn said that anyone who kills Palestinians will be  hanged. He was referring to the operation in which six  Palestinians were killed on 25 April.    Concluding his interview with MENA, Abu-Middayn said that  Israel's agents will not enter Gaza. Israel will not be able to  carry out operations with the aim of driving a wedge between the  organizations because communications continue among them.</p>

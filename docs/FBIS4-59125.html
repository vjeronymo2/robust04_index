			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian negotiator Jamil al-Tarifi says the  Palestine National Authority has signed new temporary contracts  with the Israeli water, electricity, and communications  companies to continue their services in Gaza and Jericho until  the PLO takes over. He says he expects the takeover to take  place on 17 May.    According to al-Tarifi, the Palestinian authority has  already  signed contracts with large foreign companies to supply the  self-rule areas with the services they need. A Canadian company  will supply Gaza with 100 megawatts of electricity from a ship  off the Gaza coast, and after two months, the company will  double its supply.    Jericho will continue to receive electricity from Israel  until an alternative becomes available. The Meqorot water  company has also promised to continue supplying water until an  alternative is found.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 7 May cites  al-Tarifi as announcing that "a French company by the name of  (Marbec) will supply the Strip with fuel and build a small oil  refinery."]</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mitsukoshi plunges into the red at halfway MITSUKOSHI, an up-market Japanese department store, posted its first interim pre-tax loss in nine years as an increasing number of consumers turned away from luxury goods.

Ito-Yokado expects a 5.1 per cent fall in full-year pre-tax profits to Y92.5bn, on a 1.9 per cent rise in sales to Y1,540bn. Seven-Eleven, a convenience store operator and a subsidiary of Ito-Yokado, said its half-year pre-tax profit rose 2.6 per cent to Y46.2bn. Sales rose 7.5 per cent to Y98.6bn due to the launch of a record 224 stores during the first half. After-tax profit rose 4.4 per cent to Y25.2bn.

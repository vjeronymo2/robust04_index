			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 11 May--"A new, complicated era will begin in  bilateral relations after the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Germany this August." Russian President Boris Yeltsin made this  statement today before starting talks with German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl.    The Russian opposition has been saying that "Germany will  turn away from Russia completely after the withdrawal of Russian  troops and will not help with its reforms, as it had been doing  very actively in recent years under the leadership of Helmut  Kohl." Answering this opposition, Yeltsin said: "I trust Helmut  Kohl--his high moral standards, his decency, and his great  political experience. An era of national reconciliation between  two countries and two peoples--of Russia and Germany--will  begin."    The Russian leader stressed that Russia wanted to be a full  member of all European organizations. He reminded that Germany  would be chair of the leading bodies of the European Union  beginning 1 July 1994. "And, of course, we hope for support  from Germany for Russia's participation in all of the European  and international organizations," Yeltsin said. He especially  stressed the importance of Russia as a European state. "Russia  is a European country, and one should not forget this fact,"  the president said.    "During the course of today's hopefully peaceful, normal,  human, but, of course, political and principled talks, I am sure  that we will achieve together with my friend Helmut Kohl a full  understanding and will settle the problems that we are facing  today. They are there, and it is futile to make a secret of  them," the president noted.</p>

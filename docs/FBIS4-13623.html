			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Saddam Husayn marking the "liberation" </F> of al-Faw Peninsula during the war with Iran; date and place not  given--live or recorded]    [Text] Many happy returns on this al-Faw anniversary, and  on other occasions and victories, God willing, for you, your  people, your families.    This is life. It is difficult in terms of its changes and  circumstances. It is exactly like two pictures of two meetings.  The first was when the Iranians occupied al-Faw and the second  is now. We might add a third meeting that came after al-Faw  liberation. When we view life in terms of these three pictures,  we will clearly see the meaning of the results, based on  difficult circumstances, or the difficult changes in the  difficult march. The history of individuals is the same. In  their history, people may rise, fall, or succeed, based on basic  factors, the most important of which are will and wisdom. What  choice will his resolve and what he thinks is right lead him to?  Which of the choices drawn in the sands, in military terms, is  suitable or is required by the results that are based, or should  be based on it?    This is the situation. Peoples and nations pass through  periods of forgetfulness or weakness due to this forgetfulness.  Thus, opportunities pass before them in the figurative, or  theoretical sense, but they do not come to grips with these  opportunities. Naturally, such a situation will not enable them  to create opportunities. If opportunities are passing in front  of them and they do not grab them, then it would be more  appropriate to say that they are unable to create opportunities.    Other peoples, in other circumstances, for other reasons, in  other conditions, create opportunities, come to grips with them,  and develop them to their end results [ma'alah].    This also applies to life, the life of man in times of war,  and even during peace time. But, of course, the war times are  more difficult.    Let us take the two pictures: The news received that the  enemy had occupied al-Faw, and the picture of summoning the  commanders and discussing al-Faw's liberation, whether in the  bilateral meeting with the commanders of the III and VII Army  Corps, or in the General Command meeting after the comrades had  arrived from the north at the time -- the late General 'Adnan  Khayrallah and his comrades. If we take these three pictures,  or two pictures, and ask each one about his impressions of the  first, second, and third pictures, we will be able to draw  correct conclusions about the correct stand at difficult  circumstances, about correct inferences in difficult times,  about the ability to remain levelheaded at difficult times. The  difficult circumstances are relative and they come at war time.  They affect different individuals in different ways; there are  degrees. We find them also at times of peace. However, they  manifest themselves in a relative manner in what an individual  regards as pressure on his powers and resources, his will, or  his ability to crystallize a stand at a given time.    Al-Faw's lessons are numerous. In every angle, we have more  than one lesson. We have seen in people pictures inspired in us  by the three meetings we mentioned about al-Faw. Some said  al-Faw was lost and would never return, but some were convinced  that it would return. The enemies were eager to emphasize a  factor that is not characteristic of Arabs, but was forced upon  them, namely, that territory taken from the Arabs does not  return, that Arab armies have no spirit for counterattack or for  returning to attack in better circumstances to liberate  territory. Zionism was working in this direction in all its  activities and with all its resources and influence, not only  inside the occupied territory in beloved Palestine but wherever  Zionism existed in the world as well.    You are also aware of the skepticism, circumstances, and  obstacles that attempted to hinder the will of the Arab combat  troops as they launched their offensive against the occupying  Zionist entity on the Golan and Suez fronts. Therefore, there  is no absolute framework for what is possible and what is not  possible. In all cases, when factors of direct impact are taken  into account, we must consider willpower to be of paramount  importance.    Let us first determine what is it that you deem possible or  not possible. Do you just view things as possible or not  possible? What have you done to make the impossible possible? I  am not referring to what you should do just technically, but  also to what you should do spiritually, mentally, and humanly in  your relations with your own selves and with others. When we  come into live interaction with all those factors, then the  impossible becomes a question of relativity, either awaiting  other factors to ripen as a result of a programmed, intentional  action, or the emergence of other factors that are unavailable  at that particular point of time. However, with effort and  willpower, other factors can be made available. Then, the  impossible can become possible.    When we recall the liberation of al-Faw, which is rightly  described as the land of sacrifice and the gate of the great  victory, then you will be able to associate every example we  have cited with your memories of that battle: The psychological  situation under certain circumstances, and how it turned under a  different situation, different circumstances, and in view of  other possibilities.    For the first time, an Arab territory was restored from  foreign troops, except for the battles of liberation against the  past traditional colonialists. Those liberation battles were  different. But, the liberation of al-Faw was the first time in  modern Arab history that an Arab state liberated its usurped  territory from another state without political bargains and  without half-way measures.    Was the mastermind of the al-Faw liberation deluded, as some  said? Did you hire foreign armies? Did you hire or seek the  assistance of foreign brains? The answer to all those questions  is clear.    Hence, we can say that no army, in a long war, can claim  that  the opposite army, under all circumstances, is unable to achieve  successes on certain fronts. This is because it is always  possible for an army's superiority to be affected by other  factors. Such factors, under certain difficult circumstances  and perhaps lack of alertness, can revert to the interest of the  enemy.    Therefore, under difficult circumstances, commanders should  not belittle any field action, combat front, or move, no matter  how small. This is because it is possible that these small  moves and steps will add up to the final result. However, all  these factors must not make the commander forget that the final  and strategic result must be in his interest. This should be  the basis for dealing with all details on the front. In this  sense, the front does not have to be exclusively understood as a  military front. It can be extended to include other domains of  life, such as politics, economics, and social and security  affairs. However, this applies more to the front in the  military sense of the word.    What matters is the final result. Commanders may win a  certain battle, but their final goal should be to win the war.    The other lesson is that it is unfair to say that Arabs are  unable to restore their territory. They are capable of doing so  -- mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. More aptly, this  applies to the Iraqis, both Arabs and non-Arabs, for they have  deep roots in the Arab nation's ancient cultural heritage and  history.    The Arab nation is deep-rooted, and so are the Iraqi  people. I don't mean deep-rooted in the sense of being ancient.  I am speaking about virtuous traits being handed down from one  generation to the next. It is natural that Iraq's patriotism be  as deep as its history is long. I am not saying it is deeper  than others' patriotism, because I am not into drawing  comparisons here, except if others claim their patriotism is  deeper than that of the Iraqis. To these we would say no. As  is known, and as we always say, in human terms, each Iraqi is  equal to any other human being. An Iraqi is equal to an Asian,  African, European, American, or Australian. However, if anyone  should say that an individual of his country equals two Iraqis,  we would say no to him. For us, an Iraqi is equal to 10. If he  should say that his country's area is greater than that of Iraq  and so claim the right of attacking us, we would say no to him.  Iraq is four times the size of your country, and our 20 million  people are superior to your people. I am not talking about  people in the abstract sense of the word, because we do not  differentiate between peoples. What I mean to say is that  Iraqis are above drawing such comparisons. Even if one  belonging to a nation of 1 billion people were to boast about  it, we would tell him that our people number that many.  However, in view of our judging things from a principled  standpoint, we view the human value of an Iraqi as being equal  to that of, say, a Ugandan. One is judged better or worse by  action and thought.    Iraqis and Arabs have been judged unfairly when it was said  that once they lost territory they were unable to retrieve it.  However, al-Faw marked the beginning -- the resounding and  undoubted start. There was a contest of wills there; one of them  prevailed and the result was the liberation of a city without  politics or any outside factors coming into play. Victories  then followed in rapid succession. The goal was to take back  every inch of territory that had been captured by aggressors.  Eventually all lost territory was taken back and the will of  aggression was crushed. The aggressors admitted in a written  message that they had been vanquished and wished they would not  have been alive to witness that moment on the front.    That is how things turned out. I am not being boastful or  arrogant. God forbid. I am saying this to underline the  inherited positive traits of the Iraqi people -- traits that  react to the deep-rootedness of the Arabs in spiritual and  civilized terms.    In Iraqi folklore, it is said that a true horseman will not  lose his camel. The al-Faw story is now well known to all  Iraqis. The Iraqis experienced al-Faw when it was taken away  from them and then when it was restored. They picture the  commanders who joined the battle to liberate it. Some of you  witnessed the occupation and the liberation of al-Faw. Others  in this great army and your comrades in arms went through the  same experience. The entire picture may not have been shown on  television screens as clearly as you experienced it firsthand.  A fighter may encounter circumstances in which he laughs and  broods alternately. At times, he may be utterly depressed; at  other times, he may feel on top of the world. These two states  of mind may be experienced in the span of just of one hour, half  an hour, a quarter of an hour, or even 10 or five minutes,  marking the interval between a telephone call and another from  the command to his position. However, the time between the  telephone call which he viewed as upsetting and the one which he  viewed as comforting is measured by his capacity to grasp the  reasons why the first call was upsetting and the second  cheering. The length of the telephone conversation should be  measured by the extent of his determination to turn the annoying  state into a comforting one. One cannot instill faith in others  unless one is faithful oneself, and a commander cannot possibly  influence his companions unless he can influence himself first.  What I mean to say is that to the extent that one is  self-assured, one can effect a breakthrough, achieve victory,  bring about a good outcome, and ward off evil with sheer  willpower.    Therefore, if we look at the al-Faw battle from a military  perspective, we can learn several lessons. We can also go in  depth into the political, social, and psychological aspects of  this.    When we talk about prosperity, I note that all people want  to  become prosperous. History, however, does not deal with the  manifestations of prosperity sought by weak people, but deals  with prosperous work in a certain era. Work, in accordance with  the Arab and Islamic concept, means jihad. They do not say how  many discotheques were built in Baghdad at a certain time, and  nobody says how many dresses Zubaydah, wife of Harun al-Rashid  [caliph of Baghdad between 786-809], had. However, they all  proudly remember how she warned Harun al-Rashid against  al-Baramikah [an influential family which sought to overthrow  Harun al-Rashid].    The storehouses of the Muslims in the early age were not  full  of rice or vegetable oil, but they are still remembered with  longing for that time. The are still remembered by all people  -- rich and poor, full and starving. The humanity of the  satiated is dead while the stomach of the starving is dead. The  man with a dead stomach, however, is better than a man without  humanity.    When we say that wellbeing is coming we first mean wellbeing  of the soul. We believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe  and know that our comrades and brothers in responsibility  believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe and know that the  leadership in Iraq is capable of effecting changes in the  overall situation if the pressure increases and the situation  becomes vulnerable. If such a thing were to happen, the  leadership would also be capable of introducing new factors into  the picture, factors that could absorb any additional elements  that might be brought into play by the enemy.    Therefore, wellbeing is coming. Wellbeing is coming not  because the evil ones intend to lift the evil, but because we  know that the fist that seizes the sword by its blade will be  forced to ease the grip when the owner of the sword pulls the  sword forcefully. The enemies of Iraq are like a man seizing  the sword with its blade and when the owner of the sword pulls  the sword forcefully, the adversary will find himself compelled  to either release his grip around the sword or risk losing his  fingers. In either case, he will have to release the sword.    We created a scandal for the enemies of mankind, the likes  of  which have never been seen before. We exposed their lies,  deception, and weakness. Their weakness dominates their power  because their weakness is ethical, spiritual, and human while  their strength is based on technology. You saw what technology  did three days ago? Is this not technological superiority --  AWACS planes flying all the time, and fixed radars with two  planes on their monitors? What did they do? Two of their  fighter planes hit these two aircraft. You saw the premeditated  goal. Some suspect radio stations and press statements  immediately claimed that Iraqi fighter planes had downed the two  U.S. helicopters.    It is likely that if it were not for the fact that there  were  other nationals besides the Americans on the planes and the fear  that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, they would  have taken the media allegations as grounds to level charges  against Iraq as they have done in the past and continue to do  now.    I heard young people around me saying that they hope  something evil will happen to the aggressors. I say to them  that whatever you expect or imagine, you cannot concoct what  Almighty God concocts for the evil ones and infidels. Almighty  God has something planned that will teach a lesson to all  mankind, not just the two parties directly involved in this  thing.    After I heard about this incident, I was briefed on a  memorandum from the Foreign Ministry. They summoned our  ambassador there in New York. He was summoned by the three  countries that are in charge of the so-called safehaven in the  Autonomous Region. They summoned our ambassador and told him:  We hope there will be no confrontation and we do not intend a  confrontation or provocation. He asked: What is the subject of  this meeting then? They said: We want to deploy patrols or a  patrol from the coordination committee. But what is this  coordination committee? It was a temporary committee formed at  their request when their armies deployed in northern Iraq in  order to avoid confrontation. They said: We will deploy a  patrol on Zakho-Fa'idah highway. He asked: What is the purpose  of this patrol? What was in the two planes? Who were inside  the two planes? What are they going to do?    When I read the cable, I then reviewed the incident, and I  noted that they summoned the ambassador on 14 April and the two  planes were downed on 14 April. Therefore, the ambassadors  summoned our ambassador pursuant to the instructions of their  governments to time an evil act or behavior which we will find  out. What is the relationship of this with those who were on  board the planes?    These are their practices. They carry out small actions, but  Iraq is greater than these practices. They still do not  understand what Iraq is because they understand the language of  figures. They know how many tanks, planes, and fighters are  left in Iraq, and how Iraq's economy is doing.    In 1968, Iraq's treasury was almost empty, and there was  extreme poverty, but there was a deep-rooted army with a  deep-rooted history. But, when we came to power in 1968, this  army was small and consisted of only five divisions. How many  division did we have after the Iran-Iraq war ended in a great  victory? We had 87 divisions. It is man's will that builds  divisions and operates the economy. Had not we the same oil  which we have now? Yes, but the Iraqis were then starving. We  hear now that some Iraqis speak about lacking certain items, but  I say that the conditions of 90 percent of the Iraqis now under  the siege is much better than their previous conditions, which  they talk of now, except for meat and some vegetables.    Most of those who are talking the most, particularly those  who became weak in face of the will of foreigners, are the ones  who made a fortune in those extraordinary  circumstances--circumstances of siege and war after the  revolution of 1968. These people are not doing so under the  revolution's protection. However, we see that these people,  whose number is not large, are impatient. What is needed is  that their neighbors should ask them to be patient as much as  they have reaped profits. They should remind them of the  damaged furniture they had when they moved from their previous  place and settled near them. They should remind them of the  good furniture they have now. They should urge them to be  patient and to have a good solid attitude, much same as the  furniture they have in their houses. They should remember their  poverty and be patient, and remember that the revolution was  what brought them the lifestyle they have enjoyed. These people  are few, and it is our responsibility to advise them because we  want them good, we do not hate anyone and we should not hate  anyone. We should feel sympathy even for the ones who are  executed under the law. This does not mean that we should  pardon them to continue their evil deeds, but it means that if  this Iraqi citizen been good, it would have been better for us,  for his country, and his people.    Their neighbors should talk to these few people and urge  them to be patient. I am saying that the ones who have endured  the most are those who have a limited income; namely, the  genuine citizens of Baghdad. I am commending them because they  deserve to be commended. But the ones who came from outside  Baghdad and became wealthy after they had been poor will have  little patience. On the contrary, we see that the patience of a  genuine citizen of Baghdad -- who lives adjacent to these people  and who used to cook meat four times a week--is greater than  that of some of these formerly poor men, who may have once been  so poor that they only ate meat when their father died.  Sometimes, these formerly poor men could only afford to recite  the opening verses of the Koran when their father died if their  neighbors helped them.    This is not a shame. A shame, however, is when the formerly  poor man does not recall this, thus losing his national memory.  This is because such a man will lose his ethics if he does not  realize that he is duty-bound to recall the past, so that he can  talk to his children and teach them. The children of those whom  I am taking about now regard themselves as if they were the  children of al- Jalabi [a famous wealthy Iraqi]. Thus, they  grumble, do not like anything, do not eat simple meals, and are  not ready to put on simple clothes. Therefore, they need tough  advice. You should laud both the genuine citizens of Baghdad  and their position because their situation is very hard. I know  these people. Their position, however, is more pure and genuine  than that of all the people who came to Baghdad from other  governorates.    Did you see the woman from al-Kazimiyah on television  recently? She said she has three sons who fought in the  Iran-Iraq war. Did you notice that she proudly talked about her  sons' history? Did you notice how she is living with her old  husband in a small house, with an area of 75 square meters,  along with two married sons, their children, and her third son?  Did you notice that her words stemmed from conviction, and how  they made eight soaps out of one soap after adding some sugar  and water, and that they all eat from the same cooking pot, and  how they are living. She talked in a way that suggested honesty  and sincerity to the viewer. The viewer felt that this woman  was telling the truth. She invited a television photographer,  who was on her way to work, to drink tea in her home, and that  is why she talked to you on television.    God willing, after a decisive and final victory is  achieved--and victory is being achieved now, God willing--these  ones will take pride in every detail of their position. We do  not want to deprive any Iraqi of proudly recalling his  circumstances under the blockade and explaining them to his  children and later to his grandchildren. Do you not recall  al-Faw in 1986? That's alright. Do you not recall al-Faw in  1988? Are they not two contradictory pictures? We are now  inheriting all the glories and positions of the martyrs of  al-Faw in 1986 and 1988 and with the same pride. Did you not  feel agonized when you recall our martyrs in al-Faw? Here, I am  saying that agony still exists in its principled, spiritual, and  humanitarian sense. In other words, we wish we had not shed a  single drop of Iraqi blood. This, however, is a law which is as  old as the times of Adam. This law means that anything of value  requires a corresponding sacrifice. However, when we recall the  martyrs now we also recall all the noble meanings of liberation.  All our martyrs contributed to liberation, whether those who  fell in 1986 or 1988. May God have much mercy on them, God  willing. We also take pride in the martyrs' families and in  their positions. We thank the state, the homeland, and the  enduring families of martyrs. May God salute the men, the  martyrs, your army, your families, and you.</p>

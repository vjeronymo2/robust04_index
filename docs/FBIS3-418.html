There were conflicting reports as to the number of  people killed, with residents saying eight people were dead and  seven were injured, while police said 11 were murdered.    What prompted the killings mystified residents, but a local  ANC leader attributed them to the ongoing conflict between the  rival "red" and "green" gangs, linked to the ANC and Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] respectively.    Residents in the ANC strongholds of Angola and Cuba -- an  area of about 3km square -- reported that gunmen attacked  different homes between 10 pm and midnight. [passage omitted]    Saturday's killing spree was probably aimed at stirring up  conflict in the area and linked to rivalry between the reds and  the greens.    Mr Blose [ANC's "office bearer in the area"] said Cuba and  Angola had been peaceful recently and the last killings had been  in adjoining Congo in January when nine people died. Black SA  Defence Force soldiers who spoke Zulu should be deployed to keep  the peace as joint ANC/IFP/police monitoring of the area had  shown limited results, said Mr Blose.    He said Saturday's attacks would probably lead to an  escalation of violence in Bhambayi, where more than 250 lives  have been lost since conflict erupted in late 1992.    The settlement appeared calm on Sunday.</p>

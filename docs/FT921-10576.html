			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on size of classes - Labour Education Policy A COMMITMENT to ensure that there are no classes of more than 40 pupils within the first year of a Labour government was made in an opposition offensive on education yesterday. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said that the pledge would cost about Pounds 3m and would affect between 9,000 and 10,000 children. The money could be found from existing plans for education spending. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said that a continuation of Tory policies would mean 'more of the same back-of-the-envelope chopping and changing, and a persistently undervalued and under-invested state system'. The move, which is the second initiative on education in as many days, forms part of Labour's effort to turn the political debate to public-service issues, traditionally its stronger ground. Labour's attack on the increase in class sizes under the Tories was directed particularly at the rise in the number of classes with more than 30 pupils. Mr Straw said that while Labour would embark on a programme of year-by-year reductions in maximum class sizes, with the hope of reaching a maximum of 35 by the end of the third year, he could give no target date for making 30 children the class limit. Mr Kinnock ridiculed the remarks made at the weekend by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, that he had 'no objection' to the re-emergence of grammar schools, saying that Mr Clarke was 'succumbing to nostalgia for the 1950s'. Labour repeated its broad promise to reverse the drop in the percentage of national wealth spent on education, but Mr Clarke said that the opposition had 'clearly abandoned their recent pledge to spend an extra Pounds 2.6bn on education'.</p>

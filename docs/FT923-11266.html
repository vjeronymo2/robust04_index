			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THE GLOOM surrounding the stock market continues to cast its shadow over directors' activity. BM Group, the construction equipment company, was highlighted a couple of weeks ago when Roger Shute, the resigning chairman, bought shares. A statement issued by the company on July 3 revealed that the board was concerned about the price drop from 398p at the beginning of June to 85p at the beginning of July. It was claimed that neither the group's trading nor financial position justified the scale of the fall, and a review of the management accounts suggested there would be continued growth in profitibility. Seven directors  -including Matthew Thorne, the new chairman, and Howard Sutton, the managing director - bought 83,500 shares at 96p. Directors at Microgen, the computer bureau services group, have also been buying. Douglas Lee, the chairman, GE Liddle, the finance director, and another executive director bought a total of 104,500 shares at 160p. Mr Allison, one of the non-executive directors, bought 2,000 shares at 168p. Final results at Birse Group, in the contracting and construction sector, reflect the impact of a bad debtor. Nevertheless, when recovery dawns it should be in this sector, and director buying should mean good news. Four directors - including the chairman and chief executive, Peter Birse, and the finance director, David Swales - bought a total of 830,275 shares at prices between 19 and 24p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                    Sector     Shares    Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Appleby Westward           FdRt       24,750      68          1 Bradstock                  InsB       26,500      38          1 Dixons                     Stor      400,000     816          1 Kingfisher                 Stor      750,000   3,515          1 Leigh Interests            Chem      150,000     375          1 Richards Group             Metl      300,000     204          1 Sims Food                  FdM        28,737      66          1 PURCHASES Barrett (Henry)            Metl       60,000      13          1 Betterware Cons Prd        Stor       20,000      59          1 Birse Group                Cont      750,000     158          4 BM Group                   EngG       83,500      80          7 Bristol Even'g Post        Mdia       10,000      27          2 Cooper, Frank              Metl       27,500      10          3 El Oro Mining              Mine       10,000      38          1 Great Portland             Prop      150,000     192          1 Leeds Group                Text        2,500      11          1 Microgen                   PP&amp;P      106,500     171          4 Oriflame                   Stor       220,00     387          2 Proudfoot (Alex)           BusS       15,000      23          2 Sturge Holdings            InsB       25,000      19          1 United Energy              Oil       158,500      30          4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

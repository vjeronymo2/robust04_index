Speaking afterwards, Rybkin said all factions had agreed to  his proposal for a Russia's Choice candidate to become his First  Deputy and the RC is expected to inform him about its choice by  11:00 on Sunday.    Four other Deputies to be elected from the LDP, Women of  Russia, Communists and the New Regional Policy alliance are yet  to be named.    It was also agreed that the Duma council would compromise  all  faction leaders, each of them having one vote, as well the  Speaker and his Deputies, Rybkin said. Heads of the  parliamentary committees may also attend council meetings.    There will be as many as 21 committees but the dispute is  over the four main committees: international affairs, defence,  security and economics, Rybkin said. He hopes that some sort of  compromise can be struck as the factions meet on Sunday.    The Speaker believes that the two chambers of the Federal  Assembly must work in the same building but "once this did not  happen", they will have to stay put at their present locations  rather than spend time and energy to reverse things.    Rybkin has also called for a single staff to the Federal  Assembly. But once the Federation Council has created its own  staff, the Duma will have to follow suit, he said.    For his part, Democratic Party leader Nikolai Travkin said  there was no objection to the candidacy of Mikhail Mityukov as  First Deputy Speaker.    In his words, the Communists and Women of Russia may  nominate  Valentin Kovalyev and Alevtina Fedulova for the posts of Deputy  Speaker. The LDP may name either its leading member Viktor  Kobeleyev or former Soviet Deputy Prime Minister in the Ryzhkov  government Vladimir Gusyev.    However, it is not ruled out that the party may nominate  Vladimir Zhirinovsky as its choice, Travkin said.    The DP leader says that if agreement is reached on electing  the candidates in a package, this can be done within a day's  work. Failing this, he said, the Speaker will hold a series of  consultations with the representatives of each faction over the  weekend.    The council of factions will meet at 12:45 on Monday to try  to resolve the issue before the Duma goes into session at 14:00,  Travkin said.</p>

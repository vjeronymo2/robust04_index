			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Acceptance of Foreign Military Aid Is </F> Consistent With the Constitution"]    [Text] The last paragraph of Article 53 in Chapter 4 of  the the Kingdom of Cambodia's Constitution stipulates that "the  Kingdom of Cambodia shall preserve the right to accept foreign  aid in terms of military material, arms, ammunition, training of  the armed forces, and other aid for its own defense and for the  maintenance of of public order and security within the country."    It is well known that in the past, especially in recent  weeks, not only has the Khmer Rouge resorted to sabotage  activities to annihilate law and order and public security  within the country, it has also further nurtured the notion of  dismembering Cambodia into two parts and taking control of the  country once again. This being the case, the appeal for  military aid to enable Cambodia to circumvent "the great danger  of the Khmer Rouge" does not contradict the country's  fundamental law at all. Actually, it suits Cambodia's vital  interests perfectly. For this reason, actions by donor  countries do not constitute an intervention in the internal  affairs of Cambodia as alleged by some countries, especially  Thailand. In fact, it should be acknowledged that aid for the  reinforcement of Cambodia's defense is also for the promotion of  the country's democracy, independence, and sovereignty that the  international community has strived to bring to existence  through the May 1993 elections.    It is really ironic to say that military aid to Cambodia  will  affect the security interest of its neighbors. The tiny and  badly damaged Cambodia does not have enough force to act as have  been alleged.    Obviously, only aid to the Khmer Rouge and obstruction of  assistance to Cambodia's legitimate government is tantamount to  interference in the country's internal affairs.</p>

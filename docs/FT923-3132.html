			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Shake-up alters shape of politics LAST night's realignment involves a devaluation of only one currency in the European Monetary System (EMS). But the adjustment may turn out to have a more substantial impact than any of the 12 previous shake-ups since the EMS started in 1979. The realignment seems likely to bring a seismic shift in Europe's political and economic landscape only six days away from the French referendum on Maastricht. The chances of a Yes vote in France next Sunday seem likely to be improved if, as is likely, the Bank of France cuts interest rates after this morning's expected Bundesbank reduction. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the Bundesbank's desire to cut rates 'shows real solidarity by Germany towards its European partners and opens the way to a relaxation of interest rates in Europe, which is necessary to support growth and unemployment'. Additionally, by taking action to deal with the over-valuation of the lira, EC finance ministers have, for the moment at least, defused the most important source of instability in the EMS. Currency market jitters will not come to an end as long as the world economy remains stuck in a slow growth phase, and doubts are maintained over the eventual fate of the Maastricht treaty. But Europe's exchange rate stabilisation scheme seems likely to have won sufficient breathing space to enable it to live to fight another day. The German government last night stressed that the realignment and expected Bundesbank credit easing back up Bonn's overall 'European policies'. In Paris, observers said they believed the move could allay public fears, expressed in opinion polls, of a German economic domination of Europe. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who was closely involved in realignment telephone conversations, may have some explaining to do over the apparent U-turn in the central bank's monetary policies. In an unprecedented fashion, the Bundesbank has bargained away a cut in its interest rates in return for the goal  - an EMS realignment  - it has desired to see for at least two years. Three factors seem to explain the Bundesbank's volte face. First, Mr Schlesinger probably believes that the inflationary risks of large inflows of speculative currency  - which should now cease  - are at least as large as those of an interest rate cut. Second, the Bundesbank itself has been concerned by growing signs of domestic recession. Third, when put under pressure from the Bonn government  - which has been unhappy for some time over the bank's tight policies  - the Bundesbank does have a track record of reacting with great pragmatism. The Bundesbank's reputation for independence is well known. But its last reduction in discount rate  - a  1/2 point cut to 2 1/2 per cent on December 3 1987  - came after a telephone plea for action by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the then president. The Bundesbank knows how to stand firm  - but it also has an instinct for the occasional need, when faced with overwhelming odds, to make a tactical retreat.</p>

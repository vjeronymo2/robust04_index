The murder occurred on 23 March in Tijuana.    Sanchez Venegas was arrested on Saturday. He then gave his  deposition to the Attorney General's Office. Today, in federal  court, he was accused of alleged complicity. The suspicion that  he participated in the murder is based on an analysis of the  videotape broadcast on television and on graphic material in the  police's possession where it appears that Sanchez Venegas, while  watching, opened a path through the crowd for the murderer,  without acting to prevent it, as confessed murderer Mario Aburto  Martinez shoots Colosio in the right temple.    Various PRG officials, who asked to remain anonymous,  indicated that the arrest of the former policeman was made after  a lady friend of Aburto Martinez declared that on 11 March the  two individuals met in a Tijuana park. According to official  reports, the former policeman was employed by the Tijuana PRI  for "crowd control" at the event were Colosio was murdered.    Colosio was murdered on 23 March in Tijuana as he was  concluding an event in his electoral campaign. The candidate was  shot in the stomach and in the head. This resulted in instant  brain death. Three hours later he died. The alleged murderer is  being held at the Almoloya jail in Juarez, Mexico's maxiumum  security jail. He is expected to be tried in the coming weeks  once the investigation concludes. The PRG has indicated that for  now, no one else has been arrested as an accomplice in the  murder, although several individuals are being investigated.</p>

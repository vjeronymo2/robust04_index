			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Corruption row in Lebanon Lebanon's prosecutor-general is to study files handed over by President Elias Hrawi accusing two top Moslem political leaders of corruption. Judicial officials said yesterday that Mr Hrawi delivered files on Mr Hussein Husseini, former parliamentary speaker, and Mr Omar Karami, former prime minister, whom he accused last week of understating the price of properties bought in order to avoid taxes. Mr Hrawi's son Roy has been linked by a parliamentary deputy to drug dealing. The president made the accusations against the ministers while rallying to the defence of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, at the weekend after the premier had offered to resign citing obstruction from critics accusing him of corruption.</p>

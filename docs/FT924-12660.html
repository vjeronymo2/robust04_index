			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: 'Moratorium until early in the new year' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the Commons yesterday: 'The government recognise the concern at the speed of the rundown and about the very great difficulties it would cause to the communities involved. We have therefore concluded that, for the time being, British Coal should be allowed to proceed with the closure of only 10 pits which they have told me are currently loss-making and have no prospect of viability in the foreseeable future. 'The pits which fall into this category are Vane Tempest, Grimethorpe and Houghton Main, Markham Main, Trentham, Parkside, Cotgrave, Silverhill, Betws and Taff Merthyr. 'Nevertheless, it is clearly important that British Coal demonstrably meet their statutory duties to consult and notify and take account of the result of consultation. No closure will therefore take place until after the statutory consultation period has been completed. 'In the case of all other closures and redundancies, I have asked British Coal to introduce a moratorium until early in the new year except for those which may be agreed by the workforce at the pits concerned. 'During this moratorium the government and British Coal will set out the full case for the closures which British Coal planned and to which I agreed. The government will also provide an opportunity for MPs to debate the issues. In addition, we will carry out widespread consultation with all those concerned over the next three months. We will then announce our conclusions following these consultations to parliament in the new year. 'If, following this process, the government and British Coal's judgment is confirmed then British Coal will proceed with a phased programme of colliery closures aimed at reducing surplus capacity as soon as possible.' On assistance to the coalfield communities, Mr Heseltine confirmed that the government had prepared a package of measures to help people retrain and find jobs, and that Tecs would have a role to play in this. He also said that the government would create new enterprise zones to attract new industry and long-term investment, and gave details of other measures. 'On the basis of preliminary discussions with English Estates (about a programme of property and sites provision) the government have decided to make available to the corporation - and in due course to the Urban Regeneration Agency - Pounds 75m of additional money over the next three years. In addition the corporation will in this year spend around Pounds 10m in these areas. 'The secretary of state for the environment is also making nearly Pounds 2m available today to the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation. 'We have already announced that three areas - Doncaster, Barnsley and Mansfield - will get enhanced status when the new assisted area map is announced in the new year. More areas will be upgraded in the review. We will continue to look at other areas. 'I intend to extend the coverage of regional enterprise grants to all coal closure areas. This will help small businesses there with investment and innovation projects. I will strengthen inward investment efforts in these areas. I will see that additional resources are available to local development agencies. 'The secretary of state for the environment is also acting immediately to alleviate the effects of the closures. He is today setting up a coalfield areas fund. Up to Pounds 5m will be made available for expenditure in this financial year and next. 'These measures will all bring new money to the affected areas. We are talking about Pounds 165m altogether. 'It will be important to ensure that the programmes mesh properly together, leaving neither wasteful overlaps nor damaging gaps. 'For this reason I have decided to appoint a distinguished national figure, who will be an adviser in my department, to act as co-ordinator and facilitator at the national level. 'I am pleased to tell the House that Lord Walker has agreed to accept this important responsibility.'</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING QUESTIONS  </P> <P> My stepson, Charles Barker, was the subject of a story printed in the San Diego  edition of the Los Angeles Times ("Slain Teen Had 2 Sides to His Life, Friends  Say," June 25). I would like to commend H.G. Reza for portraying my stepson as  the quiet, polite person he was. The article was researched and the facts were  presented in a most professional manner, while avoiding undue sensationalism.  </P> <P> I do, however, feel compelled to comment on two issues, one pertaining to the  story and the other to the case.  </P> <P> In regard to the story, the issue I have is with the comments made by the  Madison High School official who chose not to be identified. The school  official was quoted as saying Chuck was "kicked out of Madison." Elsewhere, the  story states that Chuck was expelled from Madison.  </P> <P> I was present when the decision was made to have Chuck leave Madison and  transfer to Twain Junior-Senior High School. It was not presented to me or to  his mother that this was an expulsion. He was not "kicked out." We mutually  agreed that Chuck was not doing well at Madison, and that a transfer to Twain  would be in his best interest.  </P> <P> The second issue I have is with the treatment of the case by the district  attorney (who ruled the shooting a justifiable homicide). I will be the first  to say my stepson did wrong and deserved to be punished. I do not defend nor  condone his actions. He chose to break the law, and that was wrong.  </P> <P> He did not, however, deserve to be shot to death. According to police, the  events of the case were: two boys wearing stocking masks approached a man and  said, "Freeze -- give me your wallet." At this point, the man feigned a heart  attack, pulled a weapon and fired one fatal shot.  </P> <P> My wife and I grieve the loss of a child and, at the same time, are shocked to  learn that our boy had attempted a robbery. (But) the laws of this country  clearly state that the punishment must fit the crime. Attempted robbery does  not warrant the death penalty.  </P> <P> JOHN M. ELLIOTT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

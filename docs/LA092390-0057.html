			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S DESK IS EASY TO BUILD OR TAKE DOWN  </P> <P> Here is an easy-to-build desk that has three all-important features:  </P> <P> 1 -- It is cut from a half sheet of three-quarter-inch plywood, sold in most  home centers or lumber yards that find a definite market in supplying smaller  sizes than the usual 4-by-8-footer.  </P> <P> 2 -- The desk top can be adjusted from 25 inches in height up to 29 inches, in  2-inch increments, as the child grows.  </P> <P> 3 -- The desk is held together by only four carriage bolts, so it can be  quickly taken apart for convenient along-the-wall storage.  </P> <P> Cut the desk from a half sheet of APA plywood; we suggest you use the A-C  grade, which has one side sanded and free from imperfections. Where the  imperfections are visible on the C side, merely fill the seams or knot holes  with spackle or paste wood filler.  </P> <P> Note that the desk consists of only six components. Mark off and label the  parts on your half sheet of plywood, as indicated in the accompanying  illustration.  </P> <P> A table or radial arm saw will ensure the straight cuts you need. But if you  don't have this equipment, for a few extra dollars most lumber yards will make  the straight cuts.  </P> <P> If you have a portable electrical saw, by tacking a fence to the half sheet to  serve as a guide you can make your own straight cuts. Use a plywood blade to  cut down on splintering.  </P> <P> With your half sheet marked off as per the layout, make the first 8-inch cut,  labeled Cut 1, to produce the cross brace (Part D). Then rip the sheet in half  by making Cut 2, which yields the table top (Part A) and both legs (Part C),  plus the side braces (Part B). Rip the 3-inch-wide side braces, and all that  remains is cutting the two legs to make them L-shaped.  </P> <P> To cut the notches in the cross braces and 8-inch legs, a saber saw is the tool  of choice; it also can be used to cut the straight interior lines of the legs.  Incidentally, by having a 1-inch radius for the inside line of the legs, you  can cut apart the legs without making a plunge cut. However, to make the slot  for the inside of the legs a plunge cut is necessary.  </P> <P> Drill the holes for the legs and side braces, as indicated, and nail and glue  the side braces to the top with six-penny finishing nails. Then sand off each  part, and to conceal the plywood end grain use a paste wood filler. Sand again  and brush on a coat of primer paint. Finish with a washable coat of latex.  </P> <P> Now all you need do is to bolt the legs to the table top and slip the cross  brace in position, as indicated.  </P></p>

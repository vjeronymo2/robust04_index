This discovery draws the attention of experts for rich  deposits and good mining conditions.    In recent years, Korea has made an effective use of diatom  earth excavated from various places of the country for the  development of the national economy.    Absorptive, filterable and fire-resisting diatom earth is  widely used in the building-materials industry, chemical and  foodstuff industries, agriculture and other domains of the  national economy. The demand for it is growing at world markets,  selling at price of about 50 dollars per ton.    The demand for diatom earth will increase still further for  its low per unit cost and increasing economic effectiveness.    Korea has made great achievements in the geological survey  for a scientific analysis of the deposited conditions and  circumstances of diatom earth and its extensive development.</p>

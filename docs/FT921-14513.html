			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Mirror journalists may suspend pension payments JOURNALISTS at Mirror Group Newspapers are considering suspending payments to the company pension fund because of uncertainty about its future. One Daily Mirror reporter, Mr Peter Kane, is prepared to issue a writ, as a test case, against the company to prevent money being deducted for the pension fund from his February salary. The moves follow a circular from the pension trustees warning that although normal pension payments were continuing, if none of the missing funds were recovered the scheme was unlikely to be able to guarantee full benefits to existing pensioners. Following the collapse of the Maxwell empire there have been fears that more than Pounds 400m is missing from the Mirror pension fund. The National Union of Journalists is planning to join with other unions at MGN to seek an urgent meeting with Mr Ernest Burrington, chairman of the newspaper group, to discuss the future of the fund. Journalists fear that the assets are so low that pensions are being paid directly out of the contributions of existing staff. The NUJ is considering setting up a separate fund for its members' pension contributions.</p>

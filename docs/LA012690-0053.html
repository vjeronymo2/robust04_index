			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LONG SEARCH FOR IMMEDIATE FREEDOM;  </P> <P> JAZZ: TURIYA'S 20-YEAR ODYSSEY LED FROM SOUTHERN BAPTIST ROOTS TO HER FLOWERING  IN LATIN AND AFRO-CUBAN RHYTHMS.  </P> <P> Her Dad is a conservative doctor and the family figured her for a career  homemaker or church organist.  </P> <P> But San Diego jazz musician Turiya felt a different calling. A 20-year musical  odyssey took her from avant-garde jazz in New York to Latin rhythms deep in the  heart of Mexico.  </P> <P> Last June, Turiya emerged playing exciting original music and reworked  standards with her new Immediate Freedom Band, which appears tonight and  Saturday at the RUSE Performance Gallery in downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> Recently, the band appeared at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park.  The atmosphere was almost spiritual. Dressed in white, Turiya looked small next  to her long bass clarinet, which has a range and size similar to a tenor  saxophone. She seemed oblivious to her audience, rocking back and forth with  her eyes closed as the music unfolded.  </P> <P> She traded searing solos with fluegelhorn player Bill Caballero and reed man  Dave Millard. A three-man percussion session brewed up Latin and Afro-Cuban  rhythms; other band members added vocal sounds, hand percussion, electric piano  and bass.  </P> <P> After years of developing her sounds, Turiya, 38, seems to have found a great  band, which doubles as an ad hoc family.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty much getting my needs met," she said during a recent interview on  the porch of her North Park bungalow.  </P> <P> During her childhood in San Diego, that wasn't always true.  </P> <P> "I grew up in a Southern family. What I was supposed to do was play piano in  the Southern Baptist church," said Turiya, who prefers to keep her family name  a secret. "No one dreamed I would consider a performing career, unless it was  as a church organist."  </P> <P> Several members of her family played musical instruments and sang. She took  piano lessons and eventually sensed that jazz might be her calling, though she  hadn't really heard any.  </P> <P> "I went through a period of searching. At 14, I put the piano music in the  closet and said I was going to improvise and never look at music again.  </P> <P> "I became interested in jazz. Someone gave me a Dave Brubeck record, and I  said, 'That's almost it.' "  </P> <P> Then she met a self-styled philosopher and jazz music fanatic named Nelson  Palleman who changed her life.  </P> <P> "He had thousands of records," she recalled. "He played me 'Om' by John  Coltrane and 'Karma' by Pharoah Sanders and started me on a reading program. He  gave me the equivalent of a B.A. in music."  </P> <P> Palleman and his teaching became more important than (Monte Vista) high school,  where she didn't fit in.  </P> <P> "I was into the Temptations, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, not the Beatles,"  she explained.  </P> <P> At 18, she began studying jazz with local sax man Daniel Jackson and soon found  the unusual instrument that remains her favorite, though she also plays flute  and saxes.  </P> <P> "With the bass clarinet, I had the strongest connection. It has a real bizarre  fingering system. It's a real masochistic instrument. It takes a lot of wind.  It's emotionally challenging."  </P> <P> Two musical sojourns had a profound impact on her career.  </P> <P> Reacting to tiny ads in the back of the jazz magazine Downbeat, she went to New  York in 1980 to spend a year at the Creative Music Studio, an avant-garde  retreat that featured such guest artists as Jack de Johnette, Oliver Lake,  Julius Hemphill, Anthony Braxton and the Art Ensemble of Chicago.  </P> <P> "It was like an ashram," she said. "The people who need to be there find it. We  lived in an old campground. They taught us chanting, breathing, meditation. We  were isolated on a mountain like monks.  </P> <P> "We learned how to get inside our feelings. Jazz is an oral tradition. You  can't learn from a book. It's passed on human to human. People would be in your  face, critiquing your music, critiquing your life."  </P> <P> A second musical adventure took her to Mexico, where she perfected her  knowledge of Latin rhythms with percussionist and band leader Taumbu and his  ensemble in Veracruz.  </P> <P> "I felt a deep calling to Mexico," she said. "It's just another world, a  beautiful world. Most Americans only see the border. Way down, it's exotic,  there are birds and flowers and tropical forests and the people are great. Our  materialistic, rushing values are not there. I felt Latin music was the way I  wanted to go."  </P> <P> Back in San Diego in 1985, she formed a big Latin ensemble, naming it Future  Primitive in honor of Palleman.  </P> <P> "His philosophy was that primitive was better, that the future lay in a return  to primitive values."  </P> <P> But she needed to support her daughter, so for a few years she worked  "casuals," hiring out as a pianist or band member for assorted private parties.  Last June, she was ready to make original music again, and the Immediate  Freedom Band was born.  </P> <P> Reed man Millard and conga player Glen Lacy have known Turiya for years. They  even went to Mexico with her. Generally, most of Turiya's band members have  been friends for a long time. Their commitment to the music and warm feelings  for one another come across.  </P> <P> During an interview, pianist and composer Joe Garrison stopped by to test  Turiya's piano as a tuner worked it over. Lacy arrived by bicycle, and he and  Garrison left to look at a car one of them wanted to buy.  </P> <P> "Everybody in the band is actively trying to expand their growth and  consciousness," she said. "They are terribly enthusiastic. They love to  rehearse."  </P> <P> On stage, the music seems to sustain her, but Turiya wouldn't mind some degree  of commercial success. A recording contract would be a good start.  </P> <P> "This band needs to be recorded," she said. "They deserve it."  </P> <P> Although she seems happy for the moment, San Diego isn't her favorite place.  She may move to Mexico, at least part time, once her daughter graduates from  high school in two years.  </P> <P> "This is a real funny town," she said, citing its conservative attitudes toward  the arts, and the poor treatment blacks and other minorities often receive.  "It's hard to be around it, that kind of ignorance. And the border situation.  This is Mexico. We live in Mexico. This is Indian land. People never stop to  think about how other people feel.  </P> <P> "The trick is not to let yourself get eaten up by that."  </P></p>

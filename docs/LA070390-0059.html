			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROOF COLLAPSES AT CAMPUS HALL IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> The roof of an 8-year-old recital hall at Cal State Long Beach mysteriously  collapsed Monday morning, flattening two grand pianos and slamming tons of  concrete and steel onto a seating area that can hold as many as 210 people.  </P> <P> No one was inside the Gerald R. Daniels Recital Hall -- a theater used almost  daily for concerts and lectures when classes are in session -- when 90% of the  concrete-reinforced ceiling caved in at midmorning.  </P> <P> Just hours earlier, a group of five high school students had gathered at the  theater for a Sunday evening music rehearsal. They were ushered away when a  professor and sound engineer observed half-inch cracks in the plaster and heard  strange creaks coming from the walls.  </P> <P> Police and firefighters who surveyed the damage said anyone sitting in the  audience or performing on stage would have been crushed.  </P> <P> "People in the first three rows might have survived. Everyone else would have  been history," Long Beach firefighter Craig Vestermark said after emerging from  the theater on the north end of the campus.  </P> <P> Campus officials shut down two adjacent buildings that were constructed in the  same style by the same architect and contractor. Administrators said they were  also studying whether other buildings on campus might pose a danger.  </P> <P> "If we find some factor that gives us reason to think there's a flaw in the  method, we'll do whatever necessary to protect people," said William H.  Griffith, vice president of administration and finance.  </P> <P> Administrators could not immediately determine how many buildings were  constructed in a similar style across the California State University system.  </P> <P> The contractor who built the collapsed theater also constructed several other  buildings in the state university system, including an addition to the art  building on the Fullerton campus and a student union at Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Campus police were borrowed from nearby universities Monday to stand watch over  the buckled building. Heavy trucks were diverted off adjacent Atherton Street  for fear that the slightest vibration would send the walls tumbling.  </P> <P> Administrators said hundreds of lives might have been saved by the timing of  the collapse. The hall is used for lectures, rehearsals and about 250 musical  performances a year. During a semester, as many as 800 to 1,000 people pass  through on an average day.  </P> <P> Classes recessed in mid-May for the summer; the theater's last major event was  a June 23 fund-raising performance put on by a local arts group that drew about  20 performers and 100 spectators, campus officials said.  </P> <P> "At 10:30 on a Monday morning during the semester, we would have had a lecture  class of about 100 people in there. We're all grateful no one was hurt," said  Donald Para, chairman of the 325-student music department.  </P> <P> A team of inspectors -- including the architect who designed the building and  the structural engineer who helped erect it -- examined the leaning structure  from every angle Monday afternoon. They were at a loss, however, to explain why  a building that opened its doors in April, 1982, would suddenly just fold.  </P> <P> A check of campus inspection records revealed no reported code violations of  any kind. University officials said all campus buildings undergo annual  inspections, although they could not say exactly when the theater was last  reviewed.  </P> <P> "The trusses failed," Don Erb, the structural engineer, said after touring the  building. He would not elaborate on the cause, however.  </P> <P> "It's quite an unfortunate thing. First time any building has fallen down that  we've done," said Donald Gibbs, co-owner of the Hugh Gibbs &amp; Donald Gibbs  architectural firm in Long Beach. The firm designed the recital hall as part of  a $6.3-million office and theater complex built with state funds.  </P> <P> The Gibbs firm also designed the campus's psychology building and is under  contract as the architect for a new performing arts center scheduled for  ground-breaking in October, said university spokeswoman Toni Beron.  </P> <P> The building's contractor, Shirley Brothers Inc. of Pasadena, has "a good  reputation," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the state university  system.  </P> <P> The contractor could not be reached for comment late Monday.  </P> <P> Gibbs called the building's construction a conventional "tilt-up" style in  which the concrete walls are poured, then hoisted into standing position. He  said the roof was made of wood and steel and reinforced with a three-inch slab  of concrete for acoustical quality because the theater sits in the flight path  of the Long Beach Airport.  </P> <P> Although it was said to be of top acoustical caliber and was a welcome addition  to the music department, faculty members and campus workers said it and other  buildings in the complex were plagued by leaking roofs.  </P> <P> "As I understand it, we've had some leakage problems but nothing that would be  indicative of a structural problem," Griffith said.  </P> <P> There was no significant damage to other buildings in the office and theater  complex, which were to be closed and inspected, officials said.  </P> <P> Although no one expected such a dramatic collapse, several campus officials  heeded warning signs of falling plaster and groaning walls throughout the  weekend and alerted campus police. A music professor and a pupil were  practicing Sunday when they noticed cracks and decided to leave the building.  </P> <P> Sunday night, sound engineer Martin Brenner was there with about five high  school students when he noticed the cracks had spread. He sent the youngsters  elsewhere.  </P> <P> A campus building superintendent who was dispatched to inspect the building  Monday morning climbed onto the roof but left in a hurry when he heard more  creaking. Technicians were called out and, within seconds, the roof came  crashing down, pancaking two nine-foot Steinway grand pianos valued at $75,000  apiece.  </P> <P> The collapse triggered the sprinkler system, which soaked several timpani, bass  drums and other instruments stored offstage, campus President Curtis McCray  said.  </P> <P> McCray said the walls of the recital hall would be shored up so the debris  could be removed and the building tested to determine the cause of the  collapse.  </P> <P> "Trucks rolls by, airplanes fly over. . . . I don't think the strains of  Beethoven could have done this," McCray said.  </P> <P> Campus officials were uncertain whether the building could be saved; some fire  officials seemed certain it was a total loss.  </P> <P> "It's wholesale," firefighter Vestermark said. "That building is going to the  ground."  </P> <P> Staff writer George Ramos contributed to this report.  </P></p>

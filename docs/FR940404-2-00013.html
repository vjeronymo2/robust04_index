Anyone entering the fishery after April 4, 1994, may not be assured of future participation in the fishery if a management regime is developed and implemented that limits the number of participants in the fishery. This notice is intended to discourage new entries into the fishery based on economic speculation while the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) considers whether and how participation or effort in the rock shrimp fishery off the Florida counties should be controlled. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Peter Eldridge, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Council prepared a Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery off the South Atlantic Region (FMP), which is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 659 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP contains management measures applying to brown, pink, and white shrimp which are caught in the shrimp fishery off the southern Atlantic states. The shrimp fishery also includes royal red and rock shrimp. There currently are no regulations for rock shrimp and the Council is considering management measures for this component of the shrimp fishery. If the Council determines that management is necessary, an amendment to the FMP will be developed pursuant to the requirements of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rock shrimp fishery is prosecuted mainly in the EEZ off Florida from Duval through St. Lucie counties. Florida produces over 85 percent of U.S. landings of rock shrimp. Rock shrimp landings have varied from 1.8 to 5.4 million pounds (816.5 to 2,449.4 metric tons) in the past decade. The introduction of peeling machines resulted in the capture of much smaller shrimp and greatly increased landings in 1989 and 1990. However, in 1991, landings decreased about two-thirds from the level experienced in 1989 and 1990 even though fishing effort remained at a high level. The rapid decrease in landings raised concern by industry that overfishing may be occurring. There is also concern about the small size of shrimp that have been taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In February 1994, the Council held a scoping meeting to solicit input from the industry and public on the management of rock shrimp. Based on the results of that meeting, the Council began development of options for management of the rock shrimp fishery. The Council will consider a range of options including area restrictions, seasons, mesh sizes, count limits, and limited entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing a control date, the Council intends to discourage speculative entry into the rock shrimp fishery while it discusses possible management regimes. As the Council considers a limited entry or access-controlled management regime, among other options, some fishermen who do not currently harvest rock shrimp, and never have done so, may decide to enter the fishery for the sole purpose of establishing a record of making commercial landings of rock shrimp. In the absence of a control date, such a record generally may be considered indicative of economic dependence on the fishery. On this basis, the fishermen may successfully lay claim to access to a fishery that is otherwise limited to traditional participants. When management authorities begin to consider use of a limited access management regime, this speculative entry often is responsible for a rapid increase in fishing effort in fisheries that are already fully or over-developed. The original problems become exacerbated by those who seek possible windfall gain from the solutions being discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of a control date does not commit the Council or NMFS to any particular management regime or criterion for entry into the rock shrimp fishery. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participation in the rock shrimp fishery regardless of their date of entry or intensity of participation in the fishery before or after the control date. The Council may subsequently choose a different control date, or it may choose a management regime that does not make use of such a date. The Council may choose to give variably weighted consideration to fishermen in the fishery before and after the control date. Other qualifying criteria, such as documentation of commercial landings and sales, may be applied for entry. The Council may choose also to take no further action to control entry or access to the fishery. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles Karnella,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Program Management Officer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Marine Fisheries Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8005 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

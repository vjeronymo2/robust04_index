			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'LAWMEN' REFERENCE  </P> <P> I really hate to complain; the Times is usually so sensitive to societal  improvements such as inclusive language, but it cannot be passed by that you  used the term "lawmen" (Jan. 23) in the article about the planned drug training  center.  </P> <P> It's a cute word if you're thinking of Matt Dillon and the days of "Gunsmoke."  But it does discount police officers who happen to be women and who, I assume,  would be students at the training center. Or, will they?  </P> <P> JOYCE CAWLEY  </P> <P> Orange County  </P> <P> Commission on the Status of Women  </P></p>

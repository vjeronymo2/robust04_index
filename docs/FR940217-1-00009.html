			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reproposed rule has been revised to incorporate many of the suggestions made in the comment letters. These provisions are intended to clarify the operation of the reproposed system and reduce the costs associated with all aspects of the reproposed rule. The changes found in the reproposed rule would: (1) Clarify the definition of a large trader and provide a flexible concept of aggregation; (2) increase the identifying and reporting activity levels; (3) reduce the scope of information captured on Form 13H; (4) streamline Form 13H filing and updating requirements that include an inactive filing status; (5) provide more informative and detailed instructions to Form 13H; (6) reduce the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for LTIDs; (7) provide special reporting requirements for execution times; and (8) provide a safe harbor for the duty to supervise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reproposed rule also addresses today's complex global trading environment and attempts to maintain a level playing field between broker-dealers and banks, both domestic and foreign. The Commission has endeavored to maintain an equal competitive environment between these entities by imposing requirements on custodians or nominees of omnibus accounts. These duties include: (1) Form 13H filings; (2) confidential and limited disclosures to the Commission or others; and (3) limited duties to disaggregate and assure compliance with omnibus account identification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Essentially, the reproposed large trader reporting system would require that a person that falls within the definition of a large trader would file Form 13H with the Commission. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission would assign an LTID to the large trader. After receiving a LTID, large traders would contact their broker-dealers and inform them of their number and all accounts to which it applies. Thereafter, the large trader only would be required to file an updated Form 13H annually. The broker-dealers carrying the large trader's accounts would maintain records of the trades for the account. These broker-dealers would electronically report transactions upon receiving a request from the Commission. Broker-dealers also would be required to supervise compliance with the reproposed rule by their customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fundamentally, the burdens that would be imposed on large traders by the reproposed rule would include: (1) Filing Form 13H (See Sections III.B.1. and 2.); (2) disclosing it's LTIDs to broker-dealers (See Section III.B.3.); (3) updating Form 13H annually (See Section III.B.1.); and (4) providing additional information when the Commission requests (See Section III.B.5.). The burdens imposed on broker-dealers would include: (1) Maintaining records of transactions effected for large trader accounts (See Section III.C.); (2) electronically reporting large trader transaction information when the Commission requests (See Section III.D.); and (3) supervising their customers' compliance with the reproposed rule (See Section III.E.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific changes to the proposed rule and several examples of how they would affect the reproposed system are discussed below. The Commission believes that the reproposed rule accomplishes the objectives of the Market Reform Act by creating an effective market reconstruction tool, minimizing burdens and costs, and maintaining a fair competitive environment among markets and market participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Solicitation of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the modifications and additions found in the reproposed rule would significantly reduce the burdens and costs of the proposed system without impeding its effectiveness and, therefore, would accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. As discussed below, the Commission staff has engaged in extended discussions with market participants and securities information processors, and many alternatives have been identified. The Commission has incorporated in the reproposed rule those alternatives that it believes would accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the changes to the proposed rule are significant, the Commission seeks comments on any aspect of the reproposed rule and, specifically, comments that relate to the: (1) The identifying activity level; (2) other means to assure that natural persons who were not intended to be large traders are not affected by the reproposed rule; (3) the use of the Depository Trust Company's (``DTC'') Institutional Delivery System (``ID System''); (4) the rules for aggregation of accounts; (5) Form 13H and Schedules; (6) the supervisory safe harbor; and (7) the plan for implementing the transaction reporting system. Finally, the Commission invites comments as to whether there are more cost-effective alternatives to the reproposed rule or system that would provide similar benefits, including particular alternatives that adopt a different structure. The Commission also continues to solicit specific comments that explore the relative costs and benefits of the reproposed system generally, or any other alternatives. Furthermore, because of the time that has elapsed, comments that identify any new information technologies that accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act and minimize costs to a greater extent would be appreciated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the reproposed identifying activity level, the Commission solicits comments on the appropriateness of the new thresholds. The new identifying activity level, combined with certain exemptions from the definition of a transaction and the new inactive status, were designed to minimize the impact of the reproposed rule on natural persons that infrequently trade in a magnitude that may warrant imposing the added regulatory burdens of the reproposed system. The Commission would welcome comments regarding any other means for eliminating the impact of the reproposed rule on these types of persons. In particular, the Commission solicits comments on whether a separate identifying activity level for natural persons or an exemption for natural persons that effect less 1,000,000 shares or fair market value of $25 million in a calendar day, would be a more appropriate means for minimizing the impact of the Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ID System is an electronic communications and book-entry settlement system through which most large institutional investors, their brokers or advisers, or their custodians or nominees confirm and settle trades. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed below, the ID System has been incorporated into the reproposed rule to reduce its burdens in three respects. Under the reproposed rule, the use of numbers assigned by DTC to ID System participants would: (1) Be incorporated into the Schedules to Form 13H by permitting their use in lieu of LTIDs; (2) minimize the amount of communication among members of an investment complex that would be necessary to complete Form 13H and fulfill the LTID disclosure requirements; and (3) establish a limit on the number of identification numbers that would be required to be maintained for each account, and reported for each transaction, by broker-dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See DTC Participant Operating Procedures, Section M, ID System Procedures (April 1983). DTC also has established a similar system for international institutional activity called the International Institutional Delivery System (``IID System'').  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27545 (December 18, 1989) 54 FR 53017 (December 26, 1989). The IID System varies from the ID System in that it does not provide a mechanism for automated book-entry settlement. DTC has proposed enhancements to the ID System that would unify existing ID and IID Systems into an ``Interactive ID System.'' See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33010 (October 4, 1993), 58 FR 53007 (October 13, 1993); and DTC An Interactive Option for the Institutional Delivery System, Memorandum to Participants and Other ID Users (March 31, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

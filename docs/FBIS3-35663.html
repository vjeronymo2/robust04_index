He graduated from the Faculty of Art  at the Art and Theatrical Institute in Yerevan. He worked in  the Department for CIS Countries in the Armenian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. Since January 1993, he has been representing  the interests of Armenia in Georgia.    [Abgarova]Sir, what is the specific nature of your work  in Georgia?    [Khachatryan] The fact that, until recently, we were part of  the same state is the first thing that leaves its mark on  diplomatic relations between our states. Therefore, we have  very many similar problems that are of an objective nature. At  the same time, it is easy for me to work in Georgia because our  peoples are tied by ancient and close bonds of friendship. My  one aim is to strengthen those constructive relations that  already exist. Unfortunately, the events of recent years have  had an effect on these relations. One cannot forget the  reaction of Armenians living in Georgia to, let us say, the  incorrect policy conducted between one and one-half and two  years ago by the former authorities in Georgia regarding all  national minorities and Armenians in particular. I am happy  that the policy of justice has emerged victorious. The recent  measures aimed at restoring order in the Dmanisskiy and  Marneulskiy rayons are clear confirmation of this.    [Abgarova]Traditional relations between our states were  built on a mutually beneficial basis. How do matters stand  today?    [Khachatryan] Yes, common sense and a realistic policy have  always determined our relations with Georgia. After all, all  Armenia's vital communications pass through the territory of  Georgia and this is how all cargoes of strategic importance for  us are transported. Although there are, of course, problems --  I have in mind the explosions along the gas pipelines and the  railroad -- these can be resolved. Georgia's policy at this  stage makes us hope for the better. We hope that Georgia's  entry into the CIS will create that basis that, in future, will  enable us to resolve all problems between our states. As  regards economic relations between our countries, they bear a  clear interstate character: The transportation of goods through  the territory of Georgia is paid for by Armenia according to  universally accepted prices. Of course, the shortage of  electric power in Georgia is also having an effect on our lives.  However, I repeat that all these problems can be resolved. All  Armenia's potential can be useful for Georgia. First and  foremost, this concerns shipments to and from Iran and Turkey.  The railroad to Turkey runs through Armenia.    [Abgarova]How do you view the problem of the resolution  of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia?    [Khachatryan] First of all, I would not like to draw  parallels between these conflicts. I have been in Abkhazia  several times and I have many friends there. Therefore, I  cannot view those events wholly as an impartial observer.  Unlike in Abkhazia where autonomy existed in the full sense of  this word and where the Abkhazian population, despite being in  the minority, was not oppressed in any way, the Armenian people  in Nagorno-Karabakh, who form the overwhelming majority of the  population, were subjected to terrible suppression. There were  no contradictions in Abkhazia that could not have been resolved  and, in general, I believe that this conflict was inflated from  the start and was somewhat artificial. I believe that this  conflict can only be resolved by peaceful means and this is  precisely what will happen. The most important thing in  Nagorno- Karabakh at the moment is a cease-fire and a halt to  the bloodshed. Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be determined by  Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia will sign any document  in this respect that will suit both sides equally. Of course,  both sides will have to seek a compromise solution.</p>

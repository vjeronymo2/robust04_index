			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> BANNER SALES;  </P> <P> A FLAG STORE IS CASHING IN AS MORE PEOPLE FLY OLD GLORY BECAUSE OF THE MIDEAST  CONFRONTATION.  </P> <P> As military activity in the Mideast gradually escalates, so does business at  American Eagle Flags and Banners in Ventura.  </P> <P> "People tell me, 'I'm going to fly the flag until this mess is over,' "  co-owner Frances Harwood said. "One woman said her son-in-law was called to  action and she would fly it until he got back."  </P> <P> What have been the fastest selling flags recently? "Marine flags," Harwood  said. "I sold out, reordered and sold out again. People are seeing more Marine  flags with the boys over there. I usually sell about one every three months,  but I've sold 12 in the last two weeks."  </P> <P> Congratulations to Ventura's Joseph Harper, who just returned from the national  canoe championships in Indianapolis with four gold medals and one silver medal.  Ventura Olympic canoe and kayak teammate Jim Werland picked up two golds and  another member, Mark Collitch, won the all-around points competition.  </P> <P> And a belated congrats to Norman Pollak of Westlake, he of the iron stomach.  Earlier this month, Pollak won his Optimist Club's annual pie-eating contest.  According to his good friend and publicist Lynn Richards, "He won because he  was the only one who didn't get sick."  </P> <P> Always a sign of good eating.  </P> <P> Ever since the motion picture came out, Dick Tracy's silhouette and machine gun  have been plastered everywhere. Who do we have to thank for this? In large  part, Camarillo artist Jonny Kwan, who had a hand in most of the design work  involving the movie logos and posters.  </P> <P> While working on the project, Kwan had a chance to meet some of the stars in  the film.  </P> <P> Warren Beatty: "He had control over everything. He had a lot of power, but he  has good taste," Kwan said. "Working with him was really nice. He has an air  about him."  </P> <P> Al Pacino: "Pacino was sitting two chairs away from me; I didn't know who it  was until Warren Beatty said, 'Big Al, how are you doing?' I just thought he  was an old man because of his makeup."  </P> <P> Madonna: "She looked at a drawing and said it was a little too dark. That was  her response. I didn't pay too much attention to it. Meeting her was a  memorable experience, but she was dressed up very plain. She was very ordinary  at the time. Everything is makeup and lighting."  </P> <P> Anyone notice the hand-drawn sign on Valentine Road that reads "Recycling  Center" and has an arrow that looks like it's pointing to the Ivy Lawn  cemetery?  </P> <P> As you may be aware, September has been designated National Piano Month by none  other than the National Piano Foundation. (Of course, it's also National  Cholesterol Education Month, National Honey Month and National Courtesy Month,  but we have limited space.)  </P> <P> In honor of the keyboard, we spoke to Dorothy Schecter, a 20-year veteran of  teaching piano and a piano professor at Cal Lutheran University, to find out  how instruction in the '90s compares to that of years past.  </P> <P> Number of students: Schecter has noticed wide fluctuation. "Ten years ago, I  noticed a drop off, possibly attributed to the lessening of the arts in the  public schools," she said. "But in the last two years, I've seen an upswing.  Enrollment in private lessons and classes at Cal Lutheran has almost tripled."  She partially attributes the increase to computerized instruction.  </P> <P> Embarrassing moments: Whether past or present, horror stories are a given. "One  time I told my students to dress nicely for a recital, but not to be drab. One  student wore a black dress and the hottest pink shoes . . . they blinded the  audience."  </P> <P> Schecter also vividly remembers a particularly awkward moment of her own. "I  remember playing a piece and having two of the keys fly off in my face." LEO  SMITH  </P></p>

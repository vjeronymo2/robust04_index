			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Solvent emission cut may hit output, warns Saab Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker, warned yesterday it would cut production and slide back into losses if it was forced to meet demands that it sharply reduce solvent emissions from the paint shop at its manufacturing plant in the city of Trollhattan. Environmentalists are calling on the state body which sets industrial pollution limits to force Saab, jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania, to adjust immediately to solvent emission levels of 550 tonnes a year officially set for its plant instead of the concessionary limit of 850 tonnes Saab currently operates within. 'If we cannot get a deferral we must reduce our production drastically to stay under the emission limit, which would lead to a loss this year,' Mr Peter Moller, Saab's development and production chief told a public hearing held by the Concessions Authority. The authority, which is also considering emission levels for Volvo, Saab's Swedish rival, said it would rule on the issue in August. Swedish companies face some of the toughest environmental regulations in Europe. The big forestry industry has been forced to spend heavily on reducing effluent emissions over the past decade. Saab is on target to make a profit this year for the first time in six years thanks in large part to the success of its new 900 model launched in 1993. But this depends on increasing production significantly. Total unit sales, the vast majority produced at Trollhattan, are projected to rise to more than 90,000 in 1994 from 73,600 last year. The company is planning a SKr1bn (Pounds 84m) investment to install a water-based paint factory which will bring solvents emissions down to the government target of 275 tonnes a year by 2000. But it insists it cannot bring down emissions immediately without slowing or stopping production.</p>

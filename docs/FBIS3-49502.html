Basta, deputy chairman of the Federal Security and  Information Service (FBIS) [FSIS] in 1990-91, was reacting to a  statement made today by Stanislav Devaty, current Security and  Information Service (BIS) director and FBIS deputy director  until December 1992. In an interview with CTK Devaty dismissed  allegations that the FBIS had actively worked against Clinton as  "not based on fact."    Basta told CTK he had much evidence to support his claim  that  the FBIS wanted to discredit Clinton by publishing information  about his contacts with the family of Marie Svermova in January  1970, when he visited Prague as a student.    Svermova, who died in 1992, was the widow of Jan Sverma, a  communist and journalist who died during the anti-Nazi Slovak  National Uprising in 1944. Svermova, expelled from the  Communist Party in 1951, was a protagonist of the "Prague  Spring" reform movement in 1968 and one of the first signatories  of the Charter 77 human rights statement.    Basta recalled an article published by the former daily  METROPOLITNI TELEGRAF on November 3, 1992, whose author, Lubor  Kohout, a former agent of the post-November 1989 secret service,  wrote that Svermova's relatives, who hosted Clinton in Prague in  1970, collaborated at the end of the 1940s and at the beginning  of the 1950s with the Czechoslovak secret services. "To retrieve  this classified data from military counter-intelligence files  more than 40 years old required expert team work. This could  not be done by journalists, but exclusively by the  counter-intelligence," Basta told CTK.    He also pointed out Kohout's article carried by the Czech  right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK today devoted to a member of  Bush's former campaign staff. The article's authors were  interested in contacts between his staff and the Czechoslovak  secret service during the American election campaign.    In this connection Basta ruled out the possibility that U.S.  authorities would have requested the FBIS to provide any  information. "Americans would never do anything like this,"  Basta stressed.</p>

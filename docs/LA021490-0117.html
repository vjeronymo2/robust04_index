			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> EXPANSION OF BRIDGES STIRS HEATED DEBATE  </P> <P> Nearly 100 residents showed up at the City Council chambers Tuesday night to  debate June ballot measures involving two pedestrian bridges on Yale Avenue.  </P> <P> Two groups of residents have been arguing for several years over the expansion  of the two bridges, one over the San Diego Freeway and the other over the Santa  Fe Railroad tracks, to allow allow vehicular traffic.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the City Council tentatively voted to place one measure, the  Neighborhood Preservation Initiative, on the ballot. A final vote will come at  its next meeting.  </P> <P> The Yale Initiative, a measure to expand the bridges, has already has been  placed on the ballot.  </P> <P> Leslie Pyle, a member of CAUTION, a residents' group opposed to the expansions,  told the council Tuesday: "I don't want the citizens of Irvine to either say  yes or no on a subject they know nothing about. What happens in June will  affect our neighborhoods and our children, not theirs."  </P> <P> Audrey Tkachenko said: "We were told the traffic would go around the community,  not right through the community. What about the children?"  </P> <P> The meeting was punctuated by several outbursts from angry residents, and  Councilman Cameron Cosgrove repeatedly asked the crowd to show composure.  </P> <P> One June ballot measure, called the Yale Initiative, would allow the bridges to  be widened up to four lanes.  </P> <P> The Neighborhood Preservation Plan, which was tentatively placed on the ballot  Tuesday night, would prevent current and future attempts at similar bridge  expansions throughout the city.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran, who supports the latter measure, cited potential dangers  posed by bridges and their expansion. "Bridges are costly, but beyond dollar  costs, they are an issue of great safety," he said.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, Calling the Neighborhood Preservation  Initiative "a can of worms," lambasted the mayor for "confusing the voters."  </P> <P> "Mayor Agran has put together this initiative just to confuse voters," she  said. "Voters could have simply voted to not build the bridges, without this  new initiative. But what is new in Irvine politics?" JOE BEL BRUNO  </P></p>

			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> Article by Toshimasa Makino, Vice President of Ship </F> Ironworks and Defense Division, Sumitomo Heavy Industries    [Text] Although being asked to write a piece for the ``Free  Talk'' column in Defense Technology is a great honor,  as a person who was in the midst of the business of civilian  demand until several months ago, I actually feel somewhat lost.  However, because national defense is very important to the  country, I consented because of the benefits of having a  connection to the technology through my work.    Examining recent economic trends, a little anxiety is  apparent. The media has complacently offered discussions on the  widespread stagnation in consumption and uneven distribution of  money following the collapse of the inflated economy, the  unbalance between supply and demand by excess equipment, or the  absence of required purchases. However, the clear-cut reason is  simply that the economy has not recovered. I feel that the  positive aspects must be stressed and lead in that direction.    I still clearly remember that a few years ago the media  primarily tended to discount the importance of manufacturing  industries. As a result, a large number of university students  studying science and technology looked for jobs at securities  companies, banks, and distribution companies. At the time,  university professors frowned upon this. In a country like Japan  that is populous but poor in natural resources, manufacturing  industries are usually very active. It is important for them to  form the basis for expanding the country's economy and enrich  the citizens' lives.    Technology is usually important in stimulating manufacturing  industries. The direct connection to development technology,  production technology, and management technology will become  increasingly important and an injection of human resources may  be needed. In addition, society will probably need to be  educated. The most important element is for technical workers to  endeavor to keep their places of activity accessible, this is  directed in particular at new technical workers.    Based on the conditions in product output to the conditons  in  market input, positioning the origin of ideas on the development  of civilian goods in what is normally called the ``market,''  undertaking the preparation of technology seeds, realizing key  technologies, and surveying market needs, and product planning  are continuing.    Since market needs in the defense industry are often  shrouded  by secrecy, manufacturers find it difficult to understand all of  the needs beforehand. Because extra time is needed during  development and hasty conclusions lead to the inevitable fear of  inefficiencies, trying to conduct a few more discussions among  the concerned parties is needed.    Recently, the fundamental and honest view is to return to  the  origin. Education is influenced by the ebb and flow of the  country and technology supports this.    As a technologist, I would like to fundamentally and  honestly  return to the correct origin and , without being boastful, to  cope with these circumstances. To solidly maintain the nation's  security in the future, I would like to work hard and to guide  technology studies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, Vyacheslav </F> Tomilin]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 23 May -- The Russian and Chinese sides  are attaching great significance to the official visit to the  PRC by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, which begins  on 26 May. Igor Rogachev, Russia's ambassador to China, stated  this today in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents. The  second sitting of the Russian-Chinese inter-governmental  commission for trade, economic, and scientific and technical  cooperation is to open here 24 hours before talks begin between  the two prime ministers. Between six and seven major agreements  are expected to be signed during the visit. A large group of  ministers will be accompanying Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage  omitted]    The proposed documents will supplement a package of  bilateral  agreements concluded in December 1992 during a visit by Boris  Yeltsin. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Valentin Moyiseyev, a top official of the Russian  Foreign Minsitry working with North Korea, has this to say about  Russia's proposals regarding the UN Security Council's draft  resolution on North Korea.    [Begin Moyiseyev recording] We believe the draft resolution  -- and this does not necessary have to be a joint resolution, it  could be an agreed resolution -- should first consider inviting  Pyongyang -- not just Pyongyang alone but other countries  mentioned in our proposal -- for an international conference  aimed at finding a solution to the problems of the Korean  peninsula as a whole. And if this conference fails to achieve  any positive results and after all other political methods of  solving the Korean nuclear problem are tried and failed, only  then can step-by-step sanctions be applied.

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Next Wave festival - New York music For several years the Next Wave festival at the Brooklyn Academy Of Music has given a New York home to the more glamorous stars of new music, dance and theatre: Philip Glass, John Adams and Steve Reich among composers; Mark Morris and Lucinda Childs among choreographers, Robert Wilson among showmen. Many of them will be back but perhaps fearing that the Next Wave was starting to look suspiciously like the Last Wave, the BAM team looked elsewhere for their opening performances. Fine. There must be life out there beyond the dazzle, but not in what we were offered: a musical that would have died as a college show in North Dakota, and a talent spot for aboriginal Americana. The latter event was probably inevitable in Columbus year. Robert Mirabel, who makes and plays his own haunting flutes, trod stealthily among the thistles of historical sensitivity and the nettles of political correctness: he conjured delicate sounds and had an engaging manner, though I would suspect the faunish naivety to have been as carefully applied as the hairfeathers. Pura Fe and her companions were a more unsettling case, inviting the audience to a complacency of guilt and self-congratulation at hearing songs of death and deracination. They were also not very good - though not quite as dire as the musical, Frida, bizarrely with Houston Grand Opera behind it, treating the life of the painter Frida Kahlo with grotesque bio-pic sentimentality. Robert Taub's recital at Merkin Hall was in another galaxy. He is a pianist whose fingers think: every chord comes as something placed and balanced as a considered moment, and when he speeds, as he often does, it is with the exhilaration of a flow of ideas. Thought sounds out too in his programming. Here he began with late Brahms - the Op. 116 Fantasias - after which his selection of three recently published pieces by Berg sounded sunnily at ease: a refreshment before, but also a passage towards, the Sonata that Berg wrote soon afterwards. Following Berg came Babbitt: the Three Compositions of 1947-8 and a new piece, Preludes, Interludes, and Postlude, with the interval to stand in for forty years of achievement in between. Mr Taub's reputation as a Babbitt player is well earned: he senses the poetry and the wit in the music, and he thinks the thought. And Babbitt has responded to his care, accomplishment and devotion with three works in the last decade, a decade in which his music seems to have come to an alpine moment of serenity and distant vision. The counterpoint is light, elegant and courteous in its pace, the rhythm nimble, the large shape  -in this case a sequence of differently textured preludes with interludes and postlude all relating - clear. What remains, of course, is the abstraction, but also the humour and the jazzy bounce. Babbitt in retirement is letting his geniality show through, but at the age of 76 he retains all his fitness of mind.</p>

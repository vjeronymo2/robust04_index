			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose Salvador Munoz, president of the </F> Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Correspondent] Can you give us your opinion on the  electoral process yesterday?    [Munoz] I gladly take this opportunity to address the  Panamanian people and to congratulate them on my own behalf and  on that of my party for the civic spirit demonstrated yesterday.  It shows that we have matured a great deal. I hope that the  same civic spirit displayed yesterday will serve all of us  Panamanians to demand that our government leaders keep their  promises.    We now have two processes: We concluded one, which was to  elect our government leaders. The next one, the next stage of  this democratic process, is to demand of our government leaders  the fulfillment of the mandate we have bestowed on them. I am  drafting a note to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares congratulating  him on his victory and reminding him that our country faces  serious problems in the next five years and that all Panamanians  hope he will always act in the interests of our fatherland.    [Correspondent] There are many people in Panama, especially  the adversaries of Dr. Perez Balladares, who believe that the  PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] -- which we assume won the  elections -- could signify a return to militarism, reprisals,  and persecution. How do you view the PRD's return to power?    [Munoz] I have no doubt whatsoever that some people will try  to collect on the debts they are owed, so to speak.  Nevertheless, I think that Dr. Perez Balladares has enough  talent to realize that such a situation in Panama would cause a  confrontation. He must also understand that even though he won,  he has 70 percent of the people against him. He won with 30  percent of the votes, which we must respect and support, but he  also has 70 percent of the people against him. I don't think  that he, being the talented man that he is, would allow the  feelings or the political misconceptions of some party member to  create a situation for him that would provoke a confrontation,  which would make it even more difficult for his government. I  don't think that will happen.    [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself part of the  opposition to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares?    [Munoz] I am another Panamanian who headed a political  party.  I am waiting with my party for a reasonable time period to pass  to take the political measures we consider advisable.    [Correspondent] Thank you for your statements to Radio KW  Continente.    [Munoz] Thank you again for the opportunity to reiterate my  message to the people congratulating them for the way they  behaved yesterday and to remind them that it is the people's  obligation not only to vote but to demand of their government  leaders fulfillment of their promises and, therefore, to demand  their attention whenever they deem it necessary. Thank you very  much.</p>

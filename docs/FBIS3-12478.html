The statement added: We, the pursued Fatah hawks inside and  outside the occupied territories, demand that the 'Arafat  leadership halt its negotiations with the Zionist enemy.  Similarly, we demand all fighting Palestinian factions to unify  themselves in the crucible of the revolution and armed struggle  against enemy troops and the hordes of settlers, who are engaged  in murder and terrorism against our Palestinian people, who are  fighting the Zionist injustice and repression.    Concluding their statement, the Fatah hawks said: Our  people's dignity cannot be safeguarded unless we extricate our  national rights by force, just as they have been usurped by  force.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jamil al-Tarifi, chairman of the Palestinian </F> Civil Coordination Committee, by Tawfiq 'Abid in Amman; date not  given]    [Excerpts] ['Abid] Palestinian-Israeli contacts are under  way in preparation for the forthcoming negotiations. Where have  these contacts reached and what is the agenda of negotiations?    [Al-Tarifi] The Cairo agreement is not a detailed agreement.  There are economic, security, civil, and other committees which  are following up the implementation of this agreement.  Palestinian-Israeli contacts and non-negotiating sessions are  being held, but they all revolve around the appropriate method  to implement the agreement in the best possible way.    According to the Oslo agreement, the phase of negotiations  on  early jurisdictions and redeployment of the Israeli Army should  commence immediately after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho  accord. This redeployment should be outside the residential  areas--cities, villages, and camps.    Regarding the early negotiations, intensive contacts are  underway to resume negotiations as soon as possible. I think  negotiations can begin within two weeks on early jurisdictions,  which include five areas. These are tourism, social affairs,  education, health, and direct taxes. However, following the  Hebron massacre and the Cairo agreement, it has become clear  that in addition to the five early jurisdictions there should be  agreement on other jurisdictions. This is what we are are going  to do within the next few days, God willing.    ['Abid] In the light of Hebron incidents, is there a new  negotiating agenda?    [Al-Tarifi] The early jurisdictions were five, in addition  to  what the two sides may agree on. However, it emerged after the  Hebron incidents that there should be more jurisdictions and we  should agree to the nature of these additional jurisdictions.  This is what we will negotiate very soon.    ['Abid] How do you evaluate the start of the formation of  the  Palestinian authority and the performance of the national  security forces in Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Tarifi] I can say that every Palestinian and Arab takes  pride in the performance of the Palestinian forces. In spite of  the shortage of available means, these forces performed  splendidly and the Palestinian people embraced them right from  the beginning. We were afraid that the people's zeal over the  return of the Palestinian security forces would soon abate, but  now that the Palestinian celebrations marking their return are  over, the citizens continue to be satisfied with their good  performance. Our people under the Palestinian authority are  psychologically comfortable. They are aware of the difference  between occupation and the new situation. There are no more  curfews, freedom restrictions, arrests, or storming of houses.    ['Abid] Some speak of Israeli violations of the Cairo  agreement. The latest was made by Dr. Sha'th. What is your  comment?    [Al-Tarifi] The agreement exists and certainly there will be  some violations from both sides. There are Israeli violations  and there may be violations on our side. What is important is  to resolve differences through the coordination committee  without leaving any traces on which any future misunderstanding  might be built and eventually affect the agreement.    ['Abid] What about the Jericho crossing point? The  agreement was signed more than one and a half months ago, but  the situation at the crossing points is still the same.    [Al-Tarifi] It is known that independent Palestinian offices  with a Palestinian flag will be established at the Jericho and  Rafah crossing points. These offices will house a director, an  administrative and security deputy, and Palestinian policemen.  There will also be Israeli offices. I believe the relevant  arrangements will be finalized within a week or 10 days at most,  after which Palestinian policemen will arrive at the Rafah  crossing point. As for the King Husayn Bridge, the arrangements  will be discussed during a meeting between President 'Arafat and  Yitzhaq Rabin in the near future.    ['Abid] Why do you think President 'Arafat's arrival in the  self-rule area has been postponed?    [Al-Tarifi] To begin with, we want the president to arrive  in this area as soon as possible, so the sooner he arrives the  better. However, I have this to say: Any Palestinian official  who tells the media that the president will arrive in one or two  weeks, and also any Palestinian official arriving in the  territories claiming that he will prepare for the president's  arrival is not telling the truth. 'Arafat has never announced  that he would arrive after a certain period of time or that he  would postpone such an arrival.    As far as I know, President 'Arafat will arrive in the near  future. We in the territories need his early arrival, and I  believe that 'Arafat understands the situation well. No doubt,  arranging the Palestinian people's situation is very important,  particularly with regard to the institutions, the cadres' entry,  and the securing of financial aid to the Palestinian forces,  institutions, and authority. President 'Arafat is working for  these objectives day and night.    ['Abid] You are leaving for Tunis. Are you carrying  Palestinian or Israeli ideas or messages to the Palestinian  leadership on the coming negotiations?    [Al-Tarifi] I am going to Tunis, and I shall be discussing  many issues with President 'Arafat. In fact, we are in daily  contact with 'Arafat to brief him on the situation in the  territories. However, some issues are difficult to discuss on  the telephone, so they should be discussed face to face. These  issues are related to the coming negotiations, specifically the  early jurisdictions, the overall situation in the territories,  and the Palestinian authority.    I would like to say that I am not carrying Israeli ideas. As  head of the Civil Coordination Committee, I meet with Israeli  officials several times a week to follow up on implementing the  civil aspects of the Cairo agreement and also on future  negotiations. However, there is no Israeli concept apart from  the one expressed as part of both the overall peace process and  the issues proposed for discussions.    ['Abid] Frankly speaking, what is your comment on the recent  developments in the negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track?    [Al-Tarifi] In fact, we welcome the Jordanian step, and we  believe that it complements the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.  This confirms that we did not sign a separate agreement with  Israel and that we support completing the peace process on other  Arab tracks. It was clear, however, that the Palestinian side  did not let anyone decide its own destiny. The Palestinian  people have a leadership that coordinates with all Arab parties  . It is true that the Oslo agreement was not publicized because  the talks were held in secret, but all Arab parties were fully  briefed on the Cairo negotiations. I would like to emphasize  that our relationship with Jordan is an integral one, and that  we are one people. Consequently, we believe that the Jordanian  approach is correct, and we hope it will bear fruit soon.    As Palestinians, we are interested in joining the Arab ranks  and we do not want to rush westward. We, however, want to go  westward along with our brothers in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and  Egypt after reaching an understanding on agreed issues.    ['Abid] What is your comment on the remarks made by His  Highness Crown Prince Hasan the Regent regarding the  establishment of a federal state [dawlah ittihadiyah] east of  Israel on the two banks of the River Jordan?    [Al-Tarifi] This is a purely Jordanian matter, into which we  will not poke our noses. For His Royal Highness Prince Hasan  has the right to choose the name he likes for his country. The  name the United Hashemite Kingdom is fine with us if the  Jordanian people and leadership endorse this.    As for us, the successive sessions of the Palestine National  Council [PNC] have endorsed confederation between the two banks  of the River Jordan. A confederation is based on two separate  political entities that complement one another. [passage  omitted]    ['Abid] Some believe that there has been a delay in the  return of the PLO cadres, particularly civilian cadres, to Gaza  and Jericho, and that the promises made to the Palestinians have  not been kept. In your opinion, what is behind all this?    [Al-Tarifi] There are attempts to brand the Palestinian  authority as impotent, to say that it will remain so, and that  it will fail. Well, we are not sitting at doorsteps, begging  for aid. Nonetheless, we believe that Arab and foreign countries  owe us certain rights, particularly since the Palestinian  debacle is the outcome of Arab and international developments.    I believe that some aid has been received. At the recent  conference held by donor nations, it was agreed to provide the  self- rule authority with $42 million, with the understanding  that the aid will be resumed so that Palestinian institutions  can perform their tasks. The picture is not so bleak or gloomy.  But, there are many parties that seek to depict us as failures.  These parties want to say that what has taken place on the  Palestinian territories has been no more than ceremonial events  that have come to an end.    By the way, I would like to say that the Palestinian  leadership has concluded a telecommunications agreements with an  international firm so that we may not remain tied to the Israeli  telecommunications corporation. A similar agreement has been  concluded with an international electrical firm to supply the  Gaza Strip with electric power so that we may not remain hostage  to the Israelis.    A third agreement has been signed with another firm to  supply  the Palestinian authority with oil from the international  market. This firm has obtained a concession, and it will have  huge storage tanks in Gaza.    Additionally, the Palestinian authority has signed two  tenders for the construction of two airports, one in Gaza and  the other in Jericho. A contract has also been signed to  construct a fishing port in Gaza. Another contract has been  signed to build housing units in the autonomous areas. Within  the next few weeks, efforts to carry out these tenders, the  overall cost of which exceeds $1.5 billion, will begin.  [passage omitted]    ['Abid] The Cairo agreement has not thus far been endorsed  by  the Palestinian legislative bodies. Have any arrangements been  made for the holding of a PNC session?    [Al-Tarifi] I believe that the PLO Central Council, and not  the PNC, may hold a session in the territories. Right now, all  our efforts are focused on entrenching our presence in the  territories.    The Israeli authorities have approved the repatriation of  most members of the PLO Central Council. So, the PLO Central  Council may convene in Palestine. And consequently, it could  debate the agreement.</p>

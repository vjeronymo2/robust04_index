			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENT CONTROL SEEN AS UNJUST, HARMFUL  </P> <P> Why is there such turmoil with Santa Monica rent control and its board? Very  simple, it doesn't work.  </P> <P> As much as (Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights) and the proponents of this  unjust system proclaim that it works, the results are obvious.  </P> <P> We have deteriorating apartment buildings, under-the-table bribes for vacant  units (which are going to wealthy tenants), an out-of-control Rent Control  Board whose budget is greater than the Los Angeles board's.  </P> <P> This uncontrolled monster, rent control, forces some of our elected officials  to push for unwanted projects, like the airport development, for the sole  purpose of increased revenue for the city.  </P> <P> The political pendulum is swinging, and a needed change in an archaic system is  about to happen.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has lived with decontrol-recontrol for over 12 years. The results  there are a competitive rental market, with effective rents staying the same  for the past several years.  </P> <P> Rent subsidies are important for the truly needy. But they should be handled  like food stamps so that all taxpayers subsidize the program, not a select few  landlords.  </P> <P> ROD DELSON  </P> <P> president,  </P> <P> Santa Monica Board of Realtors  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> 'ART AND ARCHITECTURE' BUILDS ON INFIRM FOUNDATION  </P> <P> When I first drove around Orange County four years ago, I was struck by several  unfamiliar sights: breathtaking views of the ocean, strange flocks of bobbing  dinosaurlike oil wells and sprawling swaths of ugly new buildings.  </P> <P> Even after closer acquaintance, it seems clear that -- except for a sprinkling  of redoubtable old structures (such as the Old Orange County Courthouse in  Santa Ana) and a very few distinctive contemporary ones (such as Michael  Graves' San Juan Capistrano Library) -- the county is largely an architectural  desert.  </P> <P> That makes the idea of an exhibit of Orange County artists' views of  architecture particularly beguiling. How do artists dream about space? And how  are their viewpoints shaped by living in a world of lowbrow buildings?  </P> <P> "Art and Architecture" at the Art Store Gallery (through Sept. 26) contains  work by 10 county artists that deals with such topics as suburban interiors,  ecological balance, postmodern stylishness and the ways light and space can  interact. Although -- as is often the case with theme shows -- some irrelevant  and unformed pieces seem to have been dragged in out of sheer desperation,  several works offer fresh points of view.  </P> <P> Angie Bray's "Blind Window/Blank Wall" is the most minimal and delicate of  these: A series of seven white-lacquered wire rectangles are attached on one  side to the wall, each positioned slightly above the next. Hanging from the top  of each rectangle, like a window shade, is a single sheet of white handmade  paper.  </P> <P> The shadow patterns created by lights beamed on the rectangles differ ever so  slightly from one to another and vary according to the viewer's position and  the smallest gusts of air. The first rectangle -- bent in such a way that its  silhouette looks somewhat like a coat swinging out as its wearer walks --  allows the paper to hang straight down. The others, twisting more discreetly,  allow the paper to fly back or forth or curl up slightly.  </P> <P> With roots in minimalism and the light-and-space movement, the piece offers a  gentle reverie on a basic component of architecture. Instead of penetrating  solid wall, as windows do, these forms "draw" on it with the help of light,  which real window blinds are designed to block out.  </P> <P> Paul Urban, who graduated from the masters program at Cal State Fullerton a few  years ago, offers a promising group of small, punchy paintings that incorporate  one or two capitalized words -- rather like skewed environmentally aware  versions of old-fashioned school primers.  </P> <P> In "Bumper Crop," stacks of identical cars (like ears of corn in an  agricultural yield diagram) fill in the contours of a giant building that rises  against a blowup of an interstate map crossed with red arteries. "Concrete  Hillside," an oxymoron if ever there was one, offers an abstract pattern of  man-made wavy-contoured "fields."  </P> <P> Janice De Loof specializes in simple compositions of tiny profiled chairs and  lone barking dogs within bland, blank interiors. In a slight departure from  this formula, "Desert View/Conversation," a mixed-media pastel, shows profiled  figures sitting passively with their arms at their sides in sparsely furnished  rooms that have no floors -- which seems to paint a portrait of Sunbelt  dwellers as rootless folk whose minds may be as unfurnished as their houses.  But, as in De Loof's other works, a cheery air of suburban uplift (bright  colors, "cute," tiny objects) waters down the stark flavor the artist seems to  be after.  </P> <P> Linda Kallan's rather self-consciously stylized paintings of airless spaces are  littered with askew facades in rich marbleized hues and lurching poles casting  strong shadows. Poised somewhere between abstraction and figuration, these  images suggest a bruised, impermanent world of vague menace and delicate  balances.  </P> <P> The works by Claremont Colleges graduate student Aaron Parazette, however --  pink enamel paintings with cutouts representing the window-grid cliches of  International Style office buildings -- merely co-opt the blandness of their  architectural sources.  </P> <P> Karen Cummings' post-earthquake, cracked "Cement House" and her charred-wood,  rope-fastened "Burnt House" are reminders of the ultimate fragility of our  domiciles. Cummings, a graduate student at UC Irvine, is moving toward strong,  elemental imagery that is still perhaps too much in thrall to the superficial  tenets of good design.  </P> <P> John Hesketh's eerily lighted Cibachrome photographs wander off in several  directions without quite reaching any particular destination. In "Pickets,"  cemetery crosses, dog paws and a pair of bare human feet mysteriously enter the  unearthly green plot of grass inside a tidy picket fence. The effect is rather  like combining the plot of a children's book with the outre film "Blue Velvet."  </P> <P> Other artists in the show are Doug Moran (inadequately represented by a few  hard-to-decipher mixed-media drawings), Thomas Chambers (whose trendy  asymmetrical vessels seem to have wandered in from another show) and Ray Jacobs  (who does colorful toylike furniture and building facades offering bland,  cutesy takeoffs on postmodernist cliches).  </P> <P> Missing, however -- yup, here comes my theme song -- is a full-fledged essay  that comes right out and comments on what connection, if any, these pieces seem  to have with the environment in which the artists live and work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Art and Architecture" continues through Sept. 26 at the Art Store Gallery,  4040 Campus Drive, Newport Beach. The gallery is open from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Mondays through Fridays and from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Admission is  free. Information: (714) 250-7353.  </P> <P> </P></p>

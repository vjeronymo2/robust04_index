			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- The whole nation will  never pardon the crimes of the South Korean authorities, who  blocked the Seoul trip of a delegation of the North side,  ruthlessly trampling down even the human morality, the beautiful  manners and customs handed down from the ancestors and warm  compatriotic feelings, and history will surely pass a stern  judgement on them.    The North side headquarters of the National Alliance for the  Country's Reunification says this in a statement released today  in connection with the fact that a delegation of the North side  could not participate in the memorial service on the one  hundredth day after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan due to the  obstructive moves of the South Korean authorities.    The statement says:    This time, the South Korean authorities proved again that  they are separatists who block even a small-scale contact of  fellow countrymen, let alone national reconciliation and unity  and the reunification of the country.    The Korean nation cannot live in peace with the  anti-national  group left alone, the group which lowers the check-bar before  fellow countrymen going to the South for a memorial service,  while rendering the situation extremely strained in league with  outside forces.</p>

This emergency rule implements a simultaneous closure of redefined Closed Area I, the Nantucket Lightship Closed Area, and Closed Area II; a prohibition on scallop vessels in the closed areas; a disallowance of any fishery utilizing mesh smaller than the minimum mesh size allowed for regulated species, with the exception of fisheries that have been determined to have a catch of less than 5 percent by weight of regulated species; a prohibition on the possession of regulated species while fishing with small mesh; a requirement that all mobile gear vessels fishing in the Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge areas, with the exception of mid-water trawl vessels, use 6-inch (15.24-cm) square mesh codends; and an increase in the minimum mesh size in the Southern New England and Nantucket Lightship Regulated Mesh Areas to 6-inch (15.24-cm) diamond or square mesh.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  December 12, 1994, through March 12, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) supporting this action may be obtained from Jon C.

The Amendment contained provisions that the Council believed would eliminate the overfished condition of cod, yellowtail flounder, and haddock. Amendment 5 was approved by NMFS on January 3, 1994. Most measures were implemented on March 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Meanwhile, NMFS issued an emergency rule, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 3, 1994 (59 FR 26) and effective from January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994, to protect the seriously depleted stocks of haddock. The emergency rule established a 500 lb (226.8 kg) possession limit for haddock; began the closure of an expanded Closed Area II on January 3, 1994, rather than February 1, 1994; and implemented several other measures to protect haddock. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 on March 1, 1994, permanently put into place several measures that were contained in the emergency rule. Other measures in the emergency rule that were not contained in the proposed rule for Amendment 5 were continued in effect by the final rule, and would have expired on April 2, 1994, as provided by the emergency rule, but for its extension through further rulemaking, effective through June 30, 1994. The final rule for Amendment 6 to the FMP (59 FR 32134, June 22, 1994) was made effective beginning June 30, 1994, and continued on a permanent basis three measures originally imposed by the January 3, 1994, emergency rule to protect depleted haddock stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 5 allows for regulatory adjustments through the framework abbreviated rulemaking procedure codified in 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. Although four frameworks have been implemented (Frameworks 1, 3, 4, and 6), only Framework 3 and Framework 6 pertain directly to increased protection of multispecies. Framework Adjustment 3 (59 FR 36725, July 19, 1994) limited the amount of regulated species allowed on board vessels fishing with small mesh to either 500 lb (226.8 kg) or 10 percent of the weight of non-regulated species, whichever is less. Framework Adjustment 6 (59 FR 47815, September 19, 1994) increased the minimum mesh size from 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm) in the Cultivator Shoal whiting (silver hake) fishery. Two other framework adjustments, Framework Adjustment 2 and Framework Adjustment 5, were withdrawn and put on hold, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

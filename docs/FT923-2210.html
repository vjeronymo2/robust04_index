			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec agrees freeze at 24.2m barrels THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night pledged that its market share in the fourth quarter of 1992 should be 24.2m barrels a day, with an allowance for additional production by Kuwait. The final communique from the Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting in Geneva made clear that the agreement was designed 'to attain the minimum reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel' for the Opec basket of crudes. The reference price stood at Dollars 19.46 as the meeting began on Wednesday but has averaged just above Dollars 18 for 1992. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, welcomed the pledge, saying he thought it would give a 'big impetus' to oil prices. However, Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iranian oil minister, said he did not accept the communique which 'really does not effectively help prices'. The substance of the communique was broadly in line with what some Opec-watchers had predicted before the meeting, and effectively implies that most members will continue to pump at present levels. With Kuwaiti production likely to increase by between 200,000 and 300,000 b/d in the fourth quarter, however, it means that total Opec output should reach about 24.5m b/d. However, analysts noted that the communique referred rather vaguely to 'market share' and not to a production ceiling, and also gave no details of how the 24.2m b/d figure was to be divided among member countries. They were also worried by Iran's failure to embrace the communique, and that no formal agreement was actually signed. Mr Nazer said Saudi Arabia, responsible for more than a third of Opec's output, would accept the 24.2m b/d figure. Asked about his expectations for oil prices, he replied: 'I hope they will go up.' Mr Aghazadeh, however, said an opportunity had been missed for Opec to 'adjust production and help the revenue to our countries'. Iranian officials had earlier told reporters the republic was pressing for total Opec production to be cut to no more than 24m b/d. It threatened to increase its own production to compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from the recent fall in the value of the dollar. The Iranian minister said after the meeting he believed the difference between the 22.98m b/d production ceiling adopted by Opec's February meeting  -and rolled over in May - and the 24.2m b/d in the new communique 'belongs to those who have the additional production capacity to meet this'.</p>

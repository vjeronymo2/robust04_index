			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Militants vow defiance at temple site HINDU militants at Ayodhya in northern India yesterday stepped up construction of a temple at a disputed site, increasing prospects of confrontation with the Uttar Pradesh state government. Their move came as all-party talks in New Delhi failed to reach a political consensus on the issue. Fourteen hours of talks on Saturday ended in failure to resolve a dispute over building a temple to Lord Rama on a site where a 16th-century mosque now stands. A court in Uttar Pradesh last week ordered a halt to the building of the temple, which has ignited bloody religious riots over the past three years and has been a bone of contention for decades. But Hindu leaders on Saturday rejected attempts by local authorities to get them to abandon the building work. Hundreds of supporters of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), the militant wing of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), defied the district magistrate's attempts to implement court orders which prohibited all building activity on the disputed site. 'We will not allow the work to be stopped, and if necessary, we will face bullets,' said VHP general secretary Ashok Singhal after meeting a district magistrate. Prime minister Narasimha Rao told the meeting in Delhi that if the state government continued to be blocked in attempts to enforce the court orders it would amount to 'a breakdown of the constitution'. Mr Rao has been under pressure within his minority Congress party government to invoke a provision allowing the central government to dismiss a state government for law and order reasons. The Uttar Pradesh government is ruled by the BJP, chief rival to the Congress party, which came to power last year on the strength of a campaign to build the temple.</p>

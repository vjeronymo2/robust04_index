			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Working to solve an attitude problem ANDY BERRY recalls how he went to Jaguar with another disabled colleague. 'One bloke took a look at us and he was thinking: 'Do I ask them to leave now, or listen and then get rid of them as soon as possible?' But we could have solved one of his business problems concerning the software for an industrial control system.' Berry has cerebral palsy, a disability in which the brain has difficulty controlling the body's muscles. He has a first class mathematics degree from the then Middlesex Polytechnic and an MSc in computer science taken at the University of Manchester. He now works as a one-man information technology business from the study of his Milton Keynes home. Running a small company is tough enough. When you have a disability it does not make it easier. 'People seem to need persuading I'm serious. Most people sub-consciously feel that I'd somehow be OK if I didn't work. But that is not true. I do not receive any money from the state, not even a mobility allowance. Some of the things people say to me still wind me up.' Berry, who is also a vice chairman of the Spastics Society is a humorous man. Pressing a button on the keyboard of his computer a list of 'goals' appears and one of them is 'Have fun]' He laughs. 'I refuse to work on anything I'm not interested in doing.' One of his bookcases is crammed with Isaac Asimov and Len Deighton books. But he is also very serious about what he does. The other bookcase is loaded with tomes and booklets with titles like New Math CoProcessors, The C Language and Public Domain Powerhouses as well as four books on computer technology he co-authored with two other disabled writers. Most of Berry's work is difficult to grasp for a computer illiterate. One of his contracts is with a US company, EMC. This company is producing a system which will allow you at home to obtain a film on video without walking to a video shop. Instead it will be piped to your television via a satellite link. Another of Berry's contracts is with a Danish enterprise working on methods of transferring television Teletext on to paper. 'What I'm best at is identifying novel solutions and finding people to put them into practice working with me. I tend not to get involved with heavy programing, you know, bashing out reams of codes. A typical programer only writes 20 programs in his life. I've done 30 and that's enough.' Berry's sharp mind contrasts with his slow and distorted speech. He set up his business late last year after working for several large and a few small companies, in some of which he was part owner. He charges Pounds 350 a day for his services and hopes to turn over about Pounds 40,000 in his first full year. Some of his contracts are about to run out and he concedes that he does not have enough on his plate to ensure financial comfort. 'I can just earn enough to survive.' Disability adds to the day-to-day costs of the 41-year-old who lives alone though he will soon share a house with his girl friend, a solicitor who also has cerebral palsy. Berry spends close to Pounds 2,000 a year on taxis and a pair of shoes lasts only a month. A small, home-based business racks up large costs. Berry's yearly telephone bill is around Pounds 4,000. He spends Pounds 4,000 on software. Publicity accounts for a further Pounds 3,000. The personal computer with printer and fax were a one-off buy at about Pounds 5,000. Berry meets a lot of people and tries never to miss a chance to obtain work. Extra-curricular posts include membership of the Central Transport Consultative Committee. 'It can take four or five years from meeting someone to getting business. If I'm in a 'disabled mood' I think it takes that time because I am disabled.' Which brings us back to how people deal with disability. 'A major problem is not with me but with other people's attitudes. Some do not want anything to do with disability. They have some sort of problem dealing with it. Then you get the person who laughs. This is often the receptionist. It is staggering the number of places I ring up and even if I ask to speak to a named individual they nevertheless ask if I want the personnel department because they think I'm looking for a job. It's this whole problem of not treating disabled people seriously. I still haven't learnt to deal with it.' Berry still has the sense of humour to clear up any misunderstanding on how you should write about disability. 'I have cerebral palsy. If you say I suffer from cerebral palsy I'll kill you.'

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOLAND AND ALLERT FIGHT AGAIN OVER ANTI-CRIME TITLE  </P> <P> Clashing again over who is the steelier crime fighter, Assembly candidates  Paula Boland and Irene Allert squabbled Thursday about which of them first  called for an end to early prison releases for repeat sex offenders.  </P> <P> Boland, a Republican, said at a press conference that if she is elected she  plans to introduce a bill prohibiting the early release of twice-convicted  rapists and other sex offenders who accumulate credits for good behavior in  prison.  </P> <P> Considered the front-runner in the GOP-dominated 38th Assembly District, Boland  said she has already written legislation to introduce on her first day in  Sacramento and that "this idea came from me."  </P> <P> But Allert, a Democrat, said in a telephone interview that although she has not  actually drafted a bill, she backs elimination of early releases and has  discussed her support for such legislation in her campaign.  </P> <P> "It's not original at all," she said of Boland's proposed bill. "It's something  that I've talked about."  </P> <P> She also noted that Boland opposes Proposition 133 on Tuesday's ballot, which  contains a provision that would bar early release of those convicted of a  variety of violent crimes, including rape and sexual assault.  </P> <P> The dispute marked the second time in less than two weeks that the candidates  have argued over who has the better anti-crime credentials to represent the  generally conservative 38th District. The seat is open due to the impending  retirement of GOP Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge).  </P> <P> Speaking at a Northridge rape-counseling center, Boland said, "Incredibly, in  this state a rapist" convicted a second time "is not called a 'repeat rapist'  and therefore is given 'good time' off until he strikes for the third time. I'm  outraged that our law books still contain this kind of insanity."  </P> <P> She acknowledged that she has no statistics on how many convicted sex offenders  have been released early, but said she knows the rate is high from reading news  stories and talking with police and sex-crime victims.  </P> <P> Boland charged that her opponent was lying and waging "a campaign of deceit" in  claiming that she was the first to propose keeping sex offenders in prison  longer.  </P> <P> But Allert said she has often discussed the early release problem and other  ways to toughen anti-rape laws during her campaign.  </P> <P> Allert also said that unlike Boland, she supports Proposition 133, which would  raise state sales taxes by a quarter-cent for four years to raise money for  drug enforcement and prevention programs. The initiative also would prohibit  early release of those convicted twice of murder, manslaughter, rape and sexual  assault. Allert said even first-time offenders should serve their full  sentences.  </P> <P> Boland countered that taxpayers want tougher anti-crime laws without higher  taxes. Asked if her bill wouldn't cost the state more in prison costs, Boland  said the state ultimately would save money by not having to arrest and  prosecute convicts more than once.  </P> <P> Allert also criticized Boland for allying herself with the author of a  successful June anti-crime ballot initiative that Allert said jeopardized  abortion rights in California.  </P> <P> The initiative, Proposition 115, mandates that state courts follow federal  rulings in determining criminal procedural rights. It was written by state Sen.  Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim), who attended Boland's press conference and said he  would co-sponsor her bill in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Allert said critics, including Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, while praising  other aspects of the initiative, said it would effectively eliminate the right  to privacy clause in the state Constitution, thereby jeopardizing abortion  rights.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp is sponsoring a measure on Tuesday's ballot, Proposition 129, which  would clarify the ambiguous language in the law and would protect a woman's  right to have an abortion.  </P> <P> Allert, who favors abortion rights, said Royce's appearance with Boland showed  her "insensitivity to the choice issue." Boland opposes abortion except in  cases of rape, incest or medical complications that threaten a mother's life.  </P></p>

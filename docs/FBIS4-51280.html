			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Greece today expressed  its displeasure over statements made by U.S. State Department  Spokesman Mike McCurry who said he had "no reliable evidence to  indicate that the Albanian Government is oppressing the Greek  minority."    Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the  statements by McCurry did not satisfy the Greek Government and  were "inadequate".    Greece's ambassador in Washington, Luukas Tsilas, made  repeated representations to the State Department reiterating  that the Greek positions and explanations were provided,  Venizelos said.    "The State Department," Venizelos continued, "said that the  explanations given were detailed but that they had not been  accurately translated in the statement made by Mr. McCurry when  he briefed reporters in Washington."    Meanwhile, the spokesman rejected claims contained in an  Albanian Foreign Ministry announcement that it had evidence  "proving that six ethnic Greeks were in illegal possession of  arms, had connections with a Greek secret service and were  engaged in secessionist activities."    "No complete and substantiated arguments were ever presented  during the meetings between the Greek and Albanian foreign  ministers in Zurich or between the delegations of the two  countries in Ioannina, northern Greece," Venizelos said.    Venizelos reiterated that Greece was not prepared to be the  target of slanderous, unfounded accusations and had displayed  its good intentions for an improvement in relations with Tirana.    "But the Albanian Government must realize that any  improvement depends on its respect for the human rights of the  Greek minority," Venizelos stressed.    "If there is any evidence," he continued, "it should have  been presented during the diplomatic contacts between Athens and  Tirana. From there on, Albania bears the burden of proving that  it is a state ruled by law."</p>

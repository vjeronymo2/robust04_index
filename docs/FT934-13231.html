			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing for London &amp; Met LONDON &amp; Metropolitan, the property company that was rescued by its banks in 1991 but spent much of the time since in intensive care, yesterday announced terms of another refinancing. The agreement includes the conversion of Pounds 29.8m of debt into ordinary equity, leaving the banks, led by Bank of Scotland, with about 70 per cent of the equity. Existing shareholdings will be diluted down to 25 per cent of the equity. The maturity of a further Pounds 25.8m of debt has been extended and the banks are to make available a new working capital facility of Pounds 4.5m. Some of the group's other banking facilities have been made non-recourse, helping to reduce net liabilities by Pounds 31.7m. The restructuring leaves London &amp; Metropolitan with positive net worth of Pounds 1.2m and assets per share of 2.7p. Before the deal the group had negative net worth of Pounds 60.3m. London &amp; Metropolitan became over-exposed in the late 1980s, a developer-trader with little investment income. In 1991 the banks rescued the company on the assumption that the property market recession would not persist. The company developed, but no longer owns, the Whiteleys shopping complex in Bayswater and Distillers House in St James Square. It still has a small investment portfolio. Mr Chris Harris, chairman and managing director, said the restructuring was a vote of confidence in the current management's ability to take the group forward. 'We have some interesting new opportunities like factory outlet shopping', he said. Under the restructuring preference shares are being converted to deferred shares and cancelled. The group also announced that for the six months to June 30 it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 4.44m) on turnover of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 19.6m). Losses per share were 5.6p compared with 6.8p.</p>

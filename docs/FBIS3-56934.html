			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Nuclear arms should be removed from Ukraine to  Russia within two years, beginning with January 1, 1994. The  protocol signed last September in Massandra provides for this, a  high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax in comments on the  statement made by Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Boris  Tarasyuk, at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday [19 January].    As Interfax already reported, Tarasyuk quoted high-ranking  Russian military officials as saying that nuclear weapons can be  removed from Ukraine within a year. But it is technically  impossible to carry out this withdrawal so quickly, he said.  Besides, Tarasyuk stressed, this would conflict with the  understanding reached between the Russian, Ukrainian and  American presidents on the need to withdraw the weapons and pay  compensation for them simultaneously.    In connection with this, the diplomat pointed out that to  remove all weapons within a year is out of the question. At the  time, when the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met in Massandra  Russian experts declared that Russia has sufficient technical  opportunities for taking nuclear arms out of Ukraine within two  years, he noted. "Our attitude to this issue remains unchanged,"  he said.    With reference to the issue of compensation, the diplomat  pointed out that the documents relating to the meeting between  the Russian, Ukrainian and American presidents in Moscow state  that the removal of nuclear weapons must begin at once.  Solution to the issue of compensation to Ukraine will be  delayed until this May, when experts from the three countries  will meet to discuss criteria for assessing the value of the  weapons in question. "The principle of simultaneousness was not  mentioned," the diplomat said.    According to him, the stand taken by Ukraine's parliament,  which will discuss this issue in the near future, may also turn  into a problem in the materialization of the  Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on nuclear arms.    The diplomat also disagrees with Tarasyuk's opinion to the  effect that Russia allowed too many nuclear warheads to be  concentrated at the places of their storage in Ukraine.  According to Tarasyuk, this led to the current situation which  is an accident waiting to happen. In this connection the Russian  diplomat pointed out that "Kiev seems to have forgotten that it  took the nuclear weapons under its own control administratively,  and prevented Russian specialists from coming near it for a long  time. No wonder the consequences are what they are," the  Russian Foreign Ministry official stressed.    A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigoriy  Karasin, confirmed that Moscow will grant Ukraine heat-producing  elements for the needs of nuclear power plants in compensation  for the nuclear warheads withdrawn from there. Speaking at  Thursday's briefing in Moscow, he added that America's purchase  of part of the uranium obtained as a result of dismantling  nuclear arms will be conducive to resolving financial problems  emerging in this connection.    The process of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament has become  irreversible. This inspires Russia and the world community as a  whole with optimism, Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine, Leonid  Smolyakov, said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow.    According to him, the circumstance that "new people, who  want  to work constructively and who understand the situation in the  right way," have joined Ukraine's Defense Ministry also gives  rise to optimism. He meant the recently appointed defense  minister, Vitaliy Radetskyy, in the first place, the ambassador  said. "This subjective factor will undoubtedly be conducive to  resolving objective problems in the nuclear disarmament area,"  he said.    With reference to the Crimean problem in Russian-Ukrainian  relations, Smolyakov pointed out that "the issues connected with  the structure of the Ukrainian state are Ukraine's internal  affair." "We may have personal attachments and even nostalgic  sentiments toward Crimea, but in our policy we must proceed from  realities," the ambassador noted.    According to him, "the country's leadership has already  begun  to understand that Russia's policy towards the former Soviet  republics should be given foremost importance, even though there  are several unresolved problems, primarily those connected with  financing Russian diplomatic missions in CIS countries."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- President Boris Yeltsin  has promised that Moscow will not conclude any pacts of alliance  with Pyongyang after the Russia-North Korea Friendship,  Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Treaty expires in two years,  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said Friday.    Kim disclosed Yeltsin's pledge during a breakfast meeting  with South Korean correspondents stationed in the Russian  capital.    Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow will neither renew the  current treaty nor conclude any others of similar nature, Kim  said.    The Russia-North Korea treaty, which has been the ground for  relations between the two countries, was concluded in 1961 and  is due to expire at the end of 1996. It will be extended  automatically for another five years unless either side  abrogates it.    The core part of this treaty, which calls for automatic  military intervention by Russia in case of war in Korea, has  practically become "a dead letter," Kim explained.    With regard to possible sanctions against North Korea,  Yeltsin told him that Russia intends to participate when they  have become inevitable after the U.N. Security Council took  necessary steps, including repeated issuance of warnings, Kim  said.    Kim said he was informed of "a top secret" by the Russian  side in connection with problems related to North Korea's  development of nuclear weapons, but he could not disclose it at  this stage.    The president said Yeltsin also promised to make a decision  so that Russia would not sell any weapons or parts to North  Korea under any circumstances.    Commenting on the North Korean lumberjacks fleeing from  Pyongyang-run Siberian logging camps, Kim said he and Yeltsin  agreed that Seoul could bring as many to South Korea as it  wishes.    Kim said the Seoul government plans to bring home all  Koreans  living in Sakhalin if they so desire.    On the shooting down of the Korean Air (KAL) 007 jetliner by  a Soviet fighter plane in 1983, Kim noted that Yeltsin said the  responsibility lies with the airline. This is the basic  official Russian position, Kim said.    But he said the two countries will hold working-level  meetings to discuss the problem of compensating the victims'  families.    As for the development of gas fields in the Russian Far  East,  Kim said South Korea and Russia will invest 10 million U.S.  dollars each to undertake a feasibility study.</p>

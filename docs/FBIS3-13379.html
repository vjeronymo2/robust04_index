Security measures were intensified  around mosques during the past few hours. Army units erected  roadblocks in several areas of the capital and suburbs as part  of these measures.    Meanwhile, the newspaper AL-DIYAR cites the CENTRAL NEWS  AGENCY as saying that the arrests constitute a preventive  security step within the framework of the series of measures  adopted by the security commanders during their coordination  meetings following the explosions and assassination incidents as  well as other security violations.    The paper adds that some of the detained persons include  explosives experts who could shed light on the identity of some  criminals involved in the recent explosions. AL-DIYAR notes  that some of the detained had constant contact and consultations  with Ghidras, and they had also formed security networks in  previous times. The paper says that the security measures aim  to halt the state of confusion and curb the waves of rumors that  preceded and accompanied the explosions.</p>

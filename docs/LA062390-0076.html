			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF MILLS COLLEGE RESIGNS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT MAKE A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO THE SCHOOL WHILE  IT STRUGGLES TO BOOST ENROLLMENT TO KEEP IT FROM GOING CO-ED.  </P> <P> Mills College President Mary Metz has resigned, seven weeks after her hesitant  support for a now-abandoned proposal to admit men to the women's school sparked  passionate criticism from students.  </P> <P> Metz said in a written statement that she was leaving because she could not  commit herself to stay at Mills during a demanding five-year plan to boost  enrollment by nearly one-third and raise $10 million to keep the college from  having to go co-ed.  </P> <P> Metz was unavailable for comment Friday, but a college spokesperson said Metz  decided to pursue other professional opportunities and permit the college to  find someone able to make a long-term commitment to lead Mills.  </P> <P> Students' anger and charges that Metz betrayed them by going along with plans  to admit undergraduate men in 1991 also took a toll on the nine-year Mills  president, colleagues said.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine that it didn't hurt," said Terry Fairman, an alumna who sits  on the Board of Trustees. "Mary is a very human person. That's the reason the  students liked her so much, but it also makes her more vulnerable to their  anger."  </P> <P> Some students still harbor resentment they first felt when Metz and the  trustees announced in May the plans to boost enrollment by admitting men,  student body President Melissa Stevenson-Dile said. Students will have mixed  emotions when they learn of Metz's departure, she said.  </P> <P> "Her seeming betrayal was really what sparked our anger," Stevenson-Dile said.  "There was a great deal of animosity that came out of that. I'm hopeful that  now we can clear the air."  </P> <P> Student protests and a campus strike prompted Mills' trustees to reverse their  decision to make the college, which already accepts male graduate students,  completely co-ed. The trustees agreed to let Mills remain a women's college  until 1995, provided cost-cutting and enrollment-boosting measures could help  erase an annual deficit of $24 million.  </P> <P> Stevenson-Dile and Metz's colleagues praised the outgoing president for her  leadership of what has long been considered the premier women's college in the  West.  </P> <P> Under Metz's leadership, Mills tripled its endowment, which now totals $72  million.  </P> <P> "We have had phenomenal success in fund-raising, and a lot of that is due to  the tireless work of Dr. Metz," said Donna Howard, Mills vice president for  institutional advancement.  </P> <P> Mills trustee and former Vassar College President Virginia Smith will become  acting Mills College president, pending a search for someone to fill the post  permanently, a Mills spokesman said. Smith also has a proven track record in  raising money for colleges, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Oakland school will need all the help it can get to bring in enough money  to remain an all-woman college, Mills officials said.  </P> <P> "We all have a ton of work to do," said Warren Hellman, chairman of the Mills  Board of Trustees. "We've got to translate a lot of enthusiasm into action."  </P></p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher interest leaves Meggitt down at Pounds 10.8m A SHARP rise in interest payments has hit pre-tax profits for the first half at Meggitt, the Dorset-based engineering company. Interest payable rose from Pounds 17,000 to Pounds 1.27m following the company's decision to adopt the proposals in FRED 3 and treat its Euro convertible preference shares as debt rather than equity. This left pre-tax profits at Pounds 10.8m, down from a previous Pounds 11.7m. However, operating profits edged ahead from Pounds 11.45m to Pounds 11.81m. Turnover rose from Pounds 152.9m to Pounds 179.3m. Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said that the group had experienced an excellent first quarter, but the second quarter had slowed down. The recession continued to affect margins in all areas, but acquisitions made last year helped the group to raise its market penetration. The electronics division, which was the first to be hit by the recession, had experienced 11 months of steady but gentle improvement. He did not believe it was clutching at straws to hope for further gains in the sector. While the group had bucked the trend in the aerospace sector, it was improving its performance through increasing market penetration, not because there was more business around. The energy division had had a tough time, with new business failing to materialise as quickly as expected. In addition a difficult contract in South America and restructuring costs had cost Pounds 1m. The controls division was doing similar business to last year. Mr Coates said that by a quirk the second half would see the maturity of several contracts, which should lead to an improved performance. Earnings per share fell to 3.3p (3.7p). The interim dividend is 1.3p (1.25p). In April, the 17.2 per cent stake of Meggitt held by BTR, the industrial holding company, was placed with investment institutions. Mr Coates said the group welcomed the change to a wider shareholder base. On July 8, Pounds 14.06m of the Pounds 17m Euro Convertible Preference Shares were redeemed at the shareholders' request.</p>

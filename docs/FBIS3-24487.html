			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. G. Yeliseyev, P. V. Karga; UDC </F> 621.373.826.038.825.4]    [Abstract] A comprehensive analysis has been performed in  this article of the feasibility of employing periodic quantum-  size heterostructure (QHS), or multiquantum barrier (MQB), based  on Al[.sup]x[/]Ga[.sub]1-x[/]As/GaAs and  Ga[.sup]x[/]In[.sub]1-x[/]As[.sub]y[/]P[.sub]1-  y[/]/InP for improving the efficiency of electron  confinement in the active region of semiconductor laser and  reducing the current density of the electron leakage from the  active zone. Parameters of the periodic MQB were determined,  where the height of the effective potential barrier was  increased by more than 100%, and the density of the  current  leakage from the active region of the semiconductor laser was  decreased by more than three orders of magnitude. The  relationship of the electron wave reflection coefficient as a  function of the electron energy, and behavior of the current  density of electrons injected into the active region in the  above heterostructures, with variation of the number,  composition and thickness of the layers which form the periodic  MQB was analysed.

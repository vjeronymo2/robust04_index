			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam,  secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea, made a report on the subject "Modelling of the whole  society on the chuche idea is a great programme of socialist and  communist construction in our age" at a national symposium  marking the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of the  programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea  which opened Tuesday in Pyongyang.    The reporter said:    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in February 1974, 20  years ago, proclaimed modelling the whole society on the chuche  idea as the supreme programme of our party with his scientific  insight into the mature requirement of our developing revolution  which had entered a new stage and into the process of  development of the world socialist movement.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "...It is a completely mature requirement to dye the whole  society in one idea, the revolutionary idea of the leader under  the present condition of our country."    The reporter pointed out:    A new guiding idea was required by the new historic era in  which the popular masses had presented themselves as masters of  history and their destiny and the revolutionary struggle of the  popular masses for socialism had entered a new stage.    It had become the desire of the revolutionary people of the  world and urgent requirement of the times to build socialist and  communist society with the chuche idea of the respected leader  Comrade Kim Il-song as the guiding idea of revolution and under  its banner.    This demand of the times concerning the destiny of the  socialist and communist cause was fully met when the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il scientifically formulated the revolutionary  idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaimed it  as the guiding idea of revolution in our era.    The revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is, in a word,  a system of the idea, theory and method of chuche.    The characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim  Il-song which distinguishes it from the preceding revolutionary  theories of the working class, is that its quintessence is the  great chuche idea, the first of its kind in the history of human  thought, and it systematizes the revolutionary theory and the  method of leadership in an integral way on its basis.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expounded that the  revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, different from the  preceding revolutionary ideas of the working class which were  the combination of separate doctrines, gives answers to all the  theoretical and practical questions of revolution and  construction, proceeding from one man-centered philosophical  principle and one basic idea of respect for humanity. This is  an immortal exploit in that he elucidated the fundamental  characteristics of the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song  and its absolute superiority to the preceding revolutionary  ideas of the working class.    Comrade Kim Chong-il, formulating the revolutionary idea of  Comrade Kim Il-song, scientifically expounded that his  revolutionary idea is an encyclopedic revolutionary idea  containing theories of all fields of transforming nature,  society and man and all stages of revolution and construction.    Thus it has been convincingly proved that the revolutionary  idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is a flawless communist  revolutionary theory leading the revolution and construction of  our era to victory and an almighty treasured sword which should  be tightly held in the whole course of the revolutionary  struggle to realise the independence of the popular masses.    Comrade Kim Chong-il, after proclaiming the great chuche  idea  as the guiding idea of the times, set it forth as a great  programme of communist construction to dye the whole society in  one idea, the revolutionary idea of Comrade Kim Il-song.    The programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche  idea is a programme of communist construction to remould man,  reform society and remake nature as required by the chuche idea  and thus build and complete communist society which is based on  the chuche idea and to which it is fully applied.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was the first in  history  to define the course of socialist and communist construction as  a course of embodying the revolutionary idea of the leader and  dying society in the revolutionary idea of the leader by  proclaiming the programme for modelling the whole society on the  chuche idea.    The proclamation of the programme is a scientific discovery  that socialist and communist society is, in essence, a society  in which the independence of the popular masses has been fully  realised and, at the same time, the whole of it is  singleheartedly united.    With the proclamation of the programme by Comrade Kim  Chong-il, it has become clear that socialist and communist  society is a society in which the independence of the popular  masses has been completely realised in all fields of social life  and that the strategic target of socialist and communist  construction is to occupy the ideological and political fortress  and the material fortress by remaking nature, reforming society  and remoulding man to meet the demand of the popular masses for  independence.    Thus the limitation of the preceding theory that communism  can be realised only if the material wealth is increased by  developing productive forces was overcome and the  unreasonableness and reactionary essence of the view of the  modern revisionists who pursued only "material prosperity" was  exposed and refuted.    At the same time, the programme clarified that socialist and  communist society is a society of singlehearted unity all  members of which are closely united as comrades to form a  socio-political organism.    The programme is a programme of singlehearted unity which  fully embodies and consummates the unique idea and revolutionary  stand on dying the whole society in the chuche idea to make it a  community of destiny whose members are united around the leader  with comradely love and revolutionary obligation on the basis of  the idea of the leader.    For this the banner of singlehearted unity is a great  revolutionary banner which firmly guarantees the victory of  socialist and communist construction.    It is, indeed, the immortal exploits of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il which will shine through generations with  the advance of history and the eternal treasure of the chuche  cause that, by scientifically formulating the revolutionary idea  of Comrade Kim Il-song and proclaiming the programme for  modelling the whole society on the chuche idea, he exalted the  revolutionary idea of the great leader as the guiding idea of  the age of independence and opened a true way of building  socialism and communism in which the independence of the popular  masses will have been completely realised on the basis of the  chuche idea.    The reporter noted that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  has wisely led the struggle of our people to materialize the  programme for modelling the whole society on the chuche idea.    He said:    What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has led the socialist cause  of our people to victory under the banner of modelling the whole  society on the chuche idea is, first of all, that he made clear  the essence of socialism and the law of its realisation and has  turned our socialism into socialism of chuche.    By studying socialism centering on the popular masses by  applying the chuche idea, he overcame the limitation of the  preceding socialist idea and theory attaching decisive  significance to economic necessity by placing economic relations  in the center and clarified that socialism is not only a society  where social equality prevails, free from exploitation and  oppression of man by man, but also a society where the popular  masses lead an independent and creative life suitable to the  intrinsic character of social human beings, firmly united in  comradeship as the common masters of the state and society.    After establishing the scientific idea and theory on  socialism centering on the popular masses, he has successfully  applied this great idea and has wisely led the struggle to  remould and develop man, economy, culture and all other sectors  of social life under the banner of the three revolutions,  ideoligical, technical and cultural, to suit the nature of  socialist society.    What holds a brilliant place in his great exploits in  leading  the socialist cause of our people to victory under the banner of  modelling the whole society on the chuche idea is also that he  expounded a new revolutionary idea on the formula of building  socialism and has decisively turned the chuche style, the Korean  style into a universal revolutionary formula of our times.    He, making it his motto of revolution to establish chuche,  put forward the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own way"  and successfully applied the unique idea of carrying on  revolution our own way and creditably fulfilled the historic  tasks raised by the socialist movement of our times.    Embodied in our style, the chuche style are man-centered  chuche philosophy, politics centering on the popular masses, our  people's consciousness of national independence and national  self-confidence.    He, with the faith and will of chuche, has built the party  our own way, built the state by our own faith and developed  politics, economy and culture our own way. This is why the  socialism of our country is being built and developed by our  people's own efforts, not by imitation of other countries nor by  instructions or pressure of someone, and is making a long drive  as invincible socialism unshakable and indestructible in any  political storm of the world.    What holds a brilliant place in the great exploits of the  dear leader is also that he has remarkably strengthened and  developed the political forces of revolution and the Armed  Forces.    He gave precedence to firmly building the party  organisationally and ideologically in leading the revolution and  construction and has strengthened the people's power and  enhanced its function and role in every way.    It is an outstanding exploit of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  supreme commander, and a shining fruition of his chuche-based  military idea and commanding art that he, as a peerless  brilliant commander, has built up our People's Army into the  army of the leader, the army of the party whose lifeblood is  loyalty to the party and the leader and has strengthened and  developed it into each-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed  Forces capable of defeating any aggressor.    What holds a brilliant place in his exploits is also that he  has established an orderly scientific theory on the inheritance  and completion of the socialist cause on the basis of the  revolutionary outlook on the leader and given a steadfast  continuity to the vitality of our revolution.    He defined it as an important task concerning the destiny of  socialism to correctly resolve the issue of succeeding the  socialist cause and gave a most correct answer to this by  studying the course of starting and developing the socialist  cause with the leader in the center for the first time in  history, on the basis of his scientific analysis of the  practical experiences of the Korean revolution and the historic  lessons of the socialist movement.    It is thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker  and theoretician produced by mankind that our party has become a  great party with the immortal guiding idea of the completion of  the revolutionary cause of chuche, our motherland has become a  glorious country glorifying the guiding idea of the times  generation after generation and our people have become a great  people who are building socialism and communism along a most  straight road.    The reporter in conclusion laid stress on adding shine to  our-style socialism centering on the popular masses by  thoroughly implementing the programme for modelling the whole  society on the chuche idea and upholding with loyalty the idea  and leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order  to reunify the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of  chuche.</p>

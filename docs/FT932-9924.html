			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Spanish official lost for words in Brussels post THE SUDDEN resignation of the European Commission's director general for social affairs has cast another embarrassing spotlight on how the EC fills its senior jobs. It also calls into question how seriously the Community takes its vaunted ambition of building a 'social dimension' into European integration. Mr Sigismundo Crespo, Spanish director general of DG5 (social policy) in the Commission, left Brussels late last week, leaving a note for his secretary saying he would not be back. He confirmed his resignation in a subsequent sharply worded fax from Madrid. A furious Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has now summoned him back, one senior official said yesterday. Explanations for his departure vary. Mr Crespo was said by one official to have suffered a family tragedy. He himself is understood to have complained that his lines of communication inside the Commission had been deliberately blocked. Mr Crespo took over DG5 in October. However, it was known that the social affairs directorate had been earmarked for a Spaniard as long ago as February 1991, because a reshuffle of top Commission jobs left Spain one directorate general short after it had conceded transport to the UK. With Spain and other member states unyielding over their informal quotas of top jobs, Brussels canvassed hard to get a Spaniard of high calibre. Highly regarded Spaniards within the Commission, like Mr Eneko Landaburu, the Basque head of regional policy, were not interested. Mr Crespo, best known in Spain for transferring back to the unions the assets seized from them by Franco, was sent from Madrid and found immediately to be out of his depth. His main handicap was linguistic. Though a French speaker, he was unable to communicate in English with his boss, Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner for social affairs. Mr Flynn has no French and had placed British and Irish officials alongside and immediately under Mr Crespo, hemming him in. Senior officials in DG5 described their weekly meetings as 'like Basil Fawlty and Manuel' in the TV comedy Fawlty Towers. This cavalier behaviour with a department the Commission claims is vital comes at a time when Brussels has been at cross purposes on social policy. Mr Flynn has won support from the Twelve to prepare an EC-wide jobs initiative. However, it emerges that Mr Delors has been working discreetly on a similar initiative using his own network within the Commission.</p>

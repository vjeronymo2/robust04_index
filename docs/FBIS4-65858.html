			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia's new military  posture is purely defensive and not aimed at any other state,  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said here Tuesday [24  May].    He was speaking after a meeting with defence ministers of  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to explain Russia's  long-awaited military doctrine to replace the security blueprint  of the defunct Soviet Union.    But Grachev said Russia would continue to use its nuclear  weapons "as a means of deterrence against a large-scale nuclear  war."    He said Russia might use its nuclear weapons against  countries with nuclear arsenals of their own, and perhaps  against non-nuclear aggressor countries, whether or not they  were in coalition with nuclear states.    Before his arrival, the ministers said NATO had reaffirmed  the essential role of nuclear forces "including sub-strategic  forces widely deployed in Europe at the minimum level necessary  to preserve peace and stability."    But in a statement, the NATO ministers welcomed the fact  that  Russia, the United States and Britain had nearly completed steps  to "de-target" strategic nuclear weapons pointed at each other.    "We expressed satisfaction with this important gesture  marking the improved strategic climate between former Cold War  adversaries," the statement said.</p>

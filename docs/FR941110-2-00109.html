			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to applicants, both BN and Santa Fe operate in a highly competitive environment and face pervasive competition from other rail carriers as well as from trucks and barges in many markets. Applicants contend that, with only a few limited exceptions, the proposed transaction does not threaten any reduction in the vigor of intramodal competition. Applicants contend that the bulk of the BN and Santa Fe systems do not overlap in horizontal competition. Applicants also indicate that no horizontal overlap exists in the three major corridors from the mid-continent to the west coast. BN operates in the Northern Corridor; Santa Fe operates in the Southern Corridor. Where overlap is present, applicants indicate that it almost always occurs in the presence of extensive competition with other providers of freight transportation services. Applicants' analyses, however, indicate the possibility for some limited reduction in competition in the areas of Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas. Concerning this area, applicants say that they are prepared to negotiate ameliorative arrangements to address any such reductions in competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants state that there will be few basic changes in the existing route structure. Applicants find that the Avard, OK gateway route will experience the most pronounced change. Applicants also project that California-Southeast traffic will increase significantly and that traffic on the route east of Avard to Tulsa will approximately double due to a combination of growth and internal reroutes. Applicants' traffic projections also involve increases in intermodal, merchandise, and grain traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN and Santa Fe routes between Denver and Texas and between Chicago and Texas also possess some parallel characteristics. Applicants, however, find that each route is generally far removed from its counterpart and each serves other different, but important, traffic lanes and, therefore, no major change in overall uses and traffic density is planned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are accepting the application for consideration because it complies with the applicable regulations, waivers, and requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 11343&hyph;45; 49 CFR Part 1180. We reserve the right, however, to require the filing of supplemental information from applicants or any other party or individual, as necessary to complete the record in this matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although applicants have provided sufficient market analysis under 49 CFR 1180.7 for us to accept their application for consideration, we find that additional information will be necessary for us to analyze the effect of this transaction on certain other railroads. Specifically, we are concerned about railroads which have interests in either WUTR or HBT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our decision served October 3, 1994 [Decision No. 3], we waived our regulations at 49 CFR 1180.3(b) pertaining to WUTR and HBT by not considering either of them an ``applicant carrier.'' Consequently, we are lacking certain information that we believe is necessary to conduct our market analysis. Therefore, applicants are directed to provide us with additional information concerning WUTR and HBT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1), applicants seek an exemption for their control of WUTR. In their petition, applicants indicate that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) owns the other one-third stock interest in WUTR. Applicants state in the petition that they expect MP will continue to participate in WUTR's management and that applicants' control will not impair MP's ability to obtain service from WUTR. Applicants are directed to provide copies of any agreement concerning use of that property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although BN and Santa Fe currently own only 24% and 25% of HBT, respectively, in the event of consolidation, their combined interests may constitute control of HBT. Therefore, we will direct applicants to provide us with the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identify the owners of HBT and their respective ownership percentages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identify any railroads dependent on HBT in order to interchange with other carriers (specify which carriers) or to connect their own lines through the city. Explain each dependent circumstance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explain whether the agreement or agreements governing the use of the property held or owned by HBT protect any other owners of HBT from adverse effects in the event of consolidation. Provide copies of any agreement concerning use of that property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the expedited procedural schedule, additional information will be necessary to assist us in preparing prompt and complete analysis of the transaction. Therefore, applicants are directed to provide us with a current complete set of employee operating timetables for both BN and Santa Fe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our Decision No. 4, served October 5, 1994, we adopted an expedited procedural schedule, and we have attached it here to give notice to all interested persons. All of the filing deadlines are in accordance with the statute and governing regulations, as modified by the expedited procedural schedule. We advise applicants and all other parties to this proceeding that, particularly because of the accelerated schedule we have adopted, they must strictly comply with all requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If questions arise concerning an interpretation of a requirement, they may contact the Commission's Office of Proceedings at 202&hyph;927&hyph;5610 for assistance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  49 CFR 1180.4(c)(6)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  By petition filed October 28, 1994, The National Industrial Transportation League (NITL) requests that the procedural schedule adopted in and attached to our decision served October 5, 1994, Decision No. 4, be extended by adding 30 days to each of the time periods specified. NITL's primary concern is the possibility that the application will be modified or withdrawn as a result of the actions of SFP's shareholders at their meeting scheduled for November 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(7)(i), our decision to accept the application cannot be extended . Further, comments by parties and interested persons are not due until December 27, 1994. We see no reason to extend the procedural schedule at this time. Accordingly petitioner's request is denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application and accompanying exhibits are available for inspection in the Public Docket Room, room 1221, at the offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested persons, including government parties, may participate in this proceeding by submitting written comments regarding the application. Comments must be filed no later than December 27, 1994. An original and 20 copies must be filed with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

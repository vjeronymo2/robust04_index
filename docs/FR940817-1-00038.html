			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Redesignation of the Term ``Mechanic'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of changes in aircraft technology, the amount of specialized training required to perform aviation maintenance has increased significantly since the introduction of the term ``mechanic.'' The highly complex and technical field of contemporary aviation maintenance requires substantially more than the manual skills typically associated with individuals classified as mechanics. The FAA asserts that the term ``aviation maintenance technician'' more completely describes the type of skills necessary to maintain today's complex aircraft and more accurately reflects the level of professionalism found in the aviation maintenance industry. Additionally, adoption of the term ``aviation maintenance technician'' would standardize terminology throughout the aviation industry and make Part 66 consistent with Part 147 of the FAR (which regulates Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools), aviation maintenance trade publications, and many ICAO member states. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment, however, specific changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Redesignation of the Term ``Repairman'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the specialized nature of aviation maintenance tasks performed by currently certificated repairmen, the FAA proposes that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' replace the current term ``repairman.'' The FAA contends that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' more accurately reflects the level of expertise required to maintain today's highly complex aviation systems. In addition, the use of the term ``aviation repair specialist'' would serve to increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. Adoption of the term would also be consistent with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment; however, specific changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Equivalency of Ratings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any valid mechanic or repairman certificate would be equivalent to an aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate, respectively. After implementation of this regulation, the holder of a current mechanic or repairman certificate may continue to exercise the privileges of the corresponding aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate and may exchange a current mechanic or repairman certificate for an aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate respectively. Phase I of the regulatory review does not create additional certificates or ratings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Certificates by Facsimile <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under proposed Part 66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance. The proposal would also allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly to the airman a facsimile that the airman may carry as proof of the original certificate's issuance for a period not to exceed 60 days. Adoption of the proposed change would make the rule consistent with current practices implemented by the Airman Certification Branch (AVN&hyph;460) at the Aviation Standards National Field Office in Oklahoma City. Current regulations specify the use of telegrams only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change reflects advancements in communications technology and would speed access to FAA services by permitting the use of other means, such as telephone facsimile or computer modem, to obtain a replacement certificate. The use of these means would speed the replacement of lost certificates to the airman, thereby decreasing the time during which the airman may not exercise the privileges of a certificate of rating. Similar provisions are under consideration for adoption in other parts of the FAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Demonstration of English-Language Proficiency and Removal of Exception Criteria for Applicants Employed Outside the United States Who Are Not Proficient in the English Language <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would require an applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate or aviation repair specialist certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, as is currently required for applicants desiring to exercise the privileges of the certificate within the United States. The proposal would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal also would eliminate the issuances of certificates to individuals who cannot meet this requirement and are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station, or a certificated U.S. air carrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal recognizes the highly technical nature of aviation maintenance in today's aviation industry. Proficiency with the general terminology of the English language is not sufficient to ensure the competency of an aviation maintenance technician or repair specialist. The individual must be able to understand and master the complex and often very specialized language of airworthiness instructions and other terminology associated with the maintenance of highly sophisticated aviation equipment. In operations conducted at certificated U.S. air carriers, certificated U.S. commercial operators, and U.S.-certificated repair stations, the vast majority of technical information is conveyed in the English language. The FAA has determined that the proposed rule would guarantee a level of competency that would ensure that an applicant for either certificate is able to use all relevant maintenance publications effectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also proposed that the current exception, which permits the certification of mechanics (aviation maintenance technicians) who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language, be deleted. The current airframe, powerplant, and general written tests for mechanics are all written in the English language. Applicants taking these tests must be proficient in the English language to complete these examinations successfully; therefore, the exception is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although repairmen (aviation repair specialists) are not required to take written tests, these individuals also work in environments that require more than mere proficiency in the English language. Because the FAA does not certify repairmen working under U.S.-certificated foreign repair stations and because of the need for all certificated repairmen to understand technical material written in English, the FAA also proposed that all repairmen (aviation repair specialists) demonstrate proficiency in the English language and that the exception allowing individuals who are not proficient in the English language to be certificated to work only outside the United States be deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current holders of a mechanic or repairman certificate, who do not meet the English language requirement and are employed outside of the United States by a certificated U.S. air carrier or a certificated U.S. repair station, would continue to exercise the privileges of their certificate without a further showing of competency. Their certificates would remain endorsed ``Valid only outside of the United States.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

One of those killed was a  battalion commander in the All Burma Students Democratic Front  [ABSDF], said a member of the Karen National Union, an allied  opposition group.    The two students were killed in attacks last Wednesday by  three battalions, or 1,500 troops, of Burmese army in an area  controlled by the Karen group about 100 kilometres north of its  headquarters at Manerplaw, on the Thai border, said the Karen  official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Manerplaw is  about 210 kilometres east of Rangoon. Another Karen official in  Bangkok said combat continued at least through Friday, and 100  Karen refugees from the fighting had crossed into Thailand.</p>

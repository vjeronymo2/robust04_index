			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement of His Excellency the President of the </F> Azerbaijan Republic, Mr. Geydar Aliyev, at the Time of the  Signing of the Partnership for Peace Framework Document (NATO  Headquarters, Brussels, 4 May 1994)"]    [Text] The Azerbaijan Republic, having a rich history going  back many centuries and having negotiated an enormous path of  development, three years ago restored its national independence  as a result of the collapse of Soviet totalitarianism and has  today presented itself to NATO as a full member of the world  community, being represented in the United Nations, the CSCE,  and other international organizations.    At the present stage, considering today's regularities of  world development, Azerbaijan, endeavoring to take its rightful  place in the world community, is fully resolved to create a  democratic society committed to the fundamental principles and  values that have been expressed by human civilization at all  stages of its development.    The bases of the official policy of Azerbaijan are a love of  peace, political pluralism, and the recognition and assurance of  individual liberty and human rights. Enforceable enactments on  political parties, freedom of religious belief, protection of  the rights of national minorities, and such have been adopted  and are functioning here.    Azerbaijan builds its foreign policy on the basis of a  profound recognition of the interdependence and interrelated  nature of the world, proceeding from the common global purposes  confronting all of us. We are firmly confident that the basis of  security in the current period of challenges and threats is  mutual respect for states' sovereignty and territorial integrity  and the sanctity of their borders.    Azerbaijan has embarked on the implementation of economic  reforms to create a market economy open to the outside world,  which will make it possible to realize the country's wealth of  potential. We are to this end implementing measures to attract  foreign investments in the economy and establish cooperation  with the world's biggest companies. A process of legislative  backing for the reforms is under way.    Azerbaijan is today experiencing the profound crisis which  has encompassed the entire territory of the former USSR and  which is the result of the collapse of the Soviet system.  Despite this, we are fully resolved to overcome the difficulties  of the current stage and by way of the plan-oriented  implementation of reforms to strive for the creation of a  prosperous sovereign state.    In September 1993 Azerbaijan became a member of the  Commonwealth of Independent States, considering this an  essential factor of political and economic cooperation with all  the countries formed following the disintegration of the USSR,  and signed the Collective Security Treaty.    My country's situation is made worse by the fact that it is  being subjected to aggression on the part of neighboring  Armenia, which has territorial claims on Azerbaijan.    Armenia, as the aggressor-state, is using the ethnic group  of  Armenians living on the territory of Azerbaijan's  Nagorno-Karabakh region as an instrument of separatism for the  annexation of our territory. Armenia is using its own territory  and armed forces to wage war on the territory of Azerbaijan, and  it can no longer conceal these facts.    In the course of the aggression perpetrated against  Azerbaijan the Republic of Armenia has occupied more than 20  percent of Azerbaijani territory. As a result of the ethnic  purges carried out by the Armenian armed forces more than 20,000  persons have been killed and approximately 60,000 have been  wounded or have become disabled, 4,000 have been taken prisoner  or hostage, and approximately 1 million Azerbaijanis have become  refugees in their own country.    Under the threat of annihilation, absolutely all  Azerbaijanis  have been driven out of all the occupied territories. The forces  of occupation are employing scorched-earth tactics.  Approximately 90,000 residential structures, more than 1,000  economic facilities, 250 schools and educational institutions,  and 250 medical establishments have been burned, looted, and  destroyed. The damage caused Azerbaijan is put at billions of  dollars.    Armenian nationalism ignited the torch of war and set  against  each other two peoples bound by the will of history to live in  peace and good-neighborliness. I am profoundly convinced that  the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has no military  solution. The continuation of the hostilities will bring both  peoples incalculable misfortunes. It will prevent them getting  back on their feet, establishing their independence,  implementing economic reforms in full, and creating a democratic  state.    Azerbaijan has always adopted a constructive position on  questions of a settlement of the conflict. The territorial  integrity and sanctity of the borders of our state are for us a  fundamental principle. We will strive for the liberation of all  occupied Azerbaijani territory and the return of all refugees to  their land, the 50,000 Karabakh Azerbaijanis included. We will  simultaneously undertake to ensure the security and all civil  rights of the Karabakh Armenians and to afford them the  appropriate level of autonomy within the framework of the  Azerbaijani state.    On 12 April of this year I appealed to the citizens of  Armenia and the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh of Armenian  nationality--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop and cease  hostilities. The Azerbaijani state guaranteed all inhabitants of  the conflict zone involved in the hostilities personal safety  and the possibility of living freely and in peace on their  native land. We once again today confirm this fundamental  position of ours.    In the time of the military aggression against Azerbaijan,  which has gone on for approximately six years now, many steps  aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict, which,  unfortunately, have yet to produce the desired results in view  of the hard-line aggressive policy of the Republic of Armenia,  have been taken.    The fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territory and the  demand for the immediate, full, and unconditional withdrawal  therefrom of the Armenian armed forces of occupation have been  reflected in four resolutions of the UN Security Council--822,  853, 874, and 884. But on various pretexts Armenia is still  refusing to comply with these resolutions.    Armenia is by its behavior openly challenging the world  community, sapping at root all attempts at a peaceful political  solution of the conflict by refusing to recognize the  territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to liberate occupied  Azerbaijani territory.    The Azerbaijani Republic once again declares its readiness  to  solve all questions by way of peaceful negotiations within the  framework of the CSCE Minsk Group, on the basis of the UN  Charter and the principles of the CSCE.    The Azerbaijani Republic is, for its part, doing everything  to support the actions of the Minsk Group and creating all  possible conditions for it. But I would like to emphasize that  each time that the Minsk Group assembles, the world witnesses a  further escalation of hostilities on the part of Armenia and new  seizures of Azerbaijani territory, as was the case at the time  of the visit to the region of the current chairman of the CSCE  in October 1993 or this April, when a meeting of the Minsk Group  was held in Prague, and so forth. A delegation of the Minsk  Group, which we rendered the utmost assistance, was in the  region from 26 April through 2 May. If all the countries  represented in the Minsk Group were to demonstrate the firm will  to bring the bloody war to an end as quickly as possible and to  embark on the restoration of peace, I am sure that success would  be assured. Taking advantage, therefore, of my presence in NATO  Headquarters in Brussels, I appeal to the North Atlantic  alliance, of which all leading countries of the CSCE Minsk Group  are members, for the adoption of the necessary effective  measures to ensure peace and stability in our hemorrhaging  region.    The Azerbaijani Republic has profound respect for the North  Atlantic alliance and values highly its activity which has in  recent decades secured peace, stability, and progressive  development in Europe. At the present time NATO, as an actually  functioning structure of collective security in the world,  provides for the defense of democratic values and their spread  to the new independent states which have formed in East Europe  and on the territory of the former USSR.    We regard NATO as an organization which could help the young  Azerbaijani state establish close multilateral relations with  the Western world and become familiar with its wealth of  experience. The strengthening of the independence of Azerbaijan,  as, equally, of the other new European states also, would serve  as practical confirmation of the permanency of the principles on  which the entire activity of NATO is built.    We are grateful to NATO for its expression of concern at the  situation in the Transcaucasus and its confirmation of its  respect for the territorial integrity, independence, and  sovereignty of the states of this region and, in particular, of  Azerbaijan, which was expressed in the NATO Council declaration  adopted in January 1994.    The principles of NATO, on the basis of which its  participants regulate their relations, settle all disputes  arising among them by peaceful means, and develop their  individual and collective possibilities for warding off  aggression against one or several members of this organization,  have proven their viability over many years now and could be the  foundation of the building of a new system of European security  in the postconfrontation period.    The young Azerbaijani Republic, which has opted for the path  of the building of an independent democratic state with a market  economy, looks with great hope to the states that have scored  big successes on this path and awaits help and assistance from  them. For this reason we, like many other countries also,  received with great enthusiasm NATO's Partnership for Peace  initiative. The North Atlantic alliance is in itself for us a  reference point thanks to the security which, as NATO General  Secretary Manfred Woerner said on 10 January of this year at the  meeting of heads of state and government of NATO members, it  guarantees its members because this is the organization which is  functioning the most efficiently in the sphere of collective  security.    We, as a state that is in a state of war and subjected to  aggression on the part of a neighboring country--Armenia, hope  that participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program will  enable us as quickly as possible to achieve a just peaceful  settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, the liberation  of the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and the elimination of  all the consequences of the war. The high authority of NATO  could be a telling factor in an end to this bloody war.    We hope that the Azerbaijan Republic's affiliation to the  Partnership for Peace program will afford us an opportunity to  stimulate our participation in the creation of a dependable  system of collective security in Europe.    I believe that the democratic principles underlying the  North  Atlantic alliance will contribute to our successful cooperation,  the practical removal of the obstacles that stand in the way of  peace and stability in the Transcaucasus and other regions, and  the progress and prosperity of all peoples.</p>

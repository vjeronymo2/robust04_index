			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL EASES CURB ON USING PLASTIC BULLETS;  </P> <P> ALLOWS TROOPS TO FIRE AT PROTESTERS BURNING TIRES, BLOCKING ROADS  </P> <P> Israel today authorized troops to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians burning  tires and blocking roads and ordered all 1,200 schools in the West Bank shut  indefinitely because of unrest.  </P> <P> Palestinians, meanwhile, rejected peace proposals by Defense Minister Yitzhak  Rabin, the man behind Israel's "iron fist" clampdown, and members of Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud Party also criticized him.  </P> <P> Rabin had called Thursday for a period of calm to prepare for elections in the  occupied territories, leading to autonomy followed by a confederation between  the West Bank and either Israel or Jordan.  </P> <P> A senior defense source said the new easing of firing orders meant that  noncommissioned officers could use plastic bullets to shoot stone-throwers,  fleeing protesters and anyone blocking roads.  </P> <P> An army spokeswoman said: "Because of severe disturbances in the latest period,  in which (Arab) school students from (the West Bank) were active, the military  government has ordered the closure of all schools . . . until an appropriate  atmosphere for studying is created."  </P> <P> Rabin's get-tough policy, which also allows troops to demolish the homes and  close the stores of stone-throwers, has led to record numbers of Arab  casualties in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Palestinians rejected Rabin's peace proposals as an attempt to bypass the PLO  and the creation of a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> "The proposal is not accepted by us. We don't accept elections in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip because we have got our leadership -- the PLO -- and we want to  tell Mr. Rabin that he should not close his eyes," said Hilmi Hanoun, the  veteran mayor of Tulkarem.  </P> <P> "He knows very well we have a leadership for the Palestinians. If they want  real peace, they know where they should go," he added.  </P></p>

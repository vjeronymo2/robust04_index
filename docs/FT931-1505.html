			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Woman who could break the Austrian mould: Heide Schmidt's new-found popularity is a significant addition to the whole political landscape WHEN it comes to stirring up Austria's normally somnolent politics, Mr Jorg Haider, the rowdy right-wing populist, has proven a master in the past couple of years. But in the end it may be Mrs Heide Schmidt, a mild-mannered liberal, who actually succeeds in breaking the strange conservative-socialist alliance that has run the country for much of the post-war period. Mrs Schmidt, a former ombudsman turned politician, last month led four parliamentary colleagues in defecting from Mr Haider's Austrian Freedom party (FPO) and setting up a new Liberal Forum. The five had long been disenchanted with Mr Haider's mercurial behaviour, but hung on in the hope that, one way or another, matters would improve. Their hopes ended when he launched an inflammatory petition campaign in January to demonstrate the strength of grass-roots support for his demand that the government get tougher with immigrants. 'To take the risk that something really terrible could happen - that was too much for me,' Mrs Schmidt says. 'To use anxiety as a policy instrument is not liberal.' While their numbers are not large, the defectors can claim a significance beyond their size. For one thing, their departure means that the FPO, with only 28 seats left in the 183-seat legislature, is no longer a potential power in coalition-making. Also, the defections have probably taken the steam out of the FPO's rapid advance. The party's popularity has nearly doubled from its 10 per cent level in the 1986 national election, thanks to Mr Haider's appeal to a new generation of right-wing dissidents. Now, however, it risks losing the traditional liberal part of the party's base. In Mrs Schmidt, liberals have a popular and effective spokeswoman for their cause. Although she was elected to parliament only in 1990, she achieved national exposure last year when Mr Haider picked her to be the FPO's candidate to replace the disgraced Mr Kurt Waldheim as president. While she won no more than the FPO's acknowledged 17 per cent of the vote, she left a strong impression on Austrian voters. According to a recent opinion poll, more than half of them would like to see her in a responsible position in the government. Whether that popularity can be translated into votes for the Liberal Forum in the general elections due next year remains to be seen, but at least it has got the other parties thinking. 'This is a sign for the whole political landscape,' says Mr Erhard Busek, vice-chancellor and head of the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP). Mrs Schmidt herself is cautious about the prospects. She is confident that the Forum will get the 4 per cent of the popular vote required to gain recognition as a parliamentary party, but anything more she will consider a bonus. 'It is not easy to get over that level because so many voters are tied to the big parties,' she says. Her hope, rather like that of the Social Democratic party in Britain a decade ago, is that discontent with the two ruling parties will work to her advantage. Certainly, discontent is substantial. In the 1990 election, the OVP's support fell from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, and there is no indication that the decline has since halted. The Socialists held their vote share at 40 per cent, but only because of the personal popularity of Mr Franz Vranitzky, the party's leader and chancellor. That sounds promising for the Forum, but the danger is that, like the SDP in Britain, it will find itself squeezed when one or both of the leading parties regains popularity. There is also a risk of being identified as merely a front for one of the parties. Rumours in Vienna have it that when Mrs Schmidt and her colleagues were thinking of breaking away from the FPO, they were encouraged by Mr Heinz Fischer, the socialist speaker of parliament. Mr Fischer's view was that the new Liberal Forum would win enough seats in the next election so that it and the socialists, now the largest party in parliament with 80 seats, could form a coalition without having to include the conservative OVP. 'It is a rumour,' Mrs Schmidt concedes. But she adds that it would be foolish to set up any alliance before the elections. 'We do not know which way the election will go. When I was in the FPO, I was asked often which party I would prefer to form an alliance with, and I never answered. You have to deal. That is the normal democratic parliamentary way.' The Forum has not yet worked out a formal platform, but Mrs Schmidt makes clear that it will be pure liberal - with the emphasis on individual rights and open markets. The party will also take a very strong stand in favour of Austria joining the European Community, not least to distance itself from Mr Haider who vacillates on this issue. Mrs Schmidt has had her share of difficulties with Mr Haider - he briefly withdrew his support for her during the presidential campaign last year - but she refuses to smear him. 'It is wrong to describe him as a neo-Nazi or as an extremist,' she says. Rather, she sees him as excessively competitive. 'There is a lack of democratic thinking in his way of fighting. He sees things too much in terms of black and white, rather than accepting that we are a pluralistic society. 'He really wants to beat the old parties; he says things like 'They have to be destroyed'. I think that if you are in politics you must respect limits.'</p>

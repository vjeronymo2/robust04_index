As a result, the date will be decided by referendum. A  petition with at least 350,000 signatures is necessary to call a  referendum. Premier Vladimir Meciar said he was ready to start  collecting the signatures starting Monday [21 February].    83 of 147 present deputies voted for the bill, while 49 were  against and 15 abstained.</p>

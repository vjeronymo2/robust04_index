			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karen Topchyan: "Russians in Armenia: Should </F> They Leave or Stay?"]    [Text] Yerevan -- The total number of Russian in Armenia  is about 20,000-25,000, less than 1 percent of the country's 3.5  million population. This is a drop in the ocean compared to the  millions-strong Russian communities in other independent states  of the former USSR.    Just a few years ago there were twice as many Russians in  Armenia. They were concentrated in Yerevan and Vanadzor  (formerly Kirovakan), as well as in Sevanskiy, Stepanavanskiy,  Gugarkskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons. However, the dramatic  events in the once-flourishing Soviet republic have led to a  significant exodus of a section of its inhabitants. Among them  there have been many Russians.    According to Viktor Derega, counselor at the Russian  Federation Embassy in Armenia on questions of migration, there  are several reasons for this: the very acute economic  situation, which has left not just individual enterprises but  entire industrial sectors standing idle; the transport and power  blockade, which has led to inhuman living conditions; and the  fact that some border regions where Russians live, including  Krasnoselskiy Rayon, are in the zone affected by Azerbaijani  artillery bombardments....    The Armenian parliament's adoption last summer of a language  law which to all intents and purposes deprived a section of the  Russian-speaking population of the opportunity to obtain an  education in their native language had a negative effect. Even  those in employment began to have some problems. Under this law  all documentation in the republic's establishments and  departments has to be in Armenian.    It is the opinion of "Russia" Society Chairman Galina  Chernousova that this document will without doubt have to have  further work done on it.    "We have already met with Armenak Kazaryan, minister of  state  of the Republic of Armenia," she says, "and he promised to  assist in increasing the number of Russian schools in areas  where our community is concentrated, particularly in Yerevan."    The question of setting up a Russian-Armenian university in  the capital is also now being decided at the highest level. At  the Russian community's request not only the Armenian but also  the Russian leadership will play an active part in this  undertaking. Incidentally, not only Russians but also Armenians  will study in this higher educational establishment. After all,  a great many representatives of the indigenous nation have not  only been educated in the language of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and  Chekhov but have become cultured thanks to the classics of  Russian literature and art.    ...The following fact is very interesting: Three ethnic  Russian organizations have been formed and are operating in the  Republic of Armenia: the Society of Friends of Armenia, the  "Harmony" International Center for Russian Culture, and the  "Russia" Society. Galina Chernousova considers that the  existence of several societies does not divide but on the  contrary actually to some degree unites the ethnic Russian  population, since each one on its own would hardly be able to  draw in everybody living on Armenian territory. "Although  nonindigenous nationalities live here no worse and no better  than the Armenians," Galina Vasilyevna continues, "our main task  is to help them in some way at least."    The Russian organizations' activities include the following  areas: defending Russians' rights, charitable works, cultural  life, education, and sociological research.    At the Russian community's request the Russian Federation  Government recently sent the republic humanitarian aid in the  form of 30 tonnes of food. In November "Russia" for the first  time in several decades organized a competition for vocalists,  to mark the 100th anniversary of Petr Ilyich Chaykovskiy's death.    In short, the first steps are being taken to unite the  Russians in Armenia spiritually. This will definitely reduce  the number of those wishing to leave the Republic of Armenia.  In the end, the Russians in the republic are the basic link  between Russia and Armenia.</p>

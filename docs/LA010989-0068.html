			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIAN KILLING FEARS RETURN IN COUNTY'S REFUGEE COMMUNITY  </P> <P> It is yet another anniversary steeped in agony.  </P> <P> Ten years ago this week, when Vietnamese occupation troops drove the murderous  Khmer Rouge Communists from power, Oudam Roeung and Kheng Bou -- like millions  of other Cambodian survivors -- wanted to hope.  </P> <P> When the Vietnamese tanks came to Kampong Thom province on Jan. 6, 1979,  Roeung, then a boy of 17, was spending his fourth year in a forced labor camp,  smashing boulders into rocks.  </P> <P> "We just throw our hammer, our material, away," he said. "We thought we had our  freedom. We think that anything that come up will be better than what we have  now."  </P> <P> And on Jan. 14, Bou, a prominent gynecologist in the capital of Phnom Penh  forced to work in the rice fields, joined a desperate throng in Pursat province  rushing toward the latest of Cambodia's "saviors."  </P> <P> "Someone say it was Russians," he said. "Others say it was Americans. I don't  know what troop it was. When I run from the Khmer Rouge to the liberation camp,  the so-called liberation camp, I say, 'Oh, Vietnamese again.' What can I do?"  </P> <P> For many among Southern California's estimated 70,000 Cambodian refugees -- the  third-highest concentration of Cambodians in the world, behind Phnom Penh and  the Thai refugee camps -- the pain of surviving what millions of their  countrymen did not is overbearing. It fades, sometimes, in the realization that  they live, but more often it clutches at their hearts and seizes their souls.  </P> <P> The dates scorched in the memories of Bou and millions of other Cambodians mark  shifts in the political strategies of the Chinese, the Soviets and the  Americans. But the waves of human suffering that those policies produced seem  to lap, one into the next, with no precise beginning and still no end.  </P> <P> This year may mark yet another political milestone in the tortured history of  the Southeast Asian nation.  </P> <P> The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas are at an estimated strength of  35,000 fighters and are by far the most powerful of the nation's domestic  political factions. In a climate of warming Sino-Soviet relations, complicated  and delicate strategies for a new coalition government in Cambodia -- which  would include the Khmer Rouge -- have not been finalized.  </P> <P> At a time when the Vietnamese are planning to continue their withdrawal from  the country, the strength of the Khmer Rouge stirs terror in the hearts of  Cambodians who fear that their country will again be turned into the killing  fields.  </P> <P> "I have a lot of memory, a foggy mind filled with so many things," said Sovan  Un, who was an elementary-school teacher before the revolutionary Khmer Rouge  overpowered the U.S.-backed government on April 17, 1975.  </P> <P> "I saw a lot of family killed," said Un, who now lives in Anaheim. "My father  killed. My brother killed. . . . And not everybody was killed with a knife or  with a gun. People were swollen, malnourished. I watched people die while they  were trying to eat."  </P> <P> "I am very depressed," said Bou, a diminutive man of 56 who abandoned his  medical career when he escaped to Thailand in May, 1981.  </P> <P> "Every Cambodian is depressed," he said. "We were depressed under (Khmer Rouge  leader) Pol Pot, the Vietnamese, then the (Thai refugee) camps and now, here.  We have what we call the culture shock. We have a different way to live and  here, everything is changed."  </P> <P> Bou, who spent more than 2 years in a refugee camp before arriving in Long  Beach in 1984, now lives in Paramount with his wife and six of his nine  children. Two have been unable to leave Cambodia, and a third lives in France.  </P> <P> Bou works as a counselor at the Santa Ana office of United Cambodian Community  Inc., a refugee service organization established in 1977 in Long Beach, where  most of Southern California's Cambodian population lives. About 12,000 to  15,000 Cambodians live in Orange County.  </P> <P> What the center aims to do, workers there said, is give Cambodian refugees  guidance and hope in a nation so strikingly different from their own.  </P> <P> But what not even the most expert counseling can erase, they conceded, are the  scars born of living through hell.  </P> <P> During a recent interview at the Santa Ana service office with a group of  diverse Cambodian refugees, the survivors credited their faith, their guile or  their fate with keeping them alive from the time of the 1975 Khmer Rouge  takeover to their arrival in the United States.  </P> <P> Each of them, they said, was "lucky."  </P> <P> For the week preceding the takeover, San Tran recalled, she and other residents  of Phnom Penh were forced to stay home from work because of the heavy bombing.  At the time, Tran, who was born in Vietnam, worked as a telephone operator at  the Finance Ministry and as a radio newscaster. She lived with her three  daughters and other female relatives. Her husband was away at sea in the  merchant marine.  </P> <P> But early in the morning of April 17, 1975, when the Khmer Rouge marched on the  capital, Tran and the other Phnom Penh residents allowed themselves to believe  in yet another savior.  </P> <P> "I thought that peace had come to Cambodia," said Tran, 45. "I put a white  sheet in front of the house. I didn't know they were killing us."  </P> <P> Roeung, who was a 14-year-old high school student at the time, added that he,  as the others, believed the Khmer Rouge when they said that everybody must  temporarily evacuate their homes so that they could "clean out" the city.  </P> <P> "I was kind of happy," he said, "because I thought (the fighting) was over. My  brother and I got on a motorcycle and waved a white sheet. For a few days, we  were having fun. It was like camping. We thought they would let us back into  our homes."  </P> <P> Instead, the entire population of Phnom Penh was marched into the countryside,  and all other urban centers were evacuated. Most government employees,  professionals and other educated people were killed. Those who were not killed  either managed to escape in those early, confused days or successfully hid  their upbringing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Killing 'Knowledgeable People'  </P> <P> "I had a problem," Tran said. "I showed them that I worked at the finance  ministry. But I escaped. I had some jewelry and a watch, and the Pol Pot  (forces) exchanged it for some rice. I cry and cry. I just want to kill myself.  I just walk and walk. We just like animals."  </P> <P> Later, Tran said, she changed her name and erased her past.  </P> <P> "I forgot everything," she said.  </P> <P> Un, at the time an unmarried, 25-year-old teacher in the western border town of  Pailin, said he escaped the area after overhearing a group of Khmer Rouge  commanders discussing their plans to kill "all the knowledgeable people."  </P> <P> But months later, after arriving in Battambang province and lying about his  identity, death again threatened to overtake Un when Khmer Rouge soldiers  challenged him while he was out gathering wood for another group of soldiers.  </P> <P> "I was standing there in the hole that they made me dig," he said of what was  to have been his own grave. "But then the other soldiers arrived and told them  that they knew me."  </P> <P> Then on June 31, 1977, Un said, the Khmer Rouge accused him and a friend of  talking against the Communist regime. Both were taken to an execution area,  their arms tied over their heads to the trunk of a tree, and for eight hours,  they were terrorized by soldiers brandishing a knife and hitting their heads  with a rifle butt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Just Kept Praying'  </P> <P> "I weighed only about 60 pounds," Un said. "I was swollen, malnourished. I keep  praying. I told them I work hard. I just kept praying."  </P> <P> Why the soldiers did not kill him, Un said, is something that he has no words  to explain.  </P> <P> "What you would call it," he said, "is a miracle."  </P> <P> Un, who escaped to Thailand in November, 1979, with the woman who was to become  his wife, now lives in Anaheim and has two children, ages 5 and 7, who were  born in the United States.  </P> <P> His American children, he said, cannot yet understand the pain of survival that  he and his wife carry with them. But he said they will learn to understand  about the Khmer Rouge, about communism and about the lies of false saviors.  </P> <P> "The difference between the Vietnamese and Pol Pot," Bou added, "is like the  difference between cholera and the plague. Pol Pot, he kill, but quickly. The  Vietnamese, they kill you slowly."  </P></p>

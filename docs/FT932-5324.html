			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Howard rejected at Brixton prison OFFICERS at Brixton prison in south London refused yesterday to meet Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, because of fears about the effect on their jobs of privatisation of the prisoner-escort service. Mr Howard, on his first visit to a jail since becoming home secretary in last week's government reshuffle, said he had been impressed by Brixton, the oldest prison in London. 'Being in prison in Brixton isn't a picnic,' he said. 'But nor should being in prison be a picnic.' He intended to continue with privatisation because he believed the private sector had a role to play in running prisons.</p>

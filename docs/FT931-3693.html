			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: Banker battles for reform - Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy prime minister for economics, talks to Leyla Boulton While working in London, Boris Fyodorov used to send advice to the reformist Russian government in the form of 'Notes from Afar' - a joking reference to Lenin's commentaries on the revolution which began without him in 1917. After returning to Russia as deputy prime minister for economics and finance in December, this pugnacious 35-year-old is now at the centre of a battle to save a market revolution begun by others. Two years ago, he quit as finance minister in protest against Mr Boris Yeltsin's failure to even start reform, and went to work abroad. Now, he says the government will fight on for its policies regardless of last week's bruising defeat by the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian president, whom he describes as 'our main hope and support'. The obstacles are formidable to the government pulling the country back from the brink of hyperinflation and pursuing economic restructuring. Its room for manoeuvre is limited by parliament, which wants not only to reduce Mr Yeltsin to a figurehead role but reverse his radical reform course. Meanwhile, the central bank, no doubt anticipating a change of cabinet, is refusing to adjust monetary policy to the government's economic strategy. 'Either you send sailors to occupy the central bank,' Fyodorov joked in an interview, referring to Lenin's use of force to break up Russia's constituent assembly in 1918, 'or probably the central bank should assume all responsibility for the economy and run it. Then we shall see how they want to stimulate long-term investment at very low interest rates with inflation at 1,000 per cent.' Joking aside, he said after the congress that it was a 'matter of life or death' for the government to get on with its job and for the central bank to co-operate. 'Either order is restored to this country, or it will continue to slide further and further into economic crisis.' For this reason, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, joined President Yeltsin last week in calling for the central bank to be transferred from parliament to government control. Fyodorov wants the central bank to agree to fixed limits for the growth of credit to the state and state-owned enterprises, even if it means telling the government there is no more money to finance the budget deficit. 'If the central bank did this, I would applaud them,' said Fyodorov, a former banker who was passed over for the central bank's chief job last year but makes no secret of the fact that he could have achieved far more there than in his present role. 'The government would then be forced to think better how to use scarce resources and get into policymaking - like social security and unemployment benefit - instead of trying to deal with kilos of milk and each state-owned enterprise.' Next he wants an end to the subsidising of former Soviet republics through the issue of unbacked Russian central bank credits, which accounted for 25 per cent of credit expansion over the past year. He says these 'technical credits' and the continuing deliveries of rouble banknotes by Russia are delaying a decision by other republics on whether to introduce their own currencies, or follow strict conditions to keep the rouble as their currency. Brought into the government to balance the appointment of an industrialist without an economic background as premier, Fyodorov advocates a 'normal' western-style solution to the plight of Russia's impoverished neighbours. 'If loans to these republics are necessary, we should have loan agreements, with terms, collateral and an interest rate,' he says, describing the present system of printing money for them as a 'real disaster'. Attempting to use the good connections he kept while abroad, he has already tried and failed to convince opposition politicians to avoid 'at least superfluous disagreements' over economic policy. Other obstacles he faces include a scarcity of reliable economic data and of skilled professionals within the state bureaucracy. 'In the two years I've been away . . . the better people have already left (for the private sector).' Hinting at nostalgia for the bureaucracies he encountered while at the European Bank for Reconstruction and the World Bank, he also bemoans 'the dozens of signatures required on the back of any paper', and the time he has to waste meeting people 'who have nothing to do with policy'. But ambitious for himself and his country, he has no regrets over trading a comfortable, but comparatively dull, life in the west for what is likely to be the toughest fight of his life. 'I want to see this country changed so it becomes a normal country and I don't have to intervene,' he explains. Fyodorov saw the need for radical change early on. Like many Russian politicians and professionals of his generation, he joined the Soviet Communist party as a means to get ahead. But between completing his doctoral thesis in economics, and working for the party's policymaking central committee, he had already become committed to a pro-market ideology. In 1990, he helped draft the radical 500-day programme for market reform, which was buried by the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. In June 1990, he joined Mr Yeltsin's first administration in the hope that at least small, practical steps could be taken to build a market system in the biggest Soviet republic. Today, he cannot say whether he will succeed, but he believes that the tumultuous collapse of the Communist party's rule while he was away shows that 'anything is possible in Russia'. 'Cutting the budget deficit and producing a normal central bank is a much easier task than ousting the Communist party. That I would never have believed possible 10 years ago. But now I can imagine radical reform happening in Russia.' The politician in Fyodorov makes him say he is not counting on foreign help  -an unpopular subject in Russia following the failure of the pro-western strategy pursued last year by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister. But he suggests that it will be almost impossible for painful reforms to succeed without it. 'We're not Chinese,' he says, referring to the success of economic reforms under authoritarian rule in China. 'The question is: can we find mechanisms to substitute for dictatorship or occupation forces (such as those which pushed through economic adjustment in Germany and Japan after the second world war). Foreign aid could be a good substitute.' Asked to prepare Russian proposals for Mr Yeltsin's April 4 meeting with US President Bill Clinton, Fyodorov was in Hong Kong yesterday to brief representatives of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on how the west might prop up reforms in Russia. His suggestions include a social fund to help support the unemployed if tight credit policies are instituted, plus a programme to encourage the growth of small businesses to create new jobs. He would also like funds to help stabilise the rouble and restructure state-owned industry. But he says Russia must first institute restrictive financial policies, without which 'everything else would be wasted', and to devise mechanisms so that foreign cash is not squandered. 'There is no point in receiving assistance if it is not targeted (at specific problems). The question is how to receive this money properly, how to organise it - this is very, very difficult and frustrating,' he says, talking from his experience of the small flows of western finance trickling into Russia. Despite his determination to press ahead whatever the west does, western guarantees of support over the coming weeks could play an important role in domestic Russan political battles. But Fyodorov stresses that such money should only become available if and when Russia can keep its side of any bargain. 'We have talked far too long. It is now time for action.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1958    Born in Moscow. 1980    Doctorate in economics from Moscow Finance Institute. 1980-87 Joined Soviet central bank. 1987-91 Institute for World Economy and International Relations. 1992    Russia's executive director of World Bank. 1992    Appointed deputy prime minister for economics and finance.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

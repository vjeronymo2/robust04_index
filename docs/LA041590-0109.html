			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVING NO. 12 WITH PRIDE;  </P> <P> A LOVE OF PEOPLE MAKES FOR A SMOOTH ROAD FOR HONORED BUS DRIVER  </P> <P> Slightly behind schedule because a wheelchair rider had to be loaded, the  crowded bus hissed to a stop in front of a blue bench in Belmont Shore. Several  passengers forgave the driver for being three minutes late and got on.  </P> <P> "Hey ya, lady, good morning. How are things?" said Joe Catalano, the Long Beach  Public Transportation Co.'s driver of the year, to a woman whose two quarters  and dime were being noisily digested by the coin box.  </P> <P> Catalano maneuvered back into traffic. He held the steering wheel with both  hands, one tattooed with the Marine Corps insignia.  </P> <P> "I enjoy my job," he said. "I enjoy people, and now that I'm driver of the  year, people look up to me. It makes my day go by good."  </P> <P> He beamed at the thought of that honor, bestowed last December.  </P> <P> "We love him," said Debbie Lewis, who sat at the front of the No. 12 East Ocean  bus that Catalano captains on five round trips from downtown to Cal State Long  Beach. "He has a million jokes. Believe me, I've heard them all."  </P> <P> Catalano, snappy in his tie and blue shirt with the company patches on one  sleeve, admitted: "They're usually the same ones over and over. Sometimes I get  some new material."  </P> <P> He has been driving the bus since the fare was 7 cents 26 years ago. Now a man  of 60 with gray sideburns, a curled-up mustache and eyebrows that rise like  church spires, he approaches each day as if still an excited rookie.  </P> <P> Another regular rider, Madeline Pratt, appreciates that spirit. "In the evening  we don't have Joe, so I car-pool home," she said.  </P> <P> The driver-of-the-year award, instituted two years ago, is based on safety and  attendance records and, most importantly, how well a driver serves the  customers, said Guy Heston, assistant manager of the 335-driver transit  company.  </P> <P> "You have to have a lot of patience," Catalano said.  </P> <P> "Let's say a little old lady gets on. Well, she's going to take forever, but  you can't say, 'C'mon lady, hurry up.' And you have to accept that people will  be grouchy sometimes. If you can't control your temper, you're in the wrong  job."  </P> <P> Born in Boston, Catalano left that city after only 16 years but has retained  its accent in his voice. He spent a dozen years in the Marines, serving in the  Korean War as a staff sergeant, then became a bus driver in 1964.  </P> <P> "It was very hard at first," he said, "but I stuck it out. You have to learn  the tricks of the trade."  </P> <P> His job is easier now. "We have more safety equipment, bigger windows, a  comfortable seat, directional signals on the floor," he said. "We used to have  to use a changer, and we had to punch transfers. Now we have an automatic  transfer machine."  </P> <P> Viewing yachts out the huge windshield as he crossed a bridge, Catalano  assessed drivers of cars: "Fair, they don't signal."  </P> <P> He pointed to a Volkswagen and shook his head.  </P> <P> "The people who drive little cars dart in and out of traffic," he said. "They  think they have all the room in the world."  </P> <P> He said he has had one accident, a fender-bender when he first started. And one  ticket for speeding, also long ago but still vivid in reminiscence.  </P> <P> "I was going 35 miles an hour in a 30-mile zone and had a load of sailors who  wanted to go on liberty. I told the policeman, 'Can you hurry up and give me  the ticket? They want to go into town.' "  </P> <P> The No. 12 first rolls at 5:18 a.m. Because he walks 3 1/2 miles to work,  Catalano rises at 3:30 a.m. If he goes to a track after work, he is home early.  "I like to have a beer once in a while, but not during the week," he said. "No  way. My job is too important for that."  </P> <P> Playing the horses is a passion of this man who has never married but claims to  be still looking for a wife.  </P> <P> "Summer Squall" was the tip of one man who got on the bus downtown that recent  morning.  </P> <P> "I'll check it out," Catalano said.  </P> <P> His bus is almost like a tour bus. He points out new ships in the harbor and  the house on Ocean Boulevard in which Clark Gable used to live.  </P> <P> "If I only had one or two passengers the whole eight hours, I would still see  something interesting," he said.  </P> <P> At the terminus of each half-hour trip, either at the university or Catalina  Landing, there seemed a sadness.  </P> <P> The bus would be empty, and Catalano would search it for newspapers and lost  belongings. In all the years he has never found anything of value to turn in.  </P> <P> He would get a cup of coffee, return and sit alone in the big bus or stand  outside it.  </P> <P> "The driver of the year gets chrome wheels," He said, pointing to a hubcap.  </P> <P> He got back on and sat in one of the blue passenger seats. He could not get  that company dinner last December at the Lakewood Country Club off his mind.  </P> <P> He said he was filming the festivities with his video camera when the  announcement was made that he was driver of the year.  </P> <P> "I go, 'Oh my God,' and I hit my head against a wall," he said. "I'm shaking,  the camera's shaking. They're all yelling, and I'm kissing the women. That was  really a surprise."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANIELS TURNS IT AROUND;  </P> <P> DODGERS: LOS ANGELES COMES BACK FROM 3-0 DEFICIT IN THE EIGHTH INNING WHEN HE  HITS A THREE-RUN HOME RUN.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, hoping to become Road Scholars sometime soon, returned to class  Wednesday afternoon in the little old schoolhouse at Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> They had earned a master's in misery on their last trip, returning to Dodger  Stadium with a 1-7 report card that could have been worse if a game in New York  had not been rained out.  </P> <P> So they decided that a new attitude was needed: Learn to think only positively,  Psychology 101.  </P> <P> Given a chance to put that lesson to a test immediately, the Dodgers overcame a  three-run deficit against a pitcher seemingly in control and rallied to beat  the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, in the opener of an eight-game trip. Kal Daniels'  three-run home run provided a victory for pitcher Tim Belcher.  </P> <P> Said Mickey Hatcher: "I know that on the last trip, we had the feeling that  something bad was going to happen every time we went on the field. We have to  take the negative and turn it into positive."  </P> <P> Is a 3-0 deficit in the eighth inning negative enough? That's where the Dodgers  stood against Mike Harkey, the former Cal State Fullerton star who in one  stretch retired 12 consecutive batters, only three of whom managed to get the  ball out of the infield.  </P> <P> Harkey had given up a single to Chris Gwynn in the first inning, a single to  Mike Scioscia in the second, a walk, and a double by Lenny Harris -- that being  the only time a Dodger advanced as far as second base. When the eighth came,  Harkey wasn't exactly getting bombed. Dissected is more like it.  </P> <P> After Alfredo Griffin opened the inning with a groundout, Hatcher,  pinch-hitting for Belcher, singled. Harris followed with an infield hit,  actually a squibber down the line that third baseman Luis Salazar held,  thinking the ball was foul and not realizing his mistake until Harris had  reached first base. Stan Javier added a sinking line drive to left field that  Doug Dascenzo trapped for a single, Hatcher scoring.  </P> <P> Harkey got Eddie Murray to hit back to the box, but Harkey was done. Cub  Manager Don Zimmer brought in Paul Assenmacher, who was sent out almost as  quickly.  </P> <P> Assenmacher's first assignment was Daniels, whose three-run blast to  left-center was his fourth homer in nine games.  </P> <P> Next up was Scioscia, who singled to right field. Zimmer replaced Assenmacher  with Bill Long, who gave up another hit to Mike Sharperson, then ended the  Dodger rally by striking out Juan Samuel.  </P> <P> Belcher helped the Dodgers get that far with a solid outing of his own. He  served up a first-inning solo home run to Dave Clark, but had only one bad  inning, the sixth, before being lifted for the pinch-hitter after seven  innings. Still, Domingo Ramos' two-run single had been enough to send out  Belcher, trailing, 3-0.  </P> <P> There was a positive aspect to this, though. Normally a power pitcher who uses  90% to 95% fastballs, Belcher has been teaching himself the art of finesse  pitching. It's not by choice: The good hard stuff has abandoned him since his  May 1 outing against Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Until it comes back -- he doesn't consider it an if proposition -- Belcher has  learned to depend more on his curve or slider or split-finger change. The last  two starts, both victories, it has been 75% to 80% fastballs.  </P> <P> "For a power pitcher, who goes out there relying on his fastball, to not have  it is like going out there naked," said Belcher, who blames the shortened  spring training and throwing too many innings too soon into the season.  </P> <P> "But the fact is, I'm still keeping my team in games and getting some wins  without the real good fastball. So that's still encouraging."  </P> <P> With the victory, he improved to 4-3. The six-hit inning that gave the Dodgers  the lead came before his reliever, Pat Perry, became the pitcher of record.  </P> <P> "You get the hook, and get a win with one swing," Belcher said, referring to  Daniels' home run. "I think that's the first time I've ever gotten a win in the  clubhouse in the major leagues."  </P> <P> Perry, just off the disabled list after shoulder surgery, was joined by Jay  Howell and Mike Hartley in protecting the 4-3 lead into the ninth, although  Hartley left after surrendering a walk to Salazar and a single to Ramos. From  there, Don Aase got the final three outs and his third save when Marvell Wynne  ended the game by grounding out to Sharperson at first base.  </P> <P> And school was out.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> For the first time this season, Hubie Brooks did not start, after the Dodgers  announced that he was bothered by shin splints in his right leg. Chris Gwynn  opened in right field. First baseman Eddie Murray, who injured his left  hamstring in New York during the last trip and apparently aggravated it during  Tuesday's loss to the Mets at Dodger Stadium, appeared as a pinch-hitter in the  eighth inning. In Murray's absence, Mike Sharperson got his first career start  at first base. . . . Pitcher John Wetteland, who has the flu, stayed at the  team's hotel. He had missed his scheduled start Tuesday because of the illness  but pitched an inning of relief.  </P> <P> Chicago's Domingo Ramos, who came in batting .195, went four for four with two  runs batted in. "Was that Domingo Ramos?" Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda asked  later. "I thought that was Lou Boudreau." . . . Mike Harkey tied a National  League record by becoming the third pitcher to record three putouts in an  inning. The two others, Rick Reuschel in 1985 and Ed Lynch in '86, also did it  while with the Cubs. Harkey's turn came in the fourth inning, all on grounders  to first base, with Mark Grace getting the assists.  </P> <P> Lasorda, on Tim Belcher's quest to regain his fastball: "He threw some balls  good today that shows he's coming back -- not with a great deal of consistency  -- but he showed some of the fastball like last year. It'll be back." . . .  Fernando Valenzuela (3-3) will pitch for the Dodgers today against Les  Lancaster (3-1) in the closer of the two-game set.  </P></p>

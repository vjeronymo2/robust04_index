			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Russia Ready for Cooperation"] </F>   [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense  minister, received U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who  are visiting Russia, 5 January. During the conversation they  touched on the state of and prospects for Russian-U.S. military  cooperation. The increase in the intensity of ties in this  sphere is indicated by the fact that last year there were 17  major events related to establishing cooperation between the two  states' armed forces and another 26 are scheduled for the coming  year.    At the U.S. senators' request Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told  them about the features of Russia's new military doctrine. In  particular he stressed that it is no coincidence that there is  no reference in the "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation  Military Doctrine" to Russia not being the first to use nuclear  weapons. First, the corresponding U.S., British, and French  documents contain no such provision. Second, such a pledge on  our part did not enable nuclear weapons to be regarded as a  means of averting war and a factor for deterring a potential  aggressor.    The Russian defense minister described Russia's attitude to  the "Partnership for Peace" idea mooted by the United States by  saying the following: "We are ready to support the idea insofar  as it considers the security interests of all states without  exception" and if it is based on an all-Europe rather than a  bloc system of security. As we see it, Pavel Grachev pointed  out, true partnership means developing political dialogue,  regular consultations, and reaching agreed positions, and this  activity may culminate in coordinated practical actions. Russia  is ready for that kind of cooperation.    During the meeting they also discussed questions of  cooperation in nuclear disarmament and housing construction for  servicemen, in particular servicemen from the troops being  withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states. There was also a  detailed discussion of Ukrainian and North Korean nuclear policy  and Russia's view of these problems.    Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General  Staff of the Russian Federation Armed Forces; Andrey Kokoshin,  Russian first deputy defense minister; and, on the U.S. side,  Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, took part in the  conversation.    It is somewhat symbolic that on the same day the Russian and  U.S. defense ministers had their first conversation over the  direct telephone line connecting the offices of the heads of the  two countries' military departments. Henceforth it will be  easier and quicker to resolve urgent "burning" problems.  Another step has been taken toward developing military  cooperation.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 600 Group to launch lathe range 600 Group, the manufacturer and distributor of machine tools and materials handling equipment, will next month launch a new range of low-cost Colchester lathes specially designed for small engineering companies. The launch is an important move for 600 Group. Within two to three years, it hopes to be producing several hundred of the new Tornado machines each year from its 600 Lathes plant in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire. The three new machines will be priced from Pounds 34,950 to Pounds 47,950 in the UK, and could add Pounds 5m to 600 Group's profits within a few years, said Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director. In the year to March 1993, the company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.4m. The launch follows a two-year, Pounds 500,000 development programme and a market research exercise among 3,500 small engineering companies worldwide to assess their needs for CNC (computer numerical control) lathes.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Scots bank staff to vote on strike THE Royal Bank of Scotland is facing widespread disruption to its financial activities as its 700-strong computer staff are balloted by banking union Bifu to support a series of one-day strikes. The ballot for action - in protest at the bank's decision to either dismiss or downgrade 44 managers in its technology division - will begin on October 14 and the result is expected by the end of the month. The bank expressed its disappointment at the union's decision to go ahead with a strike ballot. 'We want a negotiated settlement and not a strike', said Mr Sandy Boyle, Bifu's Scottish officer yesterday. He accused the bank of drawing up a 'hit list ' of middle and senior managers and using performance assessment exercises to make 10 per cent of its technology workforce redundant every year and replace them with contract staff. The bank rejected Mr Boyle's assertions, saying all but 20 had been found new jobs. The union had been involved in 'confidential consultation in advance of any decisions being announced'. It had been told that 44 staff would have to be made redundant or redeployed. Those moving to other jobs would retain their salary level. The bank also denied it had a 'hit list' or intended to 'clear out' 10 per cent of its technology workforce each year. The union wants the bank to allow those dismissed to return to their jobs, and a reduction in the use of contract staff by the bank. Mr Boyle warned that staff were angry and it was only after three consultative meetings they had pressed the union to hold a strike ballot. Earlier this year the bank announced it was reducing its staff by 3,500 by 1997 with 1,000 jobs going this year.</p>

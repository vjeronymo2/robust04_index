			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Reshape union link, says Blair MR TONY BLAIR, shadow home secretary, yesterday rejected proposals for a new form of Labour party associate membership for trade unionists. Mr Blair called on BBC television for Labour's relationship with unions to be recast on the basis of one-member-one-vote for all members. He rejected any institutional role for the unions in the selection of the party's parliamentary candidates. His comments, reflecting deep concern that Labour is not going far enough to dismantle its traditional relationship with the unions, foreshadow an intense struggle in the shadow cabinet to win the support of Mr John Smith. The Labour leader has signalled that he is inclined to support a compromise proposal that would involve giving 'associate membership' to trade unionists who paid the political levy and declared their support for the party.</p>

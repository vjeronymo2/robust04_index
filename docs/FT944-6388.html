			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Venezuela mass jail breakout About 70 prisoners were on the run from a Venzuelan prison yesterday, amid unconfirmed reports of deaths after a mass jail break, authorities and local radio said. Union Radio, quoting police sources, said between 30 and 40 prisoners had died in the escape and ensuing fighting with guards at Tocuyito jail in the eastern state of Carabobo, 160 miles from Caracas. Some 100 prisoners escaped in the early hours of Tuesday morning when an electricity failure allowed them to dodge guards. Police recaptured about 30 of the inmates.</p>

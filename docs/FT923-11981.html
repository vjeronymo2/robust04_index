			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Management: Armageddon view of European pricing - Christopher Lorenz takes issue with a scaremongering study of company profitability A pricing 'time bomb' is ticking under the profitability of many companies in Europe. By depressing product and service prices across the European Community to the lowest national level, it could threaten their very existence if they do not act quickly. That is the Armageddon view of European pricing expressed by two leading German business academics, Professor Hermann Simon and Dr Eckhard Kucher. They blame pressures to create common cross-border pricing which they say are being exerted by parallel importers and strong retailers. The only way out, they argue, is for companies smartly to raise prices in their cheapest markets, or to quit those markets altogether. In an article in the summer issue of the European Management Journal*, the two academics say that each company must also establish a centrally-calculated 'European price corridor' within which prices in each of its national markets must be set. There is, however, a much less nightmarish view of the situation. It has been gaining ground among manufacturers since their panic a few years ago over the approach of the European 'single market'. In a phrase, it is that reports of the death of national price differentiation have been greatly exaggerated. This school of thought argues that the fear of standard European pricing fails to take account of several important factors: that Cross-border retailers are still few and far between, and that national retailers show little interest in harmonising purchase prices; The degree of parallel importing is still very limited; The number of products in different European countries which are similar, let alone identical, is also limited; Identical products tend to be positioned very differently in different countries; Distribution and retail patterns, and therefore pricing pressures, vary widely from market to market; There is even a trend for different retailers within the same country to demand varied packaging on identical products. This view holds that the alarmist prophesies of European pricing consultants are little more than scare-mongering tactics. Yet Simon and Kucher have some strong scare stories, and they offer valuable advice to those companies facing pressures to harmonise their selling prices across Europe. They tell, for example, of the 'horrific' situation confronted last year by a leading Germanic manufacturer of consumer products, which sells through large retailers, some of which have operations in several countries. Simon and Kucher call the company Logo GmbH to preserve its identity. Logo was told by its largest retailing customer to supply products in each country at one European price - the lowest in Europe. This happened to be in Portugal. Logo had no choice but to comply, and this slashed its prices by an average of 20 per cent. The consequences for its profits were 'disastrous' - it incurred the first loss in its history. Rather than starting hastily to align prices on to a low common European level, companies should do everything they can quickly to raise levels in low-price countries even if this hits market share, argue Simon and Kucher. They propose a range of complex but objective techniques for assessing the optimum price; such decisions are often taken too subjectively, they complain. The techniques - including something called 'conjoint measurement'  -also help analyse all the competitive and other trade-offs which must be made to determine the ideal level and breadth of a 'European price corridor'. The academics have several particular points of advice: Attack the problem dispassionately. Since most companies' turnover comes mainly from large countries, nothing is more foolish than to undermine their price levels through low prices in small countries. For instance, Logo would have done far better to have abandoned the Portuguese market. Price elasticity varies between countries more than many companies realise. To ignore this in the quest for a uniform European price is to throw away profit. Also, it may be better to tolerate a certain amount of parallel imports. Determination of a company's European price corridor is not only complex, but also painful in organisational terms. Pricing decisions must be taken centrally, even though this flies in the face of most companies' existing decentralisation of pricing - and of profit responsibility. 'Because of these incompatibilities, European pricing is an area of continuous conflict in many multinational companies.' * The European Pricing Time Bomb. EMJ June 1992.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ]  Governor Yasushi Mieno said Monday [24 January] the economy  remains mired in a slump with more time needed for recovery, but  maintained his stance of keeping current monetary policy intact.    The economy "remains stagnant" with personal consumption and  capital investment -- the key pillars of domestic demand --  "staying lackluster," Mieno said in an opening address to a  two-day meeting of branch managers and overseas representatives.  Against this backdrop, labor conditions have become "tougher,"  and the business sentiment has turned "more cautious," he added.    Although the latest fiscal and monetary measures are  expected  to continue showing their effects, an economic recovery seems to  require "more time," Mieno said. But the central bank intends  to watch the effects of past measures, he repeated, stressing  that credit easing to date is "contributing to set the  environment for macroeconomic recovery" by facilitating  corporate restructuring programs.    Meanwhile, Mieno noted that lending by private financial  institutions has remained weak and the money supply has  continued to post low growth despite record-renewing drops in  lending rates in line with the latest discount rate cut in  September to an all-time low of 1.75 percent.    Mieno attributed the distant recovery outlook to cautious  activities among companies and financial institutions stemming  from lingering problems in clearing losses incurred during asset  deflation after the collapse of the "bubble" economic boom of  the late 1980s.    He also cited continued corporate restructuring in "trade  divisions" to cope with the yen's appreciation. But Mieno  reiterated that capital stock adjustments have progressed, and  "pressure in this sense" is expected to "head toward easing."    Under these circumstances, Mieno called on banks to continue  liquidating bad loans "steadily." He stressed the importance of  "fully" utilizing market "vitality" in promoting adjustments and  putting the economy on a path toward sustainable growth without  inflation.    BOJ branch managers from 30 domestic branches and three  overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on the  economic conditions of their repective areas.    Attention is fixed on whether the two-day meeting would lead  the central bank to ease its monetary policy at a crucial time  for the government that on Friday failed to pass the political  reform bills through the upper house of the Diet. With the  failure expected to cause a possible delay in the launching of a  new fiscal package slated for this week, and with the market  plunging again, hopes for a rate cut are rekindling after  receding amid the stock market rally over the past week.    Tokyo stocks took a steep dive of more than 800 points in  the  key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues Monday morning.</p>

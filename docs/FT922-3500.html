			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: AH Ball achieves growth of 16% In demanding market conditions AH Ball Group managed a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 825,000 to Pounds 960,000, in the 12 months to March 31. Sales were little changed at Pounds 5.75m. The USM-quoted civil engineer said that the malaise in the construction industry continued to affect the water and gas market sectors. However, profit margins in the second half benefited from adjusted depreciation rates, and the commercial completion of contracts substantially finished in the first half. A recommended final dividend of 4.8p brings the total to 7p (6.75p). Earnings per share were 10.19p (8.04p). The shares added 10p to 160p.</p>

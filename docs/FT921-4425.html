			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Persimmon falls 23% to Pounds 22.26m PERSIMMON, the north of England-based UK housebuilder, yesterday revealed that it had sold a record number of houses last month but warned that it was too early to talk about a recovery in the UK housing market. Announcing a 23 per cent drop to Pounds 22.26m in pre-tax profits for 1991, Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said that the group had made an en- couraging start to the current year. Earnings per share fell from 23.4p to 16.8p. This still left a dividend cover of almost two times leaving plenty of scope for Persimmon to keep its promise to raise dividends by 20 per cent. This was made a year ago when the group raised Pounds 33m from a 2-for-11 rights issue priced at 238p a share. The final dividend was increased from 4.85p to 5.8p making a total of 8.6p (7.15p). Persimmon's share price following yesterday's announcement rose from 287p to 294p. Mr Davidson said that the group had achieved a record 304 sales last month, averaging more than 70 a month. The first week of this month had seen sales slip to 50. This was still encouraging compared with very low sales at the end of last year. He said: 'We are not suggesting that this is the start of a recovery. There have been previous occasions during the past year when sales have picked up only to fall again. Nonetheless we would expect a recovery in house sales to get underway during the next 12 months.' The group which last year sold 2,324 homes intended to increase production to 4,000 homes a year during the next few years. Purchases of sites during the past 12 months had increased the group's land bank from 11,500 to 13,000 plots. It said that margins should start to improve as higher-priced land bought during the late 1980s was used up. Mr Davidson said that net pre-tax profit per house had fallen from Pounds 16,000 in the first half of 1990 to Pounds 8,000 in the second half of last year. Net margins had fallen to 15.5 per cent compared with 25 per cent several years ago. He said said the quality of Persimmon's land bank had enabled the group to stick to its policy of not writing down land values unless it had made a loss on a site. This was then subtracted from operating profits. The policy is in marked contrast to other housebuilders, some of which are expected to announce very large land provisions during the next few weeks.

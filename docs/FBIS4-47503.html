Simashko under the ``Signal Processing'' </F> rubric; received after rework Aug. 9, 1991; UDC 621.396.6]    [Abstract] An important task of a system for establishing  communications (SEC) in navigation and command systems and  communication radio systems is to measure signal carrier  frequency and provide target indication to the frequency  tracking system. The objective of the work was to study  algorithms for measuring the carrier frequency of a continuous  phase manipulated signal that use two fast Fourier transform  (FFT) readings of a discrete complex spectrum and comparing them  to known algorithms using one FFT reading. The article analyzes  the case when symbols boundaries are unknown. Analysis methods  are described. Synchronous and asynchronous SEC operating modes  are examined. The synchronous mode yields a lower average  carrier frequency measurement error than an asynchronous mode.  The asynchronous mode makes it possible to reduce frequency  estimate shift and in certain cases yields a lower maximum error  than the synchronous mode. Figures 3, references 4.</p>

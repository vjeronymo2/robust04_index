			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- Another moratorium has  been granted to the outstanding debts Iran owes to South Korean  traders.    A business source said on Friday that a visiting Iranian  Central Bank delegation and representatives of South Korean  creditors agreed on Thursday that the debts will be paid in  three years and six months on an installment payment basis after  two years' grace.    The outstanding debts Iran owed to major Korean firms  totaled  360 million dollars as of the end of last year.    Toward the end of last year, the two sides agreed on the  payment of the debts in two years after a year's grace period.    When the 70 million dollars maturing this year are included,  the total outstanding debts would total 430 million dollars, the  source said.    This amount represents the debts Iran owes to those 16 major  industries which maintain branch offices in Iran. When those  owed to small Korean industries are counted, the total  outstanding debts would easily run to more than 500 million  dollars, he said.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries recover early losses as dollar improves After falling back during the morning session on overnight weakening of the dollar, Treasury prices recouped most of their losses yesterday afternoon following a modest rebound in the US currency. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down just 1/32 at 96 5/32 , to yield 7.828 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, at 99 7/8 , yielding 6.549 per cent. Prices edged lower from the start, primarily because of a slide in the dollar's value on foreign exchange markets overnight and fresh losses in US trading, which pushed the US currency to a new low against the D-Mark. Investors were worried that further declines in the dollar might push the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates sooner rather than later. Although the Fed generally does not change monetary policy because of currency concerns, it is believed to be ready to raise rates if the economy continues to grow strongly. Consequently, some analysts believe fresh weakness in the dollar could trigger an early move by Fed policy makers. The market was put under additional pressure by a firming in commodity prices - including gold, platinum, silver and crude oil - and by news of a strong business inventories reading for August. However, dealers reported little selling during the morning session. This helped explain why, after the dollar bounced of its lows, bond prices rallied in the afternoon amid a rush of short covering by dealers. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's narrow election victory gave bunds a boost which rippled across European government bond markets. The Nordic markets derived additional support from the Finnish referendum on European Union membership, which resulted in a vote of 57 per cent in favour of joining. German government bonds recouped an early drop to end a busy day more than 1/2 point higher. Although bunds had already risen sharply last week in anticipation of a Kohl victory, the rally continued yesterday as capital flows into the market increased, observers said. 'Although a lot of people were calling for a Kohl victory, few of them were willing to bet their money on it before the election - the opinion polls were so close until the very end,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'But once people knew the outcome, there was an immediate flow of funds into German assets, especially bonds.' Traders reported buying of bunds not only by European fund managers, but also from east Asian and US investors. This was also reflected in the D-Mark, which rose sharply against most other currencies. Bunds largely ignored weakness in the US Treasury market, which caused the yield spread between the two markets to widen. Mr Callow expects this divergence to continue in the near term as bunds strengthen further. However, he warned that as bund yields approached 7 per cent, that spread would look 'very stretched'. The election hurdle having been overcome, the focus is now back on the Bundesbank as market participants await September M3 money supply data and October inflation numbers. French bonds underperformed their German counterparts, causing the 10-year yield spread over bunds to widen to 69 basis points, from 62 on Friday. The market was depressed by the French franc's weakness against the D-Mark and the shift of the political focus from Germany to France ahead of next year's presidential elections. Political jitters have been exacerbated by recent corruption scandals surrounding members of the government. The OAT futures contract on Matif rose by 0.08 point to 111.90. UK gilts tracked bunds higher and underperformed them only slightly, with the 10-year yield spread widening by two basis points to 132. The December long gilt future rose by  1/2 to 102 1/4 . In the absence of significant domestic data, gilts are expected to take their cues from international markets until Friday's release of third-quarter GDP figures. The Nordic markets posted solid gains, boosted both by firmer markets elsewhere and Finland's vote in favour of EU membership. Mr Paul Donovan, bond analyst at UBS, said: 'The prospect of a positive vote in the Swedish referendum on November 13 has increased; if Sweden agrees to EU membership, there are realistic prospects for a 'yes' in Norway's referendum on November 28.' EU membership for Sweden would provide prospects for fiscal austerity as the government aimed to meet the Maastricht criteria, and support for the krona, he said.</p>

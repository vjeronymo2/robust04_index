			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Stench of sleaze is enveloping Tories, says Straw A stench of 'sleaze, cronyism, insider dealing, waste and corruption' was enveloping the Conservative party, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said last night. He said no soap powder or deodorant would be able to remove this 'smell-bad' factor before the next general election. Mr Straw, speaking in Nottingham, saw no likelihood that the Conservatives' political fortunes would improve with the help of continuing economic growth and falling unemployment. 'Whatever happens to the economy in the next two years, anxiety, fear and insecurity have gone too far to make people 'feel good' about the Conservative party,' he said. Mr Straw said the Conservatives were in such bad odour because they had taken positive steps to reduce the scope of democratic institutions and replace them with an unaccountable and unelected 'quango state'. In an apparent response to earlier Conservative attacks on 'loony left' Labour councils, he said that for every pound lost in elected local government, Pounds 60 was lost in quangos and central government through fraud, corruption and serious mismanagement. Mr Straw said a Labour government would establish an elected regional council for the east Midlands, where Pounds 2,379m of taxpayers' money was being spent by 169 quangos and unelected boards. Where appointed bodies remained there would be far tighter rules on conflicts of interest. A Labour government would also 'clean up the rules on insider trading, party political funding and the honours system'.</p>

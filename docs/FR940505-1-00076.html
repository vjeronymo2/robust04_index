			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1171  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Solvent Cleaning Operations) as adopted on August 2, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other impacts of the proposed FIP rule's requirements can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in SCAQMD's final staff report for Rule 1171, dated July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. This proposed FIP rule also incorporates changes from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft amended Rule 1171 released by SCAQMD on October 6, 1993 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components of the VCAPCD Rule 74.19 (Graphic Arts) as adopted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 11, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is in the process of developing an Alternative Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology (ACT) Document for solvent cleaning operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACT will primarily address recordkeeping and will not establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national guidelines for solvent content and work practices. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP rule requirements on VOC content and work practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not conflict with the draft ACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.44 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 11.82 tpd in Sacramento in 2005,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 3.55 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 6.75, 7.66, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.66 tpd respectively at an overall cost savings of $991 per ton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC removed (1990 dollars). A cost savings is projected because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB and the Districts have identified compliant solvents which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are less expensive than high-VOC solvents currently in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Wood Products Coatings (Sacramento, Ventura)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(b) controls VOC emissions resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from commercial and industrial application in the Sacramento and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura nonattainment areas of coatings while manufacturing wood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC content of various wood coating products; (2) allowing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricting application of wood coatings to application methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and equipment with high transfer efficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to all persons applying coating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inks, stains, and/or strippers in wood product coating operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the purpose of manufacturing wood products, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furniture and other coated objects made of solid wood and/or wood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition and/or simulated wood material. The proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not apply to residential noncommercial operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the affected wood products coating operators are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to comply with the proposed rule through the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated coatings rather than add-on emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1136  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled ``Wood Products Coatings,'' as amended on August 2, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA has incorporated some of SCAQMD's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to Rule 1136, dated July 23, 1993. Evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1136 can be found in SCAQMD Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1136_Wood Products Coatings,'' dated April 19, 1988, and SCAQMD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplemental Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule 1136_Wood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products Coatings,'' dated July 5, 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has prepared a draft Control Techniques Guideline (CTG)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document on wood products coatings that is entitled ``Control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Wood Furniture Coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations.'' Upon publication of the CTG, revisions to this FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule may be appropriate for consistency. EPA expects, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed FIP rule may be more stringent than the CTG in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some regards to reflect the unusually difficult air pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems in the FIP areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.49 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 0.55 tpd in Sacramento in 2005,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 0.65 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 0.45, 0.51, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.61 tpd respectively at a cost of $18 per ton VOC removed (1988  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Automotive Refinishing Operations (Sacramento).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) controls VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobile refinishing operations in the Sacramento nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of various automobile refinishing coatings; (2) allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85 percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricting application of automotive refinishing coatings to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application methods and equipment with high transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to facilities that apply coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to motor vehicles and mobile equipment or their existing parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and components for the purpose of on-site refinishing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification. The proposed rule does not apply to application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original equipment manufacturing coatings applied at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing plants. Affected facilities include autobody  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair/paint shops, production autobody paint shops, new car  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealer repair/paint shops, fleet operator repair/paint shops,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custom-made car fabrication facilities, and truck body builders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) is based largely on SCAQMD's Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1151, Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coating Operations (September 6, 1991). Portions of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP rule are based on CARB's Determination of Reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Automotive Refinishing Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (January 8, 1991). An evaluation of the environmental, economic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1151 requirements can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in SCAQMD's staff report for the proposed amended Rule 1151  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (August, 1991); this evaluation is also applicable to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.23 tpd in 1999 and 4.71 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 3.77 tpd  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 4.19 tpd respectively at a cost of $7,200 per ton of VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed (1990 dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 183(e)(3) of the Act, EPA may in the future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue either national regulations or a CTG for this source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category, as well as for other categories discussed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. If EPA does so and the FIP rule is less stringent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the national guidance or rule, EPA will amend the FIP rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Adhesives and Sealants (Sacramento) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(d) controls VOC emissions resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from industrial and commercial use of adhesives and sealants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various adhesives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sealants; and (2) allowing the use of add-on control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 percent in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the VOC limits on coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule applies to certain facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply, sell, or use adhesives, sealants, or adhesive primers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affected facilities include (but are not limited to)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing plants, architectural and construction companies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and welding operations. Various activities are exempt from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or part or the proposed rule, including tire repair, undersea-based weapon systems manufacturing, research and development, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small quantity users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

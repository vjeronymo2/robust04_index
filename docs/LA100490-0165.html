			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $700,000 IN DELINQUENT CHILD SUPPORT  COLLECTED  </P> <P> More than $700,000 in child support payments has been collected from 650  delinquent parents in Los Angeles County District Atty. Ira Reiner's two-month  amnesty program, Reiner said Wednesday.  </P> <P> At a news conference with his long-time adversary, feminist attorney Gloria  Allred, Reiner said that additional child support payments have been pledged by  parents who took advantage of the "Support Our Kids" program in order to avoid  arrest and jail.  </P> <P> Reiner said his Bureau of Family Support operations plans to file more than 250  new cases against parents who have failed to provide family support. His  investigators also will resume arrests of those with outstanding warrants for  failure to pay child support.  </P> <P> Those arrested will face up to one year in jail, a $2,000 fine, or both, Reiner  said. And they still will be responsible for the support payments, he said.  </P></p>

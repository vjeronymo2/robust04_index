			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: EMC earnings growth exceeds expectations EMC, the fast growing US manufacturer of computer data storage and retrieval systems, reported a 331 per cent jump in earnings for 1993 as sales far exceeded expectations. EMC's products include data storage systems for use with IBM mainframe and mid-range computers as well as Unisys mainframes. For the year, the company reported revenues of Dollars 783m, an increase of 103 per cent over 1992's Dollars 386m. Net income for the year rose to Dollars 127m, or 60 cents a share, compared with Dollars 29.5m, or 16 cents a share, in 1992. Fourth-quarter revenues more than doubled to Dollars 248.6m from Dollars 117.8m while net income was Dollars 46.8m, or 21 cents a share, up from Dollars 10.4m, or 6 cents, in the same period a year ago. EMC is a leader in the emerging disk array market, for data storage systems based upon a collection of small disk drives, like those used in personal computers. Disk arrays provide faster data retrieval as well as higher storage capacity than conventional data storage systems at a lower price. EMC gained market share in 1993 and expects to continue to do so this year, said Mr Michael Ruettgers, president and chief executive. EMC is planning to launch new very high capacity data storage products this year that will address a broader segment of the data storage market, added Mr Bob Ano, senior vice-president of marketing. In particular, the company expects growing demand for high capacity storage systems for multimedia and information highway applications, such as interactive television.</p>

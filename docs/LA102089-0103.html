			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GROSS ANATOMY' NEEDS SOME SCRIPT SURGERY  </P> <P> The young medical students in "Gross Anatomy" (citywide) -- five hopeful  surgeons sharing the same dissection table during a punishing first med-school  year -- aren't the kind you'd want pawing around your pancreas in some  emergency.  </P> <P> Self-centered, callous, shallow, they don't express much desire to help people  beyond the formula rote idealism you'd expect from students-on-the-make. Except  for pregnant young Kim (Alice Carter), they seem low on sensitivity, as well.  These are kids, and a movie, with tunnel vision: yuppie-doctors-in-embryo. One  of them (Todd Field) pops pills and hides biochemistry textbooks naear his  cadaver. Another (John Scott Clough) is a silk-shirted apple-polisher. They're  privileged kids for whom success is a touchstone. The major seeming exception,  fisherman's son Joe Slovak (Matthew Modine), is slotted as the group's sexy  rebel. He bounces a basketball on the way to his class locker.  </P> <P> This sounds like good meat for a satire of the medical profession -- a movie  that might cheerfully savage its mercenary tendencies -- and "MASH" and "The  Paper Chase" are the obvious inspirations, along with the real-life experiences  of co-producer and ex-med student Howard Rosenman.  </P> <P> But "Gross Anatomy" isn't really geared for satire or humorous realism. There's  a charismatic mentor here, like "Paper Chase's" Prof. Kingsfield, plus some of  "MASH's" jock irreverence and a pale carbon of its hip, funny attitude toward  gore. Mostly, though, the five writers who've pawed over this story in three  shifts have shot it full of '80s raw pragmatism and sentimental tomfoolery and  left it anesthetized on the table, full of cheerless twitches and spasmodic  eruptions of programmed mirth.  </P> <P> There's another deodorant-ad notion of a love affair: Novak and Laurie (Daphne  Zuniga) do much of their wooing on a jogging track and, when Laurie succumbs,  she says simply "You got me!" Novak's rebellion, meanwhile, is limited to  helping his roommate cheat on exams and cheerfully telling his examiners that  he's in it for the money. (So, apparently, is the movie.)  </P> <P> Christine Lahti is cast in the John Houseman-type role and, though she is a  brilliant actress, she is used badly here. The script suggests that Lahti's Dr.  Woodruff sees Joe as a kindred spirit: a rebel, an outsider, a born doctor.  Instead, she seems another movie fairy godmother, inexplicably hung up on a  self-absorbed goof-off. When, in the movie's big passing-the-torch scene, Joe  finds her wasting away from lupus and begins screaming "What do you want from  me?," you want to set him right back to his fisherman dad, perhaps to be used  as bait.  </P> <P> Is this any way for a potential surgeon to act toward an obviously dying woman?  You'd like to think the writers are being sarcastic with Dr. Woodruff's  response -- she gives him a be-all-that-you-can-be speech -- but no such luck.  Fifty years ago, Joe would have been wafted with a heavenly choir out of this  benediction from his female Dr. Chips straight to worldwide surgical fame.  Here, we know we're heading toward the '80s equivalent: a climactic sexy clinch  with Daphne Zuniga and soft-rock under the credits.  </P> <P> The director of "Gross Anatomy" (MPAA-rated PG-13 for sex and language), Thom  Eberhardt ("Night of the Comet"), shows occasional verve and a lively touch  with the actors -- especially Modine and Field, surprisingly good as Joe's  amphetamine-crazed roommate. But there's a no-exit shallowness to this '80s  sentimentalism where people scream, rage and insult each other, cheat, strive  ruthlessly for success, and go warm and gooey after they pass the final exam.  Who needs heavenly choirs? "Gross," in this case, describes the anatomy class  and the movie itself.  </P> <P> 'GROSS ANATOMY'  </P> <P> A Touchstone Pictures presentation in association with Silver Screen Partners  IV.

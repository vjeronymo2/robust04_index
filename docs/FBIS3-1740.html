As a result of continued progress in  broadcasting, recording, and media technology, effective 1  March, the Central People's Radio Network will air casts under  Program One, that have been originally broadcast via frequency  106.1 MHz, in stereophonic instead of monophonic sound system.    While being broadcast in stereophonic sound system, casts --  especially literary casts -- in the Central People's Radio  Network Program One will have characteristics such as treble and  bass notes, a strong sense of reality, and a pleasant timbre to  provide listeners with more melodious entertainment.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Teachers to ballot on test boycott TEACHERS in England and Wales yesterday neared outright conflict with the government over controversial national curriculum tests. The executive of the NASUWT, the second largest teachers' union, voted to ballot its 127,000 members on a boycott of all tests this year. The tests are due to be sat by seven and 14 year olds in state schools from April. The union will seek next Tuesday the support of the other five teachers' unions. All have expressed serious reservations about this year's tests for 14 year olds, which are to be compulsory for the first time. The tests in English, set to take place in June, have caused particular controversy. The last of the prescribed texts have only recently been received by schools, and sample questions have still to reach many teachers. Teachers say this has left insufficient time to prepare pupils. There is also widespread opposition to the publication of test results, which may lead to school league tables like those issued by the government for this year's tests for seven year olds. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Teachers know their pupils are being used by the government. They know that the tests have not been properly piloted, that set texts have been announced piecemeal after the year has begun and spending decisions have been made.' Of the other unions, the National Union of Teachers, the largest, is most likely to join the NASUWT in pressing for a boycott. An NUT survey of teachers involved in the English tests, released earlier this week, showed nine out 10 respondents in favour of a boycott. Baroness Blatch, schools minister, described claims that the tests had not been properly prepared as 'ridiculous', and pointed to pilots 'involving hundreds of schools and thousands of pupils' over the past 2 1/2 years. Mr de Gruchy said the boycott would 'definitely go ahead' if he secured a 'clear-cut majority'. It would probably start in April but possible courses of government action are unclear - particularly when education authorities, headteachers and governors are all sympathetic. Despite threatened boycotts, the introduction of tests for seven year olds in 1991 proceeded without disruption. Mr de Gruchy said his union was not opposed to 'sensible testing and assessment', and hoped Mr John Patten, education secretary, would think again and 'engage in genuine consultation' over the tests. A GROUP of headteachers has set up the National Co-ordinating Committee on Learning and Assessment to campaign on the issue of pupil testing in England and Wales, Bethan Hutton writes. Mr David Martin, headmaster of Chenderit School in Middleton Cheney, Northamptonshire, organised the committee after headteachers in the county recommended that schools should not proceed with testing, and received approaches from other areas where similar decisions had been taken. 'It is a groundswell,' he said, adding that members were united by the strength of their feelings on the subject, not by any union affiliation.</p>

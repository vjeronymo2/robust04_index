			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mayne Nickless posts 26% rise MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and health group, yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in equity accounted net profit of ADollars 143.7m (USDollars 102.1m) for the year to the end of June. The result included abnormal profit of ADollars 54m before tax, largely reflecting the sale of its cross-shareholding in Amcor, the Australian packaging and paper group. Net operating profit after minority interests but before abnormal items was down 3.2 per cent to ADollars 99m on turnover down 4.4 per cent to ADollars 2.8bn, reflecting the Amcor disposal. Mayne Nickless said the result was 'steady' in the light of poorer trading conditions. An unchanged final dividend of 17.5 cents per share, fully franked, was declared, making a total of 35 cents, equivalent to 34.7 cents adjusted for a one-for-five February rights issue.</p>

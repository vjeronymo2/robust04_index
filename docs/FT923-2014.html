			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Heseltine moves to offset revolt by Tories - Major breaks silence on crisis / Chancellor expected to reiterate fears over German policy - Boost for home buyers urged THE GOVERNMENT moved to reassert its European credentials yesterday in the face of increasingly open dissent within the Conservative party. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said that the week's turbulence should not be perceived as the end of Britain's move towards Europe. His remarks came as Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, moved to place himself in the forefront of the Tory Euro-sceptics. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, followed by an interview on BBC Radio 4, Mr Baker made clear his opposition to the pound's early return to the exchange rate mechanism, making more likely a strong Tory backbench revolt in next week's emergency Commons debate on the economy. Mr Stephen Dorrell, a Treasury minister, last night emphasised that ERM membership was still seen as crucial to the government's long-term economic strategy. The policy of delivering low inflation and sound money remained 'precisely the same tonight as it was last Friday'. This desire for a stable long-term environment was why Britain joined the ERM and why the government had 'made clear its desire to resume active participation in the ERM as soon as conditions allow'. Mr Heseltine, during a visit to the north-east of England, said companies must not be deflected from urgently needed preparations for the single European market. 'We have to persuade the people who work in our companies to take the readjustment to the single European market seriously and urgently,' he said. Any misreading of Britain's approach to Europe might also affect inward investment, which the UK had success-fully attracted in the 1980s. 'They didn't come here because it was Britain, they came here because it was Britain in Europe,' Mr Heseltine said. 'If there were to be any doubt about that, then many of these companies who have positioned themselves in Europe by basing themselves in Britain would have to reconsider that strategic judgment.' Last night, in a speech to the Northern CBI, Mr Heseltine said: 'The underlying dynamic of our relationship with Europe is not the Maastricht treaty but the single European act. Nothing must deflect our attention from the significance of the changes in that market place.' Mr Baker said that conditions for sterling to re-enter the ERM would take 'a very long time to get right'. The UK 'should not be too keen to re-enter the ERM, even if it survives'. He added: 'The Maastricht concept of a single currency for the whole of the Community will not come about this century.' Mr Baker also urged Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to make further rapid cuts in interest rates  - down to 6 per cent. Conjuring up a vision of Britain  - untrammelled by the ERM  - buoyed by the fastest growth rate of any western economy, he said: 'Interest rates in Britain are now not determined by bankers in Frankfurt. The chancellor is a free man.' The government's position of a return to the ERM 'as soon as conditions allow' was criticised more forthrightly by other Euro-sceptics. Sir Teddy Taylor, secretary of the Conservative European Reform Group, described it as 'arrogant and bumptious'. Sir Rhodes Boyson, former Conservative Tory minister and another prominent Euro-sceptic, said that Britain needed to rejoin the ERM like it needed 'a hole in the head'. Support for the government, though, came from Mr Hugh Dykes, Tory MP for Harrow East and chairman of the European Movement, who said membership of the ERM was 'essential for this country's future prosperity'. The row over the ERM grew as the agenda for next month's Tory party conference was published. The motions on the agenda were submitted before July 13 but include a number of pleas for Britain to leave the ERM and several calls for a referendum on Maastricht. It also emerged that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, will attend the Brighton conference, posing a delicate stage-management question for party organisers.</p>

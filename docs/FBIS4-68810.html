			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Babkin, chairman of Tyumen Oblast </F> Trade-Union Council, by N. Filimonov from the Tyumen affiliate  of RASI; date not given: "Will the Law on Northerners Work?"]    [Text] The commonly used name for the Law On  Northerners is obviously an abbreviated title. The full title of  the law is "On State Guarantees and Compensatory Benefits for  Individuals Working and Living in Regions of the Far North and  Locations of Equivalent Status."    This law, which was passed at the insistence of trade  unions a year ago, just last April, and which went into force on  1 June 1993, is still not working. The government immediately  suspended almost 20 of its main sections because of insufficient  funds.    The funds are still lacking....    The Northerners are understandably upset. So are the  trade unions.    Another regional trade-union conference on the social  and economic problems of the North, the fourth of these  conferences, was held in Moscow at the end of March. The topic  of discussion is always the same--the non-existent guarantees  and compensatory benefits.    Here is what one conference speaker, Chairman Vladimir  Babkin of the oblast trade-union council, had to say.    [Filimonov] I know that the law began to be discussed more  than three years ago, at the first conference in Murmansk. Later  the whole draft law was "composed" in Surgut, at the third  conference, in the presence of high-level government officials.  Now there has been another conference, but this one was held in  Moscow instead of in the North.... Why?    [Babkin] At first they wanted to hold the conference in  Norilsk, but then they learned that hearings on the northern  regions were scheduled for the end of March in the State Duma  and make a quick decision to meet in the capital at the time of  the hearings. This was done for the purpose of interaction with  Duma deputies, but there was also the hope that representatives  of the executive branch could also be urged to attend the  conference.    [Filimonov] Did they?    [Babkin] They did not indulge us. Only Deputy Minister V.  Kuramin attended. State Duma deputies and members of the  Federation Council were present, however, and supported the  conference resolutions, which they subsequently used in their  work in their own committees and in the Duma hearings.    [Filimonov] I would imagine that the deputies who did attend  are Northerners themselves.    [Babkin] Most of them are. One of them, for example, was  Vladimir Gomon, the former mayor of Nadym who is now the deputy  chairman of a committee. He has first-hand knowledge of the  problems of Northerners and is now solving them in a new  capacity.    [Filimonov] How was the situation in the North described at  the conference?    [Babkin] It was called extremely critical, both in the  economic and in the social sense. Oil production decreased by  one-sixth and capital investments decreased by one-third in just  the past year. Production cuts have extended to virtually all of  the main fields of production. One out of every three  enterprises is operating at a loss. In addition to all of this,  there is the problem of non-payments and, consequently, the  absence of money for the payment of wages. The personal savings  of Northerners have depreciated, and the Northern privileges and  compensatory payments are meaningless, because the cost of  living in the North is rising each day....    [Filimonov] Especially when this compensation exists only in  the form of a written promise....    [Babkin] Yes, especially in view of the fact that it is  unavailable. The North is becoming more and more isolated. It is  difficult, and just too expensive, for Northerners to travel  anywhere else for medical treatment and vacations. The quality  of health care and consumer services has declined perceptibly.  The diet of Northerners has deteriorated. People are tormented  by feelings of insecurity. According to surveys conducted by the  Federation of Independent Russian Trade Unions, almost 30  percent of the inhabitants of Northern cities would like to  leave them as soon as possible. If it were only that simple....    In short, signs of crisis are present in all spheres of the  national economy in the northern regions, they spread more  quickly here, and they frequently take the most extreme forms.    [Filimonov] In other words, people have no legal protection.  That is why you are fighting for this law....    [Babkin] For this law and others, and for many  administrative  ordinances. The law on guarantees for Northerners requires  funding for its enforcement. Last year's allocations amounted to  only 158 billion of the 560 billion rubles needed for its  implementation. This year the Ministry of Finance calculated  that the law would cost the budget 34 trillion rubles. Then it  added up the figures again and came up with 80 trillion. The  upshot was that since the budget could not afford either amount,  the Northerners could not expect any help.... The Ministry of  Justice, instead of overseeing unconditional compliance with the  law, has taken the liberty of amending the nine main sections.    [Filimonov] The law does call for colossal expenditures. I  do  not think the government will agree to 100-percent financing--at  least, not this government, which has to deal with the present  budget deficit....    [Babkin] We propose the sequential enactment of the law. The  mechanism for implementing the law has to be set in motion.  Under no circumstances should the main provisions be watered  down. If we yield on any one point, we might lose everything. I  discussed this, as well as the problem of non-payments in the  oil and gas complex and the need to review the tax laws, in my  speech at the conference. I am quite familiar with the problems  of the North, because I worked there for 15 years.    [Filimonov] What would you do about the Ukrainians, the  Moldavians and, in general, all of those who worked here and are  now foreigners?    [Babkin] We want the governments of the CIS states to  conclude agreements on mutual commitments to extend social  benefits and guarantees to the foreigners in the North today and  those who worked there in the past. The State Duma deputies  agreed with us. While our conference was still in session, they  arranged for a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey  Kozyrev, who promised to take the initiative in this sphere.    [Filimonov] I read the conference resolutions carefully. It  is impossible to summarize all of the demands it addressed to  the government in just a few words. Most of them seemed to  pertain to sections of the Law on Northerners. Is that right?    [Babkin] Yes, it is. We are demanding funds from the federal  budget for the implementation of the law and measures to solve  the problem of mutual non-payments. We insist on higher  compensatory payments for the rental of housing in the North and  on cost-of-living adjustments in the personal savings of  citizens. We also have other demands.    [Filimonov] How will you get the government to react?    [Babkin] Through the Federal Assembly, the press, and the  Northerners' own labor collectives. The latter certainly will  not have to be talked into it, because you can see how agitated  they are.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Heywood shares leap after bullish forecast Shares in Heywood Williams, the building materials group, rose sharply yesterday after it forecast a sixfold rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34m for the year to December 31, against Pounds 5.5m. The bullish forecast was announced along with plans to buy Bristol Products, a US plumbing components manufacturer and distributor, for Dollars 81.2m (Pounds 54.9m), including the repayment of borrowings. The acquisition, complementing the group's purchase of US building group LaSalle-Deitch earlier this year, will be funded by a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 50.6m. Strong growth in existing businesses was forecast to push earnings per share ahead to 14.8p (1.7p). The shares rose 43p to 387p following the announcement, before closing at 384p. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, Heywood's chairman, said Bristol would help the group develop its niche business in the US, where LaSalle distributes building products to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries. Bristol was a rival bidder for LaSalle, and the Indiana-based company approached Heywood after it failed. Bristol's management, which is forecasting profits of Dollars 12.5m in the year to November 30, will be kept in place. COMMENT Heywood Williams has seen a marked improvement in its share price since it sold most of its glass business to Pilkington earlier this year. Since then it has turned its back on the construction industry and concentrated on auto glass sales in the UK and the growing manufactured housing and recreation vehicle market in the US. Future acquisitions are now likely in the UK, where it wants to keep at least 40 per cent of its business. If the rights issue is fully taken up, it will certainly be in a position to do so with cash balances of up to Pounds 10m and shareholders' funds of Pounds 120m. Following yesterday's announcement, brokers upgraded pre-tax profits forecasts for 1994 by Pounds 11m to Pounds 39m, putting the shares on a multiple ratio of 16. The positive sentiment and upgrading appears to make Heywood a good long-term buy.</p>

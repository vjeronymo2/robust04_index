The document, which the former German economics  minister drafted jointly with four other FDP political leaders,  contains the FDP's independent position on government  modernization, the economy, and society as a whole. In support  of the new ideas, Moellemann proposes to conduct a "propaganda  campaign unhampered by coalition concerns and commitments to  political alliances." The campaign is to be buttressed by  "independent candidates for high government offices." He and his  co-workers are calling for a "lean government" based on  large-scale privatization of government programs, "vigorous  reform" of fiscal policies, and cuts in taxes and social  insurance deductions. The social insurance system is to be based  on individual responsibility.    Speaking in Duesseldorf, Moellemann maintained that the Bonn  government coalition has reached a low point in popularity. The  polls, conducted during the past six months, indicate that the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU)  would obtain "somewhat less than 30 percent" of the vote if the  Bundestag election were held at this time--with the FDP  obtaining about 6 percent. This situation calls for decisive  action, he said. Legislation to shore up the national and  laender budgets must be passed this spring. If nothing is done,  this, too, would "send a message," Moellemann said, stressing  the position of his party's leadership that a decision on  coalition plans should not be made until after the summer  recess. He said he believes that a decision on this matter might  be reached, but this would have to wait on developments during  the next few months.    At the moment, Moellemann said, the political party  landscape  is undergoing a sea change which is why it makes sense for the  FDP to concentrate on what it has to offer to the voters on its  own. Moellemann reiterated his intention to vote for Social  Democratic Party (SPD) presidential candidate Johannes Rau, if  it comes to a third ballot in the federal assembly. He disputed  the contention of chairman Solms of the FDP Bundestag caucus  that he and chairman Rohde of the FDP caucus in the Duesseldorf  land assembly are the only ones to have decided to do so.  Moellemann's "proposal for a new liberal strategy" was  co-authored by Rhode, North Rhine-Westphalian politician  Tschoeltsch, and Bundestag deputies Friedhoff and Schuessler.  The 39-page document was distributed to all FDP land  organizations today. According to Moellemann, it is to  invigorate the party's strategy debate as it prepares for its  convention in Rostock next June.    The priority goal, according to the proposal, is the  creation  of an "efficiency government" whose programs are to be  restricted to what is necessary. This calls for the large-scale  privatization of numerous public institutions such as hospitals,  old-age and nursing homes, theaters, museums, and libraries.  "Management" is to take the place of "administration" as part of  "downsizing the bureaucracy." Moellemann and his  comrades-in-arms are calling for a reform of civil service  regulations and for the assignment of civil servants solely to  governmental functions. The political leadership should set an  example by reducing the size of the Federal Government and the  legislatures. The reformers also call for the consolidation of  laender and for letting the individual laender create their own  budgets.    The FDP politicians would like to introduce a "replacement  principle" for future legislation, i.e. existing regulations  would be repealed every time a new law is passed. New markets,  e.g. information and health services, would require new types of  legislation. All laws applicable to such services which hamper  economic development should be repealed by the end of next year  unless reapproved by parliament. Among other things, subsidies  should be cut in order to "rescue the budget." As far as hard  coal is concerned, the Moellemann document suggests retention of  a "rudimentary mining capability" which could be expanded on an  ad hoc basis to meet an energy crisis.    The paper further proposes a simplification of tax laws  through the creation of just five types of taxes, i.e. income,  corporate, value-added, inheritance, and resource taxes. All  other taxes, church taxes among them, are to be repealed. On  social insurance the document favors "retention of basic  benefits" but calls on individuals to make provisions for their  old age on their own. The employment exchanges are to be  transformed into regional "employment exchange limiteds" which  offer unemployed workers as "workers for rent on the market,"  the idea being that "premiums for the labor exchanges and such  workers are good for competition."</p>

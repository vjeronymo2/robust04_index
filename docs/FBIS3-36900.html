			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to UN </F> Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; read by announcer]    [Text] To His Excellency UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    Esteemed Mr. Secretary General, I would like to greet you  and  convey to you my people's best wishes.    I had to write this letter because of a further  deterioration  of the situation in Abkhazia, which, as you know full well, was  already extremely tense. The Abkhaz separatists have repudiated  their obligations under the memorandum signed in Geneva on 1  December 1993 and the communique adopted on 13 January 1994, and  on 7 and 8 February of this year launched a new Fascist action.    An about 1,000-strong group with heavy equipment attacked  Georgian villages in Gali Rayon, burned down up to 800  residential houses, and staged the mass killing of civilians.  Several thousand Georgians were uprooted from their permanent  places of residence and joined the tens of thousands of  displaced people and refugees. Mountain villages in Gali Rayon  beyond the reach of the armed groups of separatists were shelled  with heavy artillery.    The hallmark of Abkhaz separatists can be easily recognized  in the latest disaster. Their common practice of ethnic  cleansing and terror against civilians is continuing. All this  shows that the Abkhaz side is not interested in the  establishment of peace.    Let me remind you, Mr. Secretary General, that the  large-scale punitive operation was carried out against the  population of the rayon where, under the Geneva communique of 13  January 1994, the first stage of the return of the displaced  persons and refugees should have started on 10 February. Events  of the last few days suggest that the stepping up of military  operations by the Abkhaz separatists is aimed at wrecking the UN  Security Council resolutions, the process of normalization in  relations between Russia and Georgia, and the establishment of  peace throughout the Caucasus region.    We have chosen a peaceful way of conflict settlement. An  alternative to this way is military escalation and the  resumption of hostilities, which will result in the spreading of  the conflict zone, enormous casualties, and a great disaster --  not only for Georgia.    The only solution is to speed up the sanctioning by the  United Nations of the deployment of peace-keeping forces in  Abkhazia and to introduce strict international supervision.    I appeal once again to the United Nations Organization, the  Security Council, all its members-states. I appeal to you to  take a decision without delay on the deployment of a  peacekeeping force and the immediate return of the refugees.    I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and  peace mission to a large extent depends the future of peace in  Georgia and, in particular, Abkhazia. Take all measures for a  peaceful settlement of the conflict and a timely return of the  refugees.    I hope that at this most difficult time for the Georgian  people, the United Nations and its Security Council in  particular will have a principled examination of this issue,  which causes us so much pain, and will take a decision to send  peacekeeping forces to the conflict area immediately.    In the event of the opposite, an escalation of the conflict  can be expected not only in Abkhazia but also in the whole of  Georgia, which may result in unforeseen tragic consequences  throughout the Caucasus.    I would like to express my gratitude for your constant  striving for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia  and assure you of my best [word indistinct].    Yours sincerely,    [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze, Tbilisi.    [dated] (?9) February 1994.</p>

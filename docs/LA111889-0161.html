			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TAKES OVER SECURITY S&amp;L IN GARDEN GROVE  </P> <P> Government regulators seized control of Security Federal Savings &amp; Loan on  Friday, declared the one-office thrift insolvent and placed it into the federal  conservatorship program.  </P> <P> It is the third Orange County-based S&amp;L to be seized this year. The action  does not disrupt normal business, and customers on Friday continued making  deposits and withdrawals.  </P> <P> But the action is a prelude to the sale or closing of the 32-year-old community  S&amp;L, which has $77 million in assets and $75.2 million in deposits in 6,035  accounts.  </P> <P> Pending that final disposition, Security -- now operating as Security Federal  Savings Assn. -- will be run by a representative of the new Resolution Trust  Corp., an agency created by the thrift bail-out bill to operate and dispose of  insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Security was among seven local thrifts identified by a number of industry  analysts as being unable to meet capital requirements that take effect Dec. 7.  </P> <P> The thrift lost $202,000 in the second quarter and since then has lost at least  $960,000 more, wiping out its entire capital base.  </P> <P> Security's problems stem from a series of bad loans made by previous management  in the early 1980s, just before the county's residential housing boom turned  into a two-year bust.  </P> <P> While it has not had serious operating problems since then, it was never able  to build up enough business to offset the drain on its resources from those  loans.  </P> <P> In June, the government stepped in to name a management team after a hoped-for  private sale of the S&amp;L fell through. At the time, regulators said Security  needed a minimum of $2.5 million in new capital to remain solvent.  </P></p>

Informed sources said yesterday Bishop Su Zhimin of Baoding,  Hebei Province, had returned home last Saturday [30 January].  The sources said Trappist Father Placidus Pei Ronggui of  Shijiazhuang and the clandestinely ordained Bishop Jia Zhiguo of  Hebei had also "gone back home safely".    Sources said Bishop Su, 62, was taken away by public  security  officers early last month after he had had a meeting with US  Congressmen Christopher Smith. It is not clear why Chinese  authorities detained Bishop Jia and Father Pei at about the same  time, but sources believed their detention was related to  contact with foreigners.    The trio are well-known figures in the underground Catholic  Church and their "disappearance" was an embarrassment to Beijing  because it coincided with the visit by US Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bensten to Beijing last month.    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities confirmed yesterday to  foreign  diplomats they were keeping Catholic priest Zhang Li in a labour  re-education centre in Hebei Province. Released in March last  year, Father Zhang was rearrested in June. Catholic sources  said he was serving a three-year sentence in a  reform-through-education centre in Zhangjiakou in Hebei. The  confirmation by Beijing is considered unusual because Father  Zhang is apparently not on any foreign government's lists of  political prisoners.</p>

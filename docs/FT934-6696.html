			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Ciampi calls meetings to save budget Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, has called the main political parties to a series of meetings today to hammer out a consensus on the 1994 budget. The move was prompted by hints from disgruntled Christian Democrats and Socialists that they would withdraw support in parliament in the wake of their parties' disastrous performance in Sunday's municipal elections. Fears about the fate of the budget, now the central raison d'etre of Mr Ciampi's government, provoked further falls yesterday on the stock change and in the value of the lira. At one stage the lira passed the key psychological L1000 against the D-Mark. However, the Italian currency recovered slightly in the wake of Mr Ciampi's decision to hold the special budget meetings. It was also significant that Mr Achille Occhetto, the leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the principal victor of Sunday's poll, came out in public support of Mr Ciampi. He added: 'The turbulence in the financial markets cannot be justified in any way by the political and electoral events in Italy.' This statement too played a part in calming market nerves. As a result of the elections in 428 towns and cities, the PDS has emerged as the one party capable of forging alliances up and down the country. This has given it a central role as the Ciampi government winds ups business and prepares for early general elections. The four-party coalition forming the government's parliamentary majority accounts - after Sunday's vote - for little more than 15 per cent of popular support. Mr Occhetto has acted quickly to take advantage of his new position to cast himself as the leader of a future government coalition, and is seeking to dispel long-held prejudices against the left in government. The discredited Christian Democrats could break apart after last Sunday's electoral performance in which support dropped as low as 10 per cent. This situation undermined parliamentary discipline, and many members are in no mood to sanction budget legislation that undercuts their privileges and those of their friends in the public administration.</p>

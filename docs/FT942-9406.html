			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue may act over bid rumour De La Rue, the banknote printer, may be forced to make a statement this week following heavy speculation at the weekend that it is in takeover talks with Portals, the high security paper manufacturer. Neither company would comment on the speculation yesterday, which followed an announcement from Portals on Friday that it had received a possible bid approach. However, Mr Les Cullen, De La Rue's finance director, said the company was 'very concerned about the speculation'. The board is expected this morning to consider making an announcement if De La Rue's shares suffer as a result of the market rumours. On Friday, De La Rue closed 7p down at 878p. Portals, which has a market value of about Pounds 500m, is expected to make a further announcement on the takeover talks within the next couple of weeks. The market has also identified Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group, as a potential bidder. However, De La Rue, with its Pounds 200m cash pile, appears to be the favourite. The company has made no secret of its intention to hit the acquisition trail. Portals, which supplies paper to De La Rue, claims 50 per cent of the available world market in banknotes and second place in the global tea bag market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The policy of opening  a new phase of national reunification through the unity of the  whole nation which was clarified by the great leader President  Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994 indicates the most  reasonable and realistic way to realize the reunification of the  country by the internal efforts of the nation in conformity with  the will and interests of the nation, said Yom Tae-chun,  presidium member of the Central Committee of the Democratic  Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF), in a  statement January 6.    He pointed out that the DPRK made every possible effort to  achieve a great unity of the whole nation last year, but the  South Korean authorities, ignoring it, took the road of  dependence on foreign forces, the road of North-South  confrontation.    He said the Kim Yong-sam group's criminal acts clearly prove  that it is a pack of despicable traitors who are clean  indifferent to the destiny of the nation, only seeking to  maintain their power, and that it is impossible to achieve  national reconciliation and unity, peace and peaceful  reunification of the country while Kim Yong-sam's "regime" is  left intact.    He stressed that all the people who love the country and the  nation should unite as the same nation in hearty response to the  "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for  the Reunification of the Country", the great charter of national  unity, transcending all differences, whether they be in the  North, or in the South, or abroad and whether they be  communists, or nationalists, haves, or have-nots, and pave the  path to national reunification together.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: EL DORADO NATURE CENTER A MID-METROPOLIS OASIS  </P> <P> Southern Californians have long lamented the destruction of the natural world  caused by freeway construction, but in one community, freeway building resulted  in the formation of a unique nature center.  </P> <P> In the mid-1960s, during construction of the San Gabriel River/San Diego  freeway interchange, earthmovers were moving millions of cubic yards of earth.  Thanks to concerned citizens and conservationists, some of that earth was moved  to form 800-acre El Dorado Regional Park and 80-acre El Dorado Nature Center.  The park is everything a big park should be, with wide lawns, ball fields and  picnic areas. The nature center is a surprise -- an oasis in the midst of the  metropolis.  </P> <P> Surely this land has undergone a strange evolution: from San Gabriel River  flood plain to bean fields to freeway interchange to nature preserve. Only in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Next to the city's beach, El Dorado Nature Center is Long Beach's biggest  natural attraction. Established in 1969, this man-made wildlife sanctuary  includes two lakes and a stream, tree-lined meadows and low rolling hills. It's  a serene habitat for flora and fauna as well as a tranquil retreat for humans.  </P> <P> Several ecological zones are represented in the nature preserve, which for the  most part emphasizes native California flora. Walkers can tour oak woodland,  grassy meadow and chaparral communities, which are representative of Southern  California plant communities, and can meander among redwoods and a white alder  grove -- vegetation typical of the northern part of the state.  </P> <P> El Dorado Nature Center's small museum, perched on an island, is a good place  to learn about Southern California's plant life and wildlife. This satellite  museum of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County features a  "hands-on" ecology exhibit and a gallery that displays the work of nature  artists and photographers.  </P> <P> Kids will particularly enjoy a visit to the nature center. The museum's  exhibits, interpretive walks and even the pint-sized drinking fountains were  designed with the smaller nature lover in mind.  </P> <P> Two miles of easy trail circle El Dorado. A one-mile nature trail is keyed to  an interpretive pamphlet available from the museum. Another mile of trail loops  around the preserve's two ponds.  </P> <P> Bird-watchers flock to the preserve because more than 150 resident and  migratory bird species have been sighted. A bird checklist is available at the  museum.  </P> <P> Directions to the trailhead: From Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway), exit on  Studebaker Road and travel north about 2 1/2 miles to Spring Street. Take a  right on Spring Street and proceed three-quarters of a mile to the entrance of  El Dorado Park Nature Center. You can park in the lot by the nature center  museum for $2 weekdays, $3 weekends, or park for free along Spring Street.  </P> <P> Trails are open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. daily. The museum is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m.  Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. For more information about  El Dorado Nature Center and its many interpretive programs, call (213)  421-9431, Ext. 3415.  </P> <P> The hike: Pick up a nature trail interpretive pamphlet from the museum, then  head out across the bridge into the reserve. Enjoy the native plant  communities, including a cattail-lined creek and a chaparral-cloaked hillside.  And keep an eye out for two non-natives that have been part of the Southland  scene for more than a century and seem like natives -- the large, plume-like  pampas grass from South America and the ubiquitous eucalyptus. Be sure to get  the "big picture" from the observation tower, the preserve's highest point.  </P> <P> When you reach a trail junction, you can proceed straight ahead on the "One  Mile" nature trail or bear right for a 2-mile hike. The second mile of trail  meanders past the park's ponds before returning to the nature center building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> El Dorado Nature Center  </P> <P>  2-mile loop through  </P> <P>  El Dorado Nature Center  </P> <P> </P></p>

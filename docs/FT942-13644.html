			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Food for thought - The week ahead When Associated British Foods announces its interim results on Monday, they are expected to show a small advance from Pounds 161m to about Pounds 167m, before exceptional items. Investors will be looking for some indications on plans for ABF's Pounds 500m cash pile, and clarification on the disposal rumours surrounding Bakers Oven. Friday's agricultural feeds acquisition may have been taken as a sign that the company plans to be more active on the acquisition front. Meanwhile, the grocery and bread businesses are not expected to show any great improvements. Farnell Electronics, the electronic components group which paid Dollars 69.8m to acquire Multicomponents from ITT in October, reports results for the year to January 31 on Monday. They will be the first finals since Howard Poulson took over as chief executive and pre-tax profits of between Pounds 47m and Pounds 48.5m are expected, up from Pounds 41.6m the previous year when the figure was boosted by a Pounds 6.36m exceptional profit. Tarmac, the UK's biggest construction and building materials group, reports its results for 1993 on Tuesday with the markets expecting underlying trading profits of between Pounds 50m to Pounds 53m, against about Pounds 21m the previous year. As with most construction companies to report recently, FRS 3 provisions complicate the numbers. After goodwill write-backs on disposals, the group is expected to report pre-tax losses of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m, compared with 1992's record losses of Pounds 350.3m. When Sears, the UK's largest multiple speciality retailer, reports its annual results on Tuesday, pre-tax profits are expected to have risen to about Pounds 127m, up from last time's Pounds 83.5m which was struck after net exceptional costs of Pounds 16.9m. The rise will be even more dramatic on an FRS 3 basis, under which the group made pre-tax losses last time of Pounds 47.8m after exceptional charges of Pounds 106.8m. First-quarter figures on Thursday from ICI, a pure chemicals company since the demerger from Zeneca last summer, will reflect both the company's cost-cutting efforts and the health of the European bulk chemicals market. Underlying trading is still tough in European chemicals with manufacturers struggling to push through price increases. But this will be more than made up for by the cost-cutting and the disposal of the loss-making fibres operation in return for DuPont's acrylics business. As a result, pre-tax profits of the chemicals businesses should rise from last year's Pounds 63m to approaching Pounds 100m.</p>

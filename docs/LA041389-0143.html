			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SANTA FE SPRINGS;  </P> <P> COURT UPHOLDS BIAS RULING FOR WOMEN IN OIL FIELDS  </P> <P> A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that four Long Beach women were  discriminated against when they tried to secure jobs at a Santa Fe Springs  company in the male-dominated oil field service industry.  </P> <P> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeal held that Plant &amp; Field Service Corp.  discriminated against Marjorie Van, Modena M. Owens, Vinell Davis and Dorothy  Johnson when they sought temporary oil field jobs.  </P> <P> The ruling upholds a District Court judge who ordered the company to consider  more women for its temporary, manual labor jobs and to stop advertising  entirely by word of mouth, which is believed to limit the number of female  applicants.  </P></p>

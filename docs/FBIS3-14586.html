Al-Hasan was alluding to the massacre of  innocent worshipers at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque during the  blessed month of Ramadan. He said in our view and in view of  the world, the massacre proved the racist settler trend  continues to hold sway in Israel, finding support, cover, and  facilities and revealing the bad conditions of the Palestinian  people under occupation.    Al-Hasan said Israeli crimes continued after the Hebron  massacre. The least occurred the day before yesterday, and was  committed by Israel after the issuance of Resolution 904, in  contempt of all rules of international legitimacy and human  values.    In a speech at the opening of the 101st session of the Arab  League council that began in Cairo today, al-Hasan said this  grotesque crime explains to us the importance of the unified  Arab stand in affirming the condemnation of Israel and exposing  its intentions, and the need to coordinate among the brothers to  confront challenges and dangers.    Al-Hasan said: In Jordan, we moved on Arab and international  levels. We contacted permanent and other members of the UN  Security Council. The condemnation of the crime was made plain.  We demanded protection for the unarmed Palestinian people. We  asked the international community to shoulder its  responsibilities and affirmed the need to remove Israeli  settlements from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

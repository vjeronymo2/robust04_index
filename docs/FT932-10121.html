			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Auditors told to be tougher on accounts AUDITORS' reports in the annual accounts of companies will be fundamentally changed under guidelines announced yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board. Auditors will be required to take a firmer line in assessing whether the accounts presented by the directors are a 'true and fair view' of a company's financial position. The audit statement will also be substantially expanded to include details of the nature of the work carried out by the auditors and the responsibilities of both them and the directors of the company. Mr Nigel Macdonald, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and chairman of the board's working party, said: 'This requires a fundamental change recognising for the first time that not all readers of accounts have a proper understanding of the respective responsibilities of auditors and directors.' Auditors will no longer have the option of expressing opinions that say the accounts are true and fair 'subject to' the effects of financial uncertainties such as outstanding litigation or contracts subject to dispute. Instead, they will be forced to qualify the accounts - rejecting the view that they agree with the figures - unless they are satisfied with the estimates and disclosures given by directors of these uncertainties. In either case, they will be expected to provide details of any 'fundamental uncertainty' with a description and details of potential risks and costs. Mr Macdonald said: 'The standard has been honoured slightly differently in the past than it will be in the future. We're trying to abolish auditors sitting on the fence.' Auditors will still have the option of issuing reports which are qualified, unqualified, which disclaim opinion or present an adverse opinion. The new report is still likely to be written to a standard form of words, but will stress that the preparation of the accounts is the responsibility of directors and the auditors form an independent opinion based on their audit. It says the audit is conducted in accordance with auditing standards, based on a test examination of evidence relevant to the disclosures in the accounts and the judgments of the directors. This wording reflects a recommendation in the report of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which was published last December. The new requirements closely reflect a consultation draft issued by the board in May last year, and will become mandatory for companies with financial year-ends after September 30. The board is urging voluntary compliance before this date. Auditors' report on financial statements. Auditing Practices Board. Accountancy Books, PO Box 6SO, Central Milton Keynes, MK9 2JX.

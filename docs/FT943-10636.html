			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Russia concedes powers to Urals republic Russia yesterday signed a treaty 'defining the areas of competence' between Moscow and the south Urals autonomous republic of Bashkortostan  - the second treaty of its kind and one which President Boris Yeltsin said represented 'genuine federalism'. The treaty was signed as Russia continues to trade threatening rhetoric with its most unruly federal subject, the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya. Russian officials have supported the claims of the rebel Chechen interim council to oust General Dzhokar Dudayev, the republic's president. However, yesterday Mr Yusup Soslambekov, the former speaker of the Chechen parliament, said 'only a war' would oust the general. The Russian president also held talks yesterday with President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus aimed at concluding a political treaty between the two former Soviet states. Both men were vague on the all-important issue of monetary union and said they would 'honour previous agreements' in establishing a monetary system. Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, a deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank, told the Financial News Agency that 'some points were corrected' in a draft treaty unifying the two currencies, and that the Belarus National Bank would play a role in money supply and the issuing of credits. Commenting on Russia's negotiations both with former Soviet republics and its own internal regions, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko political party and a proponent of closer economic union between the former Soviet states, said that 'economic union is inevitable, both for the Russian economy and for their economies. Political union, military union, are quite different things and we should not seek them now'. The treaty with Bashkortostan, an oil-producing republic which has already adopted its own constitution, is in line with Moscow's attempt to hold together the sprawling Russian Federation by bilateral treaties which concede large areas of economic and legislative autonomy - including independent tax-raising powers - within a common constitutional and macro-economic framework in which defence and foreign affairs are handled largely by Moscow. Mr Yeltsin told the official news agency Itar Tass after the signing ceremony that 'we are now moving towards the fine-tuning stage in federal relations. We are agreeing who answers exactly for what'. Mr Murtaza Rakhimov, the Bashkortostan president, said 'the process of creating independent legislative bodies will continue. The only demand (of the treaty) is that the common legislative framework of the Russian Federation be preserved.' Tatarstan, an oil-producing republic which neighbours Bashkortostan, was the first to sign such a treaty - after claiming virtual independence from Russia two years ago. Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement yesterday to create a single border guarded by a joint command, Reuter reports from Kiev. Since Ukrainian independence in 1991 the 1,500 mile border has been guarded by separate sets of Ukrainian and Russian posts.</p>

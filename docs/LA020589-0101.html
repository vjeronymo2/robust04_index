			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LETTER' TO EX-PRESIDENT PRAISED FOR ITS HONESTY  </P> <P> Sam Hall Kaplan's column (Jan. 22) on ex-President Reagan was a breath of fresh  air, truth, honesty, etc. after the stifling accolade given to this, our worst  President in the history of our republic.  </P> <P> Thank God that the infamous Ron and Nancy dog and pony show has closed its run.  He can no longer veto sound legislation that fails to fit into his shallow,  inhumane ideology.  </P> <P> I hope that you will continue to write on the subject of Reagan's illusions.  The American people are being cruelly deceived by this amiable dunce.  </P> <P> JOHN UTVICH  </P> <P> San Marino  </P> <P> Letters to "Our Readers Write" must include the writer's name, address and  daytime telephone number and should be sent to the Real Estate Editor, Los  Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053. Letters may be edited  for reasons of space and clarity.  </P></p>

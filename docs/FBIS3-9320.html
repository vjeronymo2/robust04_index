Mr.  Qendro, who held the report on the trade union's activity during  the 1992-1994 period, emphasized the significant role played by  trade union in protecting rights and interests of the workers.    President of Albania Sali Berisha, who hailed the congress,  appreciated the trade union's great contribution in democracy's  victory and its consolidation in Albania. President Berisha  ranked three main directions in which the trade union's role has  been especially important and the anticommunist spirit in  destructing the dictatorship where its contribution has been  theoretically and practically great. Its very creation as an  opposition power revealed the hypocrisy of the former party in  power which claimed to be an workers party. The second  direction, President Berisha said, is the great trade union's  role in protecting the rights of the workers. The first  delegation I received when I was elected president, was a trade  union one, who told me that we will no more be allies and that  they would continue their fight to defend the workers's rights  being an opposition to the government.    The third direction, Mr. Berisha pointed out, was the  confrontation of corruption. "It was you and your newspaper  SINDIKALISTI," president addressed to participants, "who raised  the voice against the corruption of the communists. Now you  confront without compromise the any kind of corruption."    Trade union representatives from 30 international trade  unionist organizations centred in Brussels, representatives from  Italy, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Albanian representatives  from Kosova and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] took part in the first congress of the Albania's Trade  Union.    The congress will continue its settings on March 22 as well.</p>

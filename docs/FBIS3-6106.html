The news analyst goes on:    The "NSL" is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law  that denies reunification, blocks dialogue and opposes  improvement of North-South relations.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet group, however, is trying hard to  avoid repealing the "NSL", turning a deaf ear to the strong  demand of the people at home and abroad. This vividly reveals  its despicable intention to maintain the notorious "NSL" and  continue seeking North-South confrontation and further  strengthen the "civilian" fascist dictatorship.    The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors said they would  "reexamine" the question of repealing the "NSL" when  "North-South relations have been improved", while maintaining  such anti-reunification evil law as the "NSL" and putting the  brakes on dialogue and reunification in every way. This  virtually means that they do not intend to scrap the "NSL".    The ill-famed "NSL" in South Korea must be scrapped without  delay. Otherwise, the "civilian" regime will inevitably bump  into stronger protests of the people and meet its disgraceful  end.</p>

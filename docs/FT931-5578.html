			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shake-up for local Labour party LABOUR yesterday ordered a shake-up of its operations in the political heartland of party leader Mr John Smith. A Labour inquiry into the running of local parties in the Monklands area of Lanarkshire said the district council had left itself 'open to criticism' by the way staff were appointed. Mr Smith is MP for Monklands East and Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, represents Monklands West. The inquiry team has also rewritten the standing orders of the local parties in what appears to be a dismantling of an old-style political machine. However the inquiry report - ordered by Labour's Scottish executive in September - was muted in its criticism and insisted the changes were simply an updating of antiquated local procedures.</p>

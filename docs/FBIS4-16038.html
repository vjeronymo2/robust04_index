			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report in the "Balkans" column: "NATO Hits </F> the Serbs. Leaving Russia to Reconcile Them With the Muslims  and the Croats"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The strategic line of Russian  diplomacy from the very start of the Balkan crisis has been  based on the postulate, "there are no innocents, all are  guilty," boiling down to a very simple but at the same time most  effective "pressure on all sides" formula. It is hard to  believe that such an approach was shared by the West. Because  in that event things might not have reached the point of air  strikes. It would have been fairly easy: The United States and  the FRG, which have certain influence with the Croats and  Muslims, exert the same pressure on them as Russia on the Serbs,  and the issue is settled. In fact, however, something totally  different happens. Why should the Muslims sit down at the  negotiation table if they can simply wait until the Serbs are  showered with bombs, abandon their positions, liberating the  "vital space" for the enemy, after whose incorporation to the  territories that are already under its control the subject of  negotiations itself will disappear? Judging by the statement of  a Bosnian leader, Ganic, who suggested that after the strikes  against the Serb positions fire should be moved to their rear  areas, depots, and communications, the Muslims understand this  very well. Russia too could be shown its "real place."    The latter task, incidentally, is now being tackled by  anyone  willing. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana missed no  chance, in the course of the Russian Federation president's  visit to Madrid, to express his satisfaction with the actions by  NATO aviation, although it is difficult to believe that he is  unaware of Yeltsin's reaction to Kozyrev's statement in Madrid  on this issue.    The West is apparently little concerned also about the  internal political complications arising from its actions both  for the Bosnian Serbs and for Russia. In both countries the  hawks' feathers have stood on end. It is one thing to hold  debates with Radovan Karadzic and quite another with Ratko  Mladic; with professional Russian diplomats or, say,  "geopoliticians" from the Duma committee of the same name.    In addition to Christopher's statements that the United  States and the Russian Federation have the same goals in Bosnia,  now even protestations of the West's interest in the success of  Russia's reform appear dubious. According to PRES leader and  Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, subjected to NATO bombing were  "not so much Serb positions in the conflict zone as the internal  political situation in Russia." In his opinion, decisionmaking  in circumvention of it is "a slap in the face of the Russian  Federation" and, indirectly, "a strike against Russian reforms,  and a very telling one," which has benefited "the  national-patriots."

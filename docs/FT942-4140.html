			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Civilians bear the brunt of drive to capture Aden: Missiles and shells take their toll North Yemeni officials continue to insist they are not targeting civilians in their drive to capture Aden. But civilian casualities in the city and in Yemen's southern region have mounted steadily as northern bombs, missiles and artillery miss their targets and hit innocent neighbourhoods - killing men, women and children in the process. But these are only the most obvious victims in a city that is beginning to suffer from shortages of water, food and medicines. Dr Mohsen bin Hammam, chairman of the Jumhurriya hospital, recites a grim roll of statistics. 'On Sunday at Dar Saad 27 were killed and 45 wounded. On Monday in Khormaksar 12 were killed and 22 injured. On Tuesday  ..' Upstairs at the hospital are some of the wounded. An elderly man sits on the edge of his bed, his left arm now a stump covered with soft gauze. He stares uncomprehendingly. A 17-year-old boy rests on the bed opposite, his right arm missing and a seam of stitches running down from his rib cage to his groin. Nearby, a four-year-old girl lies with her head bandaged, her tiny arms and legs drawn up into a foetal position. Semi-conscious, she emits a continuous low moan. Nurses say the girl, named Fatma, was caught in the shelling of nearby Wahad. She may live. Jumhurriya hospital was built by the British, says Dr Ahmed Bilal, a specialist in chest surgery. He walks around to the entrance and proudly points to an inscribed stone: 'This stone was laid by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the 27th April 1954.' Yemen's civil war broke out 40 years later to the day on April 27 this year. The hospital was, in its time, the finest in the Middle East and drew patients from throughout the region. It has suffered with age and use and is full of wilting equipment. But the doctors and nurses pay little attention to the state of their hospital. They are too busy using it, caring for 80 per cent of Aden's civilian casualties. They are working against the odds. 'Casualties come all at once. The missiles, the bombs, or the shells hit and we are suddenly inundated with the dead and wounded,' Dr Hammam says. The hospital has only one ambulance and patients are brought in by any means available. Even so there are more casualties than doctors can immediately cope with. 'Every day we open six operating theatres and most of our work is successful. We have only one neuro-surgeon and two orthopedic surgeons. All the rest are general surgeons,' Dr Hammam says, 'but everyone is doing their best, 24 hours a day.' Five weeks ago the northern leader General Ali Abdullah Saleh told southerners he would not bomb their cities, assuring them it would therefore be unnecessary to flee their homes. But Aden is now full of refugees from cities, towns and villages that have been hit repeatedly by the artillery of the advancing northern army. Northern officials have often and publicly denied attacking the refinery, the power station and the water system in Aden. Such utilities, they say, belong to the people. And yet the refinery became a smoking ruin last Sunday, electrical power fluctuates, and - in 37 degree heat - there is no running water in the city. Mr Abdullah Saidi, director of the Bir Nasser pumping station, says that there are 45 wells which supply Aden with fresh water. Shelling by northern forces, he says, has cut cables and pipes which enable water to reach the city. He and his men have tried to repair the damage, but northern shells hamper their work. 'We can only work on seven wells because of the shelling and each time we fix something they destroy it,' he says. Mr Saidi says that these seven wells alone would supply about one-third of Aden's water needs. Even under normal circumstances Mr Saidi and his men would need a month to repair all the damage done to the water pumping station. But northern shells, he says, sometime come at the rate of one a minute. As shells explode around the edges of the city, as warplanes tear through it, and as troops stand poised for their final assault, Adenis carry on. They bathe in the sea, draw water from wells drilled into the streets, and, always, they queue up. At the hospital, another patient is rolled into the emergency room. For hours there has been no water in the taps. But outside a dented blue tanker truck has just arrived and workers are busy with clear plastic pipes, running the sparkling new supply into storage tanks. For a few more hours, at least, there will be enough to serve the hundreds of civilian casualties inside, targets or not.</p>

Addressing about 20,000 people at a rally to commemorate  International Women's Day at the Pietersburg Stadium on Sunday  [6 March], he said there would be no peace if some political  players remained outside the transitional process. "I am still  prepared to talk to those who refuse to register. I have said I  am prepared to go down on my knees to ensure peace in the  country," he said.    Mr Mandela said he would urge the ANC, its allies and the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to accept his proposal  that there should be no deadlines regarding registration for the  elections. "Even after Friday night, absolute patience and the  ability to understand the fears of others."    Earlier Mr Mandela said there were people who were prepared  to contribute to building a new South Africa, but whose efforts  had been rebuffed. "These are temporary setbacks to such men of  integrity and vision and they should not be discouraged. The  future does not belong to a minority that wants to cling to  outdated policies, but belongs to those who have vision and  courage."    Thousands of people from all over the Northern Transvaal  packed the stadium to hear the ANC leader's address. Mr Mandela  was applauded wildly when he arrived at the stadium on the back  of a bakkie [pickup] and briefly walked along the stands waving  and smiling at the crowd.    Later on Sunday he will travel to Magoebaskloof where he is  scheduled to meet Chief Samuel Nxumalo of Gazankulu's Ximoko  People's Progressive Party.</p>

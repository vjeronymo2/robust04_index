			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PADRES INCREASE TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> The San Diego Padres announced a ticket price increase after a losing season  marred by player infighting and a public relations fiasco caused by Roseanne  Barr's singing of the national anthem.  </P> <P> The cost of attending a Padres game was the third-lowest in major-league  baseball last season and "will continue to be among the lowest in 1991," club  President Dick Freeman said.  </P> <P> Under the 1991 ticket price structure, all field, plaza, press and the new View  Box level seats will be increased $1.50 to $11.00. Loge and regular view level  seats will be raised the same amount to $9.50, while general admission tickets  were increased $1 to $5.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Padres fired third-base Coach Sandy Alomar Sr. and picked up the  1991 contract option of left-hander Atlee Hammaker, who joined San Diego as a  free agent Aug. 21 after being released by the Giants one week earlier.  </P></p>

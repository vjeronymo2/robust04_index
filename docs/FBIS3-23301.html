Al-Mahdi: We do not consider it unlikely that the  forces of arrogance may embark on such folly. If they find the  conditions favorable, they will certainly intervene, since they  are already poised against Sudan. The propaganda by the Western  mass media, the United Nations, the UN Human Rights Commission,  as well as their economic embargo, are all indications of an  intervention by the forces of world arrogance. I stress: If  they find suitable conditions, they will certainly intervene.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Two weeks ago, a mosque was  attacked in Omdurman, Khartoum by armed assailants and some  worshipers were killed and wounded. What group was responsible  and what were its objectives?    Al-Mahdi: Those who were arrested were mostly  foreigners; this shows the nature of this act. What motive can  there be for attacking worshipers? The attack on the residence  of Shaykh 'Usamah bin-Ladin and against the Islamic al-Da'wah  party's headquarters is a clear indication of the identity of  the attackers. Such incidents usually have some political  motivation.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Why was the mosque attacked?    Al-Mahdi: The objective of the attackers was to  foment agitation, unrest, and instability. [passage omitted]    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Do you see any foreign hands  behind this attack?    Al-Mahdi: The remarks by Government officials  indicate that foreign hands were involved, but the complete  report on the investigation has not been released. The issue is  being followed up.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Sudan is currently facing the  hostile stance of the United States and the West. How do you  assess the attitude of the West and the United States toward  Sudan?    Al-Mahdi: The West and the United States cannot  bear to hear calls for liberation. They are seeking to plunder  and pillage the wealth of the people of the world. They wish to  strangle every cry for freedom; and this is the policy they  follow.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: What is Sudan's stance toward  the world's Islamic movements?    Al-Mahdi: Our message to the Muslim nations  is--and we hope that they get this message--we approve of all  acts in the service of Islam. The powers of world arrogance  have besieged the nations. Thus it is the duty of Islamic  movements that they all should join hands; and our relations  with these movements are strong.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: The Egyptian and Algerian  regimes have accused Sudan of giving refuge to the Arab Muslims  who fought in Afghanistan. They say that Sudan is giving them  military training. What are the objectives of these regimes in  making such accusations?    Al-Mahdi: Sudan has no problems with Egypt and  Algeria and our relations with their people are cordial.  However we believe in differentiating between the people and  the governments. The lackeys are the ones leveling such  baseless charges against Sudan.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Who are these lackeys?    Al-Mahdi: The Western lackeys who rule over these  governments and are at loggerheads with their own people. They  wish to label Sudan in order to cover up their own weakness.  They are pitted against their own people, not against  terrorism. They cannot face reality and therefore are using  Sudan as a pretext.    JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: How are relations between  Sudan and the Egyptian Government?    Al-Mahdi: The Egyptian Government has occupied  the area of Hala'ib and is seeking to avoid talks on this  subject. It continues to plot against us. The Egyptian mass  media have started a propaganda war against Sudan. However we  believe that the Egyptian people are closer to us and that Egypt  and Sudan have a common destiny and interests. We belong to the  same ummah and we will strive to maintain cordial ties with the  Egyptian people and to counteract the maneuvers of the enemy.</p>

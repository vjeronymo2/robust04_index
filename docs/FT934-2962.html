			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Argentina increases global bond offering to Dollars 1bn Strong demand from US investors, confident that the Republic of Argentina would achieve an investment-grade rating before too long, enabled the sovereign borrower to increase the size of its first offering of global bonds to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 750m. Demand was such that the 10-year bonds were priced to yield 280 basis points over US Treasuries, at the low end of the indicated range of 280 to 285 basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened to 276 basis points. Mr James Quigley, managing director in charge of global debt syndicate at Merrill Lynch, one of the three joint leads, said that Argentina had secured a yield spread which reflected a strong double-B rating rather than a single-B rating. 'The market expects further upgrades in Argentina's rating in 1994,' he said. The sovereign borrower is rated B1 by Moody's and double-B minus by Standard &amp; Poor's. A total of Dollars 1.25bn was allocated to investors, of which Dollars 200m was placed in Argentina, leaving some underwriters with short positions. Of the remainder, 60 per cent was placed in North America and 40 per cent in Europe and Asia. Mr Quigley said at least half of the bonds which were sold in the US were bought by traditional, investment-grade portfolio managers, as opposed to junk-bond or emerging-market investors. Mr Daniel Marx, Argentina's finance under-secretary, said the proceeds of the issue would be used to re-finance maturing debt. The larger-than-expected issue would enable Argentina to build up its currency reserves and be less active than planned in the debt market early next year. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels, which owns the Peninsular Hotel in Hong Kong, tapped the Eurodollar sector with a Dollars 150m seven-year offering of convertible bonds. Lead manager BZW said the indicated conversion premium of 16 per cent to 19 per cent, which was more generous than other recent convertible offerings from Hong Kong issuers, reflected the issuer's desire for good placement. Elsewhere, the sterling bond market was swamped with new issues as issuers took advantage of the strength in the UK government bond market to raise money before the end of the year. Scottish Amicable became the first UK mutual life insurance company to raise debt capital in the international bond market with its Pounds 100m issue of undated subordinated bonds. More mutual life insurance companies could well follow suit, now that the Department of Trade and Industry has indicated that insurance companies may raise external capital prior to the implementation in the UK of the European Community's third life directive. Mr Roy Nicolson, Scottish Amicable's managing director, said the proceeds of the offering would fund potential ventures in the UK and Europe. The bonds, via Kleinwort Benson, were priced to yield 190 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017.</p>

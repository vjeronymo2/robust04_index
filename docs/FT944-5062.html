			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / US broadband licence bids start today: Government hopes for world's largest auction of public assets in forthcoming wireless personal telecoms sell-off Bidding opened in Washington yesterday for what the US government hopes will be the world's largest auction of public sector assets. The Federal Communications Commission's auction of broadband wireless telecommunications licences could last for weeks, and some industry analysts have said bidding could go as high as Dollars 15bn. The FCC will sell off 99 licences for a 30 megahertz wide frequency for wireless personal telecommunications services in 51 separate geographical areas, from huge markets such as New York and Los Angeles to the tiny territory of American Samoa. The third big auction of telecommunications frequencies the FCC has conducted, it is expected to be by far the biggest. Earlier auctions of national and regional narrowband licences for advanced paging services raised bids of over Dollars 1bn. But Mr Reed Hundt, FCC chairman, says the broadband auction will launch an entire new industry that will provide the telecommunications services of the 21st century. The FCC received initial applications from 74 companies, consortia and individuals to take part in the broadband auction, but only 23 stayed in the running when the time came to make refundable advance payments. The size of each bidder's downpayment is calculated at 60 cents per person reached by the frequency and will determine the maximum size of market each can bid on. The biggest applicant, a consortium grouping the long-distance phone company Sprint with Telecommunications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Enterprises, has put down Dollars 118m, which will allow it to bid on licences covering a total of nearly 200m people. Other major bidders include long-distance phone giant AT&amp;T, the Pacific Telesis local phone company and a consortium of three other Bell local phone companies. Mr Craig McCaw, who sold his cellular phone company to AT&amp;T, will also be bidding for markets in which he knows he will not be competing against AT&amp;T. Applicants can bid in secret by computer, with one round of bidding a day. New bids must raise the price by at least 5 per cent, and each company or consortium must submit at least one bid in each round stay in the ring. But companies can change their strategy in mid-auction to target a different region if they see their first choice as too expensive.</p>

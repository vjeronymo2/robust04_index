			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWERS VIEWS  </P> <P> Your March 5 cover story ("Walter Matthau: TV Actor?") stated the actor's  reason for doing the TV film ("The Incident") as "the well-written script."  </P> <P> This was not only mentioned in the piece, but accentuated in the accompanying  bold-faced quote.  </P> <P> Strange thing is, the writer's name did not appear anywhere in the piece. So  what is it, a state secret? A revelation punishable by death? Did the writer  request anonymity? If not, I'm sure you will print his or her name in your next  issue. Right?  </P> <P> George Beckerman, Beverly Hills  </P> <P>  Right. The writers were Michael Norell and James Norell.  </P></p>

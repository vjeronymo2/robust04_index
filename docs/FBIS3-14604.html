			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Test] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign  affairs, said that the meetings of the Arab League Council,  which ended in Cairo yesterday, tackled the issues of Arab  solidarity and reconciliation within the issue of pan-Arab  security. This came in statements to our political affairs  correspondent Shakir Maharimah upon the minister's return from  Cairo this evening.    [Begin recording] [Al-Hasan] Foremost of the many issues  discussed by the Political Committee were the Arab-Israeli  conflict, the issue of Jerusalem, and the intifadah. Jordan  made a lengthy comment on this issue. We reviewed the peace  process and the Jordanian stand that condemned the massacre  perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque as well as our stand on  UN Security Council Resolution 904. We also reviewed His  Majesty King Husayn's efforts toward this issue and the  Jordanian measures aimed at expressing condemnation of the  horrific massacre and at showing concern and pressuring the  international community to take measures to protect the  Palestinian people.    [Maharimah] Your excellency, What about your bilateral  contacts during the current session of the Arab League Council?    [Al-Hasan] During my visit to Cairo, I held a series of  bilateral contacts. I met with a number of brother Arab foreign  ministers. I met with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria,  Oman, and Yemen. I also met with the foreign minister of the  Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros, the new 22d member in the  Arab League Council. I also had the honor of meeting with  Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. We discussed bilateral  issues of interest to both countries as well as a number of  Arab, regional, and international issues. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Sea Group, which is comprised of various  government departments and commissions, held its second meeting  on 21 March. It was presided over by the convener, Interior  Minister Wu Po-hsiung. At the meeting, participants  provisionally decided to build a communications equipment  station and weather station on Taiping Island [Spratly Island].  However, in discussing the most critical issue of building an  airfield on the island, the participants chose to await further  assessment before making a decision, arguing the airfield will  be restricted by several factors: The runway will be only 1.5  km long; the construction cost is high; the type of aircraft  able to land and take off is limited; and the airfield will only  serve "non military aircraft."</p>

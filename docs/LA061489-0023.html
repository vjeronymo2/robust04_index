			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY SAYS DRIVER TRIED TO AVOID CRASH  </P> <P> The driver of a car that sped through a red light and collided with another  vehicle, killing three people, was trying to avoid causing an accident at the  time of the collision, his attorney argued Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jim Epstein said in his closing statements to a Van Nuys Superior Court jury  that Gregory Masterson Michael ran the light after changing lanes to avoid  hitting a car stopped at the intersection where the accident occurred.  </P> <P> Michael, 22, is on trial on three counts of felony vehicular manslaughter with  gross negligence in connection with the Oct. 22 accident.  </P> <P> Benjamin Rochel, 84, of Beverly Hills; his wife, Ashraf, 71, and their  grandson, Jonathan Rochel, died in the accident at Victory Boulevard and White  Oak Avenue in Reseda.  </P> <P> Epstein admitted that his client caused the accident, but said Michael could  only be found guilty of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter because the  prosecution had failed to prove gross negligence as required for felony  charges.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip Rabichow disputed Epstein's argument, saying that  Michael had been driving in excess of 60 m.p.h. for several blocks before the  accident.  </P> <P> If convicted of a misdemeanor, Michael could receive three years in County  Jail, authorities said. If found guilty of a felony, he faces a maximum  sentence of 18 years in prison.  </P></p>

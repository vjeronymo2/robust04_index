			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Reader's Digest stages rebound WALL Street took heart yesterday from an announcement by Reader's Digest that its struggling US books and home entertainment business had showed signs of rebounding. The stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at Dollars 42 3/8 , even though the news came against the backdrop of a 7 per cent decline in net income, lower revenues and a sharp downturn in operating profits during the three months to September 30. The company said 'early reports' indicated that changes in the marketing strategy for its US book operation were succeeding in returning its growth rate back to 'historic levels' of about 10 per cent. It added that it would eliminate a further 200 jobs to bring domestic 'staffing levels in line with business activities'. In June, 250 redundancies were announced. After the cuts are fully implemented, the company will employ about 2,050 in the US and 7,200 worldwide. With the share price near its 52-week low, investors appeared willing to bet the worst may be over. The stock had fallen sharply since February, when Reader's Digest first said the business was not performing to expectations. The company, a leading publisher of magazines and books, blamed unfavourable changes in currency exchange rates for the 7 per cent decline in revenues to Dollars 637.2m, and a 23 per cent fall in operating profits, to Dollars 68.2m. If currency changes were excluded, revenues would have showed a 6 per cent rise. In the event, net income fell to Dollars 62.8m, compared with Dollars 67.6m last time. Earnings per share worked through at 54 cents, exceeding analysts' forecasts of about 50 cents. In addition to the strength of the US dollar, profits suffered from increased promotional spending in international markets.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS pressured ahead of shareholders meeting The Continent was steady yesterday. ZURICH looked to the firm dollar to provide some support for industrials, but UBS and Ciba shares found themselves under pressure. The SMI index picked up just 0.5 to 2,607.0. UBS bearers fell SFr15 to SFr1,185 and the registered were SFr1 lower at SFr279 as the market braced itself for today's crunch extraordinary shareholders meeting on the bank's plan for a unified share structure. The premium on the registered stock has slipped to 17.7 per cent, from the 34.4 per cent seen on September 29, when battle lines were drawn with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision. Ciba registered weakened SFr13 to SFr757 following the news that it was lifting to 49.9 per cent its stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology company, amid uncertainty about the longer term benefits of the deal for Ciba. Renewed profit-taking left Swiss Re SFr9 lower at SFr788, but Roche certificates picked up SFr35 to SFr5,900. PARIS confirmed the pattern of dull trading, with the CAC 40 index struggling to make a rise on the day of 1.33 to 1,927.83. Turnover was around FFr3bn. Renault remained at the forefront of activity following its debut on the bourse last week, with more than 2m shares changing hands, but the stock closed unchanged at FFr181. Peugeot remained under pressure, losing FFr16 at FFr785. LVMH was one of the strongest of the day's offerings, up FFr11 to FFr847, following the announcement at the end of last week that it was reduc-ing its stake in Guinness, of the UK. Generale des Eaux receded FFr4.40 to FFr496.60 after slightly disappointing nine-month figures. FRANKFURT failed to make much headway as the market awaited domestic M3 data sometime this week and a meeting of the Bundesbank on Thursday. In addition, the closure of both the Japanese and US markets, on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, is viewed as a disincentive. The Dax index rose 5.05 in official hours to 2,105.28, but then crawled backwards in the post-bourse to 2,097.20. The chemicals sector attracted interest ahead of interim results due to be announced later in the week. BASF, wisth figures due on Thursday, put on DM1.20 at DM313.80, Hoechst struggled to a 10-pfennig gain at DM324.10, and Bayer went in the opposite direction, losing DM1.60 at DM342.00. VW was among the strongest stocks, up DM6.70 at DM467.50, helped by dollar strength and in spite of criticisms levelled against the management style of Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chairman. Elsewhere in the sector, performance was miserable: BMW shed DM3.50 to DM783.00 and Porsche DM4 to DM695. MILAN remained driven by politics and budgetary concerns. The slump in the popularity of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the weekend's regional elections was viewed as positive, since it reduced the chances of a snap general election. However, the successful passage of the 1995 budget through the lower house of parliament during the day only drew attention to the pitfalls it faces in the Senate, where the coalition government has no overall majority and will have to rely on the support of opposition parties. The Comit index picked up 5.05 to 648.64, but some late weakness was reflected in the real-time Mibtel index, which finished 38 ahead at 10,374, off a day's high of 10,401. Montedison fell L23 to L1,197 in heavy turnover, driven by speculation about further restructuring. Credito Italiano picked up L18 to L1,715 as its L2,000bn bid for control of Credito Romagnolo remained in play. Romagnolo ended L28 down at L16,867, but off a low of L16,700. Ras, whose L2,300 capital increase is under way, saw its stock recoup L124 at L15,122 after last week's sharp losses. AMSTERDAM gained ground on general strength throughout the Continent, but enthusiasm was limited. The AEX index rose 1.34 to 411.19, having traded in a narrow range throughout the session. EVC International, a PVC joint venture between ICI, of the UK, and Enichem, of Italy, ended the session at Fl 78.10, against a flotation price of Fl 77.00, in reasonable volume of an estimated 125,000 shares. ING added Fl 1.00 at Fl 79.20 ahead of nine-month results due out later this week. STOCKHOLM was higher on stable debt yields, a stronger dollar and the remnants of the positive momentum established last week by the 'yes' vote in the EU referendum. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 13.5 to 1,520.0. The index for the building and property sector jumped 3.3 per cent on hopes of a surge in new construction projects. Skanska B climbed SKr7 to SKR176.50, while NCC B rose SKr4 to SKr74.50. The forestry index climbed 2.1 per cent as SCA B gained SKr4 at SKr119, while Modo B climbed SKr9 to SKr343. Volvo B rose SKr2.50 to SKr147.50 as the company said it planned to raise research and development spending to about SKr9bn. WARSAW tumbled 4.9 per cent on a lack of confidence that the market was bottoming out of its recent drop. The Wig index lost 349.3 at 7,190.6 as traders warned that the market was likely to continue to slide towards support at 6,716. Some dealers, however, took heart that turnover fell by 31 per cent to 338bn zlotys, indicating investors' reluctance to sell at currently depressed prices.

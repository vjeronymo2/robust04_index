			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: W&amp;A in scaffolding deal W&amp;A INVESTMENT, the diversified South African consumer and industrial group, has bought a 'substantial' foreign scaffolding business for R118m (Dollars 42.7m). Mr Jeff Liebesman, W&amp;A chairman, said it was too sensitive to disclose the name of the company. Local sources have named the target as the Kwikform scaffolding business of Australia. W&amp;A has financed the initial payment of R88.5m through a vendor placing of 22m convertible debentures and 1m new shares, all valued at R4 each. W&amp;A says it expects substantial rationalisation benefits from the transaction and, in the medium term, a significant contribution to profits. The acquisition will make W&amp;A one of the world's largest scaffolding companies.</p>

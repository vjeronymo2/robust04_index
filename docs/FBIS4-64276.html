			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Military Planning Law Requires </F> European Cooperation"]    [Text] Condemned by its critics as Hobson's choice military  planning, the 1995-2000 programming law is being clearly  defended by its authors at the Defense Ministry. They insist on  stressing its coherence and especially the considerable trust  placed in Europe. This is proved by the fact that future weapons  research has been kept at the same level, but reduced as an  overall percentage of the plan. This ratio, referred to as the  CRED (Research, Study, and Development Credit), was fixed at 6  percent of the annual budget. When the account for ground  arsenals, which are grouped together in Giat Industries, was  closed, the figure was 5.6 percent. It will further drop to 5.3  percent. The distribution ratio between military equipment  manufacturers and research and development facilities will  therefore switch from 70:30 in 1994 to 75:25 by the year 2000.  R&amp;D credits will drop from 16.2 billion francs [Fr] per year  to  Fr14 billion.    The logic behind this is the need to supply the Armed Forces  with the resources they rapidly require. In the eyes of the  authorities, there is no question of reliving the experience of  the mid-eighties, when a new fighter aircraft, a new tank, new  helicopters, missiles, ships, an aircraft carrier, and  submarines were all planned at the same time, representing more  than Fr700 billion-worth of programs to be financed. However,  above all, this brake on research budgets, while the overall  military planning budget is rising by 0.5 percent this year or  even by 1.5 percent over the last three years, represents a  clear message from the French authorities to industry: You must  cooperate on the European level. This should make it possible  to limit the amount of parallel work being carried out in the  European defense industry and to share the costs that each  company previously bore alone. At the Defense Ministry it is  stressed that its decision to reduce the CRED is in line with  its "policy of champions" and "technological choices" in the  weapons industry.  <H5>  Effective Cooperation </H5>   Thus, the future fighter aircraft destined to succeed the  Rafale will have to be produced as part of a cooperation  project. Dassault Aviation is already working in this field  with British Aerospace, while Dassault Electronique is working  with GEC [General Electricity Company]. The Tigre and NH-90  helicopters (French-German for the former and  French-Dutch-Italian for the latter) have been saved, although  costs have been revised downward. Where ships are concerned,  the Horizon frigate program (France, Great Britain, and Italy)  shows the way ahead.    Officials have not hesitated to force industrial groups to  cooperate by whittling down their R&amp;D credits. They stress  that  the military planning law, which provides for overall annual  growth, will enable French weapons companies to increase their  military revenues (excluding exports) significantly by the year  2000.</p>

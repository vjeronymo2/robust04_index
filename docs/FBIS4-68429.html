			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Mikhail Zadornov, Sergey </F> Ivanenko, and Aleksey Mikhaylov under the rubric "Alternative":  "Budget-94: 'A Forward-Looking Economic Policy Could Be Started  as Early as the Second Half of 1994'"]    [Text]  <H5>  What Kind of Economic Policy Has Been Built Into the Budget? </H5>   A conspicuous reduction in the domestic expenditures of the  state is the first point that should be noted. The official  deficit of the federal budget--62.4 trillion rubles [R]--equals  approximately one-third of its expenditures and comes to 8.6  percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is less than  last year (10.5 percent of GDP). However, the reduction in state  expenditures in real terms and the hardening of monetary policy  are not restricted to two percentage points; they are much  greater.    The expenditure side of the budget includes quite a number  of  new items which were not included in last year's budget. For the  relative size of domestic expenditures of the budget to be  comparable with last year, the following should be subtracted  from the amount of expenditures in 1994:    --state guarantees for foreign loans--R12.8 trillion  (previously they were not taken into account within the budget,  and from 1994 on they are registered in the budget twice, as  financing for the deficit and as budget expenditures). In  general terms, these are mythical, nonexistent expenditures;  they will not occur actually, i.e. as payment of funds from the  budget, this year, and in the years to come--only in the event  that the enterprises that have received these loans are unable  to pay them back);    --financial support fund for northern territories--R6.6  trillion, and expenditures for conversion--R0.8 trillion (the  monies in these items were previously provided as loans from the  Bank of Russia);    --the debt of the budget for 1993--about R4 trillion (has  already been paid in the first quarter);    --the increment of expenditures for serving the foreign  debt--R6 trillion (more than $2 billion).    Therefore, the real domestic expenditures of the state under  comparable methodology will decline by about R30 trillion  rubles, and the size of the deficit will decline by almost a  factor of two and come to merely one-fifth of the expenditures  and less than 5 percent of GDP.    It should also be taken into account that the interest rate  on credit from the Bank of Russia has become positive in recent  months, i.e. it exceeded the growth of prices, that the  extension of easy credit and subsidization of imports were  canceled, and that a number of other restrictions in monetary  policy were introduced. Therefore, the government is planning a  perceptible hardening of the budgetary and monetary policy for  1994.    The tax burden is growing noticeably:    --profit tax has been increased by 6 percent (of which 3  percent is for the federal budget),    --a special tax has been introduced--actually, value-added  tax has been raised by 3 percent;    --the tax on assets has been raised to 2 percent; this  amounts to a very sharp increase given a reappraisal of the cost  of enterprise assets by a factor of 27 effective 1 January 1994  (in 1994 proceeds by virtue of this tax are projected to be 20  times greater than in 1993);    --transportation tax has been introduced (1 percent of the  labor compensation fund);    --customs duties on imports were increased effective 15  March.    At the same time a number of preferences in profit tax have  been granted; however, in grand total the government plans to  collect 16.6 percent of GDP for the federal budget, instead of  the 10.6 percent last year. Even after the nontax proceeds are  subtracted, the tax load on the economy for funding federal  expenditures will increase by a factor of almost 1.5.    Nonetheless, despite the tax increase the revenues of the  budget appear to be overstated. Budget revenue calculations  clearly fail to take into account the industrial slump, the  mounting volume of nonpayments, the flight of capital, and an  increase in the "average" resourcefulness of merchants in terms  of tax evasion. In the first two months of 1994 only 8 percent  of GDP in taxes was successfully collected by the federal  budget, whereas a statistic from the beginning of last year is  built into the calculations which is clearly unrealistic.    Given that the revenue calculations are overstated, it will  become necessary to cut back expenditures as revenues are really  taken in, that is, the domestic expenditures of the state will  be reduced even below the level planned in the budget, which is  low to begin with.    While the overall tax burden increases, the government turns  out to be unable to take specific and realistic measures to  increase budget revenues.    Thus, in keeping with the Law on the Customs Tariff which  was  passed last year, an overwhelming majority of customs  preferences were to be canceled effective 1 January 1994 because  the rates of customs duty were to be uniform and not subject to  change. The government has been unable to cancel these  preferences and apparently is not planning to do so. A shortfall  in budget revenues on account of the granted preferences exceeds  $4 billion (R12 trillion) in terms of duties alone, and  considerably more taking into account value-added tax and the  excise tax on imports. Besides, the government exempts from the  levying of duties and taxes almost $20 billion in foreign trade  turnover consisting of centrally exported and imported items  (loss in duties alone--up to $3 billion).    The budget does not sufficiently account for the possibility  of increasing proceeds from privatization, as well as the growth  of revenues in conjunction with the consolidation of off-budget  and "ministerial" funds in the budget. Despite the decisions  made to merge these funds, this has not been actually done.  <H5>  Budgetary Expenditures </H5>   On the whole the budget expenditures are planned to increase  by a factor of 4.5 compared to 1993 (under the comparable  calculation method described above), with revenues planned to  increase by a factor of 7.1.    State investment from the federal budget comes to about 2  percent of GDP (even according to initial calculations for the  budget it came to 3 percent). Priority investment programs have  virtually not been distinguished in the draft. The assistance  fund for small businesses and entrepreneurship comes to less  than one-hundredth of 1 percent of budget expenditures. Out of  almost R8 trillion in subsidies for the coal industry, only R0.3  trillion is earmarked for a program of reorganization and  closure of unpromising enterprises; the rest of the amount  constitutes a grant to the industry to carry out the pay scale  agreement (wages), to maintain social services facilities, and  so on. The reorganization fund is not envisioned at all in other  sectors. Funds allocated for conversion (R0.8 trillion) are not  an investment in the reorganization of production for  manufacturing civilian products at defense enterprises, as one  might think; instead, grants for wages or to maintain social  infrastructure facilities account for four-fifths of these  funds. In real terms, proceeds from privatization will decline  compared to 1993, although last year privatization for checks  proceeded whereas in the second half of this year a transition  must be made to privatization at a fee.    The structure of budget expenditures is inertial in nature  and appears to be called upon to merely "patch holes" in the  economy. Of the entire complex of economic policy measures, only  the policy of restricting state expenditures and the growth of  money supply is implemented very consistently.  <H5>  Is the Budget Policy in Line With the Existing Situation? </H5>   Some economists might be getting the impression that a  "victory" over inflation is near: The rate of inflation has been  falling consistently since August 1993. It appears that the  objectives set for economic policy will be reached any minute.    Of course, a normal economic situation presupposes stable  prices or prices growing slowly (up to 10 percent a year).  However, is the direct path toward the goal always the best?    As a result of consistent policy, in the fall of 1993  enterprises have for the second time since 2 January 1992 ended  up in a situation of rigid financial restrictions. Two years ago  enterprises responded with an increase in nonpayments, with the  volume of production falling slightly. They reacted differently  at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994.    Industrial enterprises no longer have the funds to purchase  raw materials and subcontracted parts, and are forced to reduce  production. In the fall of 1993 industry experienced the most  feeble seasonal pickup in all the years of crisis. In January  1994 (during the period of traditional seasonal stability),  there was an unprecedented decline, by 12 to 17 percent compared  to the December 1993 level according to various estimates. The  decline in one month was virtually equal to that for all of  1993! In February the volume of industrial production stabilized  at the extremely low January level, thus confirming that the  decline in January was not random in nature. In the process the  volume of production in machine building dropped by more than  one-half compared to January 1993 (according to preliminary data  it fell by one-quarter in industry as a whole in the first  quarter of this year).    The worsening financial standing and stoppages of  enterprises  are bringing about a rapid growth of arrears in the payment of  wages and forced furloughs for workers. In the last five months  (October 1993 through February 1994), arrears in the issuance of  funds for labor compensation in industry, construction, and  agriculture increased by a factor of 5.2, of which in the last  two months--by a factor of 2.6. As of 1 March more than 8,000  industrial enterprises had arrears; in February the latter  exceeded the monthly labor compensation fund at these  enterprises by a factor of 1.25. A reduction in effective demand  by workers who have failed to receive wages restricts final  demand even more.    Mounting financial difficulties hit the budget like a  boomerang: Proceeds from the profit tax are dropping sharply (in  conjunction with reduced profits), as are those from value-added  tax (in conjunction with mounting nonpayments), income tax, and  some other taxes. The economy ends up in a vicious circle:  Failing to receive revenues, the budget reduces expenditures,  which diminishes the value of final demand; this brings about a  worsening of the financial standing of enterprises, lower  profits, and growing nonpayments. The knot becomes ever tighter.  As the results of January and February indicate, even a direct  tax increase does not bring about an increase in budget  proceeds; losses due to the deterioration of the economic  situation are considerably greater. The increase in import  duties effective 15 March will most likely bring about smaller  budget revenues due to a reduction in imports.    Shortfalls in financing for agriculture are one of the  reasons for a reduction in the planted area. In the fall of  1993, an area 20 percent smaller was planted in winter crops,  which will bring about a loss of the crop of approximately the  same magnitude. Planted areas are likely to shrink in the spring  of 1994, too. This means that there will be fewer foodstuffs  this year, and they will be more expensive. In 1992 and 1993 the  slump in agriculture was minimal, and this mitigated the  deterioration of the economic situation in the country. In 1994  the situation might change, and a reduction in agricultural  production will accelerate the industrial slump rather than  mitigate it.    The policy of increasing taxes and cutting back on budget  expenditures will not actually bring about a reduction in the  deficit. It will bring about a cataclysmic fall in production,  deterioration of the financial situation in the economy, and a  surge in the budget deficit; paradoxical as it may be, as a  result of this policy revenues will grow (inflation!)  conspicuously slower than expenditures.    The general economic situation in Russia obviously  deteriorated sharply at the end of 1993 and the beginning of  1994. In this situation, the government prefers to pretend that  nothing special is happening. However, if the deterioration  continues at the same rate, the most elementary projecting  methods result in an estimated slump in industry of more than 30  percent, i.e. almost by a factor of 1.5, rather than 8 percent  (as in the original projection of the government), 12 percent  (as in the revised projection), and not even 20 percent (as in  the pessimistic projection)!    Let us recall that the president's Budget Message for 1993  submitted to the Supreme Soviet contained the following  macroeconomic projection: inflation--a factor of 3.4 during the  year, slump in industry--7 percent, budget deficit--7.2 percent  of GDP and about 25 percent of expenditures. The actual numbers  for 1993 were: inflation--a factor of 10, slump--16.2 percent,  budget deficit--10.5 percent of GDP and about one-half of  expenditures (and then only at the price of rigid restrictions  and debts of the budget carried over into 1994).    If we look at the 1992-1993 situation as a whole and try to  distinguish the principal causes of this profound fall in the  volume of industrial production (just under a factor of 2), we  can distinguish two causes--a reduction in investment and a loss  of sales markets.    The government projects a further decline in investment for  1994. Indeed, there is no hope that investment will grow under  the stated policy. Undoubtedly, investment from the budget will  be extremely limited (in conjunction with attempts to achieve  inflation-control goals). Following the events of 21 September-4  October 1993, the investment climate for domestic, to say  nothing of foreign, private capital investment is extremely  unfavorable in view of sharply higher political risk. This is  why new decisions will be needed in order to stabilize the  volume of investment--yet another revision of the cost of fixed  assets of enterprises, the expansion of centralized credit  provision through government channels, or an increase in the  budget deficit.    Between 1989 and 1993 Russia successively lost traditional  markets for the sale of its products. The markets of the former  socialist countries were lost from 1989 through 1991 in  conjunction with the disintegration of the Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance. The markets of the former Union republics  were lost in 1992 and 1993 in view of the deliberate liquidation  of the united ruble zone by Russia. Finally, in 1993 Russia  began to lose its own domestic market in conjunction with the  policy of stabilizing the exchange rate of the ruble in the  environment of high inflation: Imported products are crowding  out the domestic producer.  <H5>  The Budget as an Instrument of Economic Policy </H5>   It is impossible to bring inflation in the Russian economy  down in the short term; its roots are profoundly institutional  and structural in nature. Regardless of the will and wishes of  reformers, the Russian economy has entered a phase of  fluctuations which is known in economic science under the name  of "stop and go" [rendered in English in the original]: Periods  of stricter monetary policy give way to periods of relaxation.  This sets a certain cycle in the economic and political life of  the country. However, in this instance it is necessary to feel  quite clearly the change in policy from "stop" to "go." In late  1993 and early 1994 this change is obviously due. Persisting in  the "stop" policy is bringing about an ever greater slump in  production in industry and agriculture, deterioration in the  structure of the economy, stoppages at enterprises, and rapid  growth of first hidden and then overt unemployment, with all the  ensuing social and political conflicts.    We consider institutional and structural transformations in  the economy against the background of relatively stable and  predictable budgetary and monetary policies of the state to be  the main tasks of economic policy at present, rather than  fighting inflation. Our main priorities in economic policy  should be as follows:    --growth of state investment (budget and off-budget) and  incentives for private investment; formation of the capital  market;    --incentives for shifts in the structure of production in  favor of products of final demand and those with a high degree  of upgrading;    --support from the state for reforms in all sectors of the  economy.    To properly devise the budget for 1994 it is first of all  necessary to build into it a realistic, realizable macroeconomic  projection designed with the likely influence of the economic  policy of the state taken into account.    In view of the worsening macroeconomic situation in Russia  at  the beginning of 1994, a minimum task should be set before the  budget for 1994: to strive to refrain from worsening the main  macroeconomic characteristics compared to last year. The  impatient aspiration to improve these characteristics quickly  has already resulted in a cataclysmic slump in industry. This is  why, in view of the results of the first quarter of 1994, the  deterioration of the indicator of the industrial slump can no  longer be avoided. It is realistic to proceed from the statistic  of decline in industrial production of 20-25 percent this year  (that is, the maintenance at the end of the year of the level of  production of the first quarter of this year).    For the most part, the state is left with the device of  funding out of the deficit in order to slow down the fall this  year. This device should be used. Of course, in the process it  is necessary to contain inflation within certain limits, for  example, 15-20 percent per month this year, with this plank  subsequently being reduced yearly.    It would be necessary to use the secured "respite" in  fighting inflation in order to develop reforms in the principal  sectors of the economy.    This is how a budget for 1994 which would reflect such an  economic policy could look in terms of the principal economic  parameters.    The revenue base should be real. This means that, on one  hand, the standard of collected taxes should not be overstated,  and on the other, it will be necessary to take full advantage of  the potential to augment revenues. Unfortunately, the  possibilities for increasing revenues are few. Most of them are  associated with foreign economic operations--revision of the  volume of product transactions to meet state needs (it is  necessary to sharply reduce it), as well as compliance with the  requirements of the Law "On the Customs Tariff" with regard to  the cancellation of preferences in export and import operations.  However, the cancellation of preferences will likely necessitate  a partial increase in directed grants and state investment,  which will be included on the expenditure side of the federal  budget. It is necessary to think over the possibility of  increasing proceeds from post-voucher privatization. It is  necessary to consolidate most off-budget funds within the  federal budget, with their expenditure side analyzed. Of course,  it is necessary to step up monitoring of the collection of  taxes, as well as export and foreign exchange controls.    The proportion of state expenditures in the budget for this  year should be approximately at the same level as in 1993, and a  little higher--in proportion to the growth of budget revenues.  This puts the size of the budget deficit at 40-50 percent of its  expenditures.    However, with a view to ensuring a turnaround in the future,  it is necessary to change the structure of the expenditure side  of the budget: Expenditures should be increased for items that  will produce real returns in the long term.    This is primarily investment. It is necessary to make  investment in keeping with the special-purpose federal programs  developed by the Ministry of the Economy. In this instance it is  better to follow the path of increasing financing for already  approved investment programs without starting new ones, and of  concentrating investment on construction sites that are close to  completion. Of course, it is necessary to improve the quality of  the development of such programs, taking into account world  experience of project financing and perhaps with technical  assistance from international financial organizations. In  addition, investment along the lines of joint financing of  special-purpose programs of local budgets is promising, as well  as joint financing with the private sector (primarily but not  only in housing construction); the latter is particularly  significant for enlivening investment activity. Federal  investment should not come as a grant in the course of joint  financing; it is necessary to record it as a share of the  property of the enterprise being built (retrofitted), with the  possible privatization of this share in the future. The  mechanism for financing the difference in interest rates on  long-term loans out of the budget may be used more actively.  Measures of state support for the development of a capital  market are necessary--a reduction in taxes on operations with  securities, incentives for an active investment policy on the  part of state and nonstate institutional investors, and the  creation of an infrastructure for the development of investment  projects (investment banks and companies, a change in the  direction of work of the Committee for the Management of State  Property, and so on) etc.    Second, there are expenditures for real reforms. This is  support for small businesses (for example, the budget fund could  be increased by a factor of 50 to 100), an increase in the fund  for enterprise reorganization in the coal industry and the  creation of a similar fund for enterprises from other  industries; a state program for voluntary enterprise  bankruptcies; realistic conversion programs associated with the  reorganization of production; active shaping of the labor  market; reorientation of the privatization process away from  distribution of property by checks toward holding auctions and  investment competitions (won by those who want to invest the  most); incentives for exports and import substitution, and many  other things.    Third, these are appropriations for science, culture,  education, and health care--not an increase in expenditures for  all items in these sectors but rather financing for reforms in  them: a transition to funding mostly scientific projects rather  than institutes; incentives for a transition to insurance-based  health care; tax exemptions for noncommercial activities, and so  on. Finally, appropriations for defense should be used to  mitigate the consequences of already planned reductions in the  strength of the army and its transition to a greater degree to  the professional principle of organization; changes in the  structure of the state defense requisition; and meeting  disarmament obligations.    Much of what has been described here can and should be done  as early as in the 1994 budget. We propose to reject in the  first reading the draft 1994 federal budget submitted by the  government and to return it to the government for revisions. One  month could suffice for the government to do this. It would then  be possible to manage to approve the budget before the beginning  of the third quarter in view of the fact that the budget for the  second quarter has already been approved, and that the specially  developed accelerated procedure for approval of a budget by the  Duma takes 40 days.    In view of the sharply higher instability of the economic  situation in Russia, the real lead time in budgetary planning  comes to one or two quarters. This is why it can be recommended  that the government submit to the Duma a budget for the third  quarter or for the second half of the year. Correspondingly,  quarterly reports on implementation of the budget should be  submitted (as of today even the 1992 report has not been  submitted to the Duma, to say nothing of the first quarter of  1994).    It is necessary to consider the federal budget together with  other fundamental decisions on economic policy--confirmation of  the Main Directions for Monetary Policy and the reports and  budgets of the off-budget funds. Besides, a macroeconomic  projection and calculations for the consolidated budget (that  is, those with the drafts of regional budgets) in primary form  are needed within the Budget Message in order for a decision to  be made. Unfortunately, not one of these documents has been  submitted for consideration by the Duma so far.  <H5>  * * * </H5>   The 1994 federal budget is unacceptable in the form in which  it was submitted. It is too harsh for our economy, which is  still ailing. If the budget were rejected in the first reading,  with precise recommendations given for revising it, a  forward-looking economic policy could be started as early as the  second half of 1994. The 1995 budget could then be developed  proceeding from the accomplishments of 1994. Of course, we could  hardly expect a quick improvement in the socioeconomic  situation. However, it is important to embark on a path that  leads out of the abyss as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US pressure over cars irks Tokyo - Campaign for market access runs into mounting criticism Criticism of the US approach to opening up Japan's market to foreign cars and car parts is mounting in Tokyo, as the two countries still remain wide apart on key issues in their bilateral trade and economic framework talks. In a rare move, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association published a statement that is highly critical of the course being taken in the US-Japan framework talks, in which the two countries aim to increase foreign access to Japan's markets. The statement points out that, while attempts to correct the trade imbalance should be based on a broad discussion of macro-economic policy, the focus of the bilateral talks has been on micro-economic issues such as cars and car parts. The association also criticises the US proposals to increase market access for foreign companies in Japan as going beyond the bounds of the two governments' activities. Irresponsible intervention by governments in private business not only leads to managed trade, but in effect reduces consumers' choice, it says. The industry association is particularly concerned that the US proposal to set 'specific expectations' for foreign penetration of the Japanese car and vehicle parts markets is in effect a call for numerical targets. Neither do the US proposals reflect any efforts on the part of the US, even though the framework consultations call for efforts to be taken by both sides, it says. That point was underlined by a high-ranking Japanese government official, who indicated that US carmakers were not making the kind of efforts necessary to win over Japanese consumers. Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs, said that Chrysler's decision not to bring its new car, the Neon, to the Tokyo Motor Show this autumn was disappointing. The Neon, which is widely considered to be a 'Japan car killer', was just right in terms of price and engine size for the Japanese market, Mr Okamatsu said. If US car companies were not going to bring that kind of car to the Japanese market they should not ask for help to penetrate the market, Mr Okamatsu said. He further underlined that there was 'no chance' that Japan would agree to set numerical targets for foreign sales in Japan. Not only did numerical targets carry the risk of leading to managed trade, they were not necessary for foreign companies to succeed in Japan. According to data published yesterday, the foreign share of the Japanese public pro-curement computer market, which was 7.6 per cent in fiscal 1991, rose to 14.4 per cent in 1992 after an action plan was implemented to make public procurement more fair and open, Mr Okamatsu noted.</p>

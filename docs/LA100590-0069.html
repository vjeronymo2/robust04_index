			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BARRIER TO BE INSTALLED ON DEADLY SPAN OF FREEWAY;  </P> <P> ROADS: THE CHP PRAISES THE PLAN TO PUT A CENTER GUARDRAIL ON THE GOLDEN STATE  BETWEEN CASTAIC LAKE AND GORMAN.  </P> <P> Caltrans began a $1.8-million project this week to install a center guardrail  on the Golden State Freeway along a stretch of road in northern Los Angeles  County where six motorists have died in head-on collisions this year.  </P> <P> The steel barriers will be placed along a 13-mile stretch of the freeway going  north from Templin Highway near Castaic Lake to Hungry Valley Road near Gorman.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Thomas Knox said actual construction could begin any day.  </P> <P> Contractors began stockpiling rails to be used for the project at a Templin  Highway storage yard Monday.  </P> <P> Authorities said the project, which was approved by the state more than a year  ago, is expected to be completed by February.  </P> <P> At the California Highway Patrol, the project has been received favorably.  </P> <P> "This is good news because of the accidents we've been having," said Capt.  Terry Horan, head of the CHP's Newhall district, which includes the area where  the barrier will be installed.  </P> <P> "This will make it safer," Horan said. "The head-on collisions demonstrated the  need for a barrier. There were fatals; there were accidents where a blown tire  could send cars into the other side."  </P> <P> The four northbound and four southbound lanes of the freeway are divided by  guardrails or canyons throughout the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> But the separation ends from Templin Highway north to California 138 above  Hungry Valley.  </P> <P> Along this stretch, the north and southbound lanes are only separated by a  36-foot-wide gravel median that dips in the center.  </P> <P> The guardrail project is part of a statewide plan to add safety barriers along  the entire length of Interstate 5 as increased population and traffic dictate,  officials said.  </P> <P> CHP officers said that in recent years there have been numerous accidents along  the stretch that were caused when cars crossed the center strip into oncoming  traffic.  </P> <P> Since April, six people have been killed in four separate accidents  </P> <P> involving head-on collisions.  </P> <P> In addition to the deaths, the accidents often cause massive traffic snarls on  both sides of the freeway -- the state's major north-south artery.  </P> <P> On Aug. 5 a head-on collision in Sunday evening traffic near Templin Highway  left one motorist dead and delayed weekend travelers more than two hours.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Steve Cortes, who has patrolled the stretch through open,  mountainous country, said the area is heavily traveled by trucks and motorists  making lengthy drives to or from Northern California.  </P> <P> He said several of the accidents that he has investigated there involved  drivers who fell asleep and drifted into oncoming traffic.  </P> <P> "It's going to prevent a lot of serious accidents," Cortes said of the new  center guardrail.  </P> <P> Cortes said that once while chasing a speeding car along the stretch, his  patrol car blew a tire and veered across the center median and all four  oncoming lanes.  </P> <P> It was 3 a.m., and traffic was light.  </P> <P> He and his partner came out of it shaken but unscathed.  </P> <P> "I was just fortunate I came through it alive," Cortes said. "My partner and I  were shaking when we got out. We aged about five years going through that. But  a lot of people aren't as fortunate."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KENNY COLMAN BRINGS DRAMATIC BALLAD TO FORTE'S  </P> <P> When Frank Sinatra calls an album "glorious" and adds that "the singing is in  the tradition of Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby and myself," you know that a visit  with the singer in question must pay some substantial dividends.  </P> <P> Kenny Colman, who recently earned that rare endorsement, opened Tuesday at  Forte's, an Italian restaurant in Encino, where he had a successful engagement  a couple of years ago. Unlike the record (not yet released) on which he is  backed by part of the London Philharmonic, the club has provided him with only  a quartet for company. Even under these conditions it does not take long to  recognize that what this Canadian visitor offers is too seldom heard on the  pop-music scene today.  </P> <P> Colman likes to call himself the last of the saloon singers. This holds true in  terms of his choice of material and his strong, true sound in the classic-pop  genre.  </P> <P> Tuesday's show began with "The Good Life" and "Just Friends," both at a bright  tempo and leaving no doubt that Colman was in great voice. The problem was, so  was the audience. When word gets around to his regular following, who in due  course may replace the talkers and the dancers, conditions should be much  easier for him.  </P> <P> Colman's long suit is the dramatic ballad, to which he applies his full reserve  of vocal strength and emotional power. "When Joanna Loved Me," a superb song by  Jack Segal and Bob Wells, remains one of the most moving items in his  repertoire. The Placido Domingo hit "I Couldn't Live Without You for a Day"  made a similarly compelling impact.  </P> <P> With Steve Donovan on keyboards, Sammy Dee on tenor sax, Sinclair Lott on drums  and Jeff Falkner on bass, Colman worked his way from a slightly nervous opening  to a potent finale. He will be off Sunday and Monday, returning for another  five-night stand and closing June 10. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

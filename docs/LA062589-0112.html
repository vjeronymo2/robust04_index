			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWHALL-SAUGUS' OFFENSE AWAKENS IN 10-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> All Panorama City Coach Scott Smith had hoped for going into Saturday's  American Legion District 20 game against Newhall-Saugus was to hang onto the  lead in the Eastern Division. What he did not expect, however, was a shelling  from what could have been the battleship New Jersey.  </P> <P> Newhall-Saugus, the Northern Division leader, banged out 16 hits and made good  use of the 340-foot fence in left-center field, over which it directed four  home runs in a 10-2 victory at Saugus High.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe that," Smith said. "Our pitchers are super. This is the  first time we've been hit hard."  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld, better known for the rockets he delivers with his arm, launched  one with his bat to start the fireworks Saturday. With his team leading, 4-2,  in the third inning, Salkeld belted a two-run home run. Two batters later, John  Lopata's solo blast gave Newhall-Saugus a 7-2 advantage.  </P> <P> Brad Anderson teed off on relief pitcher Carlos Concha's first pitch in the  sixth and Corey Byars' two-run, eighth-inning home run made the score 10-2.  </P> <P> According to Newhall-Saugus Coach Tom Pedersen, his team is breaking out of a  shell.  </P> <P> "This is a good-hitting team", he said. "We've been in a hitting slump the past  two weeks. I was pleased. It takes some of the pressure off the defense."  </P> <P> Canyon High right-hander Scott Thomason went the distance for Newhall-Saugus,  scattering eight hits and recording seven strikeouts while yielding only an  unearned run.  </P> <P> "It's good to have a pitcher that you know can go all the way," Pedersen said.  "He doesn't get tired."  </P> <P> Panorama City took a short-lived 2-1 lead in the third on an error and  consecutive hits.  </P> <P> Davy Garcia reached first on a throwing error and Shane Wight singled to left,  sending Garcia to third. Garcia scored on a wild pitch as Wight went to second.  Joe Cascione followed with a double to the center-field fence off Thomason,  scoring Wight.  </P></p>

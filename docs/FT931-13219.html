			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / As independent as they feel: The Bank of England's new bosses may have a few surprises in store for Mr Major In appointing Mr Eddie George as the next governor of the Bank of England, the government has done a paradoxically risky thing. On the face of it, there is no risk involved at all. Mr George has worked at the Bank for 30 years, and has been running its day-to-day operations since becoming deputy governor in 1990. He is a discreet, professional operator, well known to the civil servants and politicians he will have to deal with during his initial five-year term. The appointment is risky, none the less. It has brought about something Whitehall normally strives to avoid: giving a man with strong and independent views a pulpit from which he will have little choice but to express them publicly. A first faint shadow of the potential tensions to come was evident on Friday night, at a hastily summoned press conference with Mr George and his deputy-designate, Rupert Pennant-Rea, editor of The Economist magazine. As journalists arrived, they were handed a statement from Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, welcoming Mr George and setting out his task: 'I have made clear to the new governor that his central responsibility should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation, the only sound basis on which sustainable growth and secure jobs can be built.' The political meat of this statement is contained in the first 18 words: the Bank's responsibility is to support the government. Only then does the sentence turn to the substance of current policy, the need for low inflation. Intentionally or not, the phrasing of the statement emphasises the government's view that the Bank plays an essentially subordinate role in formulating economic policy. The prime minister, Mr John Major, is known to have turned his back on the arguments advanced by some in his own party that the only way to achieve long-term price stability is to give the Bank of England formal independence. Though a commitment to an independent central bank is also enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, it is not something the prime minister wishes to consider at the moment. Mr George is a forceful advocate of the view that low inflation should be the central aim of economic policy. In the past, he has argued for a central bank with a high degree of operational independence, with a statutory obligation to aim for price stability. An elected government should be able to overrule such a semi-independent Bank, he has told colleagues, but only in a formal and public way. On Friday night, he returned to the theme. What counted was not the institutional mechanism, he said, but the shared commitment to low inflation, and he welcomed the chancellor's statement. Then he went on: 'Having said that, I do think that there is a good case for making the setting of the strategic objective and the operational responsibility for achieving that objective separate. But that is essentially a matter for politicians, for government and for parliament to consider.' As long as the government remains as committed to low inflation as the new governor, the debate on this issue is likely to remain a low-key one. Mr Pennant-Rea, whose magazine has argued for an independent central bank, promised on Friday that he would continue to advance that view from inside the Bank. If the government seeks to diverge from the path towards lower inflation, however, a cosy theoretical debate about appropriate institutional structures will become a pressing issue of policy. Mr Major believes that the political importance of mortgage interest rates is one argument that rules out an independent central bank. Yet what if the political imperative to keep mortgage rates low conflicts with the need for higher interest rates in the face of rising inflation? This sort of situation - by no means unlikely over the next few years - would provide the decisive test for Mr George's governorship. In the past, Bank governors have largely confined themselves to private protests in such circumstances. All Mr George's instincts, after 30 years in the Bank, must lie the same way. He said on Friday: 'If independence has to be in some sense in opposition to government, in that case I don't think I want it.' Yet, unlike other recent governors, he will have no choice but to make his judgment known: the collapse of economic policy after sterling was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism in September led the chancellor to ask the Bank for a public report every quarter on the inflationary outlook. Given that, said Mr George, 'it will be very difficult for us not to make known publicly if we actually think that the government's inflation objective is threatened'. This is not the only area in which there are seeds of potential conflict. Mr George is less than enthusiastic about a speedy move to European integration. He listed, on Friday, the various ways in which European economies would need to draw closer together before sterling could re-enter the ERM. 'What we've learnt from the experience of last year,' he said, 'is that it is critically important that we achieve a very high degree of economic convergence before it makes sense to lock in a rigid way exchange rates between countries.' His endorsement of the decision to join the ERM in 1990 was lukewarm. In considering such a decision, he said, 'we may not think it is absolutely the right thing to do from a monetary perspective, but do we want to be left behind?' In these ways, Mr George shows himself a loyal but sceptical servant of the elected government. He clearly has no illusions about the economic management of the British economy since the second world war: its failures had created a 'credibility gap'. Other European central bankers, he said, would have no doubts about the Bank's commitment to low inflation, but they were bound to have questions about the government's, given the history of the past four decades. There is plenty of scope for potential conflict there. In the public eye, however, the biggest question mark over Mr George's appointment lies not in his views but in his provenance. He is only the second governor to come from the Bank's existing staff. The pressures for an outside appointment must have seemed particularly great, given the sterling crisis last autumn and the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. Though, in the end, these issues were not enough to prevent Mr George taking over, they were enough to bring in an outsider as deputy governor. Mr George made it clear that such an appointment was the price the Bank had to pay for having one of its own staff as governor. 'I absolutely recognise the case for having fresh air brought into the Bank,' he said, in a tone that implied the case had been made to him fairly forcibly. Just how much will change in the Bank as the new team takes charge is not clear. Mr George has a reputation as an extremely hands-on manager, though he did say he expected to be much less involved in administration. Mr Pennant-Rea, in turn, was unclear about what his exact responsibilities would be, though he hopes to be closely involved in the presentation of the Bank's case to the world. He has some experience of bringing the musings of a bureaucracy to the public: in the 1980s he was regularly seconded to the World Bank to turn its annual World Development Report into comprehensible English. The Bank will change in subtle ways under the new team. Those who hope for an immediate radical change in the way the institution works are likely to be disappointed, however. There had already been a revolution in the Bank, said Mr George. 'If I could see an area in which there was an immediate need for further change, I would have been pretty remiss if I hadn't done that already.'</p>

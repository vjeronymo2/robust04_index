			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has affirmed that  the postponement of the pope's visit to Lebanon is related to  divergent policies in the region. These policies are linked  more to international factors than to internal Lebanese factors.  He added that if the pope had come to this country, we would  have welcomed him. We welcome all Lebanon's guests, more so the  pope because he espouses the issue of coexistence. However,  since he will not come, he knows better the justifications that  have prompted him to postpone the visit.    Fadlallah said the situation in Lebanon requires it to be an  oasis of freedom so that the region's problems can be aired in  Lebanon. Freedom will survive but it might receive some  scratches, depending on the political conditions outside Lebanon.</p>

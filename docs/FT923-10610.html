			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: LTV's steel side still in the red LTV, the US steel group which has been operating for five years under the protection of bankruptcy courts, yesterday reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net income, thanks to a gain from the sale of a business. But its core steel operations remained mired in red ink. LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars 13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn. The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher volume of steel shipments. The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, compared with Dollars 23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 947m, and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons. The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher employment costs, mainly from a new union contract. 'Shipments are up, purchased materials costs are down and operating costs have been reduced,' said Mr David Hoag, LTV's chairman. 'But these gains are not sufficient to offset persistently low prices which continue to impede the company's financial performance.' The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m, down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from Dollars 2.5m. For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales dipped from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn. Loral yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 29m, or 85 cents a share, against Dollars 22.4m, or 83 cents a year earlier, Karen Zagor reports from New York. Sales were slightly higher, at Dollars 681m compared with Dollars 677m. Operating income for the three months to June 31 rose 7 per cent to Dollars 68.8m from Dollars 64.1m. Bookings stood at Dollars 502m in the latest quarter against Dollars 492m last year, while Loral's backlog slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 2.73bn from Dollars 2.88bn. Mr Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said the company expected 'income, bookings, sales and margins to accelerate as the year progresses, with double digit per share earnings increase for the year, without acquisitions'.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Monopoly under the microscope / Examining the case for a radical restructuring of British Gas At the City of London headquarters of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a handful of experts is hard at work disentangling one of the most complicated issues in UK competition policy - what to do about British Gas. The deliberations are being followed closely - not only by the monopoly gas supplier, but by potential rivals in the industry and the rest of Britain's privatised utilities. The MMC report is expected to set a marker for the development of competition in industries privatised during the 1980s and will determine in which areas, and to what extent, the gas market is opened to new entrants. The commission's discussions will focus on an ambitious blueprint for a fully competitive gas market. The plan, drawn up by Sir James McKinnon, director-general of the regulatory body Ofgas, calls for the division of the company into 12 regional businesses, a separate gas-purchasing arm and a pipelines company. So complex are the issues that the commission has postponed its report, due at the end of this month, until the end of July. Sir James's ideas are radical. His plan is to break up the monopoly structure forced on the industry six years ago when British Gas was privatised as a single entity. The company's dominant position in the market has obstructed the development of competition, Sir James believes. Rivals now supply about 30 per cent of industrial sales, but Sir James would like to see competition extended beyond the industrial sector. Ofgas also wants competitors to move into the household supply market - where British Gas holds a monopoly. This is the only way to offer consumers real choice and lower prices, Sir James claims. Ranged against him are British Gas, many of the North Sea oil operators and the Gas Consumers Council, which represents household customers. British Gas says prices will rise in a more open market. Large industrial users fear they will lose their access to cheap supplies of gas - which are currently subsidised by household customers - if more competition is introduced. British Gas desperately wants to retain its monopoly over household supply. It has proposed decentralising its own operations in an effort to fend off calls for a wholesale break-up. It has suggested to the commission that it split its business into five wholly owned subsidiaries covering sales of gas to the industrial market, household supply, pipelines, sales of appliances, and installation and servicing. The company has also offered to disband its central purchasing arm as a way of diminishing its buying power in the North Sea. British Gas receives some support from North Sea oil companies. Producers such as Shell point to the need for long-term supply contracts to assist the development of gas fields - these may not be available without British Gas's strong buying power. Shell argues that the current industry structure has served customers well in many respects. Consumer groups agree with this prognosis. The Gas Consumers' Council is sceptical about the benefits accruing to domestic consumers in a liberalised market. The commission's first challenge is to weigh these arguments and decide whether British Gas's monopolistic power has worked against consumers' interests. If it concludes that the household supply market should be opened up to rivals, it must then decide how this could be done and, if necessary, suggest relevant structural changes. But the commission can only recommend action - the government does not have to follow its advice. The government has indicated that it would look favourably on a gradual opening of the gas market. Last year, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he would consider the introduction of competition in household supply in May this year. But the government's plans were thrown into disarray by the monopolies reference last August. Rival gas shippers are nonetheless convinced that pressures for liberalising the market will be difficult to resist. British Gas has about 25 main competitors in the industrial market and almost all of them have told the commission they are keen to become involved in sales to households. Though they differ over how quickly and in what way they should be given access to those customers, the competitors to British Gas do agree that they could offer customers cost savings. Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil and Norsk Hydro, reckons that households could save an average Pounds 50 a year or 10 per cent of their gas bills if it were allowed to supply them. The company is basing its claims on evidence drawn from sales to the industrial sector, where it currently supplies 6,000 sites. British Gas buys its gas at about 20p a therm and sells it to households at close to 50p a therm, a substantial profit margin which competitors believe they could erode. But the mark-up is not pure profit, counters British Gas. Transportation costs must be added to the cost of the gas, and these are higher for some customers than others. For this reason, the company says 12m of its 18m customers could end up paying more in a liberalised market and only 6m would make a saving. British Gas believes there would be a political outcry if customers in those parts of the country which are the greatest distance from the gas terminals end up paying substantially higher costs than others. In addition, the company has argued that the flow of gas through its pipelines would be difficult to balance - ensuring that customers get enough gas on cold days - with no single company to monitor supply and demand. This view is echoed by some industry experts. 'If anything goes wrong in the system, there will be all sorts of recriminations, with shippers blaming the pipeline company and vice versa. In the meantime, the consumer is going without gas,' said Mr Jonathan Stern, an industry consultant with the Gas Strategies group. Competitors say these drawbacks are not insurmountable, saying they could provide financial bonds with the regulator so that the pipeline company could draw on the money if rivals fail to meet their supply obligations. 'No one worries about the security of supply of, say, milk,' said one rival. The Gas Consumers' Council, however, says it is not convinced that competition would bring more benefits to consumers than are currently available from the heavily regulated monopoly. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council, is also doubtful about whether effective competition is possible in the household market. He believes it is not practical to have several companies competing for customers in a small area because of the huge infrastructure required to service those customers. Large industrial users are similarly sceptical about the benefits of increased competition. They fear losing supplies of cheap gas in the so-called interruptible market. Interruptible users pay very low prices for their gas in return for being cut off during periods of peak demand  - on the coldest days in winter - when their supply is redirected to households. 'We're getting ready to fight very, very hard to preserve the interruptible market,' said Mr Anthony Mitchell-Harris, who represents large gas users in the Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group. If competitors were to supply the interruptible customers - and so far none do because prices are too low - those large users fear prices would rise. The rival suppliers would not have British Gas's economies of scale or the same need to balance demand in the domestic market. In addition, if competitors were promising savings to domestic customers, they would not be able to subsidise industrial users. British Gas is trying to allay such fears by suggesting the creation of a market in peak gas sales to cover supply in this sector of the market. Initially, it says, competing suppliers could bid for industrial contracts, with the sale going to the lowest bidder. Eventually, a so-called spot market could evolve, where gas is bought and sold like any other commodity. The company is planning to consult its rivals on how this market might work. British Gas will be hoping that such proposals will pre-empt the imposition of more radical reform. It might draw some comfort from the government's concern to avoid another damaging energy dispute after its controversial coal decisions. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will be aware that he is bound to make enemies whichever way he decides. He is likely to hope that the experts remain embroiled in the complexities of the sector for as long as possible.</p>

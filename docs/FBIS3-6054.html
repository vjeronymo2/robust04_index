			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yun Yong-chan: "Why Did Prime Minister Yi Make </F> Remarks About North Korea?"]    [Text] Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang suddenly convened a  news conference on 10 March and strongly criticized North Korea  for its insincere attitude toward the working-level contact for  the exchange of special envoys. The prime minister's office  said that particular news conference was nothing unusual. The  news conference itself, however, was a deliberate act to a great  extent.    Prime Minister Yi called the news conference after attending  a high-level strategic meeting at his residence in Samchong-tong  that morning and at a time when the North-South dialogue was  deadlocked.    Prime Minister Yi looked stern and expressed his  uncomfortable feeling about North Korea. He stated: "North  Korea assumed an insincere attitude toward the working-level  contact," and "We doubt if North Korea has the will to exchange  special envoys," and "We express strong regret."    During the news conference Prime Minister Yi primarily  criticized North Korea for its insincere attitude, even though  he also discussed ways to give financial assistance to  government-patronized organizations and government restructuring.    He made hard-line remarks about North Korea for various  purposes. First, we can say Prime Minister Yi felt it necessary  to express the government's strong will, as some people  criticized that the "government has been pulled and hauled by  North Korea." He said that the government would not "beg" for  dialogue with North Korea anymore. He reportedly expressed a  strong uncomfortable feeling about North Korea at the high-level  strategic meeting, as well. This means that the government has  turned hard-line.    Prime Minister Yi made those remarks also because of the  demand by Tom Hubbard, U.S. assistant secretary of State, and  Warren Christopher, secretary of State, that the ROK National  Security Law be abolished. Prime Minister Yi was much  displeased with this interventionist demand and, therefore, felt  it necessary to clearly express our government's own position on  the North-South dialogue, without regard to the United States.    We can say that by making those remarks, Prime Minister Yi  strongly asked North Korea to change its attitudes at the sixth  working-level contact scheduled for 12 March. The government  thinks that if no agreement was reached at the sixth  working-level contact, it would be impossible for the North and  South to exchange special envoys by 21 March, when North Korea  and the United States are scheduled to start the third round of  high-level talks.    We can also say that as it is virtually impossible to  exchange special envoys given North Korea's attitude, Prime  Minister Yi made those remarks in order to stress that North  Korea would be held responsible for a possible breakup of the  North-South talks. The government believes that North Korea has  deliberately excluded South Korea from discussions on the  nuclear issue and that it has also delayed the working-level  contact for the exchange of special envoys, judging that it has  nothing to lose even if the North Korean-U.S. talks are  postponed.</p>

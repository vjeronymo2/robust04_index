			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / 'Ex-Services Minister' called for MPs of all parties yesterday called for more sensitive handling of the problems of former members of the armed forces, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said in the opening speech of a Commons debate on the issue that the UK was one of the few allied nations that had not appointed a minister charged with promoting the interests of ex-service personnel. Such a minister's role would be to cut through red tape to ensure that those who had served in the forces speedily secured their benefits and other entitlements. Mr MacKinlay said that a sub-department of ex-service affairs would be better equipped to co-operate with the Royal British Legion and other organisations acting on behalf of those who had served in the forces. Mr Donald Anderson, from the Labour front bench, said his party was considering whether a unit should be set up in the Ministry of Defence to look after the needs of ex-servicemen and women. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, agreed to look for improvements in administrative arrangements but argued against the creation of a special sub-department which, he said, would 'cut across existing lines of communication' including those between MPs and ministers.</p>

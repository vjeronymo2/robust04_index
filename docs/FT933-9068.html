			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Labour accuses the government of undermining local democracy LABOUR yesterday accused the government of undermining local democracy by expanding the powers and membership of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations). Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government minister, said a Labour survey suggested that quangos in some parts of Britain would soon have more members than local authorities. Quangos would be further boosted by more schools opting out of local authority control, and more hospitals choosing to operate as self-governing trusts. The Audit Commission has announced a review of probity in local government, to report in November.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Crimea" column] </F>   [Excerpts] Yesterday in Simferopol Yuriy Meshkov gave a  press conference. It was devoted mainly to the results of the  Crimean president's six-day visit to Moscow. The president  noted that he is "more than satisfied" with the meetings and  negotiations in Moscow. According to Yuriy Meshkov, some  tangible steps have been made toward merging the economies of  Russia and the Republic of Crimea. The president said that by  the start of the summer vacation season the peninsula will be in  the ruble zone. Yuriy Meshkov assured that "we shall feel the  results of this in the very near future." According to the  president, "all the important decisions have been made on energy  deliveries and other problems, in spite of the rather  complicated situation in Russia itself." It was specially noted  that "the Republic of Crimea enjoys the most favored nation  regime with Russia." The president did not say whom he met in  Moscow, saying only that negotiations were held at the highest  level. "Above that level is only God." [passage omitted]    Talking about his visit to Kiev prior to his trip to Moscow,  Meshkov stressed repeatedly that this visit was of a working  character. "In Kiev, questions of the Crimean economy were  discussed." Meshkov noted, however, that "the negotiations  there were conducted in a friendly but rather tense situation.  There is no way they can compare with the talks in Moscow. It  is like apples and oranges." The president confirmed reports  that Russia has allocated 50 billion rubles to ensure the return  of the people deported from Crimea. Sharp comments were made  with respect to persons implicated in misappropriating the  resources earlier granted to the Crimean Tatars by Ukraine.  "Some Crimean Tatars live in dugouts while some are building  four-story mansions for themselves. I ordered my ministers to  straighten that out." The president stated that his first edict  will be on interethnic relations.    Responding to the question of weather he has advised  Kravchuk  about his trip to Russia, Yuriy Meshkov said, "I do not report  to the Ukrainian president on my work." [passage omitted]    Journalists at the press conference assessed Meshkov's  phrase  "I consider it abnormal when state structures are used to  promote the (journalists') views" as an encroachment on  glasnost. The president believes that the journalist's duty is  to "convey information," not express his opinion or select  people who share it. "It is wrong to use one's official  position to express one's personal views."</p>

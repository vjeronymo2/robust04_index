			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: True believer gains credit -  Michael Portillo, Tory hero behind the scenes Mr Kenneth Clarke got the plaudits on the day. But on the Conservative back benches at Westminster Mr Michael Portillo will take much of the political credit for the Budget. In theory, as chief secretary to the Treasury and the chancellor's number two, Mr Portillo is the most junior member of the cabinet. He is just 40 years old. He is one of the three rightwing cabinet 'bastards' castigated by Mr John Major in one of the prime minister's more intemperate moments during the crisis over the Maastricht treaty. But he is also the heir to Lady Thatcher's mantle. A true believer and self-confessed conviction politician, he is seen by the Tory right as the natural candidate for the party leadership. So Mr Clarke's decision to balance another round of tax increases with unexpectedly large reductions in public spending will do nothing to dim Mr Portillo's rising star. A politician committed to reducing progressively the share of the nation's income taken by the state, he got as much as any on the Tory right could have hoped for in terms of cuts in spending targets for the next three years. The chief secretary cannot claim it was all his own work. Under the new system for sharing out the Whitehall spending cake the final decisions on each departmental budget are taken by a cabinet committee, the so-called EDX. Nor were the additional cuts announced yesterday the result of a pre-planned operation to sweeten the pill for the Tory right of another round of tax increases. When EDX first started serious negotiations in September it aimed to meet the Treasury's original, higher, spending targets. It was only when savings started to come along faster than expected that the decision was made to take a political trick by lowering those targets. There was also sleight of hand. A close look at the figures suggests that a significant chunk of the savings will come from a fortuitous drop in the government's contributions to Brussels. The projected public-sector pay freeze on which all the figures are predicated remains a heroic assumption. But Mr Portillo was the chief prosecutor, attacking every bid for extra cash from the ministers who run the big Whitehall spending empires. He was the driving force in the often acrimonious negotiations between the Treasury and Whitehall departments which led to what promises to be the toughest squeeze since the government took office in 1979. He has also been shaping the parallel long-term spending reviews which are challenging many of the basic assumptions which have underpinned the welfare state since the last war. Mr Clarke may insist that his commitment to preserve the welfare system is unshakeable. But the chancellor has done nothing to prevent Mr Portillo appearing almost weekly on the nation's television screens questioning the long-term future of some of its principal building blocks. Even the state pension can no longer be regarded as inviolate. Some times in the latest round of negotiations the chief secretary went too far. He wanted the government to break the pledge in its general election manifesto to maintain the real value of child benefit. Perhaps he forgot for a moment that Mr John Major had personally insisted on that commitment. But such setbacks have hardly dented Mr Portillo's most significant political success over the past few months. He demanded and got large-scale reductions in the budgets for defence, local authorities, housing and transport. More importantly, he managed to open up both within and outside the government a debate which has posed fundamental questions about the respective roles and responsibilities of the state and the individual. Politics will probably dictate that Mr Major's government retreats from some of the harsher conclusions of its welfare-state review. Mr Portillo has the Tory right on his side but the mood will shift once the economy strengthens and the general election approaches. The proposed cuts in invalidity and unemployment benefit already threaten a dangerous political battle. But Mr Portillo is there for the long haul. Mr Clarke has confirmed his place as heir apparent in the event that Mr Major were to fall by the political wayside. But henceforth the chancellor will be looking over his shoulder.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to Legislator Leo Gonzalez, it is unfair  for the U.S. Government to say that drug money laundering in  Panama has increased. What must be done to dispel all doubts is  to update all laws dealing with this matter.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] Panama has done an excellent job.  Customs, the PTJ [Technical Judicial Police], and the National  Police have confiscated large amounts of drugs. A number of  narcotraffickers have been captured, the country has cooperated  with the U.S. Government, and the DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration] works unimpeded here, which I think is all  right. We must admit, however, that we have lagged a little  regarding money laundering. We have experienced trouble with  money laundering because of our banking center and the Colon  Free Zone. [end recording]    The Legislative Assembly is making every effort to approve  the new drug bill as soon as possible. Gonzalez said it is  urgent to pass money laundering legislation as soon as possible.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] The only weak link in our  legislation has to do with money laundering, for which we will  have to pass special legislation. Yet we are moving in that  direction. This fight against drug trafficking will not end  overnight. The important thing is that we are taking firm steps  to solve this problem. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: China trapped in a maze of tyranny - Derek Davies on the plight of the Chinese citizen THE TYRANNY OF HISTORY: THE ROOTS OF CHINA'S CRISIS by W. J. F Jenner Allen Lane The Penguin Press Pounds 18.99, 248 pages WILD SWANS: THREE DAUGHTERS OF CHINA by Jung Chang HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 524 pages ONE OF the most heart-rending of the television images broadcast from China during the post-Tienanmen crack-down of 1989 was that of a student being bussed away from an abortive demonstration in Shanghai. Leaning from the bus window and speaking to camera in English he mourned: 'China is a hopeless country.' A great Chinese weight of tyranny, of pressures from history, society and culture, and of repeatedly shattered hopes and illusions, squeezed out this unpatriotic verdict on his fatherland. It is one largely shared by the two authors of these books: one a 'foreign devil' professor of Chinese at Australia's National University at Canberra, the other a Chinese child of Mao Zedong's blood-stained revolution, now in exile in Britain. Jenner's book is an admirable attempt to map the Chinese psyche in a series of chapters discussing the various burdens that a Chinese acquires at birth under whose weight he must grunt and sweat through his or her weary life, and the man-made partitions which shut off horizons. The burdens of the past are heavy, symbolised by the emperor figure, and all the authoritarianism and centralism that system of government entails. The occasional imperial progress to parts of the kingdom failed to allow the real world to penetrate the maze of courtyards, gateways, silk curtains, kowtows, corrupt mandarins and conspiring eunuchs which separated the man in the fields from the dragon throne. It was a pattern of rule to which China's last-but-one emperor, Mao himself, reverted. He spent his last years immured in a suite of rooms in the Forbidden City, mostly in bed reading the classics and taking food only from a favoured maid servant. Jenner argues that Deng Xiaoping has become the latest in the line, once boasting that he works only a quarter of an hour per day. The family; the neighbourhood committee; the community; the legal and security systems; the bureaucracy; the Party; the Emperor: the concentric circles ring every Chinese citizen and never widen. The social limits have their physical equivalents: the interlocking rooms and courtyards of the Chinese home; the surrounding walls repeated in macrocosm in the fortifications around towns and cities and around northern China itself: 50,000 kilometres of wall to keep the barbarians out and the Chinese in. Even in death, an official lay nested within six or eight coffins, boxes within boxes. Jenner's weakest chapter seeks to close off the optimists' hopes for ways out of the past. The 'plastic' version of neo-Confucianism he rightly characterises as a self-rationalisation for 'elected dictatorships' like Singapore, but he neglects to discuss the very real advantages of non-confrontational consensus politics compared with the diverse wastefulness of Western democracies. Similarly, he discounts East Asia's genius for capitalistic growth and its burgeoning in South China. Economic success he largely ascribes to inherited colonial experiences (but what of Thailand?). Neither does he give democracy much chance: 'Authoritarian values . . . cannot accommodate the existence of rival (views). The state is absolutist.' Such arguments ignore the fact that economic successes in East Asia's 'Confucian' states have created middle classes (and their university-educated offspring) that are effectively demanding an ever-greater say in the government. They ignore the openings to the outside world inherent in growth (trade, foreign investment, technology transfers and so on). Jenner should attend a few opposition party election meetings in Taiwan and marvel how brightly the lamps of democracy, anti-corruption and human rights burn after a century of Japanese occupation and Kuomintang oppression. The societies which are emerging have much in common with modern Western societies (something Singapore's neo-Confucian apologists find unacceptable). Jenner does not write like an academic - a great compliment in my book. Unclogged by footnotes, the chapter-essays swing along with the convincing verve of a good leader-writer, with an eye for the telling phrase. 'This book deals briefly with vast issues too urgent to be left till they can be viewed with the wisdom of hindsight', he opens, while denying any claims to originality. Jenner stretches a polemical canvas on a socio-political framework, but it is Jung Chang who paints the darkly epic picture. Her book is on a Victorian scale covering the gamut of Chinese society, vast areas of China itself and spanning three generations: her grandmother, mother and herself and spanning the 20th century. Her grandmother, complete with bound feet, becomes the concubine of a pre-revolutionary warlord (the story of women in China plumbs fresh depths of oppression and humiliation). Her mother flees to Manchuria, suffering Japanese occupation and becoming an anti-Kuomintang agent for the Communist armies, marrying a prim, idealistic guerrilla fighter. Their patriotism is rewarded with good jobs once Mao's forces triumph. Too soon, however, the dark, destructive forces of Mao and palace politics turn revolutionary hope into cynicism. The family survives the Korean War; the idiocies of the Great Leap Forward; the bitter years of famine; the neurosis of the Cultural Revolution; the Maoist Purges: but all bring appalling suffering to the patriotic pair and their children. Through long separations, terms in jail, exiles in the countryside, denunciation as class enemies and KMT agents, ill health, random violence and bitter betrayals, the early zeal and idealism are gradually leached out. Finally, just before his death and still under false suspicion, the father admits; 'If I die like this, don't believe in the Communist Party any more.' Jung Chang herself has her first contacts with foreigners and with English literature. Finally she glimpses Mao's feet of clay and asks herself yet again: 'If this is paradise, what then is hell?' The tragic story of the three true daughters of China is told with what rings out as absolute honesty, with that mixture of intelligence and naivety which is truly Chinese. The book is a huge tour de force, the inside story of what was really going on while the outside world peered fitfully in, only guessing at the damage the imbecilic Mao was causing his country. Jung Chang escapes to England, rejoices in Deng Xiaoping's reforms, and is cast down by Tienanmen, although she claims that China has become altogether a different place since she left in 1978 and that the once all-pervasive fear has diminished. But the happy escape to the west of Jung Chang and her three brothers lights no way out of the maze for the rest of the one billion Chinese. Black though the prospects may seem from both these admirable books, China's neighbours do offer glimpses of light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. In the last month, Deng Xiaoping has performed the latest metamorphosis in his survivalist career, denouncing the inflexibility of the very hard-liners he promoted to the highest office after Tienanmen, and giving his personal blessing to the almost unrestrained economic warlordism which is transforming whole tracts of South China. There is no reason to believe that, if 'bourgeois capitalism' is allowed to blossom, it should not bring to China the material and social benefits it is bringing to other, once poverty-stricken, countries of the region.</p>

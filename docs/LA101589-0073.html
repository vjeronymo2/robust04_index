			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: BODRUM IS PLACE TO BE ON AEGEAN  </P> <P> A 15th-Century crusaders' castle crowns a hill beside the blue harbor here, but  down below a crusade of a different sort has been going on for years.  </P> <P> The latest wave of faithful is secular and consists in the main of young people  who have made this their beachside capital on the Aegean Sea, getting up just  in time for an afternoon of sun followed by an evening of cafe hopping until  dawn.  </P> <P> So popular has this town of 13,000 become that its population rises to about  100,000 between April and November. New construction to accommodate tourists  has been so frantic that the recently elected mayor ran on a sole platform of  "no more building" during his five-year term.  </P> <P> In addition to being one of the prettiest and liveliest resort towns on the  Aegean today, Bodrum has a modicum of antiquities and ruins to interest those  seeking to combine a seaside holiday with a bit of history.  </P> <P> Getting here: Take British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Pan Am or SAS to Istanbul,  then Turkish Airways to Izmir. From there it's half a day bus ride to Bodrum,  but many visitors sail in with a cruise line, Turkish ferry or the increasingly  popular gulet, a private-hire sailing vessel right out of the Middle Ages.  </P> <P> How long/how much? A day will do for the sights of Bodrum, but many linger on  for a week or more. Costs for accommodations from moderate downward, with  superb Turkish food for a pittance.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: The Turkish lira recently sold for 2,200 to the dollar, about  .00045 each. Visit any time between April and November, but between July and  September the town is crowded with Europeans and the harbor is choked with  yachts and gulets. Taxis are cheap, dolmus (communal cabs) even cheaper.  </P> <P> Settling in: Hotel Ayaz (Gumbet Bay; $42 U.S. double, half-pension) is owned by  Huseyin Ayaz, whose family has held land in these parts for 400 years. It has  its own beach with a fine pool, gardens, lively beachside bar and every  possible water sport.  </P> <P> Bedrooms of moderate size have private balconies and contemporary furnishings.  A big plus for the Ayaz is its site on a bay behind the main harbor, away from  the noise and bustle of town. And the owner has a six-cabin gulet with all the  amenities of a yacht, just in case you'd like a cruise down the coast.  </P> <P> Otel Park Palas (Gumbet Bay; $40 double, half-pension) is next door to the Ayaz  and duplicates most of its virtues.  </P> <P> The beachside garden is a cool haven of green lawn, banana and eucalyptus  trees, and bowers of flowers. The gigantic pool sits beside an awning-covered  terrace restaurant and American bar. There's a very friendly owner here who  grows tomatoes, eggplant and herbs in his garden for the dining room.  </P> <P> Hotel Serthan (Gumbet Road; $39 double, half-pension) is a small and sparkling  white place of local architecture that's perfect for families, many of which  seem to come back yearly to go fishing with the owner.  </P> <P> Only 31 rooms, it's built around the pool and is only a two-minute walk from  the beach. Bedrooms are simple but beautiful, with balconies spilling  bougainvillea. The pension meals are excellent.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: All along this coast you'll find plenty of fresh  seafood, but it's usually about twice the price of meat and vegetable dishes.  Look for fresh sardines, anchovies, swordfish, sea bass, red mullet and bream,  plus whatever is running at the time.  </P> <P> Two things that caught our fancy fast were ezo gelin, a lentil and rice soup  spiced with tomato, mint and red peppers, and midya dolmasi, a cold meze (hors  d'oeuvre) of mussels in their shells and stuffed with rice and pine nuts. The  last was probably the best dish of the trip.  </P> <P> Another meze you'll enjoy is the patlican salatasi, a heavenly paste of  eggplant pureed with yogurt, which you dip onto pide (pita) bread. Mezes go  well with raki (anise liqueur) or ayran, yogurt mixed with water, a Turkish  favorite.  </P> <P> Good dining: Restaurant Han (just off the main shopping street) is built around  a tree-shaded courtyard, its walls lined with colorful carpets. You dine at  communal tables on kebabs, kofte (spicy lamb patties) and fresh prawns. The  most expensive thing on the menu is $6.50. Evenings are festive, with Turkish  folk dancers and the ever-present belly dancer gyrating away.  </P> <P> Amphora (on the quay at the edge of town) is a pretty place where you may dine  indoors or on a cool terrace rimmed with potted oleanders. A broad menu gives  you a choice of 20 mezes, two dozen kinds of skewered meats and several koftes.  Again, you'll find carpets decorating the floors and stuccoed walls.  </P> <P> Eren (near the main square on the quay) is entirely open, with rustic tables  and a menu of no-frills Turkish specialties. A lamb brochette goes for $2.25,  fresh sea bream for $6.50. There are half a dozen similar cafe-restaurants  along this front, so pick and choose.  </P> <P> Going first-class: When it's lighted at night, the new Club M (on the hill near  town; $75 to $120 double, half-pension) rivals the crusaders' castle as a local  focal point. It's a huge place, airy and beautiful, with individual cottages on  a hill leading down from the main building to the two pools and marina.  </P> <P> Two restaurants, a beach club, fresh and saltwater pools, Turkish baths, a  shopping arcade and casino. Meals are four-course affairs, or an open buffet of  continental and Turkish dishes.  </P> <P> On your own: Start with the 15th-Century Castle of St. Peter, built by the  Knights of St. John. The castle houses a museum that is worth the stop in  Bodrum: Mycenaean pottery and jewelry from the 14th Century, silver coins from  the 6th Century BC (coinage was started on this coast) and underwater relics  recovered from shipwrecks that occurred 1,000 years ago.  </P> <P> Bodrum is the Aegean Coast capital of boating, and the "blue journey" of  coastal cruising is a popular pastime. A short trek inland takes you to Milas,  where a cottage industry turns out fine Turkish carpets by hand.  </P> <P> Ruins hopping: Izmir has the only large airport with regular service on this  coast, so the logistics of getting from one remote town to another presents a  problem. A tour or cruise company can help you get more from your visit here,  particularly in understanding the history and archeology of southern Anatolia.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the Turkish Culture &amp; Information Attache at  (212) 687-2194, or write (821 United Nations Plaza, New York 10017) for a  brochure on Bodrum and other towns on the coast, plus a travel guide to Turkey  that includes hotel listings.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of the Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of revising the open meeting policy is to further the goal of providing meaningful opportunities for the public to be informed of NRC activities without unduly affecting open and candid discussions between licensees and the NRC staff or interfering with the NRC staff's ability to exercise its regulatory and safety responsibilities without undue administrative burden. The policy also provides guidance to the NRC staff concerning the types of meetings that should be open to public observation. The open meeting policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The open meeting policy excludes meetings where the expressed intent is not to discuss substantive issues that are directly associated with NRC's regulatory and safety responsibilities. Meetings that would not need to be open could include training, conferences, and association meetings where both NRC staff and applicant/licensee officials participate. The open meeting policy also excludes meetings or interviews between NRC staff and licensee staff or management personnel that occur during the performance of an NRC inspection. The policy also excludes meetings the NRC staff has with its own employees, contractors, and consultants, other Federal agencies where the matter does not relate to a specific activity for which NRC has oversight, and with representatives of foreign governments and State and local representatives on matters other than those relating to specific NRC licensing or regulatory actions involving individual NRC licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exemptions to the policy will permit meetings to be closed to ensure that classified, commercial or financial proprietary, safeguards, personal privacy, and investigative information protected by statute or otherwise requiring protection is not disclosed to the public. Other exemptions are provided to ensure that the NRC staff has sufficient flexibility to efficiently carry out its responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A meeting to discuss preliminary, unverified information is not an open meeting under the policy. The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that licensees and applicants are not inhibited in bringing to the Commission information that is not verified or sufficiently analyzed to draw firm conclusions. It also ensures that discussions about potential implications of this type of information occur candidly and openly without fear that it may be misunderstood by the public as fact or as final conclusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A meeting that is an information exchange having no direct, substantive connection to a specific NRC decision or action is not an open meeting under this policy. The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that routine administrative matters relating to regulatory activities can be carried out efficiently. For example, drop-in visits or similar management meetings between senior executives of a utility licensed to operate a nuclear power plant and the Executive Director for Operations, Regional Administrators, or other senior NRC managers are generally closed meetings because they typically consist of a general exchange of information not directly related to any regulatory action or decision. Furthermore, meetings to discuss schedules for NRC actions, or the status of an applicant's or licensee's activities would not be open under this exemption. Meetings between staff and licensees or trade groups to discuss technical issues or licensee performance would normally be open under this provision because they may lead to specific regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final exemption is for meetings where the administrative burden associated with public attendance could interfere with the NRC staff's efficient execution of its safety and regulatory responsibilities. This exemption ensures that the NRC staff has the discretion to have a needed meeting on short notice where adequate public notice cannot be provided without placing an undue burden on the agency. The meeting could be necessary because of an urgent issue that needs addressing or where the opportunity becomes available on short notice to meet with an official of the applicant or licensee that would benefit the NRC staff person in carrying out his or her duties. The meeting also might be in a location that does not have the facilities to easily accommodate the public, such as within a plant's protected area, because these meetings would require an undue administrative burden to establish access authorization for members of the public. For example, an NRC manager may visit a facility on short notice or without any notice for purposes other than meeting with licensee officials. These purposes may include but are not limited to monitoring and assessing the performance of NRC subordinates, touring the facility, or independently assessing licensee performance. During such a trip, he or she may visit licensee officials and may discuss substantive regulatory issues with them. Opening such a meeting to the public would constitute an undue administrative burden and could impede the efficient executions of the NRC's safety and regulatory responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public meeting notice system planned for providing public notice of all NRC staff meetings open to the public will have a toll-free telephone recording and a public-access electronic bulletin board for announcing meeting notice information. Open staff meetings will also be announced by a weekly press release as well as being posted in the agency's Public Document Room, as is the current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Commission Policy Statement on Staff Meetings Open to the Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This statement presents the policy that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will follow in opening meetings between the NRC staff and one or more outside persons to public observation. The policy continues NRC's longstanding practice of providing the public with the fullest information practicable on its activities and of conducting business in an open manner, while balancing the need for the NRC staff to exercise its regulatory and safety responsibilities without undue administrative burden. This policy also announces central agency services available to the public for obtaining schedules for the staff meetings that are open to public attendance. Implementing guidance will be issued to the NRC staff as a management directive. This meeting policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public meeting is a planned, formal encounter open to public observation between one or more NRC staff members and one or more outside persons physically present at a single meeting site, with the expressed intent of discussing substantive issues that are directly associated with the NRC's regulatory and safety responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An outside person is any individual who is not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> a. An NRC employee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Under contract to the NRC;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Acting in an official capacity as a consultant to the NRC;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Acting in an official capacity as a representative of an agency of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the U.S. Government (except when the agency is subject to NRC regulatory oversight);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

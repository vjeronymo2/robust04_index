			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / People: New finance director for Severn Trent Severn Trent has announced the appointment of Alan Costin as group finance director in succession to Stuart Larnder, who resigned without explanation last October. Costin, who joins the privatised water supply, sewage and waste management group next Monday, has been finance director of Lex Service, the car retailing and leasing group, since 1987. He joined Lex in 1970 and held a number of financial control positions in the UK and US, including finance director of Volvo Concessionaires. The abrupt departure of Larnder, who quit 'to pursue other interests', caused surprise within the water industry since it came less than six weeks before the group was due to present its half-year results, and John Bellak, Severn Trent chairman, declined to enlarge on the terse resignation statement. Costin, who is 49, at present lives in Buckinghamshire. ***** THE DESIGN MUSEUM is being very stoical these days, a suitable attitude in the light of its recent funding troubles. It thus seems entirely appropriate that it has appointed a philosopher, Paul Thompson, 32, as its new director. Thompson has jumped a rung, from the post of curator, and is joined at the helm by John Hendry, 35, who will continue as administrative director. The museum has thereby tacitly recognised the need to have two people taking on the difficult roles of both financial administration and management and programming of the Museum's galleries - functions previously performed by its previous director, Helen Rees. Thompson studied first at Bristol University, then moved to the University of East Anglia to complete an MA, then a PhD on the origins of the modern movement, focusing on the American philosopher William James. The museum now has an operating budget of Pounds 1m for 1992, which given a determination to match expenditure to income, should be enough to see it through to better - and richer - days.</p>

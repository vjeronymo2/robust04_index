			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (9): Metamorphosis in progress - Australia Like so much of Australian industry, the telecommunications sector is in a state of upheaval as it moves from a regulated, government-controlled environment, into the world of competition and free-market economics. Five years ago, the industry was made up of three principal entities, all wholly-owned by the federal government. First, there was the Australian Telecommunications Commission, or in popular parlance, Telecom, which provided the nation's domestic telecommunications services. Then there was the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, or OTC, which provided international telecommunications services. Finally, there was the loss-making Aussat, which was responsible for the country's domestic satellite communications system. Aussat had been set up as a space-based competitor to Telecom but, for a variety of reasons - including inadequate funding and regulatory restrictions - had effectively failed in its task. Today, the industry's structure has changed radically - although it will be another three and a half years before the metamorphosis is complete. Telecom and the OTC were merged in February 1992, and last year adopted the new legal name of Telstra Corporation. The organisation still trades as Telecom in its domestic market, but uses the Telstra tag overseas. At present, Telstra remains wholly-owned by the federal government, and the notion of a wholesale privatisation of the organisation is politically contentious. Both Australia's powerful union movement and the Labor Party caucus have been strongly opposed to this and in the run-up to the 1993 general election, Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, formally pledged that Labor would retain Telecom as a publicly-owned enterprise, if re-elected. However, under its American chief executive, Frank Blount, Telstra does seems to be nudging its way towards the private sector, and most commentators believe that some private sector involvement is inevitable in the medium to longer term. There has been talk more recently of floating off parts of the business - say, some of its international interests or its fledgling cable operation - or bringing in joint venture partners on a limited basis. Such schemes would help to fund expansion, it argued, without draining public funds. Meanwhile, Optus was licensed as the second telecommunications carrier in early 1992, providing Australian consumers with a rival carrier to Telstra. Optus is owned by a consortium of international interests. These include Britain's Cable and Wireless, which holds a 24.5 per cent interest in Optus: BellSouth of the US, with a similar percentage, Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport company, with 20 per cent, and a number of leading Australian institutional investors. Despite the UK-US involvement, however, the Australian interests have always held a majority of the company's shares. Aussat, meanwhile, was sold to Optus for ADollars 800m - of which ADollars 500m was paid up front with the remainder coming in instalment payment starting at end-1994 - and effectively becomes a division within the new group. Optus began its life by competing against Telecom in the cellular telephone market, but by December 1992, had expanded into long-distance services. In 1993, a series of high-profile ballots took place in Australia, giving customers a well-publicised opportunity to switch carriers. Although response rates varied between different cities, Optus saw a very encouraging reception in some cities - picking up a fifth of the Sydney market, for example. At present, then, Australia operates a duopoly. This, however, is meant to be an interim arrangement only, and the government's declared aim is to introduce full network competition by mid-1997. Optus, which began life by leasing existing network capacity from Telecom for about 90 per cent of its traffic, is expected to be 90 per cent independent by this stage. The company has talked of a ADollars 4bn investment plan, to make its long-distance service accessible to all Australians, and to bring its cellular services to a large portion of the population. Finally, the most recent development on the deregulation front has been the opening of the mobile telephone market to a third carrier - Vodafone of the UK. The company began to offer digital mobile telephone services in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra last October, and is expected to extend its network to accommodate about 85 per cent of the population by 1996. Vodafone's entry was timely. Telecom and Optus had snared around 750,000 mobile phone customers on their analogue networks, but this system was close to saturation. (It is due to be phased out by 2000). The two domestic rivals had introduced digital services earlier in the year, ahead of Vodafone's arrival, but acceptance of the new system had been slow. Vodafone's aggressive entry was seen as a welcome boost to the flagging digital market. More broadly, there is little doubt that growth in the Australian telecommunications market is coming on the international side. International traffic expanded by around 70 per cent between 1988/89 and 1991/2, whle domestic traffic rose only 20 per cent in the same period, according to a Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report last year. The same report suggests that, assuming 'only modest growth in the world's major economies', international traffic to and from Australia should continue to grow at around 15-20 per cent annually in the years ahead.</p>

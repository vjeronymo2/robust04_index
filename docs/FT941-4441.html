			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / N Sea costs set to fall by up to 30% Operating costs of oil companies working in the UK sector of the North Sea could fall by between 15 per cent and 30 per cent over the next six years, according to a study published yesterday by consultants Arthur Andersen. The report said cost-cutting initiatives undertaken by North Sea operators will cushion the impact on profits of low oil prices, although gross revenues from North Sea production would be badly hit if prices are persistently weak. The report, which looks at the impact of low oil prices on revenues and profits, is based on an average real price of oil of Dollars 13 a barrel over the next 32 years. Under those conditions, revenue per barrel of oil equivalent - which includes natural gas - would drop by 24 per cent compared with an earlier study based on real oil prices of Dollars 18 a barrel. But net profits per barrel would fall by only 12 per cent. The expected resilience of profits is attributed to the industry's emphasis on reducing costs by using new technology which requires fewer offshore staff.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Lloyd's leadership faced with challenge over business plan LLOYD'S leadership faced a fresh challenge yesterday from rebel members of the insurance market who won the first stage in a battle to overhaul its new business plan. An extraordinary general meeting of the market agreed to ballot Names - the wealthy individuals whose capital underwrites the market - on a resolution demanding a vote on changes to the plan. Rebel Names drew up the resolution demanding that the plan, designed to revitalise Lloyd's after recent heavy losses, should receive two-thirds support in order to be implemented. It also seeks compensation for Names who have suffered financial hardship. Under the plan, announced two months ago, market costs would be cut and Lloyd's would be opened to corporate as well as individual Names to attract capital, possibly under conditions of limited liability. The rebels fear this could put existing Names, who have unlimited liability, at a severe disadvantage. A second resolution, proposed by Mr Claud Gurney, leader of the rebel faction, calls on the leadership to accept a 'duty of care'. If accepted, this could give extra impetus to attempts by Names to sue their agents and Lloyd's leadership for alleged mismanagement. The Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest Names organisation, yesterday submitted a third resolution, calling on Names to back the leadership and its business plan. The result of the postal ballot on the resolutions, open to all Names, is expected on August 10. An attempt by rebel Names to seek an overhaul of Lloyd's council through a postal ballot last year, the first such ballot held at Lloyd's, failed because it did not win the necessary 50 per cent support of those voting. Lloyd's leadership could take some comfort from the fact that yesterday's extraordinary general meeting, though occasionally heated, was attended by only about 600 external members. This compared with about 2,500 who turned up for an extraordinary general meeting ahead of last year's postal ballot. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said he welcomed fresh input into the business plan, but stressed the leadership needed members' support. 'We don't have time. We need to get on with the job,' he said. Mr Gurney said he was confident the resolutions would be passed after a year of mounting losses that left growing numbers of Names joining action groups.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Soul's little madam LISA Stansfield is in danger of turning into a proper little madam. When last seen, a couple of years ago, this fantasy figure who made an ass of pure reason by coming from nowhere - well, Rochdale actually - to top the US soul charts, retained a Lancashire lass charm. With her cap worn the wrong round and a tendency to skip around the stage like a mixed infant allowed home early, she undermined the critical faculties with the same ease as Our Gracie. Now, at Wembley, millions of record sales later, she lies astride a packing case stroking her body meaningfully and nibbling her hand mike with all the subtlety of Ruby Wax as she purrs 'Time to make you mine'. Lisa seems destined to join Olivia Newton-John and Sheena Easton as a nut-brown Hollywood Queen, dragging herself away from the pool to do Vegas. Fortunately she still gives a northern stretch to the 'a' as she tells us we are free to 'dance', but it took two pointed reminders before the Wembley crowd staggered to its feet to boogie modestly. To the nation's loss, Lisa Stansfield has been transformed into a soul superstar with a packaged show of faceless musicians. At the start the packaging was too constricting. Bass and percussion were winning over a voice which is still packed with power but bereft of sensitivity. Gradually things fell into shape, especially on the slower numbers, but there was plenty of time to think about her outfit - initially frock coat over black stockings, then hot pants and Rochdale Hornet yellow and black striped blouse - and her appearance (a forties perm and shiney make-up) rather than to be transported away on that old soul train. The old hits - 'All around the world'; 'This is the right time' - were kept for the end, but by then I was nostalgic for the pert 24-year-old who was still so in love with music, and her own voice, that she could try out Billie Holiday's haunting 'Good Morning Heartbreak' in the middle of her set. This 26-year-old is in danger of falling into that strange irony whereby soul singers inevitably pervert the emotional intensity that is the source of soul music into a mechanical, beat dominated, superficiality of showmanship.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by BIZNES-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 May -- The total deposits by the  population in Russia's Saving's Bank as of 1 March this year  amounted to about 4.7 trillion rubles [R] and the average size  of each deposit was over R20,000. The BIZNES-TASS correspondent  was informed of this in the Ministry of the Economy of the  Russian Federation. However, the proportion which this money  represents in the total amount of the population's deposits in  Russian banks is declining, and today comprises about 60 percent.    In the first quarter of 1994 the monetary incomes of the  population of Russia were 8.8 times greater than the level in  the first quarter of last year and amounted to R53.8 trillion.  In comparable prices this amount corresponds to 60 percent of  the monetary incomes of the population of Russia in the first  quarter of 1991.    The population spent R37.5bn (69.8 percent) of the total on  consumption -- buying goods and services. This is 5.9 percent  less than in the same period last year. The proportion of  expenditure on acquiring foreign currency increased more than  six-fold to 11.6 percent.    In the opinion of experts of the Ministry of Economy, this  shows that a stratum of the population has been formed which has  a very high and constantly increasing level of income. If one  excludes from the population's total income the expenditure on  acquiring foreign currency, it turns out that the monetary  incomes of the overwhelming majority of the population in the  first quarter of 1994 were 7.9 times greater than in the first  quarter of last year. However, because of inflation the real  incomes showed virtually no increase.</p>

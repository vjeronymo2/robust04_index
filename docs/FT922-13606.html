			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Walesa in clash with defence minister POLAND'S first civilian defence minister yesterday offered to resign, bringing to a head a power tussle between President Lech Walesa and the government over who controls the 300,000-strong armed forces. Mr Jan Parys, who became minister in January, has been sent on two weeks' holiday in an attempt by Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, to defuse the row. This followed an accusation by Mr Parys of recent attempts 'to overthrow democracy with the aid of the army'. He was referring to meetings between members of President Walesa's staff and senior army officers at which the officers were told that Mr Parys was likely to be dismissed and were promised promotion once this had happened. The Polish president yesterday said he had asked Mr Olszewski to dismiss Mr Parys about 10 days ago. At the same time, he confirmed a report that his staff were working on contingency plans to impose martial law. He described the plans as 'routine' and said 'the president must have lots of solutions at his disposal but he doesn't have to resort to them'. The increasing mistrust between Mr Walesa and Mr Parys arises out of a lack of clarity in Poland's constitution over who controls the armed forces. It is a highly sensitive issue in a country where the last attempt at parliamentary democracy was curtailed by an army coup in 1926. Under the 1989 constitution - tailored to suit communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski - special responsibility for foreign policy, defence and internal affairs lies with the president. However the relevant ministers are cabinet members and answerable to the prime minister. Since his appointment, Mr Parys, 41, has moved quickly to exert control over the army, retiring his predecessor, Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk, whom Mr Walesa wanted as commander of the armed forces. He also removed several senior officers who had Warsaw Pact connections, but with whom Mr Walesa was happy. In addition, he made new appointments without consulting the president. Mr Walesa said yesterday he had had too many conflicts with Mr Parys. Mr Olszewski is trying to avoid becoming embroiled in the dispute. But if accepts Mr Parys' resignation, it will have to be referred to parliament, opening the rift between Mr Walesa and Mr Olszewski's minister to full political scrutiny.</p>

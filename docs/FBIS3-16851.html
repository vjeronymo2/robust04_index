			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata criticized North Korea on Sunday over its suspected  nuclear arms development plan, saying Pyongyang is taking a  stubborn attitude.    Hata, speaking to reporters in Moscow, said North Korea's  tough attitude led to the breakdown of the eighth round of  working-level inter-Korean talks Saturday.    "It is regrettable that the (dialogue) broke down because of  North Korea's stubborn attitude," he said.    The foreign minister, who is on a four-day visit to Russia  starting Saturday, urged North Korea to respond to serious  concern among the international community about its nuclear  development program. He also asked Pyongyang to hold sincere  talks with South Korea.    On Saturday, delegates of North and South Korea met in the  truce village of Panmunjom for 55 minutes to discuss procedures  for an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys between Seoul and  Pyongyang. But the session produced little progress, failing  even to set a date for the next round. The talks collapsed with  North Korean negotiators walking away from the dialogue table,  south officials said.</p>

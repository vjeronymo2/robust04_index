			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Finale on Omaha for D-Day ceremonies: Community of nations is recalled on Normandy beach Veterans and international leaders gathered yesterday on Omaha Beach, the most notorious of the five Normandy landing points because of heavy US casualties, for the closing ceremony of the D-Day commemorations. Recalling the community of nations which banded together to fight Nazism 50 years ago, and that has since embraced democratic Germany, the wartime allies reviewed troops, bands, aircraft and ships from 14 countries that fought the Nazis. The overall message which the leaders gathered in France sought to convey yesterday was that from the anti-Nazi struggle of 50 years ago came the postwar international co-operation that must be continued to combat present and future conflicts. President Bill Clinton told the US Rangers, who had scaled the Pointe du Hoc cliff above Omaha, there are 'still cliffs to be scaled' by the world's democracies which must maintain strong alliances. Mr Clinton went on to tell the Ranger veterans that 'if we should falter, we need only remember you at this spot 50 years ago, and you again at this spot today'. The tale of the D-Day preparations was recounted in two ways - first in the homespun words of Mr Walter Ehlers, who won America's medal of honour and lost his brother on June 6 1944. Then President Francois Mitterrand, himself for a time a prisoner of war in Germany, in polished rhetoric saluted all the veterans 'come to rejoin their past, which is our future'. The French president also saluted the heroism of the Russian people, who pinned down 150 German divisions, the French resistance which helped pave the way for D-Day and Hitler's opponents inside Germany 'who remained true . . . to the Germany of their dreams, home of the highest culture'. Meanwhile, in a newspaper interview yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl denied he had ever solicited an invitation to the D-Day ceremonies, and said: 'I understand very well why the allies are commemorating this occasion, so significant for Europe and for their sacrifices.' Chancellor Kohl, in a meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, later underlined forcefully the continuing commitment of Germany to the process of European integration. Britain commemorated its dead at the Bayeux cemetery in morning drizzle and then its veterans at Arromanches in afternoon sun. The ceremony was attended by President Mitterrand, Australian prime minister Paul Keating and other leaders including the Grand Duke of Luxembourg who served in the Irish Guards to free his country from the Third Reich. Later, the Queen and Prince Philip walked among the graves of the 3,935 British dead and the memorial to 1,808 unknown dead of the Commonwealth. At Arromanches, the Queen said the presence of Mrs Simone Veil, a senior French minister who as a young Jewish girl was in Auschwitz, 'represents perfectly why we are here today'. Mr Clinton, who has been criticised for not serving in the Vietnam war, paid eloquent tributes to fallen US soldiers and survivors. But at Utah Beach, where US forces had also landed, veterans booed when they were told that tardiness on the part of President Mitterrand had delayed Mr Clinton.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] has held a  telephone contact with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher during which he called on the United States to  effecitvely intervene to render the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations a success. He explained that we are at the  threshold of being committed to the implementation of total  Israeli withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip on  13 April.    The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, mentioned that brother  leader Abu-'Ammar has also called for expediting the  implementation of international resolution No. 904 on the  protection of our Palestinian people. WAFA said brother leader  Abu-'Ammar said he believes any delay in the implementation of  the pledges and the timetable will negatively affect the entire  peace process, harm it, and cause it to lose its credibility.    WAFA also pointed out that during the telephone contact, the  two sides discussed the deteriorating situation in the occupied  Palestinian territories and the developments that have been  taking place since the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and  how these developments have harmed the entire peace process and  the negotiations.</p>

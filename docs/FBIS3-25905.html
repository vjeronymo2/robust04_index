The General Staff Headquarters pointed out that our army  building was being carried out in a new historical period. The  development and changes of the general environment of the  society and the mission of military struggle of our armed forces  in the new period had provided new opportunities and conditions  for doing a good job in troop management and had, at the same  time, set higher new demands.

Strengthening and  improving troop management has a bearing on the comprehensive  work of army building in all aspects and is the common  responsibility of party committees, leadership, and organs at  all levels. It is necessary to earnestly strengthen leadership;  pool the strength of all sectors; do solid work; keep abreast of  new situations; explore new measures; ensure strict discipline,  good work style, normal order, security and stability in the  armed forces,;and strive to increase the cohesive force and  enhance the combat capacity of the armed forces.

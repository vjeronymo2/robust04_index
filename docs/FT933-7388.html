			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Building society lending slips back  -At a glance LENDING for new mortgages remains uneven, according to figures released by the Building Societies Association this week. Net new commitments fell to Pounds 2.9bn in July reversing a rise the previous month. In July last year, net new commitments were higher at Pounds 3.4bn but buyers were then rushing to beat the August deadline reimposing stamp duty on house purchases up to Pounds 250,000. Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA said he expected levels of lending activity to be broadly maintained over the coming months. On the savings side, building societies suffered a net outflow of funds in July as people withdrew money to pay for holidays, L-registration cars and BT3 shares. The net outflow of Pounds 61m followed an outflow of Pounds 56m in June.</p>

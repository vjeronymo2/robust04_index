			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysian affair - insensitivity and mistaken beliefs (4) Sir, The continuing furore about the Pergau Dam still comes from the original misunderstanding of where the money for the project came from. The Malaysians do not know that the UK has specific guidelines and rules which govern our Overseas Development Administration budget, and that the question of whether these monies should have been used for Pergau is what has caused so much upset. If Sir Tim Lankester, as head of the ODA, advised Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, not to fund a dam which he said would not be of benefit to the poor and would be an abuse of ODA funds, then it was , in my opinion, time to refer the project to the Department of Trade and Industry and allow the tiny, frozen Pounds 1.8bn aid budget to be used more for the use of uplifting the poorest people in the poorest countries. If we untie aid and trade, then there will be no more Pergau dams from a small department which can then get on more effectively with its genuine raison d'etre.

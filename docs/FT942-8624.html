			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Aker pays NKr1.1bn for 27% holding in Partek Aker, the Norwegian building materials and oil and gas technology group, has paid NKr1.1bn (Dollars 152.2m) to acquire 27 per cent of Partek, the Finnish building materials, minerals and load-handling equipment company. The move is the latest step towards a far-reaching restructuring of the Nordic building materials industry aimed at creating a business grouping that can stand up to increasing competition and expand internationally. The grouping, based around the Swedish Euroc group, has annual sales of more than NKr25bn and a market value of NKr10bn, making it Europe's fifth largest cement and building materials group. Partek acquired 25 per cent of Euroc last year. Finland's influential Bjoerneberg and Rettig families disposed of their Partek stakes at FM89.50 a share. With Partek shares trading at FM70 a share before the deal was announced, Aker has paid a premium of almost 30 per cent to become the Finnish group's biggest shareholder. Finland's Aabo Akademi Foundation holds 11 per cent of Partek, while Sampo and Varma, two Finnish insurance groups, hold 9.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively. Yesterday's deal gives Aker, together with the three other major shareholders, control of 52.2 per cent of Partek and considerable influence over Euroc. In 1993 Aker's pre-tax profit was NKr851m on sales of NKr18.14bn. Partek suffered a pre-tax loss of FM433.9m (Dollars 79.7m) on sales of FM6.61bn. Euroc's pre-tax profit was SKr375.5m (Dollars 48.5m) on turnover of SKr19.57bn.</p>

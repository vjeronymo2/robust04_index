			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Westpac - Other Companies Analysts expect profits of around ADollars 700m (Dollars 538m) when Westpac reports its September year-ends on Tuesday. They also predict around a 10 cent final dividend, giving shareholders a total of around 18 cents for the year, compared with 12 cents last year. The results are being viewed as a test of the managerial skills of Mr Bob Joss, installed as Westpac's managing director in January 1993. At that time the bank was beset by problems in its loan portfolio and reported a ADollars 1.5bn net loss for 1991/2.</p>

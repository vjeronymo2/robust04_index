			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN CHARGED WITH CRUELTY TO ANIMALS  </P> <P> Two men who authorities said were operating an illegal rodeo in Saugus were  charged Monday with felony cruelty to animals, the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office said.  </P> <P> Jose Aranda, 33, who operated the rodeo on Sundays at a ranch in San  Francisquito Canyon, and Aucencio Guerrero, 38, a caretaker at the ranch, were  charged with one count of animal cruelty, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela  Davis-Springer.  </P> <P> The rodeo was closed by sheriff's deputies July 23 after they discovered it  while investigating complaints about cars parked in the area, officials said.  About 200 participants and spectators were dispersed by deputies. Neighbors  said the Mexican-style rodeo had been taking place at the ranch on Sundays for  about a year.  </P> <P> Aranda was cited for violating county codes by operating the rodeo without  proper permits. County animal control officers also conducted an investigation  after deputies noticed that several horses used in the rodeo had open wounds.  </P> <P> "The wounds were consistent with abuse," Davis-Springer said. She said the  horses had untended wounds on their mouths, backs and sides.  </P> <P> Aranda and Guerrero are scheduled to be arraigned today in Newhall Municipal  Court. If convicted, each man could face up to three years in prison,  Davis-Springer said.  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (11): Goldman gets ready to harvest Spanish profits / Merchant banks As European economies begin to recover and as governments across the continent launch privatisation programmes, US investment banks are ready to make strong Euro-related profits. In Spain, 1994 already appears to belong to Goldman Sachs for it has picked up most of the big domestic business that was available in the first quarter of this year. 'It has the best people working the Spanish patch,' says a senior executive of a European merchant bank. 'They are clever and they eat, sleep and dream Goldman.' A review of the New York bank's progress suggests that its Spanish team will not have space on its shelves to accommodate the tombstones it is accumulating. Success has inevitably bred criticism and envy. Goldman's Spanish team is accused of being, on occasions, too aggressive in its pricing. European rivals also say Goldman is benefitting from an unhealthy fascination for all things American in investment banking. There have been deals initiated by others that Goldman joined once they were under way. 'They have a technique of wriggling their way into a business,' says a domestic banker. The weight attached to US banks may be unwarranted on a domestic level - Spanish banks, with their huge retail networks, are capable of delivering an impressive book - but it is justified by the growing trend in Spain towards international offerings dominated by a US tranche. In Spain Goldman has a track record with government-controlled companies thanks to a trail-blazing 1987 listing in New York that it co-ordinated for Telefonica, the telecommunications monopoly, and now it is making its mark on the private sector. In February Goldman Sachs acted as global co-ordinator to Fomento de Contrucciones y Contratas (FCC), a leading and highly diversified construction company that made a Dollars 350m equity offering, one of the largest to date by a private domestic group. The initial groundwork for the FCC offering had been conducted by Schroders and when Goldman took on the global co-ordinator mandate the New York bank was accused of aggressively pricing the construction group and blamed for the offering's disappointing results outside Spain. There were similar fears over pricing when Goldman worked its way on to an April Dollars 280m equity offering by Continente, a hypermarket chain controlled by France's Promodes group. The offering was co-ordinated by Societe Generale and Continente brought Goldman on to the team as co-lead manager in order to consolidate the US book. Goldman rejects the aggressive pricing criticism (FCC's share price has since recovered to the levels that Goldman had set) and points to the fast-growing Cortefiel retail clothing group as an example of its increasing ability to manage smaller offerings for the private sector. Cortefiel, in which Goldman Sachs has a small shareholding, has hired the US bank to co-ordinate its long-awaited equity offering within the next six months. The Cortefiel placement could net a comparatively modest Dollars 88m but it should lead to business with similar family-controlled domestic groups in the retail fashion business. Like other investment banks, Goldman has its eyes on Inditex, a group which owns a highly successful youth orientated high street chain called Zara. Goldman meanwhile remains strong in its more familiar territory of large offerings by public groups. Last month the New York bank co-ordinated a global offering worth Dollars 1.3bn by Endesa, the large state-controlled electrical utility. Goldman had already guided Endesa on to the markets in its 1989 partial privatisation and prior to May's equity offering, it had advised the utility on close to Dollars 1bn worth of asset purchases from regional and small Spanish generators. Goldman is now hoping to take on the year's other big public equity deal, the Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 2.2bn offering by the Repsol oil and chemical group. Repsol, like Endesa, is a longstanding client of the New York bank. Goldman helped to take the oil group to the markets in 1988 in its first encounter with foreign institutions and it was its global co-ordinator in a second major Repsol international offering last year. Goldman was also on familiar territory when in late April it advised Pedro Domecq, the Spanish-Mexican drinks group, on its Dollars 1.1bn sell out to the UK's Allied Lyons. The previous big drinks sector disposal in Spain, the 1990 takeover by Guinness of the domestic Cruzcampo beer group, also had Goldman advising the Spanish seller. Together with the traditional business, at least one interesting innovation has taken place. Earlier this year Goldman arranged Dollars 132m worth of financing for a Barcelona city council hydraulic services company that is branching into water treatment. Finessing a loan structure that has been practised in the US and was being introduced for the first time in Europe, the New York bank guaranteed the financing with the future water cannon that the company will impose on Barcelona consumers. Why is Goldman so far ahead in Spain? One reason is that it entered forcibly in the late 1980s when government-controlled groups started tapping the markets. Its Wall Street listing for Telefonica attracted solid clients such as Repsol and Endesa. These relationships, with its analysis and distribution muscle and follow-up expertise have served Goldman extremely well. 'Very few big deals are decided on fees,' says a senior member of the US bank's Spanish team. The existance of well established clients in what is essentially a recurring business is, however, only part of the answer. Goldman, at least in Spain, has provided continuity by keeping the same close-knit team working together for more than five years. It has also invested strongly in a 'door-opener' in the shape of former junior economy minister Mr Guillermo de la Dehesa, the chief executive of Banco Pastor, who also serves on Goldman's advisory board. A rival US bank, worried that it was slipping in Spain, recently sent one of its most experienced officers to Madrid with the mission of 'finding a de la Dehesa'.</p>

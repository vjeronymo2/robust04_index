			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a report on the attack and liberation of  Boeng Trakuon and its vicinity:    1. Boeng Trakuon, also called Banteay Mean Rit, is an  important area from which UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia], the United States, and an alliance used artillery  pieces and tanks to attack Phnum Prak hill in the Phnum Chhat  area in August 1993.    2. After the attack, the two-headed government, the United  States, the alliance, and the communist Vietnamese assigned the  8th division of U.S.-backed puppet Dien Del [former chief of  staff of the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces] to  join the 7th and 8th divisions of the communist Vietnamese  puppets.    3. The 7th, 8th, and 12th divisions joined the communist  Vietnamese puppets' troops to attack the Malai and Pailin  regions. [sentence as heard] In February and March 1994, the  United States provided the Dien Del forces with more than 1,000  tonnes of armaments and ammunition bought from the communist  Vietnamese and Russia.    4. After clearly grasping the situation, the people and  National Army of Democratic Kampuchea mustered forces to attack  the warmongering troops and destroyers of the nation at Boeng  Trakuon called Banteay Mean Rit, the biggest base of Dien Del.    On the night between 20 and 21 April, the people and NADK  attacked and completely liberated Boeng Takuon and its vicinity.  The area, which is a major base of U.S.-backed puppets Dien Del  and Pan Thai, was totally destroyed. In the wake of the attack,  the people in the area raised their hands praying and said:  Down with the notorious border bandits, Down with the great  assassins. As for parasoldiers [of the Khmer People's National  Liberation Armed Forces], they also shouted: Down with great  border bandits Dien Del and Pan Thai, who plunder the people's  cattle and send them across the border.</p>

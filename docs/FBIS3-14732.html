			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 25 Feb -- Armenia should ratify the treaty  concluded with Russia in 1992 on the legal status of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces on the territory of the republic, says a  statement by the republican leadership of the Ramkavar-Azatakan  Party of Armenia [name as received], published here today. The  statement by this liberal democratic party says that the Russian  Parliament ratified this document exactly a year ago, but  meanwhile, it has not yet been examined by the Supreme Council  of Armenia.    Stressing the importance of Armenian-Russian mutual  relations, the leadership of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party of  Armenia expresses anxiety regarding the Armenian Supreme  Council's delay in ratifying the treaty. The party's faction in  the Supreme Council of Armenia will seek to have this issue  included in the republican Supreme Council's agenda, the  statement says.    The treaty was signed in Moscow on 21 August 1992 by Russian  and Armenian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Levon Ter-Petrosyan.  It settles questions pertaining to the presence on Armenian  territory of units and formations of Russian Armed Forces.</p>

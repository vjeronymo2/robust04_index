Korotkov, Department of </F> MathematicalPhysics; UDC 517.958:[535+537.812]    [Abstract] A problem of determining the real  characteristicsof the Earth's surface from its radar image,  obtained by a radarwith a synthesized aperture is examined in  this article. Theradar located on an aircraft moving in a  straight line at aconstant elevation scans a section of the  Earth surface in aprojection mode, where the transmitting and  the receiving antennas are continuously directed to this  section. The transmitting antenna radiates a probing signal,  consisting of two electromagnetic waves with a parallel and  perpendicular polarization; the receiving antenna records a  signal, which is a combination of two waves generated by  scattering of the probing signal by the Earth's surface. The  problem consists of finding the scattering coefficient from the  known radiating and received signals. With this information the  Fourier form of the f(x,y)projection and the projection itselves  can be determined, butonly for a narrow angular section. In  order to reconstruct thef(x,y) function for the entire region, a  method is developed fordetermining the scattering coefficient as  a function of the characteristic of the Earth surface with a  radar, making it possible to compute the desired coefficient  using the data from apartial angular section, applying effective  algorithms.

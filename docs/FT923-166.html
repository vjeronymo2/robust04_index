			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Output shows steep monthly fall JAPANESE industry is facing its stiffest test since the deep recession of the mid-1970s, according to official figures yesterday showing industrial production last month was 7.6 per cent lower than a year ago. It was the 11th successive month in which output was down, the longest series of falls since the 20-month run of declines between May 1974 and December 1975. Production was down 3.7 per cent on July, the largest monthly fall since January 1975. Government economic policymakers argue that backward-looking indicators such as industrial production paint too depressed a picture. They stress more attention should be paid to forward-looking indicators, in the wake of the boost to business confidence delivered by the announcement in August of a Y10,700bn (Pounds 52bn) emergency spending package. Hopes that the economy will be buoyed this autumn by a resurgence in business confidence was lent support yesterday by a marked improvement in official indicators used to forecast economic activity three and six months ahead. The Economic Planning Agency said its leading indicators of economic activity leapt to 70 per cent in July, from 46 per cent the month before, one of the steepest monthly rises recorded. It was the first time for almost two years that the leading indicators have risen above 50 per cent, which is interpreted as the dividing line between growth and decline. However, EPA officials said the leading indicators combined with indicators of current and past economic performance still showed the economy in a slowdown. The leading indicators would need to stay above 50 per cent for three months before there could be any confidence that an upturn was on the way. The collapse of demand was highlighted by the continued rise in industrial inventories in August. Shipments were 6.8 per cent down on the year before and so inventories rose by 4.3 per cent. The ratio of inventories to sales was 10.6 per cent up on the year before. The continued rise in inventories, despite deep and sustained cuts in production, makes it increasingly likely that industry will have to start cutting into labour costs through early retirement and freezes on recruitment.</p>

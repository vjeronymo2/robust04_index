			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech National Bank Governor Josef Tosovsky </F> by Martin Frydl; place and date not given: "There Are More Banks  in the Czech Republic Than Is Healthy"]    [Text] [Frydl] Sir, what was the Czech National Bank's  greatest success and failure in 1993, in your view?    [Tosovsky] The relatively stable purchasing power of our  currency is the central bank's good result, and so is the  creation of the new currency. In less than 10 months, we have  completely replaced all of the currency in circulation. Greatest  failure? Maybe the problems in the banking system. Specifically,  problems in some smaller commercial banks that still do not have  the skills to be able to evaluate risks cautiously.    [Frydl] In its projects up to 2000, the government foresees  the growth of the GDP by 3.5 percent a year. According to some  experts, this is too little to catch up with developed  countries. Will it be necessary to "fuel" the Czech economy, now  or in the future, by incurring a reasonable amount of deficits,  for example?    [Tosovsky] This cannot be ruled out. At present, however, I  would not evaluate the economic development by looking at one  figure, albeit an important figure, such as the growth of the  GDP. Our economy is undergoing principal transformation today.  We are witnessing a decline in output, mainly in the primary  sector, and growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Large  enterprises are gradually giving up activities that have no  prospects. These giants are undergoing a reduction diet. Look at  the numbers of employees. Tens of thousands of people have left  the industry and agriculture sectors and began working in  services, trade, and private enterprises. Many people began  working in banks. GNP growth is around zero, or slightly under  zero this year. This represents the same sum of values as last  year, or slightly less, but the quality of products and services  is substantially different.    [Frydl] What would a budget deficit do to the economy, and  when would it be possible to take such a step?    [Tosovsky] Budget deficits provide a possibility to  stimulate  demand in the economy and give the supplying side the  opportunity to develop. Depending on the type of spending,  deficits may have a multiplicative effect, however. In our  current conditions, it would not be a step in the correct  direction. Most likely it would have an impact on the price  index and the growth of inflation. We do not believe that there  is little liquidity or shortage of cash in the economy. A  certain surplus has been caused by the influx of foreign capital  in recent months. Aggregate demand is quite sufficient, but its  weight is in private consumption rather than in investments. We  would like to see more investments.    [Frydl] It seems that, instead of direct investments,  portfolio investments are being preferred. Does such foreign  capital bring what we need--that is, technology, markets, etc.?    [Tosovsky] We are not monitoring the utilization of foreign  capital, only overall figures. It ensues from these figures that  direct investments are actually declining. In previous periods,  every year there were large projects, such as the  Skoda-Volkswagen, or Philip Morris this spring. Such cases do  not happen anymore, which has reduced the amount of direct  investments. However, the number of investors has not declined.  Direct credits from abroad--that is, credits from a foreign bank  directly to our enterprises--are growing strongly. Very often  our enterprise has a partner abroad, possibly a buyer of its  goods, who provides guarantees to the bank, and the credit can  be granted that way. Our entrepreneur is on his own; he does not  have to establish a joint venture, but he accepts credits  instead. For the money he receives, he buys new machines and  improves his ability to export. The fact is that overall imports  are growing, and machines and equipment, bought either directly  or on lease, are a very important item in imports. According to  an estimate, the portfolio investments--that is, the purchase of  securities--reached between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000. This  is only the beginning.    [Frydl] The stability of the portfolio investments is a  problem, however. Are you not afraid of the movement of capital  on our market while there is low liquidity? Does the money  flowing to our country represent really well-considered and  long-term investments, or is it "money adventurers" who are  investing here?    [Tosovsky] Small and large investors have shown an interest.  Recently, we noticed the interest of larger  investors--institutional investors--such as pension funds and  similar institutions. Of course, large sums can be moved quickly  like that. However, the liquidity on our capital market is high  enough not to pose a substantial danger.    [Frydl] Do you agree with the opinion that banks should  initiate bankruptcies? If the banks initiated bankruptcies, what  effect would ait have on the economic situation of the banks?    [Tosovsky] Bankruptcies in the neighboring countries,  particularly in Hungary, are essentially solutions to some  problems of the past. We have already dealt with these problems  in a certain way. We have balanced the bank's accounts, written  off the debt of certain enterprises, established the  Consolidation Bank, and provided new capital to commercial  banks. That is, we have already worked on the old debt problem;  therefore, we do not have to initiate bankruptcies on such a  scale as elsewhere. It is not necessary to throw away the names  of the companies that still have a good reputation, or  traditions that still have some value. Of course, the banks are  considering every individual case and behave in such a manner so  as not to cause damage to themselves. According to information  provided to us, some bankruptcy proceedings have been launched,  but the courts' capacity is insufficient.    [Frydl] What are the Czech National Bank's monetary goals  this year?    [Tosovsky] Our principal objective is to keep control over  the price development. We want to keep the inflation rate under  10 percent. The government will take more deregulating steps  this year and will increase certain prices, those that are still  in the government's jurisdiction. This should increase the price  index by some 2 percent next year. We are anticipating a monthly  price growth of 0.5 percent. However, there are more factors  influencing prices--wages, the state budget, just to mention the  most important ones. To apply our monetary policy with the aim  of lowering the interest rates is another main objective. We are  getting prepared for the koruna's full convertibility, and we  want to make our interest rates commensurate with those abroad.  We cannot have the convertible koruna and interest rates several  points higher than in the neighboring countries. Our goal will  be to cut the interest rates, particularly interest on credit.    [Frydl] What should the money supply and the credit  expansion  look like this year?    [Tosovsky] The applicable figures have been published. We  are  anticipating an increase in money supply of 12-15 percent,  approximately 10 percent inflation, and 2 percent growth of the  GDP. In the beginning, we will be achieving the lower numbers.  The monetary policy will be neutral. We still have a certain  capacity for slight expansion.    [Frydl] Can you tell your opinion on cooperation between the  Czech National Bank and the Finance Ministry? These institutions  usually have contradictory objectives and roles.    [Tosovsky] At the most recent meeting of the Banking  Council,  the finance minister was also present, to which is he entitled  by law, and we are quite happy that he uses this right from time  to time. We discussed better harmonization between the fiscal  and the monetary policy, which will become our key to success  this year. As I said, the state budget is one of the independent  factors in the money supply situation, which the central bank  cannot influence directly. It is therefore necessary to know the  trends of budgetary developments and the government's intentions  and to closely cooperate. It seems that both sides are prepared  for that.    [Frydl] The Czech National Bank is working on the  introduction of the koruna's full convertibility. Could you tell  us how far you want to go in liberalizing the capital account?    [Tosovsky] It may seem improbable, but our system is quite  close to full convertibility. In principle, three things are  involved. The limit on foreign currency purchases by the  population will be abolished, the obligation of the exporter to  offer foreign currency to the bank for purchase will be  abolished, and the export of capital will be liberalized. When  this happens, we only have to address foreign banks, open an  account in our currency, and make foreign payments in korunas.  We want to achieve this situation--that is, full  liberalization--also on the capital account of the balance of  payments [sentence as published].    [Frydl] How do you view the Czech Republic's position in the  world economic organizations, such as the International Monetary  Fund and the World Bank?    [Tosovsky] Our position remains the same. In the  International Monetary Fund we have the position of the  countries that are providing assistance to other countries. In  1990, we renewed our membership as a country that needed  assistance. This is quite a good result, which we achieved in  such a short time.    [Frydl] Do we have enough commercial banks? What should be  their optimum number?    [Tosovsky] The number of banks is essentially an  uninteresting number. We do not judge the situation according to  that number. There should be as many banks as required to  provide all of the needed services on the standard level. This  is not the case in our country, not yet. Nevertheless, it seems  that all those banks on the market are an unhealthy situation.  We expect that their number will be reduced, some of them will  merge, and the banking services provided to clients will improve  and become of better quality.    [Frydl] The "retail banking" system--that is, really complex  services for regular clients--is closely linked to this issue.    [Tosovsky] We have enough branches, but the quality of  services must improve and their variety increase.    [Frydl] In your opinion, why have the foreign banks not  engaged themselves in this sphere?    [Tosovsky] I cannot say that they would completely avoid  this  market, but it would mean for them to build a network of  branches, which is expensive and slow.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARD GETS $13,000 FINE IN CAMPAIGN FUND VIOLATION  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission on Tuesday unanimously agreed to fine  Bellflower school board member Larry Ward $13,000 for campaign reporting  violations arising from his unsuccessful 1986 campaign for the Assembly.  </P> <P> According to documents prepared by the commission staff, Ward violated the  Political Reform Act by reporting two $10,000 campaign contributions even  though he "knew or had reason to know that there was no actual monetary  contribution to him or his committee . . ."  </P> <P> The commission staff had recommended that the five-member panel accept the  settlement with Ward, a member of the Bellflower Unified School District board  since 1977.  </P> <P> In an interview, Ward, 47, of Lakewood, acknowledged making a mistake but  denied doing "anything intentionally . . . to mislead the voters." Ward  described the $13,000 fine as excessive, saying that $4,000 "would have been  fair." The fine was $1,000 short of the maximum the commission could impose.  </P> <P> Ward said the central issue in the case revolved around the way he reported  campaign donations from Ingram Industries of Bellflower as cash contributions.  He should have listed them as in-kind donations of office space, printing,  telephones and other services to help run the campaign, Ward said. "We did it  wrong and we should be fined," Ward acknowledged.  </P> <P> Last May, the commission rejected a proposed $9,000 settlement in the case  because of concerns that the amount was too low considering the nature of  Ward's violations.  </P> <P> The violations stem for a bitter 1986 Democratic primary in which Ward was one  of nine candidates seeking the seat of retiring Assemblyman Frank Vicencia  (D-Bellflower). The primary was won by Edward Waters, who lost the general  election.  </P> <P> Ward said he plans to pay the entire fine, even though his volunteer campaign  treasurer, Christine Hinton, was cited for having improperly labeled campaign  statements. "She only followed my direction," Ward said.  </P></p>

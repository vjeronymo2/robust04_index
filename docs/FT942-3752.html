			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Fears raised over splits in EU parliament Governments across Europe yesterday expressed concern about the fragmentation of the European parliament after elections that saw a strong shift to the right on the Continent offset by Labour's sweeping victory in the UK. In the immediate aftermath of the results, Mr Achille Occhetto resigned as leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, the main Italian opposition party. And Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, signalled a possibly more nationalist stance by his government. Polling last Thursday and on Sunday was dominated by a mixture of protest voting and apathy in many EU member states. The new 567-member parliament, in which Socialist and allied parties look likely to form the largest grouping with an estimated 213 seats, will have increased powers. But the record low turnout across Europe - down to 56.5 per cent from 58.5 per cent in the last election in 1989 - may constrain the parliament's abilty to play a fuller role as the EU's sole directly-elected institution. In spite of the strong showing by conservatives in Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and Denmark, co-operation among rightwing MEPs in the new parliament is likely to be hampered by bickering over the composition of the European People's party group, traditionally dominated by Christian Democrats. Fragmentation of the rightwing presence has been increased by the strong showing of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, which won 30.6 per cent of the votes, up nearly 10 points from the general elections in March. Mr Leo Tindemans, a former Belgian premier and leader of the EPP in Strasbourg, insisted yesterday that his grouping did not want to work with Forza Italia on account of the latter's coalition alliance with neo-fascists. Meanwhile, senior German officials expressed concern about the risk of unpredictable factions in the parliament disrupting Bonn's plan to work closely with the newly-elected assembly. They drew attention to the election of maverick French and Italian MEPs from the right which could leave between 80 and 100 MEPs unattached to formal left or rightwing party groupings at Strasbourg. Bonn's worries about co-operation with the parliament when Germany takes over the six-monthly EU presidency next month took some gloss off the surprise victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in Sunday's poll. A confident Mr Kohl predicted yesterday he would win the country's general election in October . In France, Mr Balladur voicedconcern about the diversity of policies and parties represented in Strasbourg. 'Fragmentation among too many lists threatens to weaken France at a European level,' he said. He added that the poll, which resulted in a sharp swing to left and rightwing French dissident parties, had shown that voters wanted French interests to be better represented in Europe. Elsewhere, ministers and officials warned about the twin dangers of voter indifference and the swing to anti-Maastricht parties. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said the low turnout was 'really disappointing', while Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Brussels commissioner for external political affairs, said: 'The credibility of the European union and our institutions are at stake.' It also emerged yesterday that Mr Kohl is playing a crucial role in trying to achieve a compromise over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Mr Berlusconi is to meet Mr Kohl in Bonn on Thursday in the Italian leader's first high-level European diplomatic meeting since assuming office a month ago. Italy is being courted furiously by the contenders for the presidency job, including Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, Mr Ruud Lubbers, prime minister of the Netherlands, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, who is being backed by France and Germany.</p>

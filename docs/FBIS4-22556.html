			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Mokrishchev under the rubric "The Near </F> Abroad: Ukraine": "Our Own Gas Is Under Our Noses"]    [Text] Ukraine is suffocating without natural gas. The  country itself extracts 15-17 billion cubic meters. But it needs  four times that. And the pressure in the gas lines from the near  abroad is falling. Prices for blue fuel are already higher than  world prices and continue to rise.    But that is only half the problem. It will become really bad  when the Orenburg, Turkmen, and even the Siberian deposits dry  up. And not for Ukraine alone. Such a prospect is not so far  off. International experts predict that with the present level  of consumption, there may be only 10-12 years of natural gas  reserves left at best. And what then?    In our country, in such cases we begin feverishly looking  for  ways to solve the problem which has supposedly come about  unexpectedly. This time, it is true, nontraditional sources of  hydrocarbon raw materials and means of extracting them were  recalled in good time. Beginning in 1988, three international  scientific symposiums were held in St. Petersburg and Donetsk  and were devoted to the topical problem which already disturbs  not only scientists but most people who are a long ways from  science.    The most promising substitute for traditional natural gas is  coal gas. The very same methane which from time immemorial has  been the enemy and killer of miners when there are sudden  blow-outs and explosions. But it could become their best friend  and put unprofitable and dangerous mines on their feet.    "Reserves of methane in coal mines are such that Ukraine  could completely satisfy its gas needs for about 12 years," said  the chief of the laboratory of mining geology and comprehensive  development of the interior under the Ukrglavgeologiya  [Ukrainian Geology Administration] Association at Donetsk  Technical University, Anatoliy Brizhanev. "And as a backup,  there is enough of it to last a very long time."    So the Donbass is not only a coal deposit but the largest  coal gas deposit. The most promising regions are the  Donetsk-Makeyevka, Chistyakovo-Snezhnoye, Krasnodon, and  Almaznaya-Maryevka regions. The mines with the most methane and  the most densely populated territories and hundreds of large  industrial enterprises which need enormous amounts of gas are  located here. But it is extracted from mine degasification  systems in very small quantities for heating administrative and  residential areas. We are not even close to industrial or  commercial extraction.    But a start has been made, although it is a modest one. At  the Torez Mine Administration, the building of one of the mines,  two residential buildings, and a greenhouse have been heated  with their own gas for many years. And not from the  degasification systems, but from mine layers worked through  vertical shafts.    The Donetsk Mine imeni Zasyadko has experience in fueling  motor vehicles with coal gas.    Experiments on preliminary degasification of layers from the  surface have been conducted for more than 25 years at other  Donetsk and Makeyevka mines under the "patronage" of the Moscow  Mining Institute.    Alas, even now in the face of a gas crisis, the extraction  of  methane remains on the same symbolic level in our country. But  "they," the United States, Canada, and other Western countries,  have taken advantage of our Soviet ideas and in record short  time developed industrial extraction of gas from coal beds.    In the United States, for example, 40 universities and firms  began working in 1987 to carry out a generously subsidized state  program. They most likely assumed a "capitalist obligation," and  in 1991 fortunate California had already obtained 5 billion  cubic meters of gas from the San Juan coal deposit alone. In  light of that, the extraction of coal from beds that have first  been degassed from the surface increases by one and  one-half-fold and the prime cost of extraction is reduced by 30  percent. The brainstorm related to the underground deposits  continues. There are already 84 universities and firms working  on the coal gas program. By the year 2000, it will reach 60  billion cubic meters of gas. Enough for the whole of Ukraine.    I have in front of me an advertising prospectus. It presents  the process of extracting methane in plain, intelligible  language.    "In principle everything is very simple," Anatoliy  Mikhaylovich continues, "a shaft well is drilled and water is  pumped into it with compressed air under a pressure of hundreds  of atmospheres. The bed is hydraulically fractured. Cracks form.  The cracks must be kept open for the methane to drain along  them. But gas does not pass through water. And if the water is  pumped out, the mine pressure will close the cracks. Water,  then, must be replaced with a material which will `eep' the bed  fractured and at the same time let through all the gas."    That is the point where many years of domestic research  stopped. Water is replaced by a solidifying foam. It must  solidify at an exact time and place and in addition increase the  release of the methane. That is the crux of the entire  technology. There are no chemicals for this foam. Nor is there  any high technological sophistication. The slightest mistake and  the crack may "close off."    But we must get started! In the far abroad this was done  long  before a shortage of natural gas appeared in order to meet it  with all weapons ready. In Ukraine the shortage appeared soon  after independence was proclaimed. And even in other republics  it was more or less clearly hinted. Even in gas-producing  republics. And deliveries of gas from the countries of the Near  East are unlikely to save the situation.    Back in 1991, specialists of a number of firms of the United  States and Canada suggested creating joint ventures to extract  gas in the Donbass on a commercial basis, under the condition  that payment for expenditures was in metal and coal. But at that  time there was no legislative basis for allocating parcels of  land for drilling wells, and none has appeared yet. Nor has the  appropriate infrastructure been built on the surface. So the  initiative of the Western firms vanished in an instant.    And isn't it absurd that we are crying about the lack of  what  we ourselves have in abundance? Instead of rescuing Ukraine from  the trouble, Donbass methane continues to kill and cripple  people. And Kuzbass and Karaganda methane too, any methane which  hides menacingly in the depths of the earth and is ready at any  time to explode with indomitable force.    Is it at great depth? Are special equipment and enormous  capital investments needed? That means efforts in Moscow, and in  the Donbass, and in Kazakhstan, and in the Urals must be  combined; the half-forgotten "Talmuds" of research on the  problem of extracting coal gas must be gotten out and the work  pulled ahead. It will not be an amorphous but a concrete  scientific-technical alliance. For the sake of that, everyone  should focus themselves and put in great effort and capital and  the military-industrial complex enterprises with their mighty  human, scientific, and technical potential should be involved.  People say that some things are already being produced in  Azerbaijan, and in Russia and Ukraine. In short, we cannot do  without a serious interstate program. But we would have more  than enough capital to realize the program in Ukraine, for  example, but it continues to be squandered and stolen and escape  abroad.</p>

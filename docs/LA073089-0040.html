Is it really more energy-efficiency and more  maintenance-free as the contractors tell me?  </P> <P> ANSWER: The most recent major design innovation for central air conditioners is  a high-efficiency scroll compressor in place of a standard piston-type  compressor. A new scroll compressor air conditioner can cut your electric bills  significantly and minimize maintenance costs.  </P> <P> Several air conditioner manufacturers are now using scroll compressors with  seasonal energy efficiency ratios (SEER) up to 12. Your old unit may have a  SEER as low as 6. SEER relates the amount of cooling output of a central air  conditioner to the amount of electricity it uses.  </P> <P> By its design, the scroll compressor is very reliable. Unlike conventional  compressors with many moving parts, pistons, valves, seals, etc., a scroll  compressor has only four moving parts.  </P> <P> As it gets older, the few moving parts of a scroll compressor actually wear in  and operate better. It is also more tolerant of foreign matter and fluids in  the system.  </P> <P> Without the pistons and valves used in a standard compressor, a scroll  compressor operates more quietly and more vibration-free. This is an advantage  both for you and your neighbors.  </P> <P> The operating principle of a scroll compressor is simple. Two spiral-shaped  members fit together. One remains stationary, while the other orbits relative  to it. This creates gas pockets which gradually decrease in size to compress  the Freon.  </P> <P> Since several pockets of Freon are compressed simultaneously in the scroll  members, it produces a smooth and nearly continuous compression cycle. In  contrast, a standard piston compressor produces fewer and larger compression  pulses per cycle.  </P> <P> When you select a new central air conditioner, have your contractor do a  detailed heat gain analysis for your house. Many use computers and  sophisticated programs. An improperly sized central air conditioner not only  wastes electricity, but doesn't provide the best comfort level.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 042, showing a list of  manufacturers, model numbers and SEER's of air conditioners using scroll  compressors, a chart showing the electricity saving by installing a  high-efficiency unit and more detailed information on the scroll compressor.

Since these operate continuously, will  they be expensive to operate?  </P> <P> A: The amount of current usage is very low and the operating cost is  negligible. The reason for requiring two power sources, batteries and house  current, is that people often let the batteries run down. They plan to replace  them, but never get around to doing it, and then they forget. Without power,  the smoke alarm provides no protection.  </P> <P> To keep people from removing the batteries to avoid annoying false alarms when  cooking, some new smoke alarms offer a hush control. This allows you to press a  button to temporarily decrease the sensitivity of the alarm. It resets to  normal sensitivity automatically.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

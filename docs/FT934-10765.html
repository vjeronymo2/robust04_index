			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Oil industry critical of Norway's tax reform plan THE Norwegian government is drafting changes to its oil tax regime which could increase the burden on foreign and domestic oil companies operating in the country, according to tax specialists. The minority Labour government aims to complete a draft of the proposed tax reform by the end of the month, but it would be made retroactive to January 1, 1993. On Monday, Mr Arne Oeien, permanent finance secretary, told a conference in Oslo that Norway was considering reducing tax concessions to oil companies that use high levels of debt to increase their tax allowances. Industry reaction to the government move has been critical. 'This would have a serious negative impact on the Norwegian oil industry as well as Norwegian society as a whole,' according to Mr Mark Randle, finance manager of Phillips Petroleum Norway. 'There should be no doubt that future investments both onshore and offshore would be hurt by the proposal.' 'Also, the fact that the proposal is meant to be enacted with retroactive effect from January 1, 1993, shows that the industry can have little confidence in the Norwegian fiscal framework. There have been investment decisions made with the expectation that the 1992 fiscal framework would last longer than one year.' Last year the government implemented a reform to the petroleum tax regime but it created a loophole for foreign oil companies, allowing them to repatriate funds to parent companies at the expense of the tax authorities. The loss to the government is estimated to be several hundred million kroner annually. At present, oil companies are allowed tax deductions of 78 per cent on the interest payments on their borrowings. Tax specialists say this has resulted in Norwegian subsidiaries repatriating substantial dividends to their foreign parent companies, while at the same time running up borrowings. The government is now considering reducing the rate of tax deduction allowed on interest payments to 28 per cent. Mr Anders Utne, a senior executive with Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, sharply criticised the proposed move. 'The government will punish the Norwegian oil companies for the sins of foreign oil companies' subsidiaries operating in Norway,' Mr Utne said. Tax specialists said there could also be an increase in the special tax on petroleum operations, which is currently a 48 per cent levy on extraordinary income from offshore operations. That is on top of 28 per cent corporate tax.</p>

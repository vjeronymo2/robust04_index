			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: De Beers A diamond may be forever, but not alas a dividend. De Beers' announcement that it will reduce its final dividend substantially shows the recession has not left the Byzantine world of diamond dealing untouched. That would be unsurprising, had not the company's chairman, Mr Julian Ogilvy Thompson, given an upbeat assessment of prospects only three months ago. The 6 per cent fall in De Beers' shares reflects how far the market has been wrong-footed. His credibility has been dented. The company may have been rash to rely on optimistic projections of the world economy, but the problems with the diamond market run a little deeper. De Beers' decision to defer purchases of 25 per cent of the diamonds for which it is contracted reflects the strain facing the cartel which it runs through the Central Selling Organisation. Mopping up illicit diamonds from Angola has proved expensive, and one of the beauties of the cartel's marketing operation is its ability to spread the misery around producers. This will clearly be unpopular. Besides saving cash, cutting the dividend may make the reduction in diamond purchases more palatable to cartel members outside South Africa. The company should be able to contain any leakage of diamonds from the cartel, but it is hard not to conclude that part of De Beers' difficulty is of its own making.</p>

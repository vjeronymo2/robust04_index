It is to the  benefit of both our countries to expeditiously put bilateral  cooperation on the road to implementation, Croatian President  Tudjman pointed out.    Mr. Meksi considers the visit of the Croatian delegation  presided by President Tudjman to be important and expressed his  conviction that all the conditions exist for passing from the  agreements and projects to their practical implementation. Both  sides greeted the achievement of an agreement in the fields of  petroleum, tourism, education, culture, science, etc.    The Croatian side expressed readiness to offer its  experience  in the fields of the production of petroleum, chemical  fertilizers, the modernization of refineries, the construction  of petrol stations, and the buying of electrical energy from our  country. It also expressed the desire to set up a cement  factory and cooperate in the copper and marble industries,  communication, etc. The Albanian side viewed cooperation in  these fields with much interest and reciprocal profit.    Mr. Tudjman and Prime Minister Meksi exchanged opinions  about  the situation in the region as well. They assessed the NATO air  attack as a response to the Serbian aggressor and expressed  their readiness to contribute to the establishment of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    People's Assembly Presidency Chairman Pjeter Arbnori and  Messrs. Ali Spahia, Namik Dokle, and Teodor Laco held a joint  meeting with President Tudjman.    During the meeting, Mr. Pjeter Arbnori said that the stable  states of the region may and should play an important role in  Balkan stability. All the states that aspire to democracy and  peace should stop the Serbian aggressor. This may be done  through dialogue and solidarity with one another. Mr. Arbnori  stressed that Albania wants to have good relations with all the  regional countries. Croatia is for us a neighboring and friendly  country, that is why we want to strengthen bilateral relations  and cooperation.    President Tudjman and Mr. Arbnori also focused on the  situation in the Balkans, Kosova, and the broader region.    This afternoon, too, Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova  and his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader had a mutual meeting,  at which they expressed ideas about the problems of the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Kosova, and elsewhere. Starova  and Sanader analyzed the changes of the situation in the Balkans  and determined the attitudes of Albania and Croatia regarding  these problems.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENNA-PROST FEUD STILL BOILING AS AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX NEARS  </P> <P> The long-running feud between former Formula One racing teammates Ayrton Senna  of Brazil and Alain Prost of France continues to boil as the two prepare for  Sunday's season-ending Australian Grand Prix.  </P> <P> The bitterness erupted full force after Senna and Prost collided on the first  turn of the Japanese Grand Prix two weeks ago, knocking both men out of the  race and clinching Senna's second world championship.  </P> <P> Prost has accused Senna of initiating the collision to eliminate him from the  championship battle.  </P> <P> "He is bad for the sport," Prost said. "If it ever came to the point where I  had to do the same things to win the championship, I would have to think about  whether to stay in the sport. What has happened is bad for the sport, and it is  a bad example for young people."  </P> <P> Senna countered that Prost is a chronic complainer.  </P> <P> "I think Prost does a good job in getting people to focus on other things,"  Senna said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BOUQUET OF 'IRISES' FOR ART LOVERS  </P> <P> Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece "Irises" has been returned to the art lovers of  the world, thanks to the intervention of the J. Paul Getty Museum. It is an  exciting addition to the imaginative collection of that great institution.  Happily, the museum has wasted no time in placing the painting on public view.  </P> <P> The acquisition by Getty ends a troubling but instructive period in which the  painting disappeared from public view for more than two years, first to a  private office wall and then to a secret vault. It was the captive of Alan  Bond, an Australian business baron. His purchase had been facilitated by  Sotheby's New York auction house, which accepted the painting as collateral for  a loan that the auction company itself advanced to cover half the record price  of $53.9 million paid at its own auction. The disquiet inspired by this novel  application of leveraged purchasing, and its bald contribution to art  inflation, has at least won a change of policy from Sotheby's, which no longer  will accept paintings as collateral for credit extended by the company in its  own sales. That move could help make prices more realistic.  </P> <P> "Irises" has been hidden in private collections more than it has been on public  display in the years since it was painted in 1889. But from 1975 until its sale  to Bond in 1987, it was on loan for display at the art gallery at Westbrook  College in Portland, Me. The then-owner, John Whitney Payson, subsequently  decided to auction it to raise money for a philanthropic foundation. His  decision was inspired by the earlier sale of Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers  for $39.9 million, a record at the time. The extraordinary price paid by Bond  exceeded all expectations. And, were it not for extraordinary business reverses  the next year, which have generated a $5-billion debt for Bond's enterprises,  the painting might still be hanging in an office in Perth instead of in the  Getty in Malibu.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- On Wednesday [9 March], the  German Bundesbank continued its policy of lowering interest  rates in tiny steps. The banks were allocated 83 billion German  marks [DM] within the framework of security transactions under  repurchase agreement. The marginal allocation rate was 5.94  percent and thus 0.03 percentage points below the interest rates  of the security transactions under repurchase agreement last  week. Until then the important "third prime rate" had been 7  percent.    According to the Bundesbank, the allocations were given an  interest rate of 5.94 to 5.95 percent. The allocation volume of  DM83 billion is set off by expiring transactions of DM82.5  billion. The latest security transactions under repurchase  agreement were, like the ones last week, an interest tender, in  which the banks contribute their own ideas concerning the  interest rate at which they want to use the money for a duration  of 14 days.    At the Frankfurt banking center the new tiny step was  interpreted as a signal that the guardians of the currency want  to keep to their course of lowering interest rates, which they  have announced for 1994. "The Bundesbank has decided not to do  nothing," it was said. In view of the enormous expansion of the  money supply in January and the latest turbulence on the  international financial markets, a major decline in the prime  rate cannot be expected for the foreseeable future.</p>

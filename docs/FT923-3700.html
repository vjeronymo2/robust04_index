			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Wage council abolition opposed THE Trades Union Congress is hoping to exploit differences between government ministers and among employers in the campaign to retain the wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.47m workers. The TUC fears that abolition of the councils - most important in shops, hotels and the clothing industry - will feature in legislation this autumn. Officials believe Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, is more reluctant to press ahead than some of her colleagues. One said: 'Mrs Shephard is likely to have qualms about removing protection from 2m women workers and supporting a measure which is likely to discourage training.' The TUC hopes that retailers will be too busy with the campaign to legalise Sunday trading to seek abolition of wage councils. The Confederation of British Industry does not support complete abolition but 'sector-by-sector review'. An NOP poll commissioned by the TUC has found that nine out of 10 people support continued protection for people on low pay.</p>

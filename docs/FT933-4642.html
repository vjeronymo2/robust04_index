			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: An island's experience - Regional electricity companies will shortly have to promote conservation Gordon Chapman was suspicious when Manweb, his local electricity distributor, offered help in reducing the power requirements of the aluminium factory he manages. Working in a highly competitive industry he found it hard to comprehend why any company should seek to cut its sales volumes. However, Chapman and his factory, owned by the Aluminium Power Company (Alpoco), took Manweb's advice and are now reaping the benefits. The projected annual savings on Alpoco's power bill amount to more than Pounds 16,000. The company is among several thousand beneficiaries at Holyhead, north-west Wales, where Manweb has been conducting a six-month experiment on promoting energy efficiency measures. The results are expected to include a reduction in peak electricity demand next January of about a ninth. They will be examined closely by other regional electricity companies, which are beginning to look at similar initiatives, and by environmental campaigners. In the UK, energy efficiency has never achieved the prominence it has in North America, where electricity companies are required by regulatory authorities to promote it. But that is about to change. In a recent review of the 12 regional electricity companies' (Recs) supply businesses, Offer, the electricity regulator for England and Wales, removed incentives for Recs to make profits just by selling more electricity, rather than being more efficient. From next April, the companies will be required to spend Pounds 1 per customer, per year on energy efficiency measures. Similar measures are expected in Offer's review of the Recs' more profitable distribution arms, scheduled for completion next year. The Holyhead initiative was conceived after a Copenhagen energy conservation conference attended two years ago by Colin Leonard, Manweb's power marketing director. Leonard admits the company could see the public relations advantages in a conservation experiment. More important, the company felt the experiment would give it a lead in building its energy conservation arm. With value added tax being introduced on domestic fuel sales next year, the energy conservation industry is set for growth. An attraction for Manweb is that profits will not be regulated by Offer. In choosing a testbed area, Manweb was attracted to Holyhead because, as an island at the edge of the company's distribution area, it was electrically self-contained. In addition, the company faced a bill for Pounds 750,000 within two years on reinforcing the network on the island. The reduced energy consumption means that expenditure can be deferred. Manweb says it is not looking to make money out of the initiative; rather to learn from the experience. However, with the aid of an Pounds 80,000 EC grant and the reinforcement work savings, it hopes it can recoup its Pounds 500,000 investment in the Holyhead project. Manweb's money has been spent on a mixture of gifts and incentives to the island's 3,500 households and 660 businesses. Domestic customers were offered two low-energy light bulbs for 70p each, less than a tenth of their usual price, and a free hot-water cylinder insulation and low-cost insulation and draught proofing. Commercial and industrial power users were each provided with a free energy audit and financial help towards implementing the recommendations. At Alpoco, the bulk of the savings (Pounds 13,500 a year) have come from reconditioning three of the five compressors needed to convert molten aluminium into powder. The reconditioning cost Pounds 30,000 but with Manweb contributing Pounds 5,000, Alpoco expects to recover its expenditure within two years. Manweb contributed Pounds 10,000 to the Pounds 12,000 cost of installing a power factor correction unit needed to regulate power flows. Alpoco's investment of Pounds 2,000 should be repaid within a year. Requirements at the Anglesey Sea and Surf Centre were much simpler. A modern building, it already benefited from energy technology equipment. 'Our problem was that electrical surges were causing lights to pop,' says Nigel Denis, manager. Manweb's solution was the installation of 82 low-energy compact fluorescent lamps at a cost of Pounds 4 each. The energy saving alone is about Pounds 250 to Pounds 300 a year, roughly equivalent to the cost of installation. Simple solutions have also been the hallmark of Manweb's approach in the domestic market, as pensioners Emrys and Mair Owen have discovered at their one-bedroom bungalow. The installation of two compact bulbs, four-inch loft insulation and draught proofing has cut the Owens' monthly electricity bill from Pounds 36 to Pounds 28 a month. But if Manweb's customers have benefited from the experiment, what has the company gained, other than deferral of Pounds 750,000 of expenditure? 'We have had almost every known energy saving measure known to mankind on the island,' says Leonard. 'We aim to find out what works and doesn't work and what people will resist.' The knowledge will be provided by a comprehensive survey of Holyhead inhabitants over the coming months. Depending on the results, Manweb will decide whether to market products more aggressively in other areas. Some lessons are already apparent. According to Benstead, response to the project was considerably greater among the 3,500 householders, most of whom have adopted at least some energy-saving measures, than it was among businesses. 'We had to drag businesses to the talks we gave for them on energy conservation,' he says. 'We found that very few were prepared to undertake any work which did not pay for itself within a year or so.' This has been a factor in prompting Manweb to consider schemes in other areas where it will provide capital costs for energy-saving devices in return for a proportion of the savings in future years. 'Many customers will not invest in energy savings because they want to direct scarce capital at core businesses,' says Leonard. 'Some organisations, including hospitals, have no money but would benefit enormously, for example, from new lighting systems. Like other electricity companies, we have low gearing and can afford to help.'</p>

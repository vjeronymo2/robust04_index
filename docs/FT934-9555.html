			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Observer: Dealing a tough hand Have you noticed that despite Edouard Balladur's attempts to appear even-handed in his reshuffle of France's public sector chairmen, socialist business leaders seem to have landed the most difficult jobs? Take the highly respected Jean Peyrelevade, adviser to Pierre Mauroy's government in the early 1980s. He was not best pleased at being removed from the top of Union des Assurances de Paris to make way for Jacques Friedmann, a Gaullist and confidant of the French prime minister. His reluctance is easy to explain. The in-tray he inherits from Jean-Yves Haberer at loss-making Credit Lyonnais is brimming with problems, from real estate losses in France to the debt-burdened MGM studios in Hollywood. Haberer, himself a socialist appointee, is paying the price for his costly expansion strategy. His move to Credit National - a much smaller institution than Credit Lyonnais - is regarded as a demotion. Foreign shareholders in the bank are also disgruntled because they were not properly consulted. Even Haberer, however, may consider himself lucky. Christian Blanc, a friend of socialist leader Michel Rocard, and Balladur's choice as the new head of Air France, has this week started to wrestle with the airline's workers. His task - to return the carrier to profitability without involuntary job cuts - could be the public sector's most poisonous chalice.</p>

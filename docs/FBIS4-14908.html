			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Andrey Shishov report: "Nizhniy Novgorod </F> Gets New Mayor"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- The new acting head of Nizhniy  Novgorod City Administration has been named as Ivan Sklyarov,  the kray's vice governor. The directive appointing him was  signed by Boris Nemtsov.    Sklyarov replaces Dmitriy Bednyakov, whom President B.  Yeltsin relieved of his duties for refusing to implement  Nemtsov's instruction to cancel the referendum on Nizhniy  Novgorod's draft charter, which, in the governor's opinion, led  to the destabilization of the situation in the city and oblast  and discredited the organs of power.    Nemtsov stated at a press conference that it had become  impossible to work with Bednyakov. There must be strict  discipline in the executive organs of power. Asked by  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA about a threat to democracy in Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast, the governor stressed that a threat exists, but  to order and stability rather than democracy. It is necessary,  Nemtsov added, to give comprehensive support to the kray's  recently elected representative organs of power, above all the  Oblast Legislative Assembly, in which the main attributes of a  rule-of-law democratic society must be improved.    The head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration also noted the  need to hold a future election of the head of the self-governing  entity of Nizhniy Novgorod in which, of course, Bednyakov can  participate. According to Nemtsov, he is prepared to help find  a job for Nizhniy Novgorod's former leader if Bednyakov  approaches him with such a request.    Sklyarov, the new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, stressed that  there will be no cardinal change in the policy of reforms, but  adjustments will be made to them. It is necessary to restore  everyday services to the population, which were destroyed during  privatization. He added that he will be appearing regularly on  television and will generally seek wider contacts with the press.</p>

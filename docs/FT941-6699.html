			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / HK bank system comes under fire Hong Kong's Consumer Council yesterday made a stinging attack on the colony's banking system, calling for deregulation of interest rates and more financial disclosure from the banks. The council estimated profits earned by the colony's banking cartel through restrictive practices had grown to 0.8 per cent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product in 1991 from 0.3 per cent in 1985, or to HKDollars 5.2bn (Pounds 452m) from HKDollars 1.2bn. Since 1964, interest rates for small deposits in Hong Kong have been subject to an agreement between banks. Banks were also allowed to understate or overstate their actual profits by making secret transfers (or withdrawals) of profits to (or from) 'inner reserves'. The council said it could find no argument to support the old rationale in favour of the cartel, that the interest rate agreement prevented cut-throat competition. 'The banking sector is now more stable and is subject to vigilant supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,' it said. The council said agreement covering interest rates on deposits below Dollars HK500,000 should be phased out by 1997; by 1996 banks' annual and interim results should be published on a fully disclosed basis. At present, only HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and Hang Seng Bank, an HSBC listed subsidiary, produce fully disclosed financial results. The HSBC group of banks reported annual results yesterday. Since Governor Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in 1992 the colonial government has stressed competition in its economic policy. The main author of the report, Prof Edward Chen of Hong Kong University, sits on Mr Patten's executive council. HSBC results, Page 23; Feature, Page 21; Lex, Page 22</p>

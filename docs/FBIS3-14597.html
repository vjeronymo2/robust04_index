A press  release issued by the High Commission has referred to the joint  communique issued in 1981 after the visit to Pakistan of the  then Indian external affairs minister and the present prime  minister, Narasimha Rao. In the communique, both sides endorsed  each other's right to acquire weapons for their defense. As  India has already acquired a large quantity of arms, it should  not sense any threat from Pakistan. The press release further  states that the F-16 issue, payment for which has already been  made, concerns Pakistan and the United States. The press  release also gives a reminder of the fact that Pakistan has  never tried to have any influence on the acquisition of arms by  India, although the acquisition of such arms has altered the  balance of power in the region. Pakistan has always tried to  maintain a balance in conventional arms and has supported a ban  on the acquisition and installation of weapons of mass  destruction and has also submitted several proposals in this  regard. The press release asks India to hold constructive talks  with Pakistan so as to ensure peace and stability in the region  instead of indulging in arguments and debates.</p>

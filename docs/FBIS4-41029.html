			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol by </F> Svitlana Pysarenko in Kiev on 16 June: "Stabilization Is  Possible in a Year or a Year and a Half"]    [Text] [Pysarenko] Vitaliy Andriyovych, will you form a  new government before the presidential elections?    [Masol] Of course, we will form one; there should be a  government. The government, in my opinion, will bring together  competent, qualified specialists.    [Pysarenko] You said that the prime minister must head the  Executive Branch... Are you convinced that the Supreme Council  will adopt such amendments to the Constitution?    [Masol] The parliament will only be adopting amendments in  September, after the run-off elections.    [Pysarenko] You said that a year or a year and a half is  needed to achieve stabilization. Are you convinced that the  people will suffer quietly during this period?    [Masol] I believe that today one must speak the truth: The  situation will not improve overnight. People must understand  that everything depends on the harvest. If it is good,  stabilization will begin a little earlier.    [Pysarenko] Forgive me for asking this, perhaps, unpleasant  question: Do you think that you were appointed prime minister  as a symbol of 1990, or as a reformer?    [Masol] I would have to say the latter.    [Pysarenko] The press has reported that Masol is going to  nationalize commercial banks. Is this true?    [Masol] The press is now free, and it writes whatever it  wants. If someone is going to privatize commercial banks, then  I would like to ask him: What will happen then; will we live  with the old system of planning? I will not.    I want to note, however, that all over the world, states  draft plans, have economy ministries, and make balance sheets  and forecasts. A state must know what it needs and how much.    [Pysarenko] After answering deputies' questions, did you not  have an impression that you are a better marketeer than they?    [Masol] You have already answered your own question.    [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward Russia?    [Masol] Russia is our primary market. If you can, please  find a state which would buy 2-3 million tonnes of sugar from  us. Yet, we should also cooperate with the West. The West  means modern technology and structural reconstruction of our  economy. Russia means energy resources and a market for our  goods. We should sell our products. To buy something, one must  sell something. These are normal economic relations, and  whether we refer to them as a union or a market... We have yet  to see.    [Pysarenko] Will you continue the policy of [former acting  Prime Minister] Zvyahilskyy on not financing the budget sector?    [Masol] More than half of Ukraine's workers are employed in  the budget sector. The budget sector is the nation's gene pool.  If we want to lose it, we should not finance education, health  care, or science.    [Pysarenko] To what degree will the cabinet be reshuffled?    [Masol] You know, I do not yet know how many people are in  the cabinet...    [Pysarenko] Are you satisfied with the current form of  cooperation between the government and the National Bank?    [Masol] The government, the Finance Ministry, and the  National Bank should work together. Everything depends not on  who is subordinated to whom, but on how they cooperate.    [Pysarenko] Who will be finance minister?    [Masol] I will think about it.    [Pysarenko] For whom will you vote in the presidential  elections?    [Masol] For those who will be included in the polls...    [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward the Crimea?    [Masol] Crimea is a part of Ukraine, it is Ukraine, and  territorial integrity must be preserved.    [Pysarenko] Would you agree to lease Sevastopol to Russia?    [Masol] This issue as a whole needs attention. Still, there  is such a practice in the world, and there is nothing new here.  Kazakhstan has leased a launch-site to Russia, and it will  profit from that.    [Pysarenko] What is your position on the idea of relations  between Ukraine and the Crimea being based on treaties?    [Masol] If we have an integral territory, what kind of  treaties can there be?    [Pysarenko] I wish you success and support in the reform  process.</p>

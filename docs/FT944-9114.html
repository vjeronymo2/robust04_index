			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Conde's fall felt in Wall Street and the palace As the legal noose tightens on Mr Mario Conde, the repercussions will be felt from Wall Street, home of JP Morgan, the prestigious US investment bank that became the Spanish banker's firm ally last year, to the Zarzuela Palace, home of King Juan Carlos where Mr Conde was a welcome visitor. On Tuesday, a Madrid high court prosecutor accused the former chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, Banesto, of criminal fraud, together with nine close associates who were senior Banesto executives. Mr Conde, who was dismissed as Banesto chairman by the Bank of Spain, the central bank, at the end of last year, was yesterday under virtual house arrest at his Madrid town mansion. High court judge Mr Manuel Garca Castellon who is likely to begin questioning Mr Conde next week before deciding whether to charge him, has ordered police to monitor the banker's movements. He may not leave the country. Full details of the criminal fraud accusation have not been released but the allegations made by the prosecutor centre on a web of intermediary companies, controlled by Mr Conde and the associates accused with him, that bought and sold assets within the banking group. If the flamboyant, 45-year-old financier was unreliable, as is alleged by prosecutor Mr Florentino Orti and believed by members of a parliamentary commission that has investigated Banesto, should JP Morgan have helped Banesto raise more than Dollars 700m from the international markets last year? If Mr Conde defrauded Banesto's shareholders during his six-year stint as chairman of the bank, as alleged, just how gullible were the business, political and media figures who danced to his tune for so long? Mr Conde was dismissed as Banesto chairman by the Bank of Spain after an official inspection discovered that the bank had overvalued its Pta7,000bn (Dollars 61bn at the time) assets by Pta503bn. The Bank of Spain, which also removed Mr Conde's fellow board members, said the 'support of the entire banking system' was required to refloat Banesto. In April Banesto was acquired by Banco Santander after some Pta780bn in public and private moneys had been spent on saving it. Less than four months before Mr Conde's dismissal, JP Morgan had managed a two-part equity-raising exercise that brought Dollars 775m of fresh capital into Banesto. Among the new Banesto shareholders was the Corsair fund, a US portfolio run by JP Morgan which invested Dollars 175m in Mr Conde's bank. The summer of 1993 saw Mr Conde at the pinnacle of his professional and social career. He entertained the Spanish royals aboard his yacht. A few weeks earlier the irrepressible Mr Conde had received an honorary doctorate from Madrid University and had delivered a lecture on the responsibilities of civil society to an audience that included fellow bank chairmen, media moguls, members of the government, ambassadors and King Juan Carlos himself. It all ended suddenly when the Bank of Spain moved against Mr Conde. What has happened between Mr Conde's dramatic removal from Banesto and the formal accusation delivered to the Madrid high court is that a tale of bad banking has become one of fraudulent financing. Last December the Bank of Spain said it had acted against Mr Conde because of 'gross negligence' in the running of Banesto. In June the Bank of Spain reported that Banesto's problems appeared to have been based on issues that went well beyond mismanagement. Two weeks after he was ousted from Banesto Mr Conde rejected the Bank of Spain's evaluation of Banesto's loan portfolio and claimed that he was on course fully to restore the bank's balance sheet under a rescue plan agreed with JP Morgan. In September Mr Conde published a book that restated these claims and added new ones: his downfall had been plotted by those in the establishment who feared his political ambitions. However over the past months the public prosecutor, with the aid of two Bank of Spain inspectors and of the new team running Banesto, has built up a case which alleges that Mr Conde and his associates enriched themselves at the expense of Banesto's shareholders. Members of the separate parliamentary inquiry into Banesto's collapse, and who are due to issue their report soon, say they have reached the same conclusion. Banesto's present chairman Mr Alfredo Saenz told the parliamentary commission last month: 'In Banesto there have been cases in which money has not been lost; it has disappeared and somebody has it.' Unravelling Mr Conde's business dealings in Banesto will occupy judge Garca Castellon for months. The judicial proceedings will backtrack on a trail that started in 1987 when Mr Conde and a partner sold their bulk chemicals company and used the the proceeds of the Pta65bn disposal to buy into Banesto, making Mr Conde chairman.</p>

Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is,  perhaps, the strongest politician among CIS presidents, proved  to the Kremlin these months which are far from being a  honeymoon, that it is necessary for Russian to reckon with him.  [sentence as received]    "Besides, experts united in praising the successes of the  Kazakhstan president's Western tours, including his visit to the  United States.    "Of course, there is a way to `neutralise' Nazarbayev by  undermining stability in his coutnry -- and some in Moscow  already tried to do that.    "However, no other country in the world should be more  interested in a strong and stable Kazakhstan than Russia, since  the newly-independent state has become the most reliable buffer  between Russian and explosive Central Asia.    "It is now Kazakshtan, not Russia, that `keeps the shield'  between Europe and Asia while setting an example of well-wishing  cooperation between the two continents on one territory".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Nazarbayev's visit:    "Life itself unavoidably prompts our two countries to  cooperate. If the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan succeed in  laying a political basis for joint work, transnational  financial-and-industrial groups may well become the locomotive  which will haul the economies of the two countries from the  crisis."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the Baykonur future:    "The social welfare sector functions and spacecraft are  launched due to Russia's space defence forces. The world-known  space port is almost completely maintained by Russia.    "But it is noteworthy that while Russia has been maintaining  Baykonur, Kazakhstan was conducting negotiations on how to  entice either the United States or Ukraine into leasing it. It  was not fortuitous that at first there was talk in Alma Ata  [Almaty] that the 1992 agreement does not accord with  Kazakhstan's interests. Later on, there emerged an idea of  establishing an international consortium on the basis of  Baykonur with no prospects for Russia's advantages either over  ex-Soviet republics or the other space-faring nations headed by  the U.S."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on a Cossack picketing of Kazakhstan  embassy:    "The Cossack Union arranged the picketing of the embassy of  Kazakhstan. The picketing coinciced with Nursultan Nazarbayev's  arrival in Moscow. B. Suprunyuk, leader of the Russian  Community of Northern Kazakhstan, and V. Latynin, ataman  (chieftain) of the Moscow branch of the Cossack Union, handed  over a message, addressed to the presidents of the Russian  Federation and Kazakhstan, to the embassy.    "The message points out in particular that participants in a  recent roundtable meeting in Omsk on the subject `the problems  of the Russians in Kazakhstan and of Kazakhs in Russia' believe  that Kazakh laws and the consitution have wrongfully divided the  country's law in provisions concerning the `indigenous' and  `non-indigenous' population. The Russians in that republic are  denied dual citizenship. Kazakhstan is the world's only country  where the activities of the Russian community, Cossack and  Slavic associations are banned juridically."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian First  Lady Naina Yeltsin who said, in particular: "Reading newspapers,  one gathers the impression that Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin]  does not want people to live a better and easier life. But how  can this be done for everyone and at once? Who will find a  magic way to turn millions of people into millionaires? Alas,  no such programmes have been suggested".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered  submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea five years ago:    "A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is more than  probable. This is an ecologicl time-bomb which may go off in a  matter of days, not months or weeks.    "In the event of multiple discharges of plutonium from the  sunken submarine's nuclear missiles -- such discharges may  continue for several years -- strong underwater currents, which  in the area reach a speed of 1.5 metre per second and which  change their course several times a day, would lead to a rapid  contamination of several thousand square kilometres of the  seabed. Considering that plutonium's period of semi-decay is  24,000 years, the sea in that sector would turn out to be unfit  for fisheries over a span of 600-700 years".    TRUD runs an interview with Yuriy Shchapov, deputy chairman  of the Committee for Economic Reform, who said as follows:  "People who are now in power at all levels do not want,  naturally, to lose it. What can they do to secure that? First  of all, to impose a state of emergency and introduce a  dictatorship. The president is unlikely to become a dictator....    "The second way is to stir up inter-regional conflicts which  may lead to a civil war. Neither the former nor the latter  should be allowed to happen."    PRAVDA on coup rumours in Russia:    "A coup scenario has been regarded too gravely in the top  echelons of power in Russia. Political detection came into play  right away...    "Those who assumed the emergence in their minds of designs  which were read prior to realisation reacted anxiously and  painfully to the coup scenario".</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI THREATENS BONN ON PLANT FIRE;  </P> <P> LIBYA: THE STRONGMAN SAYS HE WILL RETALIATE IF WEST GERMANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR  DAMAGE TO THE SUSPECTED POISON GAS FACILITY.  </P> <P> Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi threatened Thursday to retaliate against West  Germany if that country helped to instigate a fire at a controversial chemical  plant near Tripoli, but he angrily denied that Libya had been producing  chemical weapons at the facility.  </P> <P> Although Kadafi stopped short of directly accusing West Germany of a role in  the crippling fire, hundreds of Libyan demonstrators massed outside the West  German Embassy in Tripoli on Thursday, declaring that West German intelligence  agents were responsible.  </P> <P> As to whether the plant turned out chemical weapons, Kadafi repeated his  country's denials.  </P> <P> "If Libya could manufacture them, it would not have hesitated," he said in a  statement broadcast by Tripoli Radio. "However, Libya on its own and by its own  efforts needs another 20 years to produce a chemical bomb."  </P> <P> He went on to offer a multimillion-dollar contract "to anyone who could build a  chemical factory for Libya."  </P> <P> Kadafi pointedly did not mention the extent of the damage from the Wednesday  morning industrial fire at the plant near Rabta, about 60 miles southwest of  Tripoli, where U.S. officials believe Libya has produced deadly mustard gas and  nerve gas since last year.  </P> <P> U.S. and Arab authorities said there are indications that the plant, which  Libya insists is used only to manufacture pharmaceuticals, was heavily damaged  by fire, and Libya's official news agency Jana reported, "Most of the factory  has been destroyed."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the agency had accused Israel and the United States of sabotaging  the plant, but Kadafi's subsequent statement targeted only West Germany. After  more than 1,000 Libyan demonstrators marched outside the West German Embassy, a  diplomatic source in Tripoli said the Libyans accused West German intelligence  agents of leaking details about the plant's design to the United States,  implying that U.S. agents could then have sabotaged the plant.  </P> <P> "If the investigation under way confirms the involvement of West German  intelligence in an action inside Libya, the economic presence of Germany will  be eliminated from Libya," Kadafi warned.  </P> <P> Demonstrators outside the embassy carried signs proclaiming "Germans Are Spies  and Liars," "Germans Out" and "Germany Down, Kadafi's Our Leader," prompting  the Foreign Ministry in Bonn to summon a Libyan diplomat and complain about  harassment of West German diplomats. Bonn's embassy in Tripoli delivered a  response denying any complicity in the fire.  </P> <P> "The accusation lacks reality, and . . . any suggestion that any German citizen  or West German intelligence was involved (is) pure invention," a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said in Bonn.  </P> <P> Israel and the United States have also denied any involvement. U.S. officials  acknowledged that Israel has both the capability and the motive to destroy the  plant but said they had no information to link Israel to the incident.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said they have received credible reports that Libyan authorities  arrested several suspects Wednesday on suspicion of involvement in the fire.  </P> <P> The U.S. government has made no secret of its opposition to the chemical plant,  and one U.S. official responded privately Thursday to news of the fire with the  happy observation that "the 'Force' is with us."  </P> <P> Official Washington reaction, however, was much more neutral.  </P> <P> "We don't know the origins of the fire," White House Press Secretary Marlin  Fitzwater told reporters in Washington. "We don't know if it was sabotage. We  don't have any idea who did it. . . . Somebody could have knocked over a  kerosene lamp or something."  </P> <P> In fact, "a lot of people" in the intelligence agencies believe that the fire  was caused by an industrial accident, said one Administration official privy to  intelligence reports on the issue. "They have had at least two" accidents in  the past, the official noted, adding that "it would be consistent with the  pattern."  </P> <P> One of the accidents, two years ago, led to the release of gas and the killing  of a large number of dogs in the vicinity of the plant.  </P> <P> When that accident occurred, workers at the plant made frantic telephone calls  to the firm in West Germany that helped in the construction. The calls were  intercepted by U.S. agents and were a prime source of U.S. information that the  plant was, in fact, producing gas and that the West German company had been  involved. The firm, Imhausen-Chemie, is under investigation by the Bonn  government over the affair.  </P> <P> The official cautioned, however, that the accident theory on the fire was not a  "consensus view" and that some analysts continue to believe that the plant was  sabotaged.  </P> <P> American officials based their damage estimates on satellite photographs of the  plant. Fitzwater said that damage to the plant appeared to be so serious that  the facility is not able to function. "Common sense would tell you it's not  functioning," he said.  </P> <P> A senior Egyptian intelligence official said Thursday: "What we know is there  is big damage."  </P> <P> But Arab authorities have been unable to secure reliable information about the  extent of the damage or whether anyone was injured, the Egyptian official said.  "It's impossible," he said. " . . . It's in the desert; nobody knows."  </P> <P> The British news service Reuters quoted unidentified Libyan officials as saying  two people were killed in the fire, but the Libyan news agency said later that  there were no casualties. U.S. officials said they had no firm information on  civilian casualties around the plant, but they noted that fire would not be  expected to spread poison gas.  </P> <P> "Mustard and nerve chemical agents are highly flammable and easily destroyed by  fire," said a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Robin Higgins. "The hotter the fire, the  faster the agents would be destroyed. Chemical contamination seems highly  unlikely, since the best way of getting rid of mustard gas is by burning."  </P> <P> Diplomats in Tripoli and elsewhere in the region said a variety of rumors were  circulating, including reports that a commando team had crossed the border into  Libya from Tunisia. But none ruled out the possibility of an industrial  accident. In Cairo, an anonymous caller claiming to represent the previously  unknown National Wing of the Libyan Army, perhaps a Libyan dissident group,  claimed in a call to a West German television office to have started the fire  "after making sure the plant was making chemical and nuclear material."  </P> <P> Egypt's semiofficial Middle East News Agency carried a statement from the  Cairo-based Egyptian Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity condemning what the  group termed an apparent act of sabotage "aimed at distracting world attention  away from the chemical and nuclear weapon arsenals that Israel possesses."  </P> <P> "We do not exclude the involvement of the United States and Israel in this  sabotage, particularly as President Bush had threatened to launch a military  action against the plant," the statement said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials last week refused to rule out use of military force against the  Libyan plant, which Fitzwater described as "dangerous and becoming more so."  West Germany charged in a statement last week that Libya had produced 30 tons  of mustard gas in a test run at the facility.  </P> <P> But Kadafi said Thursday that Libya has signed agreements banning the  proliferation of "weapons of total destruction and their use" and that Libya  would be entitled to build such a facility under international law.  </P> <P> "I challenge any company or state to come to Libya to build a chemical  factory," he said. "Then I would personally sign the contract without  hesitation, and I would have paid 1 billion to anyone who could build a  chemical factory for Libya, because the world has not yet forbidden that." In  Kadafi's offer of money, it was unclear what currency he referred to.  </P> <P> International law prohibits the use of chemical weapons but not their  manufacture or stockpiling. The United States and Soviet Union both have  sizable stockpiles of the weapons.  </P> <P> "Libya is a civilized and Muslim country which fears only God and respects  international treaties and laws," he added. "There is nothing to be gained from  being hostile to Libya. What is beneficial is to sit down and to negotiate with  Libya."  </P> <P> If Kadafi carries out his threat to eliminate West Germany's economic presence  from his country, the loss would not be vital to the West Germans, whose  interests there are confined to oil exploration on a relatively small scale and  a limited involvement in contracting. East Germany, on the other hand, has long  had close ties to the Kadafi regime, and its security forces have been deeply  involved in providing him protection.  </P> <P> U.S.-Libyan relations in recent years have been vitriolic, with Washington  accusing Kadafi's regime of supporting international terrorism. American and  Libyan warplanes have tangled over the Mediterranean on two occasions, with the  loss of four Libyan planes. In April, 1986, responding to reports of Libyan  involvement in the bombing of a West German discotheque that took the lives of  two Americans, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi, with 37 Libyans and  two American airmen reported killed.  </P> <P> One senior U.S. official said the apparent large-scale damage to the plant has  "opened up a whole new set of options" for the American government in denying  Libya the ability to produce chemical weapons.  </P> <P> While U.S. efforts in recent months have focused on rallying international  support to deny Libya critical "precursor chemicals" and the missile technology  to deliver chemical weapons, the fire could allow the United States to "start  from the beginning" and try to prevent the Libyans from getting the material to  rebuild its factory.  </P> <P> But the official stressed that the incident was the result of a happy  coincidence, not U.S. sabotage.  </P> <P> "Isn't life wonderful?" the jubilant official asked. "The 'Force' is with us.  We're on a roll."  </P> <P> Times staff writers David Lauter, Melissa Healy and Doyle McManus in Washington  and William Tuohy in Bonn contributed to this article.  </P></p>

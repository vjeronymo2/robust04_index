Ford said the SI presidential office, at a meeting in Tokyo  on May 10, will formally replace Craxi, who is mired in  kickbacks scandals at home and is under investigation by  magistrates in several cities on suspicion of violating party  financing laws and receiving bribes.    The continued stay by Craxi as SI vice president has caused  growing controversy in Italy. The Northern League yesterday  criticized the Left Democrat Party, formerly the Italian  Communist Party, for "not having raised objections" to having  Italy represented in the organization by a discredited  politician. The Left Democrats responded by noting they had  already raised the issue with the SI president, Pierre Mauroy.    Today, Ford said Craxi will no longer hold any post in the  SI  and that the vice presidency should go to another Italian party  affiliated to the organization; "the most appropriate person,"  he said, "is the party's secretary, Achille Occhetto."    Craxi was elected SI vice president in 1992, when he was  still Socialist Party chief and just as the nation's bribery  scandals were beginning to emerge. He now faces more than a  dozen possible indictments.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belarus: Emergency </F> Situation as Means of Managing Economy"]    [Text] "Daylight robbery" is how Belarusian businessmen  assessed the actions of Kebich's cabinet, with regard to  commercial structures. Finding itself in a grave situation, the  government has found a way out in confiscating currency funds  from economic players.    On 5 March, the Belarusian Council of Ministers issued a  decree "on emergency measures for the Republic to reduce debts  to the Russian Federation for gas and other energy carriers."  In accordance with this document, 20 percent of funds in freely  convertible currency and Russian rubles are being deducted from  the accounts of all enterprises. It is characteristic that the  accounts of Belarusian economic players in both republican and  foreign banks are being cleaned out. This action is reticently  referred to in the decree as "hiring for a period of three  months under government guarantee."    But those were only the first flowers. On 11 March, the  government published an addition to this decree. Now all  enterprises, including joint ventures, must hand over their  March profit in freely convertible currency and Russian rubles  to state currency funds. The Council of Minister kindly  promises to compensate for losses in Belarusian rubles at the  Republic's national bank's exchange rate of 2 February 1944.  The comrades from the government were obviously modest in  selecting that date. Why not set 7 November 1917 as the starting  point (or rather reckoning point)?    The arbitrary cessation of trading at the interbank currency  exchange until 1 April was the logical continuation of the  Council of Ministers' actions. Now, determining the exchange  rate for foreign currencies against the Belarusian ruble is the  exclusive prerogative of the Republic's national bank.    Although the government's actions are invested with  outwardly  legal forms, this alters nothing. Essentially, it is a case of  the nationalization of a substantial proportion of the funds  belonging to commercial structures. It is not difficult to  predict where this will lead.    "We are almost guaranteed a couple of suicides," Mikhail  Shevelzon, vice president of the Belarus union of entrepreneurs,  believes. "People will simply be unable to settle their debts.  If the state cannot pay its debts, a specific businessmen is  obliged to be answerable in any situation. In addition,  according to my calculations, about 70 percent of Belarusian  enterprises' capital is already working outside the republic.  As a result of the government's actions, this figure will  obviously grow. The situation that has taken shape will also  undoubtedly affect foreign investments."    Naturally, the Belarusian Government does not want to  demonstrate so graphically to Russia, with whom it actually  intends to unite, but the Minsk bureaucrats obviously do not  understand that in our case the exchange is only a reflection of  several other processes. In particular, according to the figures  of the BELORUSSKAYA DELOVAYA GAZETA, 2.3 trillion rubles in  unsupported credits were earmarked in January-February to  subsidize agricultural enterprises, to cover the budget deficit,  and for some other purposes, which is nearly twice last year's  emission. Now, agrarian experts are demanding a further 6  trillion. But the government seems to believe that unification  will write off everything and the Belarusian bureaucrats will  yet again be able to enter paradise on the Russians' backs.    Over the weekend the cash dollar exchange rate rose from  8,500 to 11,000 Belarusian rubles. Comment is superfluous.  Meanwhile, it emerged that the World Bank credit intended to  support the Belarusian ruble exchange rate had been given out by  the government to pay directly for energy carriers. This was  announced by Stanislav Bogdankevich at a conference of the  National Bank leadership and chairman of the boards of  commercial banks. This fact will hardly give rise to a positive  response among international financial circles.    The Belarusian Government is deceiving not only Western  bankers, but also its own fellow citizens. In February, from  the platform of the Supreme Soviet Vyacheslav Kebich swore that  there would be no increase in prices for basic foodstuffs before  the unification of the monetary systems. But on Saturday a loaf  of bread was sold in stores for 300 rubles instead of Friday's  price of 120 rubles.    To avoid undesirable consequences, the government announced  in advance that as of 1 April (we will have a good laugh then)  the minimum wage will be raised from 30,000 to 60,000 rubles.  In this case, it is appropriate to ask: Where is the money  coming from? Are we going on a spree at Russia's expense again?    What is happening today is only the start of the collapse.  The Belarusian noose has been coiling long enough, but the  finale has nonetheless arrived. A natural finale.    So far, it is unclear how exactly the union of entrepreneurs  will react to the Council of Ministers' March decrees. Perhaps  it will adopt a tough stance, but it will hardly be able to  influence the government.    On the other hand, the businessmen themselves have already  drawn the necessary conclusions. A leader of a large commercial  structure who wishes to remain anonymous ("I may still have to  work in this country") told an IZVESTIYA correspondent: "No one  intends to feed this government. Any normal economic player  will stop showing his currency profit. This is robbery. The  nomenklatura undertook this step out of despair: The  incompetents from the ranks of former party members are simply  incapable of anything else. Now they have one commodity left  that they can sell -- sovereignty -- and the status of a  province in the Russian empire suits them very well."    The government has made its move, but what next? Let us  allow that it succeeds at least partly in extinguishing the debt  for energy carriers. But given the present state of the  Belarusian economy, in a couple of months everything will be the  way it was before, and then what? I very much doubt that  entrepreneurs will give the Council of Ministers the opportunity  to rob them again.    Alas, it looks as though the principle "if we can last the  day we can hold out for the night" is prevailing in Kebich's  cabinet. As before, the desired unification of monetary systems  is looming. But even if this dubious measure does take place,  will the prime minister's team survive until then?    It is no accident that the currency exchange auctions have  been repealed. Their cessation was preceded by a scandal at the  last auctions, which was held 10 March. Some 40 minutes before  they started, representatives of the National Bank, citing a  letter from the bank's chairman, Stnbislav Bogdankevich,  demanded that currency purchasers supply copies of the contracts  for purchasing goods abroad. No one had heard a word beforehand  about the chief banker's message and so entirely naturally no  one had the documents. After lengthy disputes, the auction  began, but after the dollar exchange rate had risen from 9,120  to 12,200 Belarusian rubles the results of the auction were  simply revoked. To avoid such undesirable figures in future, the  auctions were simply canceled. For three weeks for the time  being but it is by no means certain the exchange will resume  work 1 April.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oil Pipeline for Greece Through </F> Bulgaria Planned"]    [Text] The construction of a Bulgarian-Greek oil pipeline  from Burgas to the Aegean port of Alexandroupolis, an idea  launched last month during the talks in Moscow between Greek  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, will neutralize Turkey's oil ambitions in the region.  In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of  transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I  KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes.    The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria,  is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist  strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims  live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes.    Athens views the idea of constructing a Greek-Bulgarian oil  pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea as a counterpoint  to the Turkish strategic plans aimed at establishing eventual  control over the export of Russian oil. According to Athens,  Turkey also aims at establishing control over the oil of the  former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea.    By constructing the Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline Russia  would  be able to free itself from its dependence on Turkey and  simultaneously, the strategic positions of Greece and Bulgaria  will be strengthened.</p>

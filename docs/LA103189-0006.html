			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMAL CLEON FRAZE; INVENTED PULL-TAB OPENER FOR CANS  </P> <P> Ermal Cleon Fraze, 76, who invented the pull-tab opener used on beer and soft  drink cans. Fraze, an engineer, was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., and moved  to Dayton, Ohio, where he assembled novelties for Cracker Jack boxes. In 1950,  he started Dayton Reliable Tool &amp; Manufacturing Co. Nine years later while  on a family picnic, Fraze had to use a car bumper to open a can of beer because  he had no opener. Thinking there must be an easier way to open cans, he came up  with the pull tab. Fraze obtained the first patent for a pull-tab can in 1963  and said then that he was not the first to envision an easy-open can but that  he was the one who developed a way to attach the tab to the top of the can.  According to figures provided by his company, which receives royalties from the  tabs' manufacturer, Aluminum Co. of America, about 150 billion easy-open cans  were used last year.

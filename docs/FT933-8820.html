			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Driven through palaces - Patricia Morison makes a plea for more time to stand and stare You love looking at great paintings. Should you then go to Buckingham Palace to see the Queen's pictures? Other things being equal, of course you should because the Picture Gallery is just wonderful. However, the decision whether or not to 'do' Buckingham Palace must depend on the time available and sheer physical stamina. How physically uncomfortable can one be and still derive pleasure from art? It could so easily be different, not just at Buckingham Palace but at cultural monuments everywhere, if only cultural tourism was not focused on the mass-experience. Although Buckingham Palace is mercifully not quite as popular as some had projected, there were still 6,000 visitors last Wednesday, which is a lot for a building not purpose-built as a museum. You should expect to queue for between 60 and 90 minutes for your ticket; it is possible to have the whole thing over in a morning if you are near the front of the queue by around 8am. Luring you on is the thought of the Picture Gallery where this year there are some dozen splendid masterpieces; Guercino's 'Libyan Sibyl', Guido Reni's sensual 'Cleopatra', the utterly chaste Agatha Bas as portrayed by Rembrandt, Rubens's 'Farm at Laeken' and 'St George and the Dragon', together with works by de Hooch, Cuyp, and Claude Lorrain. Other rooms have memorable paintings and some surprises, such as finding no less than three women artists: the Renaissance wonder Sophonisba da Anguissola; Angelica Kaufmann (her large German duchess has the Throne Room to herself); and a marble statue of Princess Louise made in 1877 by obscure Mary Thornycroft. However, the Picture Gallery is the thing, perhaps above all for the chance to see together two of the most famous and haunting images of royalty ever made, Van Dyck's 'Great Piece', Charles I with Henrietta Maria and the two eldest children, faces the great equestrian portrait of Charles and his riding master, M. de St Antoine. (The second, larger portrait of the king on a dun charger is in the National Gallery.) These monumental paintings would be better seen from much further away, as the artist intended and as they were at one time displayed in the Van Dyck Room at Windsor Castle. Even so, it is marvellous to compare these two very different images of a doomed king. Royalists will find them the more poignant for being still within palace walls and just a stroll away from the Banqueting House where Charles's head was struck from his shoulders. So far, so very good, but the drawback is that visitors have to move in one direction only. Anyone who wants to look properly must be for ever criss-crossing the gallery which is a wretched way to see paintings. They will permit no looping back for a last look, a particular hardship in the case of Rembrandt's small 'Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb', to my mind one of the loveliest things he ever did. On a pragmatic view, the Queen's generosity in lending works from her vast collection - for example, to The Queen's Pictures at the National Gallery last year - lessens the urgency of going to the Palace. Both my favourite Rembrandt and 'Agatha Bas' were widely seen in the 1991 Rembrandt show. The third terrific Rembrandt, 'The Shipbuilder and his Wife', was shown at around the same period in the Queen's Gallery beside Buckingham Palace. For 30 years, the Queen's Gallery has been making the royal collections accessible, although as a rule its shows are very little publicised. It is there that you will find Vermeer's 'Lady at the Virginals' in an exhibition on George III and Consul Smith previously noticed on this page. Even so, I hope that the Buckingham Palace visit will also become a regular feature of London's cultural resources, as the summer visit to the Palais du Roi is in Brussels. (Will public opinion prise open the Prince of Liechtenstein's collection at Vaduz Castle?) I would also like to see special access for people who are not interested to flow by, gazing open-mouthed at the mirrors and chandeliers, but want instead to concentrate on the art treasures. Some country houses with important art collections do offer 'connoisseurs' trips', although not nearly enough. They do at Boughton House in Northamptonshire, a palatial building of exceptional beauty which is only open on August afternoons. The intact 17th-century panelled State Rooms with their tapestries are protected by being shown as part of the longer tour. I see the royal palaces as a classic example of the need to offer the public a split-level, sheep-and-goats kind of cultural tourism. Separating the serious from the faintly curious visitor preserves the quality of the experience and should become part of the strategy for protecting prime cultural destinations while actually increasing public access and awareness. Unfortunately, the sole object of the people who run many tourist venues is to herd visitors round in droves, adding on so-called 'attractions' which in reality amount to force-feeding us gimmicky, patronising, low-grade pap. How great an improvement it would be if, instead, every great castle, palace, or great house offered a choice of experience. Whether at Versailles, Wilton House or Castle Howard, there ought to be a 'happy hour'. Enthusiasts, who may have hankered to see a place for years, could be assured of the peace to look, savour, and commit the experience to memory. Of course, the motive for opening Buckingham Palace is financial and not philanthropic. It might reduce the takings to lay on something special for people with a serious interest, even though they would be asked to pay sweetly for the privilege. (I see no reason why a private view of a great art collection should not cost as much as a good seat at the opera.) However, there is also the matter of popularity. It is surely no bad investment if in future years a trip to the palace could be made more appealing to the Queen's more educated subjects.</p>

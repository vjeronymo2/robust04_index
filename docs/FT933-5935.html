			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: 'Appalling' cost if trade talks fail MR Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, yesterday urged governments to face down vested interests and 'place political leadership before expediency' in a warning that the costs of failure to complete the world trade talks would be 'appallingly high'. Before leaving for Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior ministers, he told Gatt's trade negotiations committee that the 116-nation Uruguay Round would end 'for good or bad' on December 15, when US fast-track negotiating authority expires. There would be no extension. The talks, launched in Uruguay in 1986, are already three years behind schedule. A ministerial conference has been tentatively scheduled for April 1994 at which the Uruguay Round agreements would be signed, along with a declaration and future work programme. These are expected to foreshadow negotiations on such issues as competition policy and the links between trade and environment, not covered by the present Round. In a speech for delivery to German industrialists in Cologne last night, Mr Sutherland called on German industrial and political leaders to stand up and fight for a successful Uruguay Round. He said the Round was not an 'optional extra' to the existing multilateral system but 'arguably the most important and urgent issue' on the world agenda today. 'It is very hard to understand how some people can be so short-sighted as to want to put all this at risk by pandering to a relatively small number of inefficient producers,' Mr Sutherland said. He did not refer directly to France, whose apparent recruitment of Mr Kohl last week in support of its hardline stance on agriculture is seen as posing a serious threat to the round. Over the next two months, trade negotiators in Geneva will focus on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services, finalising the rules on services, and sorting out some institutional aspects of the proposed multilateral trade organisation and dispute settlement mechanism. Other problems with the draft package of Uruguay Round agreements would be dealt with 'at the appropriate time', Mr Sutherland said. Ariane Genillard adds from Bonn: Mr Sutherland carried his message in the afternoon to Bonn, where he received full support from Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign affairs minister. Both have opposed a renegotiation of the Blair House agreement, despite Mr Kohl's recent questioning of the validity of the accord. Mr Rexrodt stressed yesterday that his position on the Blair House agreement remained unchanged and called for a rapid conclusion of the Gatt trade talks. Mr Kinkel also reiterated yesterday his firm opposition to any renegotiation of the accord. The real test of Germany's determination to support French calls for a watering down of the farm accord will come today as Mr Sutherland meets Mr Kohl.</p>

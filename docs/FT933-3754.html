			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on pensions I RECEIVE two pensions, one from the state and the other from a company. The former is paid into my bank account every 28 days and my company pension every calendar month. Thus, there are 12 payments a year from my company pension and 13 from the state. When the 13th payment of the state pension was made this year, it was credited to my account on April 8 1993 which, in my opinion, is the tax year 1993/94. The tax office concerned will not agree and is taxing me as if I received it weekly and in the tax year 1992/93. But the 13th monthly payment was not available to me until after the start of the new tax year on April 6 1993. The inspector is right. Section 41(2) of the Finance Act 1989 says: 'As regards any particular year of assessment, income tax shall be charged on the amount of the pension or other benefit accruing in respect of the year; and this shall apply irrespective of when any amount is actually paid in respect of the pension or other benefit.' This rule applies to (a) a pension, stipend or annuity chargeable under paragraph 2, 3 or 4 of Schedule E; (b) a pension or annual payment chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 133 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (voluntary pensions); (c) income support chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 151 of that act; (d) a pension chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 597 of that act (retirement benefit schemes); and (e), a benefit chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 617(1) of that act (social security benefits). Income tax is levied according to arbitrary rules laid down by parliament and it is rarely possible to deduce one's tax liability by the application of logic or by extrapolation. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

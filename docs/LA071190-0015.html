			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: POLLEN ALLERGIES  </P> <P> Question: Hay fever runs in my family. However, when I get together with my  brothers, sisters and cousins, I find that we all have different reactions.  </P> <P> Since we all have hay fever, we all live in the same neighborhood, and we're  all exposed to the same air, why do we have different reactions?  </P> <P> Answer: Not every hay fever patient is affected by every type of pollen.  Patients will react only when the particular tree or weed to which they are  sensitive is pollinating. For example, very allergic individuals may be  troubled with hay fever over a period of months, while others may be bothered  for only a few weeks. Those sensitive to a particular allergen may experience  hay fever symptoms for only a relatively brief period.  </P> <P> Although you and the other members of your family live in the same  neighborhood, you are not necessarily allergic to the same pollen, and this  accounts for the difference in symptoms.  </P></p>

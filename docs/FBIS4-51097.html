			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lin Jianhua (2651 1696 5478): "Develop Party </F> Schools' Role as `Fronts' and `Furnaces,' and Comprehensively  Upgrade Cadres' Theoretical Quality"]    [Excerpt] The provincial party school work conference  concluded on 12 May after a three-day session.    The conference discussed ways to conscientiously implement  the national party school work conference with the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee and, based on Jilin's reality, ways to study and  address the new issues on the current party school work, to  thoroughly probe the new measures and new ideas for the reform  and development of party school work, and to promote Jilin's  party school work in a down-to-earth manner.    He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  attended and gave an important speech at the conference. He  said: Cadres at all levels should attach importance to and  intensify study and take the initiative in arming their minds  with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. China's reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization are in a crucial period for major change.  Correctly understanding the situation we are faced with,  addressing the issues on the way of advancement in a timely and  effective manner, and arming cadres with new concepts and new  knowledge constitute the most important link. Leading cadres,  in particular, cannot assume the important leadership task if  they do not intensify study because "those in the dark are in no  position to light the way for others."    In today's historical conditions, our intensive study, with  the focus on new historical tasks, chiefly includes Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; theories on the socialist market economy and  the knowledge on linkage to the world market economy; knowledge  on modern science and technology; and the laws and regulations  reflecting China's economic and political activities of the  present stage, especially economic laws.    Party schools at all levels should conscientiously implement  the theory of integrating theory with practice and fully develop  their role as "fronts" and "furnaces." They should help cadres  at all levels embrace the new ideas and concepts and the way of  thinking needed in developing the socialist market economy; help  cadres probe the new ideas for reform, opening up, and  development of the socialist market economy; and help cadres  uplift spirit and establish and maintain a good mind-set.    Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership  and regard the work to make party schools successful as an  important link of strengthening party building. Strengthened  leadership of party committees over party school work is an  important guarantee to make party schools successful. Party  committees' leadership over party school work chiefly consists  of five aspects: timely relay of the guidelines of the important  policy decisions and instructions of the party Central Committee  and local party committees, guidance for party schools to  understand and adhere to the correct orientation for running  schools and educational principles, and steadfastness in taking  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the basic guiding principle for running party  schools; formulation of the plans for leading cadres at all  levels and reserve cadres to undergo training at party schools  and guidance for party schools to appraise and examine the  performance of cadres during their study at party schools in  line with the principle of combining training with use of cadres  and the requirements on cadres in the new period; conscientious  selection of cadres and establishment of rationally structured  and united leading bodies which have good political quality,  adhere to the party's basic line, have a high level of  understanding of Marxist and Leninist theories, and know the  work of party schools; and supervision and inspection of the  work of party schools, timely study of and timely solutions to  the major issues party schools encounter, participation in and  guidance to party schools' research on some major theoretical  and practical issues; and mobilizing party committees and  governments to support party school work, adhere to the  principle of "letting party committees run party schools," and  invest willingly in gradually improving the teaching conditions  of party schools.    In conclusion, He Zhukang hoped that comrades of party  committees and party schools would seize the opportunity, uplift  the spirit, hold the heavy tasks entrusted by this era, and  raise the education of party schools to a new level.

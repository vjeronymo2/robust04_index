			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>   [Excerpts] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 16 Jan (NOTIMEX) --  The amnesty proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for  the people involved in the Chiapas State rebellion is the "most  important decision" for attaining peace in the area,  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said here today.    "The most important decision to contribute to the  reestablishment of peace has been made today. It is a risky  moment, because there could be provocations aimed at undermining  the peace process," the peace and reconciliation commissioner  said in Chiapas.    [Passage omitted]    Regarding the timeframe for the presidential initiative,  Camacho said it is "an amnesty for what has already taken place,  and that is the reason for the timeframe" set by Salinas de  Gortari.    [Passage omitted]    During a news conference, Camacho spoke of the first steps  and signs of conciliation that he has received without saying he  has received direct messages from the spokesmen of the armed  group in response to his calls to dialogue and reconciliation.    "We are negotiating through facts, with messages of concord  in both directions, which is already yielding its first  results," he said.    The National Congress, which must ratify the presidential  proposal, now plays "a leading role for attaining peace, as the  nation's general feeling is for reconciliation," the former  foreign minister said.    He said the amnesty will ease "the return of members of the  self- styled Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] to their  communities and the reintegration to their jobs, which required  that we advance in the topic of guarantees."    To attain the pacification of Chiapas State, it will be  necessary to "set the bases for a peace with justice, guide the  changes politically," and "favor the construction of channels  for the effective and authentic political participation of the  different indigenous groups," he added.    He reiterated that he believes the armed group "is basically  a Mexican and Chiapan movement."    The return of the kidnapped former governor of Chiapas  State,  Absalon Castellanos, would be a conciliatory message from the  armed group, Solis said.    "The EZLN is an organization that, regardless of methods, of  which we disapprove, has shown it has political clarity;  therefore, I hope they realize that for their cause it is better  that General Castellanos be alive, not dead."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by John Hibbs: "Consumers Still Not Kings"] </F>   [Text] If the reader of this article can correctly answer  the following question then he or she has rare insight into  doing business in the Czech Republic.    The question is this: How many sales representatives work  for  Staropramen, the largest brewery in Prague?    Those who give an answer in the neighborhood of 40 to 50  make  an intelligent guess, as that is about how many front-line  salespeople work for similar-sized breweries in Amsterdam,  Munich, Bristol, St. Louis and Perth.    Those who answer with a number in the 90 to 120 range also  have a logical basis for their conclusion. Commonly, the  formerly state-run factories of Eastern and Central Europe  employ two or three times the number of workers as do their  Western counterparts.    But the truly shrewd observer of affairs in this part of the  world recognizes the hazards of automatically linking Western  operating practices to the situation here. This is particularly  so when it comes to the subject of marketing, which of course is  barely a four-year-old concept for Czechs.    Thus, the foreigner familiar with the way things are done  here would not be surprised at the number of sales reps at  Staropramen. That number is zero, zip, nada, none. Not a single  full-time employee at the brewery has the sole function of  making regular calls to either distributors or retailers.    How can this be? Staropramen is a professionally run,  century-old brewery with an excellent product. Its production  processes are modern and cost-efficient. Senior management is  motivated and the work force is diligent. So how can they not  have even one front-line sales specialist?    At first, those of us who are from the West might be tempted  to chuckle. After all, "everyone" understands that sales--and  salespeople--are the absolute lifeblood of any business.  "Everyone" knows that basic operating decisions are dictated by  the demands of the market, which must be monitored constantly  through face-to-face contact with customers.    "Everyone" knows this, provided of course that "everyone"  has  grown up in places where consumers are pampered by endless  supplies of goods and services. The West is where the butcher  works incredibly hard to provide the best meat, the baker the  best bread, and the candlestick maker the best candle. For those  who grew up where there were more plumbers than leaky faucets,  more mechanics than broken cars, more phones than callers, these  are simple truths. In the West, it is an unchallenged dictum  that the customer is king and that the road to wealth is open  only to those who strive for entrepreneurial excellence and aim  to leave the customer fully satisfied.    But "everyone" didn't grow up in that kind of environment.  For more than four decades, the Central and Eastern European  supplier was not just king but kingmaker. With goods always in  short supply, the customer was either ignored or looked down  upon. The masters were those who held the keys to the inventory;  the subject were the masses, who were always stuck on the  outside looking in.    This goes a long way toward explaining why people waiting in  line to pay for their groceries at the neighborhood  potraviny (grocery store) are so well-behaved or why  the waiter is so surly and shop hours so short. The imprint of  40 years of demand exceeding supply is deep, and lasting.    The men and women inside Staropramen were not inoculated  against this. It should be no wonder that, more often than not,  their customers are viewed as a nuisance. Or that sales tactics  commonly used by Anheuser-Busch and McDonald's are perceived as  frivolous and wasteful. What value can a salesperson's call  report have in a society indoctrinated to place such little  value on the customer?    Soon, of course, the rigors of capitalism will force  themselves on Prague's business managers. When this happens, as  it must, they will discover that the customer is fickle,  demanding and unbelievably smart. Then wise managers will listen  carefully to the message brought to them by their front-line  sales force.    The point of all this, it seems to me, is that the task for  us resident foreigners is never to forget that, for Staropramen  and other Czech enterprises, the cake has been turned upside  down. Putting the customer at the head of the parade is not  easily done, as proven before by the sharp guys in Detroit who  once ignored this basic requirement.    Seen in this light, what is astonishing is that change has  been so rapid. The progress so far is a near miracle. Perhaps  what is most in order is applause, not snickers.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The writer has 30 years' experience in the import-export  business.

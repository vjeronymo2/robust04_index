			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Shopkeeper who drove his Rolls to the brink - The bank told Kingsley Maine to sell his yacht and his car. He ignored their advice IN 1960, when Kingsley Maine was working as a carpenter in the police headquarters in Bridgend, he spent his two weeks' summer holidays running a small general provisions store. It was a typical, 1950s suburban shop with hardly any stock and run by an ageing widow. Maine increased the stock range by borrowing from his father's post office four miles away, and boosted the turnover from the average Pounds 50 to Pounds 120 in his first week. At the end of the second week, he resigned his job, borrowed Pounds 3,000 from Barclays, guaranteed by his father, and bought the business, which included a flat above the shop. Thirty years on, Maine has five stores. Their annual turnover will be about Pounds 6m this year. He has survived competition from the supermarket chains, in spite of being written off by a bank in the mid-1980s. His two sons provide the family backing that has enabled the company to expand and streamline its operation in a fiercely competitive market. The business has gone full-circle from a convenience store, through the traumas of competition through price cutting, and back to convenience trading, but with extended hours. The shops are open 8am to 10pm, 364 days a year. In 1963, after three years living in the flat above the first shop, the Maines were able to move to a nearby house. Takings were around Pounds 1,000 a week, allowing them a more comfortable lifestyle. The move left space for the shop to expand and become one of the first self-service shops in the area. With a further five years' confident trading behind him, and with an eye to expansion, Maine paid a deposit on a car showroom on the other side of the town. The bank was unimpressed with the development plan, considering it a poor location, but after much persuasion, Maine gained the cash. He joined Spar, the wholesale supply chain, to take advantage of its purchasing power and promotions and developed the 3,000 sq ft shop into a main food retailer, with self-service and four checkouts. Soon it was selling more than 40 sides of bacon a week and, in 10 years, the turnover built up to over Pounds 20,000 a week. He attempted to repeat the formula in nearby Porthcawl, but the store there struggled on turnover of just Pounds 3,000 a week, rarely covering overheads. This time the location was wrong. Business livened up only in the blizzard of 1978 when the town was cut off. The store was sold in 1981, never having made a profit. But a further venture in 1972 in the densely-populated Sandfields area in Aberavon was successful and profitable. By 1982, Maine's lifestyle included a Rolls Royce, a sea-front house in exclusive Rest Bay, Porthcawl, and a motor yacht in St Tropez. All this was threatened when competition arrived. The International Group, under the name Mainstock, opened the largest in-town food store in Britain, just a few hundred yards away from Maine's chief store in Bridgend. Weekly turnover in Bridgend slumped overnight from more than Pounds 20,000 to less than Pounds 12,000. The story was similar in Aberavon. Maine's shops had become outdated, and at his own admission, a mess. 'We were overstocked in many departments, many lines were being sold at minimal profit, it was clear that a major shake up was necessary for survival. But we were determined to come through it.' The initial Spar Driver scheme which offered lines at very low prices was a disaster and cut margins even further. Maine started monitoring stock levels. The results directed the next move away from food and into more profitable lines such as video tapes, drinks, and disposable household goods. This was coupled with extended hours and Sunday trading. Although the signs of recovery were evident, it took five years to produce a good set of accounts again. During this time, Maine's Barclays bank manager of 25 years retired, and competition from the multiples intensified. This prompted a curt letter from the newly-installed bank manager, declaring that it was impossible to compete with chains such as Tesco and Sainsbury. 'Sell the Rolls and the boat, and think about a smaller house,' was the only advice offered. Fortunately, the view was different from the National Westminster branch across the road. It had watched Maine for many years, and his accountant, Bill Mace, who had a long experience with shopkeepers, persuaded NatWest to take over the account. Maine's development programme for his shops was able to continue. Much of the finance came from the local Spar wholesaler Capper and Co, which arranged favourable leasing deals for modernising the stores. By the late 1980s, a system of bar-code scanning was installed which analysed each line by volume, profitability and shelf allocation. Professional stock and internal controls facilitated by efficient computerisation helped the company return to profitability. The link with Capper strengthened, and Maine now buys nearly 90 per cent of all goods from it. Such loyalty has shown great benefits this year with the 'purchase' of a further large store in the Uplands area of Swansea. Here the Spar formula had worked well in spite of the shoddy presentation of the well-located store. Capper bought the business from the previous owners for around Pounds 500,000 and has licensed it back to Maine, who will purchase it over the first two years, with an opportunity to buy the freehold later. The full Maine team, including Kingsley's wife Wendy, his daughter Lian and his sons Julian, Christopher and their wives, has set about revamping the new acquisition. 'We now have very sophisticated computerised systems and can produce management accounts within days after each quarter. We are far better placed to meet the price competition of the 1990s which is already most evident,' said Maine. Six months on, trade at the new shop is up 10 per cent, and Maine is buying Pounds 100,000 of goods a week from Capper. Six years after the move to NatWest, the business is showing a gross trading profit of 19 per cent on a Pounds 6m turnover. Maine still has the same Rolls, boat and house. He takes six weeks' holiday a year, but otherwise works every day and is in the Swansea shop each Sunday morning. KD Maine 14-16 Ewenny Road, Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, tel: 0656-655373</p>

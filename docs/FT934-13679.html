			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (6): Cutting raw material risks - Commodity products IN SPITE of low commodity prices in recent years, a range of innovative hedging arrangements offered by banks and brokers has appeared on the market. Some bankers see the slight upturn in commodity prices in recent months as an indication that a recovery has set in which could give a new boost to commodity swaps and over-the-counter derivatives. 'If base metals prices bottom out and we see a turnaround, the growth in that market could be huge as most consumers are currently not hedged,' said Mr Per Sekse, vice-president for commodity derivatives at Chemical Bank in London. Credit Lyonnais, the French investment bank, is so confident of finding new business in the commodity derivatives sector that it set up a new arm in September, Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives, to extend its involvement into structured finance deals. However, commodity prices have been depressed for several years and, overall, have declined again this year. Goldman Sachs's commodity index, which tracks the prices of a range of commodities from metals to energy and agricultural products, showed a 4.4 per cent decline in the year to the beginning of October. Goldman is forecasting a modest upturn in prices over the next six months, fuelled by supply-demand imbalances as low prices have not encouraged investment in new capacity. In a low price environment, commodity derivatives can allow a company to lock in a price - either for its raw material or for its sales - and at least meet its budget objectives when cashflow is stretched. By using OTC products, companies can also hedge to position themselves strategically in the market for a number of years ahead. These derivatives are often also traded on futures exchanges, but banks can cut individual deals in the OTC markets that extend years beyond the timescale offered by the traditional exchanges. The most sophisticated area of hedging in the OTC market is in the energy sector where the exchanges do not always provide products that cover parts of the refined oil barrel. For instance; although there is a thriving futures market for crude oil in London and New York and gas oil in New York, there is no exchange-traded futures contract for jet fuel. Mr Sekse describes how a leading oil company recently bought an option on the spread between jet fuel and gas oil. This covers the company's risk of hedging its jet fuel sales to airlines by using gas oil futures. The prices of jet fuel and gas oil are different, so the company runs a certain amount of risk of those prices diverging: that risk can be limited by buying a tailor-made option on the spread between the prices of the two fuels. Mr Chris Mason, managing director at Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives, says airlines have increasingly been using swaptions in jet fuel as a way of reducing their fuel costs. Some 18 to 20 per cent of an airline's running costs are accounted for by the fuel bill and using fixed and floating rate price swaps, CLRD can reduce that bill by 1 per cent. Energy companies and airlines are more sophisticated users of these types of hedging deals - more so than similar companies in other sectors. Many banks and brokers are trying to move into a position where they can offer these products to carmakers, for example, food companies and aluminium smelters. 'You are battling with an inherently bullish attitude among management,' Mr Sekse says. 'They say the reason they are in the commodity business is so that their share prices carry commodity price risk and they always believe the price is going to go up again.' His challenge is to convince some conservative company managers that 'not hedging is as risky as hedging'. Mr Mason adds that for some mine operators, hedging could be the deciding factor on whether or not they get bank financing for their start-up costs. CLRD offers a rolling hedge for, say a copper mine, to lock in the price of its output for five years making the project more viable. CLRD will also finance the cost of holding metal stocks for an aluminium company. The company can sell its entire stock to the broker and then buy it back when it needs it - buying at a spot price which is cheaper than the forward price. It helps the company to get the cost of carrying stock off its balance sheet and the broker locks in a profit by selling the metal forward which it shares with the metal producer. Hedging is less familiar in the agricultural and soft commodities sector, not least because the prices of many products are government-controlled. Some consumers are using the OTC markets to hedge purchases of frozen orange juice, but Mr Mason believes the food sector could offer enormous potential for these hedging arrangements because it is largely untapped. There is no regular deal flow for banks and brokers from this sector of the market, but much marketing effort is being directed at this type of business. 'It can take a lot of patience to convince producers of the need to hedge soft commodities - often as long as six to nine months before they start looking at a deal,' said Mr Sekse. The timing is also crucial since the market could, in the meantime, have moved in the wrong direction and the producer could be put off again. In the agricultural sector, a number of banks and brokers are working on a hedge for the green pound - the theoretical currency linked to the Ecu in which EC farmers are paid subsidies. This is almost impossible to achieve, but is in demand from food manufacturers. The food companies are less interested in hedging since they tend to have higher margins than companies in the energy sector and can more easily absorb changes in prices of raw materials. But a number are beginning to look at the possibility of locking in some prices. The commodities sector offers wide potential for innovative deal-making and growth in future is expected to come - at least initially - from the energy business. Other sectors present a hard sell to the banks involved in the business and a challenge to convince conservative companies to dip a toe in the complex waters of derivatives.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protection measures would damage former socialist countries Sir, Judy Dempsey nicely raises the issue of trade barriers against imports from former socialist countries ('European neighbours fall out over garden gnomes', September 26). However, Germany's steadfast EU border defence against unlawful intrusions by Polish garden gnomes will be dwarfed by protection measures which EU Mediterranean countries are trying to have enacted against clothing imports from Poland and other former socialist countries (FSCs). The measures would be embodied in the pending revision of an EU regulation, which permits EU fabrics to be sewn into clothing outside the EU (so-called 'offshore' processing) and then be re-imported under lower tariff rates. In its most restricted version, the revision would cause a virtual drying-up of such clothing imports from European FSCs. And since mainly German companies have tapped this offshore potential (almost 70 per cent of the EU total in 1992), and these countries accounted for almost 20 per cent (roughly Dollars 4bn) of Germany's total clothing imports in 1993, German consumers will be the first, but not the only ones, to be mangled. But why should Italy be behind such restrictions or even feel that the Germans are using their Council of Ministers presidency to attempt with Teutonic finesse to destroy the foundation of the 'alta moda' industry? Is it because Germany has successfully gone 'offshore' in the FSCs to produce high-quality, fashionable clothing, with which they could outperform Italy in leading EU and other export markets? If this were the case, why should Italy then want to limit its own access to an obviously advantageous option, from which the Italian textile industry and the (still) highly competitive Italian textile machine industry would also definitely profit? The fact that answers are not forthcoming, that the other industries have not protested and that consumers (not just in Germany) have remained silent, is simply due to the veil of secrecy with which the EU shrouds such decisions. Is Brussels listening to just a few, and giving little thought to what happens in the struggling FSCs it pretends to help?

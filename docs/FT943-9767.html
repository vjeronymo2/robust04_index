			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Wallenberg increases its stake in SE-Banken Sweden's Wallenberg group has sharply tightened its grip on Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's largest commercial bank, after buying nearly 20m A shares worth almost SKr1bn (Dollars 129m) in the first half of the year. The buying, carried out by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, has lifted Wallenberg ownership of the bank to more than 11 per cent from 8 per cent. It bolsters the influence of Sweden's leading industrial dynasty over what is already considered to be the 'family' bank. The foundation has overtaken the investment group Custos to become the largest single shareholder in SE-Banken. It holds 47.3m A shares and 1.36m C shares for a 9.2 per cent stake, according to statistics compiled by DN Agareservice, a share monitoring service. At the end of last year the foundation held 27.8m A shares and 1.28m C shares, equivalent to 5.5 per cent of the capital. Other Wallenberg interests, including Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company, hold 2 per cent of the shares. SE-Banken's recent decision to scrap a rule preventing shareholders from voting for more than 2 per cent of its shares has enhanced the Wallenberg influence. Today the group accounts for 11.4 per cent of the bank's votes, based on a system which accords each A share one vote and each C share one-tenth of a vote. Mr Jan Nilsson, managing director of the foundation, said it had decided to increase its stake in the bank because it believed it would get a good return for its investment. He also noted that the foundation had been fairly liquid since it sold its shareholding in Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, to Investor in 1991. Strong links have existed between SE-Banken and the Wallenbergs ever since the bank was formed from the merger of Stockholms Enskilda Bank, the Wallenberg family bank, with Skandinaviska Banken in 1972. Mr Bjo Svedberg, SE-Banken chief executive, is a central figure in the Wallenberg family empire and Mr Peter Wallenberg, dynasty patriarch, is first vice-chairman of the board.</p>

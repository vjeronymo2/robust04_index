			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Sticker Situation: Louisiana could become the first state in the nation to make  it illegal to sell "explicit" records without a warning label on them. A bill  that would mandate the stickering of albums with explicit lyrics and prohibit  the sale of such records to minors passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on  Tuesday. The measure, which passed the Louisiana House of Representatives on  May 14 , could be put to a floor vote in the Senate before the end of the week.  GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Man in the News: Franc could be the death of him - A foreign exchange dealer Stanley Smartcash, one of London's top currency dealers, drove back to his Knightsbridge flat last night, skipped the regular Friday visit to the gym and told his wife about the hardest week he had ever had in the foreign exchange market. 'We made a fortune selling sterling last year and a packet out of the peseta,' said the 39-year-old head of foreign exchange (FX) at Global, the US investment bank. 'But there have been times this week when the French franc looked as if it would make a killing out of all of us.' Stanley, an elegantly dressed Londoner with an ability to charm, is one of many foreign exchange managers recovering this weekend after a momentous 10 days in the currency markets: a period that shook the European exchange rate mechanism, saw the effective flotation of the French franc and some of the largest money flows ever in London's dealing rooms. On Monday, Stanley had hoped a devaluation of the French franc would bring Global the same profits it had received from the demise of sterling last September when it was forced to leave the ERM. He recalled how on Black Wednesday Giovanni, his suave Italian chief dealer, had taken over Global's proprietary trading book, the one containing the bank's own money, and sold the pound for D-Marks at a rate of DM2.778. Next day, Giovanni bought sterling back cheap at DM2.60, a net profit of more than 6 per cent in 24 hours. In comparison, trading in the French franc was a nightmare this week. After the relaxation of the ERM rules on Sunday, it slumped on Monday, stabilised on Tuesday and soared on Wednesday. By yesterday afternoon, Global was, at best, only a few million pounds up on the week. Stanley's button-down, white, Hilditch &amp; Key shirt was looking unusually crumpled at the end of the week's trading. But after 15 years in the market, Stanley is used to the roller-coaster world of currency dealing. Occasionally he becomes incensed at the public's attitude. The phrase 'Anglo-Saxon conspiracy' makes him laugh - although French politicians often refer to it, it does not exist. The words 'barrow boy' make him wince. 'People think the industry's filled with idiots, but that's nonsense,' he regularly tells his wife. Yes, when he is managing trades in the office, his manner with the junior dealers can be brutal. But he has a sophisticated side, too. What about his 2:1 in French from Oxford? What about his knowledge of the highly technical aspects of the derivatives market, the esoteric world of options, forwards and delta hedging? And what journalists and politicians never understand is that not all of an FX manager's time is spent pushing buttons. Much of it is spent out of the office, flying to Paris, New York and Frankfurt, talking to the bank's blue-chip clients: the pension funds, the insurance companies and the big multinationals. These are the really big players in foreign exchange, sophisticated fund managers with billions of dollars under their control and anxious to hedge their bond exposures. 'Getting to know the clients, managing their investments and taking a premium on the buy/sell spread: that's the basis of Global's earnings whether there's a currency crisis or not,' Stanley says. He rarely allows the public perception of spivvy dealers to get him down. He is addicted to deals. He trades a large part of the bank's proprietary book when in the office. And, at lunch, he loves to play with his pocket Reuters machine, which gives the latest moves in the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate. There has never been a better time to be in the business. Global's foreign exchange balance sheet since Black Wednesday has been pushed up not only by trading in fund managers' money but also by Stanley's aggressive risk-taking with the firms' own capital. Turnover was up 100 per cent in the past three years; there was a bigger net profit in the first half of 1993 than in the whole of the previous year; and the discreet mention of 'our outstanding capital markets activities' in Global's glossy annual report is a source of pride. Stanley's annual take-home pay, including bonuses, should be in the Pounds 400,000 area by Christmas. Assuming, that is, that the French franc behaves itself. Stanley cannot help but daydream about events since last weekend. On Sunday night, he was inside Global's glass and concrete building near St Paul's, waiting with his top dealers for the results of the EC finance ministers meeting. At once, he knew that the widening of the ERM bands was a technical way of floating the whole system. 'The Germans have kicked sand in France's face,' he told Giovanni and the team. 'The French will cut interest rates. We could be looking at FFr3.60 to the D-Mark by Friday.' On Monday morning, some of his hedge fund clients were asking him to take massive speculative positions on their behalf against the franc. He, too, decided to take a risk with Global's own book. But the cut in French rates never came. France jacked up the cost of borrowing francs and nearly pushed the currency back into its old ERM trading range. The market was outmanoeuvred, and the choice for every risk-taker was the same: take a loss on the exchange rate or hang on, paying the French banks a huge interest rate premium. The losses ate into Global's FX profits. Still, Stanley will not lose much sleep. The future for currency dealing looks rosier than ever now the ERM has effectively gone. There will be greater currency volatility. Those pension funds will be even more keen to buy Global's financial products, hedging their bond portfolios against currency risk in these wild times. And the French will not keep their rates high for long. But somewhere in the back of his mind Stanley may be starting to consider how long the turmoil can last. France has shown how keen it is to hang on to the D-Mark. And, in 18 months, when German rates are down at lower levels, Europe's currencies may be back in the straitjacket again, only this time it will be tighter. If Stanley Smartcash is really smart, he might be giving some thought to becoming a Ferrari salesman.</p>

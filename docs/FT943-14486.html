			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Leading Article: America's near abroad When 2,000 US marines are stationed off a Caribbean country 'to protect American personnel', that country should know what to expect. Signals from Washington suggest, more concordantly than usual, that the countdown for an invasion of Haiti has begun. At first sight this seems strange. Why should President Clinton decide on an invasion now, after 18 months of ducking and weaving and contradicting himself? A substantial majority of Americans opposes military intervention in Haiti. So do the Pentagon, at least part of the State Department, most of the Republican party, most other Caribbean and Latin American governments, many of the Americans still resident in Haiti whom the marines would ostensibly be protecting, and - in public, anyway - the ousted Haitian president whom an invasion would restore to power. Almost the only voices calling for an invasion are those of the black caucus in Congress and, increasingly, the inhabitants of Florida who fear an invasion of their state by Haitian refugees. Already UN sanctions, imposed in May at the US's request, have cut off all legal commerce with Haiti and paralysed the economy of what is anyway the poorest country in the western hemisphere. Should these sanctions not be given 'time to work' before a resort to force? Sanctions argument That argument, familiar from the build-up to the Gulf war, does not take account of the way that sanctions 'work', if and when they do. Rarely if ever do they succeed on their own in persuading a government to change its policy, or even prompt its supporters to overthrow it. What they can do is to disorganise and demoralise a regime, gradually reducing its will to withstand a violent onslaught from within or without. In Haiti's case they have produced a renewed exodus of refugees. In the past the US sought to label these as economic migrants, in order to avoid offering them asylum. Now it attributes their flight to human rights violations. The latter are real and numerous, but there can be no doubt that destitution aggravated by sanctions is also a potent factor. The US is desperately building temporary housing for the new refugees at Guantanamo, its naval enclave in Cuba, and seeking 'safe haven' for them in other Caribbean countries, whose populations do not want them any more than Florida does. Mr Clinton cannot afford to let this crisis escalate indefinitely. Nor can he revert to a more conciliatory policy without making himself a complete laughing-stock. He has boxed himself into a situation from which invasion may be the only way out. Popular enthusiasm If it comes, it will probably be greeted with initial popular enthusiasm in Haiti. It will no doubt succeed in removing the three top military leaders and restoring President Aristide to office. But if it stops there, it will leave Mr Aristide with the problem that faced him before his expulsion in 1991: implacable opposition from the military and the ruling elite. Only a much longer occupation, which would purge and disarm the police and army down to NCO level and encourage the educated Haitian diaspora to return to the country, with a coordinated package of economic and technical aid, would give Haiti any real hope. The US tried something like that in 1915, stayed for 19 increasingly bitter years and left the country little better off at the end of it. This time, following a precedent set in Somalia and now followed by France in Rwanda, it is looking to other countries in the hemisphere to relieve it, under UN auspices, once the initial, dramatic phase is over. There might indeed be a case for making Haiti a UN protectorate or trust territory, as there would have been for Bosnia and might be for a dozen or more 'failed states' in various parts of the world. There is certainly a case for any intervention being carried out under UN auspices rather than by a great power acting alone - if only because of the dangerous precedent that the latter would set. But the chances of an invasion being followed through with sufficient generosity and clarity of purpose do not seem good. There is still time for the Haitian junta to realise what is about to hit them, and to hand over power voluntarily before it does.</p>

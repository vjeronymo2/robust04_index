			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Borrowing on capital markets hits record BORROWING on the world's international financial markets in 1991 reached a record Dollars 518bn, a 'remarkable achievement' in light of the poor performance of the world economy and widespread pessimism about the future, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. However the boom in borrowing was restricted largely to international bond markets, says the OECD's latest report on Financial Trends. By contrast, syndicated bank credits fell to Dollars 113.2bn, their lowest level since 1987, as borrowing costs rose sharply. In 1990, Dollars 124.5bn in syndicated bank credits were recorded. The sharp drop in bank lending reflects growing anxiety about credit quality internationally, the OECD said. That anxiety, coupled with the effects of capital adequacy guidelines, has stiffened margins and fees to their highest levels since the early 1980s. The overall borrowing picture, however, brightened towards the end of the year when higher-rated corporations found it easier to raise funds for capital expansion or restructuring. Thus, while conditions remained difficult for highly-leveraged or non-prime borrowers, there are signs that the rise in fees may be tapering off. Meanwhile, the dip in long-term interest rates appeared to have fuelled the boom in all forms of bond issues, including equity-linked securities. Following a sharp decline in 1990, these surged by 30 per cent to Dollars 41.3bn, largely reflecting a pick-up in borrowing by Japanese corporations. On the bond markets, there was a shift in the growth patterns of currencies, with so-called traditional issuing currencies lagging well beyond newer ones. In particular, Ecu-denominated bonds surged by 78 per cent over 1990, despite the uncertainties over negotiations on the treaty on European Monetary Union.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Drug clearance boosts Glaxo shares GLAXO has won US approval for its ondansetron drug to treat patients suffering from nausea that sometimes follows surgery. The approval could add more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) a year to the sales of the drug by 1997. Glaxo shares rose 36 1/2 p to close at 558p yesterday as the pharmaceutical sector in London caught up with overnight gains on Wall Street after President Bill Clinton's latest comments on his health care reform ambitions. Until now, the drug has been limited in the US to patients with nausea arising from cancer chemotherapy rather than anaesthetics used in operations. Glaxo said it would begin promoting the wider use for ondansetron, sold under the trade name Zofran, later this year. It is already approved and available for use in 17 countries for post-operative nausea. The US is likely to account for at least half total sales, said Mr Stuart Adkins, pharmaceuticals analyst with Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker. The drug is one of Glaxo's most important new products. It is one of a small group of big sellers likely to take over from Zantac, the ulcer treatment, as a mainstay of the company's profitability. Zantac's position as the world's best selling drug is under threat from the expiry of its patents and a patent law suit in the US. Launched in March 1990, ondansetron had world sales of Pounds 163m in the six months to end-December 1992. Although sales are growing quickly, the drug is facing competition from SmithKline Beecham's Kytril, and Navaban, from Sandoz of Switzerland. Post-operative doses are much lower than for post-chemotherapy. A typical dose of 4mg will cost Dollars 17.29 in the US. Chemotherapy doses are between 8mg and 32mg and cost proportionally more.</p>

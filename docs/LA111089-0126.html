			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SWEET SMELL OF GIORGIO'S SUCCESS;  </P> <P> 'REEKING HAVOC' LOOKS AT THE MAKING AND UNMAKING OF PERFUME EMPIRE  </P> <P> The saga of Giorgio Beverly Hills perfume, arguably the most successful  fragrance of the decade, goes on. From the beginning, the tale has been almost  too schmaltzy to be true, the type that soap operas are built on. It's a story  with a beginning but no end, told so many times already that even its star  players refuse to talk about it anymore.  </P> <P> But author and journalist Steve Ginsberg, whose book on the subject, "Reeking  Havoc, the Unauthorized Story of Giorgio " is in stores this week, expects to  attract a wide readership based on "the powerful personalities involved" and  the fact that "two people without college degrees could hit a home run twice.  First with the boutique and then with the perfume."  </P> <P> The Rodeo Drive boutique captured national attention when it was used as a  location in "Scruples," the 1980 TV miniseries based on Judith Krantz's  blockbuster novel set in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> But "Havoc" reaches back to a time before there was a Giorgio -- store or  fragrance -- tracing the development of Fred and Gale Hayman, the names behind  the phenomenon, from Beverly Hills hotelier and cocktail waitress to retail  wizards to perfume magnates who anointed the wrists of the world with their  heady, $100 million product.  </P> <P> Ginsberg also covers the couple's divorce and the infighting that led to the  sale of Giorgio to Avon Cosmetics in 1987 for $165 million.  </P> <P> The West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily, Ginsberg describes his  version of the events as "essentially a business story." And he says it was his  boss, WWD editor Michael Coady, who encouraged him to write it.  </P> <P> But Krantz isn't so sure about the book's broad appeal. She scanned it before  it was officially released this week, and says "Maybe fashion mavens and the  perfume industry will be interested, but it's not for the mass market. It's a  story of dividing up assets."  </P> <P> Let's face it, suggests Herb Fink about the saga, "it wasn't the downfall of  the Roman Empire." Fink is Chairman of the Rodeo Drive Committee and owner of  the Theodore boutique just up the street from Giorgio. He had a bird's-eye view  of the story as it happened. In retrospect, he says, "their timing was good,  the perfume worked, but I don't see them as celebrities."  </P> <P> Throughout the book, Ginsberg cites his leading characters' differing points of  view. (Fred wasn't interested in creating a perfume, Gale was. Fred didn't want  to sell the company, Gale did.) But he leaves it up to the reader to  distinguish the good guys from the bad guys, if there are any.  </P> <P> "There are no saints and sinners," he concludes. "They were all a little crazy,  and still are."  </P> <P> Fred Hayman refused to be interviewed for the book, or most media accounts of  the rise of Giorgio. And he still refuses to talk. "He prefers to dwell on the  positives of today and the future rather than the negatives of the past," his  spokesperson explains.  </P> <P> Gale Hayman is quoted extensively by Ginsberg, as are David Horner and Jim  Roth, the perfume-industry consultants who directed the marketing of the  fragrance as it soared to its No. 1-in-America position.  </P> <P> Horner calls the book, "all steak and no sizzle." Both he and Roth are willing  to credit Ginsberg only with reporting the basic story.  </P> <P> Gale Hayman's only comment is: "I haven't read the book."  </P> <P> Finally there is Michael Gould, president and CEO of Giorgio Beverly Hills and  Parfums Stern, who is also included in the book.  </P> <P> He has no comment either, perhaps because investors are trying to buy the  Giorgio perfume company from Avon.  </P> <P> Ginsberg predicts Giorgio will sell for less than $200 million this year.  </P></p>

The top 10 names on the national assembly candidates list  feature cabinet members Pik Botha, Roelf Meyer, Sam de Beer,  Leon Wessels, Derek Keys, Jac Rabie and Piet Welgemoed. Deputy  Ministers Theo Alant, Fanus Schoeman and Sheila Camerer are  among the first 15. Two senior ministers on the national lists  have opted to also be on the provincial lists--Kobie Coetsee and  Amie Venter.    Senior ministers who have opted for election to the national  assembly include Dawie de Villiers (Western Cape), Kobie Coetsee  ([Orange] Free State), Danie Schutte (Natal) and Amie Venter  (northwest).    Those topping the other regional national assembly lists  include Tobie Meyer (Eastern Cape), Keppies Niemann (Northern  Cape) and Chris Fismer (Eastern Transvaal).    Senior ministers topping the lists for regional governments  include Hernus Kriel (Western Cape), George Bartlett (Natal),  Tertius Delport (Eastern Cape) and Kraai van Niekerk (Northern  Cape).    In releasing the names, State President de Klerk said the  lists were "reasonably representative" of South Africa's  population groups as well as of both sexes.    Two provincial NP leaders said in statements that  intimidation had played a role in reducing the number of blacks  on the lists. Cape leader Dawie de Villiers said there were  various Xhosa-speaking members of the party who were coerced by  the current climate of violence and intimidation into  withholding their candidature so as not to jeopardise their  families' safety. This disturbing state of affairs had cast a  shadow over the election.    Natal leader George Bartlett said the party would have  wished  to have a greater number of black candidates, but fear of  intimidation and an atmosphere of intolerance had a serious  inhibiting effect.</p>

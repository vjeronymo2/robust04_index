			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 14 (CTK) -- Hungary is not opposed  to including the inviolability of borders into bilateral  agreements if the partners so wish and if it is in an acceptable  form and in line with international documents, Janos Herman, the  Foreign Ministry spokesman tells the MAGYAR HIRLAP today.    Herman is commenting on an excerpt of Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik's parliamentary speech in which he said that for the  sake of reaffirming confidence Hungary should declare the  inviolability of the Hungarian Slovak border.    It is tiring and incomprehensible why Hungary has been  constantly asked to make declarations on the inviolability of  the border, Herman states. He also points to the fact that  Budapest sees an effort to resolve practical problems on the  part of the Slovak government and expresses the hope that  Slovak-Hungarian relations can improve.    Herman stresses that Hungary has met all the terms regarding  the recognition of European borders, including its own, and it  will do so even in future. "Neither the Hungarian government nor  any of its representatives have made any statement which would  contradict this," Herman says. He also points out that Hungary  is a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act, the Paris Charter and  a number of other documents which guarantee the inviolability of  borders in Europe.</p>

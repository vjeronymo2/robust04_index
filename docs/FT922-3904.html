			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Banks reluctant to put property assets in receivership says survey BANKS ARE reluctant to put property assets into receivership because of fears of large falls in their value, according to a survey of leading insolvency practitioners conducted by English &amp; Overseas Properties. In a sample of 30 accountancy firms involved in property receivership work, 80 per cent said banks were shying away from liquidation and choosing to use accountants more as managers than sellers of assets. The views come in spite of the recent use of insolvency procedures taken by banks in a number of high-profile property projects including the administration of Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. But they echo concerns about Heron Corporation, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and finance company, currently seeking to re-schedule its debts. It had its property portfolio down-valued from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1bn in April. Some 90 per cent of the practitioners questioned in May believed the number of properties entering receivership would continue to rise. Half think property prices are starting to level off in the UK, but another 40 per cent expect further declines over the coming months. Only 60 per cent were spending money to improve buildings in their charge so that they would retain their value, and they often met considerable resistance from creditors' committees in raising additional funding for this purpose. The appointment of property managers to help enhance the value of properties in their charge was considered by 60 per cent of the firms, and the majority accepted they needed to seek professional assistance when carrying out their work. Half said that marketing techniques to sell property assets could be improved, although 80 per cent established marketing and advertising budgets to help in disposals.</p>

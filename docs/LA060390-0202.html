			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAXING THE CABLE TV COMPANIES  </P> <P> No solvent company ever pays any taxes.  </P> <P> If a cable TV company's assessment is raised, the cable company will collect  the increased taxes (from subscribers) and pass the money on to the government.  </P> <P> The cost of litigation to the government will be paid by taxpayers. The cost of  litigation to the cable company will be paid by its subscribers, who are also  taxpayers.  </P> <P> Most people have to budget their luxuries and money. If the cable companies pay  more taxes, their services will drop in the priority list of subscribers, and  cable companies will have fewer customers, which is why they fight so hard to  stay competitive.  </P> <P> In justice, all businesses should be assessed on the same basis. The assured  loser in any struggle can only be the Orange County taxpayers.  </P> <P> PAUL WHITMORE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

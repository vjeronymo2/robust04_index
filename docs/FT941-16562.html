			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Bribery claims shake Belgium: Leaked allegations involve three French-speaking ministers Belgium was shaken this weekend by the publication of leaked allegations of bribery and corruption at the heart of the country's French-speaking Socialist party, one of four members of the fragile governing coalition. Mrs Veronique Ancia, an investigating magistrate from Liege, wants to question three Socialist ministers about claims that money was promised to the party in relation to a 1988 contract for military helicopters awarded to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer. Members of the national parliament, and the assemblies of the country's Walloon region and French-speaking community, will this week consider whether to agree to her request that the ministers' parliamentary immunity be lifted. But the formal procedure may be disrupted by the wholesale leaking of the secret report justifying Mrs Ancia's request. The report was widely quoted by Flemish radio last week and published in full by certain Belgian newspapers on Saturday. 'What is at stake in this affair is too important. . . . for the truth never to see the light of day,' the francophone daily La Libre Belgique argued in an editorial. As published, the report alleges that vital documents were doctored to favour the Agusta bid over French and German competition. It concludes that 'the way in which the contract was granted was tainted with illegal acts. . . . and forgery'. Mrs Ancia's inquiry has been based on interviews with sources including Mr Philippe Moureaux, another senior member of the French-speaking Socialist party, ministerial advisers, and senior army officers. All three Socialist ministers - Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian deputy prime minister, Mr Guy Spitaels, minister-president of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon minister of internal affairs - again denied last week that they were involved in any wrongdoing. Critics of the way in which the inquiry has been handled now say two key principles of Belgian law - the secrecy of legal investigations and the presumption of innocence - have been broken. Mr Mathot claimed yesterday that he was being subjected to the 'justice of the streets', with no right of defence. Public discussion of the scandal has also raised fears of a split in the francophone Socialist party, a rekindling of animosity between French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders, and even the disintegration of the government itself. The Volksunie, a moderate Flemish nationalist party, certain young French-speaking Christian Democrats, and most of the Flemish press have already called for the resignation of Mr Coeme, who was defence minister at the time of the Agusta deal. Agusta itself has always denied any connection with illegal financial dealings.</p>

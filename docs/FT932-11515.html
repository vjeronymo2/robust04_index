			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Jumping the EC fences - Charles Batchelor continues a monthly series answering questions raised by the single market The Growing Business page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European market on January 1 1993. If economic recovery in the UK continues British companies should once again be able to turn their thoughts to expansion and opportunities in continental Europe. To judge by the response to the first Q&amp;A feature (on March 9) there is also a keen interest among readers outside the community. Illegal barriers to EC trade Q: I have encountered what I believe to be non-tariff barriers in selling to Italy. Is there an organisation that can assist companies who experience these problems in trading with another member state? A: In the UK the Single Market Compliance Unit (SMCU), at the Department of Trade and Industry, advises and assists UK companies experiencing illegal barriers to trade in other member states of the community. These may be breaches of the Treaty of Rome or non-compliance with single market measures by other member states. This is of particular value to smaller companies with limited resources. Where a company, individual or organisation meets a problem, believes it has a legal basis for complaint and has evidence to support it, the SMCU will review the case and advise on the best way to resolve it. Assuming a legal basis for complaint is found, the UK government will usually take up the case with the member state concerned. However, it can take many months to resolve problems and patience will be necessary. A company may also wish to raise the matter with the European Commission, particularly if a direct approach to the country concerned is not working. The SMCU can advise companies preparing a case for the commission. The commission will carry out its own investigation and if it finds evidence of a breach of EC law it may issue infringement proceedings against the member state concerned. This may result in the case being brought before the European Court of Justice. Public contract procedures Q: I would like more information on the procedures for public contracts mentioned in last month's Q&amp;A article. Is the negotiated procedure, whereby contracting authorities only consult contractors of their choice, not anti-competitive? A: There are three procedures in use: open, restricted and negotiated. If an open procedure is used by the contracting authority anyone may tender. The open procedure may be used for the purchase of works, supplies and services. Under the restricted procedure anyone may apply to be considered. The purchaser selects suitable suppliers from those who have expressed an interest in a contract advertised in the Supplement to the Official Journal and invites them to tender. Under the negotiated procedure, direct discussions take place between the contracting authority and one or more suppliers or contractors of its choice. This procedure is not intended to be anti-competitive but to be practical and to shorten lengthy procedures. The negotiated procedure, with no prior publication in the Supplement to the Official Journal, may be used when: no tenders are received under an open or restricted procedure; there are technical or artistic reasons for choosing a particular supplier or a particular supplier has exclusive rights to the product or service needed; there is extreme urgency resulting from unforeseeable events. Where supplies of a product are concerned the negotiated procedure may be used when: goods are for research and development purposes only; additional deliveries are sought from a particular supplier because of the need for compatibility with existing goods or for technical reasons. Where public works are concerned the negotiated procedure may be used when: additional works cannot be separated from a main contract or are strictly necessary to its later stages; under certain specified circumstances, where a previous works contract is repeated. In addition, the negotiated procedure, with prior publication in the Supplement to the Official Journal, may be used for works contracts where: tenders under an open or restricted procedure were irregular or unacceptable; the nature of the work makes it difficult to calculate the overall price at the outset. Opening outlets in Germany Q: I am a supplier of hairdressing products and equipment and am looking to open an outlet in Germany. How do I go about this? A: If Germany is a new market for your company we suggest that you select a region where you would like to start and then consult the local chamber of commerce for information about appropriate local distributors. In Germany hairdressing supplies and equipment are normally sold to chemists and hairdressing salons served by regional wholesale distributors. It is often a good idea to invite the distributor to inspect your offices and products and then ask him to prepare a report on the market potential, regulations and the competition in his area. This can lead to a distribution agreement (where the distributor becomes the sole purchaser of your products in his area in order to sell them on to his customers) or to an agency agreement (where the agent procures sales on your behalf and receives a commission). It is probably better to explore these routes before making costly commitments in setting up a local subsidiary or a branch. Your choice will also depend on your long-term strategy. If you already sell in Germany but want to establish a local presence to increase sales you may want to set up your own organisation locally. This will involve setting up a local company, probably a private company known as a GmbH or a branch (Zweigniederlassung). A subsidiary will require its own capital and is a legal entity in its own right, with limited liability. A branch is merely an extension of the company abroad and has no separate legal identity. From an accounting and tax point of view, however, there is little difference. Travel insurance in the Netherlands Q: I recently bought an air ticket in Amsterdam for a client in another country but was told I could only insure against loss if I was a resident or national in the Netherlands. Is this true? A: There is no national legislation in the Netherlands stipulating that non-residents or nationals are excluded from taking out an insurance policy. Neither are there any legal constraints on the opening of bank accounts by non-residents. However, travel insurance companies have no legal obligation to sell an insurance policy and may refuse a request from an individual or company which they consider represents an increased risk. Some of the smaller companies will not accept non-resident customers because of the increased administrative burden. Larger companies, however, are normally prepared to do business with both residents and non-residents. Since there is no existing or proposed EC legislation in this specific area the regulations may vary from country to country. Recycling computer equipment Q: Is there any EC legislation governing the recycling of computer equipment in the EC? A: At the moment there is no EC legislation specifically governing the recycling of computer equipment. However, the commission has defined general policy goals for the recycling of waste for re-use as raw materials or energy, the prevention of waste generation and the safe and orderly development of the waste disposal industry. The guiding principle behind the community's waste programme is that the disposal of waste is carried out to the highest possible level of protection for the environment and for health. With this in mind, the commission has developed a plan for the prevention of pollution from waste known as the Community Waste Management Strategy. This is set out in a Commission Communication (SEC(89) 934). Emphasis is placed on waste prevention and then on recycling, re-use and the 'optimisation' of waste which is disposed of when not re-used.

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA, TUSTIN;  </P> <P> CALTRANS BRACES FOR BRIDGE DEMOLITION  </P> <P> In a move expected to snarl traffic in Santa Ana and Tustin, a pair of bridges  will be demolished in late spring to make way for a widening of the Costa Mesa  and Santa Ana freeways, state Transportation Department officials announced  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The two 4th Street bridges crossing the freeways will be removed by June and  wider overpasses will be erected, a process that should take more than a year,  Caltrans officials said.  </P> <P> Joe Hecker, Caltrans traffic management chief in Orange County, said the  "traffic impacts will be large." Much of the traffic will be funneled onto 1st  Street, where bridges over the two freeways are slated to be demolished and  rebuilt as soon as the 4th Street work is completed.  </P> <P> Hecker said that brochures will be sent to 100,000 nearby residents outlining  the project and that a second radio transmitter will be installed to offer  information to freeway drivers about traffic delays caused by the work.  </P> <P> Most importantly, Hecker said, efforts have been made to improve alternative  surface streets and upgrade traffic signals to accommodate automobiles diverted  by the construction project.  </P> <P> Aside from rebuilding the bridges, Caltrans has secured funding to widen the  eight-lane Costa Mesa Freeway to 12 lanes between the Santa Ana Freeway and  17th Street, officials said.  </P> <P> The bridge work is just the start of an effort to rebuild nearly every overpass  along the Santa Ana Freeway to allow its widening to 10 general-use lanes, two  car-pool lanes and an elevated thoroughfare for buses and car pools.  </P> <P> But state transportation officials said much of that work will be delayed  indefinitely unless new funding sources are available, in particular the  gas-tax increase on the state ballot in June.  </P> <P> Among the projects in jeopardy is the rebuilding of the tightly knotted  interchange of the Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways. If the gas-tax  measure is approved by state voters, the interchange reconstruction is expected  to begin in August, 1991 and be concluded in early 1996, Caltrans officials  said.  </P> <P> Keith McKean, Orange County district director, said much of the department's  budget and attention has been shifted of late to retrofitting bridges up and  down the state since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in the Bay Area last October.

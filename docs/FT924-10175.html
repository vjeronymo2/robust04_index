			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Power of a postal route to rescue: Charles Leadbeater finds Japanese strength against recession in an old savings method THE LOCAL post office in Tokyo's fashionable Harajuku district, tucked in a narrow back-street, is as central a social institution in its community as the collective bath-house opposite, which attracts a stream of people each evening. The office, overseen by the postmaster and a team of staff in sharp white shirts, hums not so much with people posting mail as with those withdrawing cash from its two automatic teller machines and depositing their savings. The 23,000 tiny local post offices like that at Harajuku are the main way by which most Japanese people save. Over the next few years, those savings will play a vital role in attempts to prevent Japan slipping into full recession. The chief risk of recession stems from the weakness of Japan's once mighty banking industry, plagued with bad debts on real estate loans that turned sour as the property market collapsed. The main hope of reviving the economy is investments made by the postal savings system, Japan's fastest-growing and strongest financial institution. With assets of Y138,500bn (Pounds 700bn), it is about three times as large as Japan's largest bank, DKB, which has 390 branches. Just as the local post offices are usually hidden away in back-streets, so the role of the postal savings system in seeking to revive the economy will not be obvious from government's accounts. This is how it will work. The savings collected through the post offices are passed to the post and telecommunications ministry, which then passes them to the trust fund bureau of the finance ministry. The money goes into the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which funds about 11 government banks and financial corporations to carry out investment in infrastructure and industry. Also, the trust fund bureau uses the FILP to buy government bonds, thereby financing government borrowing. The FILP is worth about Y40,000bn a year, more than half the central government spending budget of Y72,000bn. The finance ministry can use the FILP as a shadow budget. It does not require scrutiny by parliament, so it can respond swiftly to shifting political priorities, such as dealing with the onset of recession. This year, the FILP, rather than the official budget, will fund most of the Y10,700bn emergency package to revive the stock and real estate markets, announced by the government in August. In April the programme's budget was set at Y40,802bn. After the emergency measures are implemented, it should turn out at Y45,199bn - a 10.8 per cent increase. Public expenditure through the budget will be as originally planned, despite a Y4,900 fall in tax revenues. The FILP is to make up a lot of the tax shortfall. The government will borrow more by issuing an additional Y2,256bn in construction bonds. These are mainly bought by the trust fund bureau, which is mainly funded by the FILP. Most of the rest of the money will come from reduced repayments on government debt, most of which is owned by the postal savings system. The FILP's expanding role is unlikely to end with this year's budget. There will be a five-year moratorium on central government repayments of debts it owes to the trust fund bureau, which in effect means the FILP. The government may have to borrow more from the FILP if the economy does not revive and pressure rises for tax cuts in 1993. It is not new for postal savings to play a central role in Japan's economy. Since its establishment in 1875, it has helped to fund Japan's defence build-up before the second world war, its industrial modernisation in the 1950s and 1960s, and more recently has increased public investment in housing and social infrastructure. The system is more than twice as large as most of its European counterparts; the US system was scrapped as anachronistic in 1966. The Japanese postal system has increased its share of the savings market through an impressive display of public sector innovation. The number of post office automatic teller machines rose from 5,411 in 1986 to more than 15,000 last year. It has developed a portfolio of savings products closely tailored to consumer needs. The system is underpinned by strong cross-party support. Local postmasters, highly respected figures in their local communities, have strong ties to the ruling Liberal Democratic party, which often uses them as local recruiting sergeants. The Social Democratic party has an equally powerful interest in the system's expansion because the Zentei, the postal workers' union, is one of its affiliates. The investments have built up strong constituencies of support among recipients in industry, small businesses and outlying regions which have benefited from infrastructure spending. A new departure is the role the system will play over the next few years, with its strategic purpose the salvation of the Japanese financial system. The Japanese banks have been highly critical of the advantages bestowed on the postal savings system in the form of higher interest rates for savers and much lower taxation than for bank saving. In the last few months, as interest rates have come down, banks have been hit by a flight of deposits to the postal system, which has been able to keep its rates higher. The leading banks have constantly pressed the finance ministry to create a level playing field by liberalising the postal system. This poses a dilemma for the ministry. As supervisor of the banking system it favours deregulation; as guardian of the national economic growth rate it is used to drawing on postal savings at need. The banks' ability to clear their rising bad loans will depend in large part on whether the FILP's increased investments will revive the economy and specifically the property market. The private and public sides of Japan's finance industry will develop an increasingly symbiotic relationship over the next few years. While the finance ministry will remain publicly committed to financial liberalisation, its actions to support the economy will rely on the strength of a highly regulated public sector savings institution. Thus the salvation of Japan's banks, which became more internationalised in pursuit of their own modernisation over the last decade, could turn on an entirely domestic network of tiny post offices with their roots in the 19th century.</p>

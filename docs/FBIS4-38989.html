			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 6) (TURAN) -- From the talks between  Azeri President Geydar Aliyev and Ivan Karatchenya [CIS  Executive Secretary] it become evident that Russian troops under  status of CIS peacemaking forces could be deployed in the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone.    Karatchenya visited the Central Asia states and Georgia.  He visited these states with the intent to put into effect a  request by Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia about the  deployment of joint CIS forces in Georgian-Abkhazian conflict  zone and about the appeal by Boris Yeltsin to CIS members.    The decision regarding the troop deployment might be adopted  as early as Friday, after Karatchenya briefs Yeltsin on the  results of his visit to the two regions. Karatchenya told the  Azeri President that although Central Asia supports the  peacemaking forces, questions do remain.    In this respect Karatchenya said that Azerbaijan's position  has particular significance.    He admitted that the CIS forces will consist only of Russian  troops. According to Aliyev, this situation arises serious  questions. "We speak about the CIS as forces cooperating as a  commonwealth. And now it has become evident that talk is only  about Russian troops. I think that international authority of  the CIS as a Commonwealth of members with equal rights will  suffer from this arrangement," said Aliyev.    The confidentiality of the talks is testimony to the fact  that Speaker Rasul Guliyev, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov,  State Secretary for International Affairs Vafa Guluzade, and  Vice-Premier Abbas Abbasov waited for the closed-door  discussions to come to an end. During the short recess, TURAN  was able to speak with Karatchenya who said that "Azerbaijan's  leadership sees the deployment of CIS peacemaking forces into  Georgia as necessary, but with the active participation of the  United Nations and the CSCE. The Azeris think it is necessary to  increase the contingent of UN observers to equal that of the  CIS. I do not exclude the fact that the Azeri President will  adopt the decision to send an Azeri military subdivision as part  of the CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia, since these must be  joined." He further said that discussion is about a 400-soldier  batallion.    It is expected that CIS forces totalling 2500 to 3000 people  will be deployed to Georgia. The UN will finance the bulk of  the expenses.    The operation for the CIS force deployment to Georgia is  scheduled to [sentence as received; passage apparently dropped  in transmission] Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone can be  applied, in part, be applied to the Karabakh situation. He also  noted that the Karabakh conflict was not discussed during the  talks.    A senior Presidential staff member expressed his doubts that  Baku will seriously send a batallion of its soldiers to Georgia.  At the same time, he noted that this operation is of practical  interest to Azerbaijan and help Baku to correct its approaches  to the options for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict.</p>

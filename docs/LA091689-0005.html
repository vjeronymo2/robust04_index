			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Should Beverly Hills' most famous defendant be found guilty, Mayor Max Salter  has a suggestion about what type of community service she could serve.  </P> <P> "Zsa Zsa could rake leaves at our Robinson Gardens," said Salter, referring to  the facility run by the County Arboretum. "She could work with the rose bushes,  do a little digging in the garden. . . . I think it would be an interesting  sight."  </P> <P> If a telephone poll conducted by Accetta/Mosier Productions Inc. is at all  accurate, perhaps Ms. Gabor should get her favorite pair of garden shears out.  About 81% of the respondents supported the Beverly Hills police officer who  cited her.  </P> <P> Long before the city of Vernon won a measure of fame as the home of the  mural-covered Farmer John slaughterhouse, poets were singing its praises.  </P> <P> Today, on the 84th anniversary of the incorporation of Los Angeles' neighbor to  the south, we reprint this poem, which appears in David Clark's "Los Angeles:  City Apart."  </P> <P>  The ode to Vernon was written by a real estate booster in 1887:  </P> <P> Go wing thy flight from star to star,  </P> <P>  From world to luminous world as far  </P> <P>  As the universe spreads its flaming wall.  </P> <P>  Take all the pleasure of all the spheres  </P> <P>  And multiply each through endless years --  </P> <P>  One winter at Vernon is worth them all.  </P> <P> Somehow, Vernon never became the Miami Beach of the west.  </P> <P> With Southern California becoming more crowded, and liability concerns on the  rise, an old custom of the automobile age appears in danger here: Teaching the  15 1/2-year-old in your family how to drive on a secluded piece of pavement.  </P> <P> The problem is that more and more parking lots seem to be roped off after  hours.  </P> <P> Griffith Park is even less subtle, citing an obscure city ordinance in its lot  along with a sign warning, "No Practice Driving."  </P> <P> (The ordinance applies to unlicensed motorists, not to golfers wishing to  polish their swing before stepping onto the course next door.)  </P> <P> Brad Altman even found a "No Driving Instruction" sign on spacious Lucerne  Boulevard in the Hancock Park area, where novice parallel-parkers are a not  uncommon sight.  </P> <P> The passing of the ritual could well evoke bittersweet feelings for those who  have attempted to learn from Dad -- and can still recall his calm, measured  bits of advice that were mingled with screams of, "You're wrecking the car!  You're wrecking the car!"  </P> <P> Who says we live in a cold, impersonal world these days? One Long Beach real  estate agent addresses his pieces of junk mail to: "My Favorite Resident."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 6 TASS -- After heated debates over the  situation of ethnic Russians in the Baltic republics, the Public  Chamber under the Russian president approved "in principle" on  Sunday [6 March] three documents: recommendations for the  Russian president, appeals to the Federation Council and the  State Duma, and an address to Russian citizens.    It was decided that after being finalized by a drafting  committee and an initiative group, the documents would be  forwarded by a co-chairmen to the adressees.    Public chamber co-chairman Boris Topornin said at the close  of the meeting that issues submitted for the chamber's  consideration should be worked out more carefully.    After hearing officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry and  other relevant agencies, including the Migration Service, the  Ministry for Cooperation, the Russian ambassadors to Latvia and  Estonia, members of the Public Chamber agreed that "numerous  violations of the rights of compatriots take place" in the  Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia.    Not only people who settled in the Baltics after 1940, but  also many of native residents have been stripped of citizenship  there. Hundreds of thousands of non-citizens do not have the  right to own land and real estate, they are even forbidden to  change their flats. They are barred from public service, they  are also socially deprived. Life is especially difficult for  former servicemen and members of their families. All this can  be considered as "a deliberate discriminatory policy of ousting  ethnic Russians."    Reporting some cases of discimination of Latvia's ethnic  Russians and Russian-speaking "non-citizens," President of the  Sodruzhestvo Foundation Mikhail Zadornov, who was among of the  initiators of the discussion in the public chamber, pointed out  that Russia did not provide actual assistance to ethnic Russians  outside it and to forced migrants coming to the country.    This view was shared by many politicians and public figures.  They believe the president should "come up with a statement on  the concept of Russia's state policy with respect to  compatriots." This motion was included into a draft  recommendation by the public chamber for President Boris Yeltsin.    The Foreign Ministry was recommended to regard protection of  the interests of ethnic Russians living in the Baltic states as  a priority task and to step up its activities in international  organizations with an aim to spotlight violations of human  rights in the Baltic countries. The Russian Government was  recommended to speed the drafting and passage of a federal  programme for protection and support of ethnic Russians residing  in former Soviet republics. The public chamber called upon the  Federation Council and the State Duma to ratify within the  shortest posssible time the agreements and accords signed with  Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. These agreements are designed to  ensure legal protection of ethnic Russians.    Participants in the discussion emphasised that ethnic  Russians in other ex-Soviet republics had found themselves in  rather desperate conditions as well. Each of the  newly-independent states "has its own specific problems related  to the Russian-speaking population, but the need for actions to  protect compatriots living there are extremely acute in all of  them," the Public Chamber stressed.</p>

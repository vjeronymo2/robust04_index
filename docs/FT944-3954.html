			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Booth back in the black with Pounds 8,000 Booth Industries Group, the specialist engineering group, edged back into the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8,405 in the six months to September 30, against a Pounds 377,970 loss last time. The company, which makes high security doors - including the front door for 10 Downing Street - and fire and blast resistant systems, reported a Pounds 2.12m loss at the year end, although this was struck after a Pounds 1.43m provision for reorganisation. Mr Gerrard Booth, chairman, said that though markets remained competitive, sales targets were achieved while maintaining positive margins. The UK market was static but overseas opportunities were encouraging. Turnover dropped to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 8m), which included Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 5m) arising from certain structural steelwork contracts being concluded this year. Earnings per share were 0.21p (9.45p losses) and there was again no interim dividend.</p>

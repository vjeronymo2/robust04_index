			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Cynicism and mayhem greet Delhi's first election: Shiraz Sidhva tests the political water in India's newly enfranchised capital THE CITY OF Delhi, recently granted statehood after being run by India's central government since 1952, goes to the polls tomorrow to choose its own legislative assembly. The contest, , the first of five state elections this month, is primarily between the ruling Congress Party and the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Two other parties, Janata Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party, and more than 1,000 independent candidates may deny a clear majority to the larger parties. Congress, which has ruled in India for most of the last 40 years, is increasingly blamed by many for the nation's ills. The BJP has increased its strength in the last five years from two seats in parliament to 118 in the 1991 general election sees the state elections as an opportunity get closer to power at the centre. The Delhi campaign has been one the most colourful, if not the most riotous that the city has seen. The chief election commissioner's announcement on September 22 that Delhi would go to the polls in November, caught political parties unawares. They had been concentrating on elections in four other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, India's largest. Trouble erupted last month when the Congress and the BJP announced their candidates - there was mayhem in the headquarters of both parties, with disgruntled party members hurling abuse and even a flower pot at party leaders. Representatives of some factions doused themselves with kerosene and threatened to set fire to themselves if they were not included on the lists of candidates. Responding to pressure from political parties to grant Delhi statehood, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government amended the constitution in December 1991, providing for an assembly for India's capital city. Though the National Capital Territory of Delhi (earlier designated a union territory) will have a chief minister and a council of ministers like other Indian states, critical areas of urban management, including law and order, land development and finance, will continue to be controlled by central government. In political circles, the focus of the elections has shifted from civic issues like the shortage of water and electricity, to national ones, like corruption, and communal tension. But in the ubiquitous slums which mar the splendour of Mughal Old Delhi or the impressive tree-lined avenues of New Delhi, the people are only concerned about whether the promised housing schemes, a regular water supply, and metered electricity, so that they do not have to steal from poles, will materialise after the elections. You'd think our lives will change overnight if you listened to these politicians,' says Dharam Singh, an office clerk in the Govindpuri area. 'It makes no difference which party comes to power, they are all corrupt, and we suffer for it.' Delhi's 72 constituencies are festooned with streamers, sparkling lights, posters, and thousands of paper and polythene flags bearing the symbols of different parties. Flower-bedecked campaign vehicles ply the streets, bearing candidates and leaflets, and giant cut-outs of political personalities with ingratiating smiles loom at traffic junctions. Loudspeakers at every street corner blare out impassioned pleas for votes and campaign songs sung to catchy tunes from the latest Hindi films. The big hit is an adaptation of the year's most popular and controversial film song, 'Choli ke peechhe kya Hai? (What's beneath that blouse?)' which the BJP has cleverly used to ask Mr Narasimha Rao: 'What's inside that suitcase?' They are referring to allegations by stockbroker Harshad Mehta, the man at the centre of the Bombay financial scandal, that he had given Mr Rao a suitcase containing Rs10m for the prime minister's election campaign. Mr Rao was cleared by an official investigation. New Delhi, the seat of power, has always been pampered but the sprawling extensions of east and north Delhi which have mushroomed over the past two decades are badly planned, and lack clean drinking water and electricity. The city's transport system is one of the worst in the country, and more private cars and two-wheelers have made Delhi's roads some of the most unsafe and the polluted in the world. Results of the polls will be announced at the end of the month, after elections are held in four other Indian states.</p>

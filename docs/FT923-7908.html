			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Halifax savings rate cut eases home loan fears THE PROSPECT of a rise in mortgage interest rates receded yesterday when Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, announced that it was cutting interest rates on its savings accounts by an average of 0.35 percentage points. The move follows similar savings rate cuts by three other of the top 10 building societies in the past week and will affect about 14m savers. Mr Mike Whitehouse, Halifax operations director, said: 'The Halifax has sought to keep mortgage rates down throughout the year but, in common with other societies, continuing pressures on operating margins means that adjustments to investors' interest rates are required to ensure continued financial strength for all our customers. The alternative of increasing mortgage rates is not realistic.' Most of the remaining large societies are expected to follow Halifax by lowering their savings rates in the next few days. However, Abbey National, the retail bank and second largest UK mortgage lender, said it would leave its interest rates unchanged for the immediate future. Halifax's decision was taken in spite of the news of an expected record outflow of money from building society savings accounts in July, even larger than a net outflow of Pounds 314m in June caused by stiff competition from National Savings. The Halifax cuts have been designed to penalise the largest balances the least. The rates paid on Pounds 50,000 or more in the 90-day Xtra account has been cut from 9.9 per cent gross to 9.8 per cent, compared with a reduction from 8.85 per cent gross to 8.5 per cent on amounts from Pounds 10,000 to just under Pounds 25,000. Although the government has twice lowered interest rates on National Savings accounts in the past three weeks, it is by no means clear that the building societies will be able to hold their own for long in the highly-competitive UK savings market.

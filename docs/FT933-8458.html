			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Deportees in phased return ALMOST 400 deported Palestinians, who have spent eight months stranded in no-man's-land between Israel and south Lebanon, yesterday accepted an Israeli offer of a phased return, writes David Horovitz from Jerusalem. About half will return next month, with the rest returning at the end of the year. The deportees, mostly linked to the fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, were expelled last December after six Israeli soldiers had been killed in the occupied territories. Until yesterday, the deportees had insisted Israel take back all or none of them.</p>

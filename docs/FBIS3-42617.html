			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tkachenko, chief of the </F> administration of policy for the labor market and the population  of the Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation, by Inna  Rozanova, under the "Employment" rubric; place and date not  given: "Specialists To Be Called For. A View of the Problem of  Hidden Unemployment"]    [Text] Assuming that the drop in production is a  temporary phenomenon, the leaders of many enterprises are  striving in their favorite ways to avoid massive layoffs. For  which they are using several tried methods: a short workday or a  short work week, leave without pay, or partially paid leave.  This has helped some. Especially those whose work stoppages  occurred as a result of disruptions in the delivery of raw  materials and supplies. As soon as the previous relations were  put in order, the collectives began to work at full speed.    But there also are many of those who have been frozen  in uncertainty. There are no orders, but there are personnel.  How long this will last is unknown. What is to be done in this  case? We talk about this with Aleksandr Tkachenko, chief of the  administration for policy for the labor market and the  population of the Ministry of Labor of the Russian  Federation.    "Unfortunately, there are no formulas," says Aleksandr  Aleksandrovich. "The fact is that hidden unemployment is an  unprecedented phenomenon. It never existed previously in the  history of our state. For example, in the period of the  development of capitalism in Russia, there was simply  unemployment. But hidden unemployment arises in enterprises  interested in retaining personnel, but this is possible only  when the workers are highly skilled. Only a part of all of those  employed in production in the years 1913-1914 possessed a high  level of skill. Therefore, the need could hardly have arisen  among employers to keep a skilled worker on a short day, while  paying him compensation for the unused work time. But the  unskilled were simply dismissed as unnecessary during any  reduction in production. Although, however, some large plant  owners granted workers who had children one free day a month.  However, it is impossible to say that this is not full  employment; rather, it was a social privilege."    [Rozanova] But how did the matter stand during stagnation?    [Tkachenko] That was the kingdom of fictitious employment.  Extensive development of the economy was a rather characteristic  feature of the period. Where one person could handle a job, five  were on the payroll. For all practical purposes, labor  productivity did not increase, and it was falling in individual  branches. An enormous army of managers was engaged for a large  part of the day in an imitation of activity. And, still, it is  impossible to call this hidden unemployment. That appeared only  in the course of the radical economic reform. It was the result  of a reduction in subsidies and favorable credits to enterprises  that became accustomed to receiving subsidies from the state.  Now they all have to pull through by themselves, which not all  of them are able to do. But last year the Goskomstat [State  Committee for Statistics] for the first time conducted an  analysis of calculated hidden unemployment as a mass phenomenon,  and it is now doing this systematically. We do not have  sufficient data at present to draw any kind of fundamental  conclusions.    [Rozanova] And nevertheless, what kind of picture has been  evolving to date?    [Tkachenko] Although a catastrophic drop in employment has  not occurred, the process of accumulating hidden unemployment is  continuing. It constitutes approximately 8-17 percent of the  number of the employed in the national economy, and it is  present in both state and in privatized enterprises, in many  ways removing the acuteness and social danger of mass  unemployment. But the imbalance between manpower supply and  demand has not only failed to abate, but has gotten stronger.    In August of last year, according to the findings of the  first Goskomstat investigation, there were about 2 million  workers who were partially unemployed (9 percent of the total  number). Eight hundred thousand persons were working under  conditions of a short work week; moreover, the week was cut on  the average by eight hours. More than 1 million persons were on  leave at administrative initiative. The length of forced leaves  in August, for example, reached an average of 12 days and, in  addition, 45 percent of such people on leave did not receive  even a partial wage.    In the first half of this year, almost 3.8 million persons  in  enterprises and organizations of industry, construction,  transport and communications, everyday services, and science and  scientific services were working in a routine of part-time  employment on the initiative of administration (12 percent of  the total number of workers of these branches), of which 933,000  were switched to a short workday or a short work week. More than  2.8 million workers were on additional leaves without the  provision or with partial provision of wages. The total period  of administrative leaves was 51.3 million man-days, or 18 days  per worker, on the average.    [Rozanova] What branches of the national economy were hit to  the greatest extent by this ailment?    [Tkachenko] Light and food industry enterprises, because of  a  lack of supplies of material resources, and enterprises of  nonferrous metallurgy and the chemical and petrochemical  industry, because of difficulties with sales. I am not even  talking about the military-industrial complex; there it is the  most difficult of all.    [Rozanova] But in what regions is the situation the worst?    [Tkachenko] Hidden unemployment has particularly hit the  republics of the North Caucasus and the regions of Central  Russia. According to data of the CIS statistical committee,  30-32 percent of those employed in industry in Chuvashia and  Mordvinia were partially unemployed. A high level of hidden  unemployment was also noted in other territories of the Russian  Federation: in Pskov, Vladimir, and Novosibirsk Oblasts, the  republics of Mari El and Kabardino-Balkaria (21-24 percent); and  in Tver, Kursk, Kirov, Bryansk, Kaluga, and Ryazan Oblasts  (17-19 percent of the workers). In the southern regions of  Russia, agricultural hidden unemployment--the so-called agrarian  overpopulation--becomes especially noticeable.    More and more primary family providers are falling into the  ranks of the unemployed and those who have been compelled to  take part-time employment (this is men in the defense  industries, and it is women in areas where female employment is  prevalent). The hardest hit were oblasts with a single industry  development--Ivanovo, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk.    [Rozanova] But, after all, by keeping workers in the work  force, enterprises are getting deeper and deeper into debt....    [Tkachenko] Unquestionably. This affects the textile  industry  particularly. The provision of textile cotton fiber in Ivanovo  Oblast this year amounts to about 70 percent of the requirement  determined by the production capacities of the enterprises. Of  course, it will not be possible to restore the previous volumes  of fabric output. Thus, it is inevitable in the textile industry  that there will be a release of manpower that will be equivalent  to the level of the lack of supplies of raw material resources,  and, according to forecasts, it will amount to not less than  20,000-30,000 persons (according to enterprises of the  joint-stock company IVTEKS).    It will be necessary on a state level to develop a special  program for this region to reorient textile enterprises to the  output of sewn and knitted articles and other products. At the  same time, there will be a need to support state organs (in the  plan of interbranch cooperation), social guarantees in the  retraining of workers, and currency investments. According to  the calculations of specialists of Ivanovo Oblast, expenditures  for the implementation of these measures will total 200 million  rubles [R]. It is possible to fulfill the entire program in two  to two and a half years, on condition that resources are  allocated. A similar situation is developing in the cotton  enterprises of Vladimir Oblast.    [Rozanova] The number of unprofitable plants and factories  is  increasing, production is coming to a stop, and bankrupt  enterprises have started to appear. Will this also make the  ailment worse?    [Tkachenko] Of course, about half the losses of work time  now  are due to difficulties in the sale of products because of the  insolvency of consumers, and 39 percent of the losses are  associated with the failure to provide enterprises with raw  materials, supplies, replenishment articles, and fuel.  Employment cuts are expected in the chemical and petrochemical  industry, in machinebuilding and metal processing, and  especially in instrument building, lumber, woodworking, and the  pulp and paper industry. An increase in the number of employed  is expected in the coal and the oil and gas industry, and  ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. But the number of vacancies  will be less than the number of dismissals.    [Rozanova] This means that a social catastrophe is not far  off: At any moment, millions of people could end up thrown  outside the gates of their enterprises. Are plant directors  really standing by and not doing anything in such a situation?    [Tkachenko] There are enterprises that are succeeding, as  they say, in pulling out of the spin. There already are quite a  few. I will name just some: The Lyuberetskiy carpet combine, the  capital shoe factory Paris Commune, the Kosinskaya knitwear  factory (now the Kosino joint-stock company), the Moscow  Trekhgornaya factory, the Norilsk ore mining and processing  combine, several aviation machinebuilding enterprises, and also  combines for diamond processing. They were able to find and  interest foreign investors, who supplied their own equipment.  Part of the finished product goes to cover subsidies, and the  rest is for the domestic market, and it has a demand because it  is competitive. Part-time employment is reduced practically to  zero.    There are successes in converted enterprises; moreover, in  rather unexpected directions; for example, the Kirov plant in  St. Petersburg started to produce knitted wear instead of tanks,  and the business turned out to be quite profitable.    [Rozanova] How in your view does policy influence the  problem  we are discussing?    [Tkachenko] If we are talking about the policy on the labor  market, our ministry holds to the line that the process of  changing hidden unemployment to open unemployment should not be  speeded up. At least for the reason that we are not prepared to  maintain a huge army of the unemployed: after all, the norms of  deductions for the employment fund, according to our  calculations, make it possible to support no more than 2.5  million unemployed.    In connection with the drop in production, the Goskomstat  predicts that by the end of the year hidden reserves of manpower  will be transformed into open unemployment. It is possible that  the situation will be influenced to a great degree by the "Law  on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which at the  present moment is practically not functioning. It is possible  that the decision of the Central Bank of Russia on prohibiting  the sale of goods for foreign currency on hand after January  will change the situation for the better. This will certainly  reduce the importation of foreign goods and will lead to an  increase in prices for them, but, on the other hand, a powerful  incentive will appear for the development of a market for  domestic goods, and, of course, domestic production also.</p>

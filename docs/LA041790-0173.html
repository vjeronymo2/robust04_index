			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE-KNOWN FEDERAL AGENCY COVERS INVESTORS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORP. WAS SET UP AFTER A RASH OF  BROKERAGE FAILURES IN THE '60S. HOWEVER, IT IS USED AS A LAST RESORT.  </P> <P> Marilyn Helding, 65, the widow of a Wisconsin vegetable farmer, was afraid the  money from her husband's estate vanished like crops in the Dust Bowl when  Windsor Capital Corp. went out of business.  </P> <P> "I nearly went crazy when they went under," Helding said from her home in  Franksville, Wis. "I didn't know what to do."  </P> <P> But a few months after the small Milwaukee brokerage collapsed in March, 1988,  Helding regained her entire stock portfolio and $45,000 in cash owed her by the  firm.  </P> <P> The message: If your broker goes bust, your investment doesn't have to.  </P> <P> The safety of customer accounts has become the focus of much attention with the  recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with the bankruptcy court  filings by two other brokerages in the past year and the widely publicized  problems at several Wall Street firms.  </P> <P> After a rash of brokerage house failures in the late 1960s, Congress  established an agency, the Securities Investor Protection Corp., to protect  investors. The corporation has a $485-million fund that insures individual  accounts for up to $500,000, including up to $100,000 in cash. Large brokerages  have insurance for larger amounts.  </P> <P> Turning to the protection fund, however, is a last-resort action. Should a  brokerage go belly up, the SIPC first tries to arrange for customer accounts to  be transferred to another firm.  </P> <P> "The basic intention is that a customer should not lose assets or property  because the broker with whom (he or she is) doing business has encountered  financial difficulty," said Theodore H. Focht, SIPC president and general  counsel.  </P> <P> SIPC covers all forms of stock and bond holdings, but not commodities. It also  does not guarantee the underlying value of a customer account. For example, if  XYZ Co. is trading at $50 a share when a brokerage folds but falls to $5 at  reimbursement time, the customer loses the difference.  </P> <P> "It does not insure you for market losses," said Irving Picard, a New York  bankruptcy lawyer who has served as a court-appointed SIPC trustee in three  liquidation cases. "If you think the broker defrauded you . . . that's not  protected by the SIPC fund."  </P> <P> In the 19 years since its creation, SIPC has handled 212 cases and paid $185  million to satisfy customer claims. If a firm cannot pay immediately, SIPC will  advance the money to customers and try to collect later.  </P> <P> SIPC officials estimate that cash and securities worth $1.4 billion have been  returned to about 240,000 investors, most through account transfers. A total of  305 claims worth $31 million have not been satisfied, primarily because of  legal challenges.  </P> <P> The SIPC fund is comparable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for  commercial banks. It is fed by required contributions from the nation's 12,000  or so registered broker-dealers. It also has $500 million in bank credit and a  $1-billion line with the U.S. Treasury. So far, however, neither of those  resources has been tapped.  </P> <P> About 25 brokerages also have private coverage of as much as $5 million per  account.  </P> <P> Before SIPC was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon on Dec. 30, 1970,  self-regulatory organizations -- the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and  the stock exchanges -- set aside funds to protect the customers of brokerages  that failed. However, Wall Street was hit with a rash of failures in the '60s,  when the market slumped as firms spent large sums to computerize. When its  customer-protection kitty dried up, the New York Stock Exchange was forced to  dip into a building fund to protect investors. Fearing the worst, the exchanges  lobbied Congress for help.  </P> <P> There were six SIPC cases last year, five of which involved a total of fewer  than 50 claims.  </P> <P> SIPC's largest payout, $32.5 million, was related to the 1983 fraud-related  collapse of Bell &amp; Beckwith of Toledo, Ohio. The demise of Fitzgerald,  DeArman &amp; Roberts Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., involved the greatest number of  customer accounts -- 50,000. SIPC has doled out $5.5 million since that case  opened in June, 1988.  </P> <P> The SIPC can become involved when a broker-dealer enters bankruptcy court  proceedings, when a trustee or receiver is appointed to run a firm, when a firm  fails to meet federal requirements or when it cannot demonstrate compliance.  </P></p>

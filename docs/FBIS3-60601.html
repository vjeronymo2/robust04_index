			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] During a telephone conversation with U.S. President  Bill Clinton, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk stated that he  would submit the START-I Treaty to the parliament to be elected  on March 27, the White House' spokesperson Dee Dee Meyers  announced in Washington.    As we reported earlier, on November 19, the Ukrainian  parliament ratified the START-I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol  with numerous reservations which, in Moscow's opinion,  undermines the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. To  quote Meyers, these reservations disappointed President Clinton.    The Ukrainian president's Staff informed Interfax that the  telephone talks between Clinton and Kravchuk had lasted for 30  minutes and that no one had been informed of the details.    Besides the ratification of the START-I Treaty, the two  leaders discussed "the economic situation in Ukraine," said a  representative of the president's Staff.    He also said that Clinton had proposed searching for ways of  implementing the START-I Treaty and expressed readiness to help  Ukraine solve its economic problems.    The Ukrainian and U.S. presidents discussed ways of  attaining  agreements on U.S. financial and economic assistance in  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, on compensation for the nuclear  materials and on guarantees of Ukrainian security," he told  Interfax.    He also said that the two leaders had discussed details of  Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the U.S. during which  Ukrainian-U.S. economic cooperation will be discussed.</p>

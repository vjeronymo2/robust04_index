			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides as equities follow bonds Wall Street US stocks slipped yesterday in a quiet session influenced by declining bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.61 lower at 3,755.91, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.67 to 458.21. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dipped 0.10 to 442.49 and the Nasdaq composite receded 4.13 to 739.30. With no fresh economic news on offer, activity was leis-urely. Only 234.7m shares were exchanged on the New York SE. Analysts said trading would likely remain listless until the Commerce Department released May producer prices data on Friday. Consumer price figures are due next Monday. The two reports are not expected to stir the market unless the data confound expectations of tame inflation last month. Forecasts are centring on a 0.2 per cent increase in the PPI, after a slight decline in April. The CPI is expected to show a 0.3 per cent upturn, after inching 0.1 per cent ahead in the previous month. After a welcome two-day rally, the US Treasury market was taking a breather. The benchmark 30-year government bond was showing a modest loss by midday, with traders also looking ahead to the inflation numbers. In the absence of a strong movement by bonds or important fundamental guidance, technical conditions came to the fore, giving rise to profit-taking across the board. Cyclical issues were the hardest hit, probably reflecting recent statistics pointing to a cooling economy. Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 106 and Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , but McDonald's climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 62 5/8 . Electric utilities were among the most active issues, with much of the trading linked to dividend payment schedules. Texas Utilities dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 on heavy volume of 2.5m shares. Long Island Lighting softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 . In pharmaceuticals, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer was turning in a strong performance amid speculation that the French parent company might raise its stake in the US operation. Late last Friday the company had filed a document with the Securities and Exchange Commission which increased the likelihood of such a move, analysts said. After a delayed opening yesterday, its share price jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 38 5/8 . Alexander &amp; Alexander Services resumed trading after a one-day hiatus requested by the company, pending a 'significant announcement' The stock added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 as the company revealed that American International Group would invest Dollars 200m in a new issue of convertible preferred stock. AIG advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 95 1/4 . It was a quiet day on the Nasdaq, with many technology stocks showing slight declines. Wellfleet Communications shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/4 but Lotus Development gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 . Microsoft marked its first day as one of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index stocks by slipping Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 53 5/8 . Canada Toronto stocks declined broadly but finished off the session's lows after a choppy session, and traders fear more volatility is on the cards. An analyst said: 'There were two bright spots - real estate was up nearly 1.5 per cent and base metals was up a tick. But the rest of the market was hiding under a bed somewhere.' The TSE 300 composite index closed 16.9 down at 4,252.1, having initially fallen to 4,232.4. Declines outscored advances by 454 to 273. Trading was brisk, volume reaching 91.9m shares valued at CDollars 633.3m. Newbridge Networks rose CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 54 1/2 awaiting the release of its financial results for the year ended April 30. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo were just 0.4 per cent higher at the close after late profit-taking had eroded gains scored earlier in the session. Foreign and domestic investors pushed stocks ahead at first as they continued to buy ahead of the introduction of the new currency, the real, on July 1. The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares gained a net 118 points at 29,205. Turnover was Cr515bn (Dollars 256.2m). A dealer said the market showed a tendency to remain nervous ahead of the closing of the options settlement on June 20. It was also still waiting for developments on government efforts to stabilise the economy, analysts added.</p>

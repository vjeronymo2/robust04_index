			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian Defense Ministry press service has  circulated a report stating that, in accordance with a plan  agreed upon at the Abkhaz-Georgian Moscow negotiations, the  deployment of Russian troops in the conflict zone was intended  to begin on 17 June and be completed on 19 June.    However, because of curt statements made by some  representatives of the parliamentary opposition, urging that the  implementation of the mission by a Russian peacekeeping  contingent should not take place, the stationing of troops in  the conflict zone may presumably be postponed for an indefinite  period.</p>

The Angolan  minister has returned to Luanda from a visit to the United  States. In New York he handed a letter from President Eduardo  dos Santos to the UN secretary general. The letter expressed  hope in the talks in Zambia and gave an account of the situation  in Angola. Lidia Cristo reports.    [Cristo] Venancio de Moura is optimistic. The Angolan  Government believes an Angolan peace accord will be reached soon.    [begin de Moura recording] We are hopeful that an agreement  will soon be reached in Lusaka, which can then be signed to  conclude the negotiations. A day will be chosen, we can call it  D-day, to proclaim a cease-fire, not a unilateral cease-fire as  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  has publicized and which has never existed, but an effective and  overall cease- fire, that is, covering the whole country.

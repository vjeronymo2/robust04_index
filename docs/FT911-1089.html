			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: PM rejects 'doctoring' allegation - Hansard MR JOHN Major yesterday rejected claims that he had 'doctored' Hansard, the official parliamentary report, after misrepresenting the British Medical Association's views on the health service reforms, Emma Tucker writes. During question time last week, Mr Major cited views in favour of the reforms from a magazine which he identified as a BMA publication. The quotes were taken from GP magazine, which is not associated with the BMA. Labour MP Mr Dale Campbell-Savours accused Mr Major of seeking to 'cover up his mistake by doctoring Hansard'. He said the Prime Minister 'owed someone an apology'. Mr Major said: 'In this case the name of the correct source was put into the record.' Mr Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, said yesterday that a Hansard sub-editor had 'inadvertently' changed the sense of the prime minister's reply after a member of Mr Major's staff had given the name of the magazine to Hansard. Challenged at question time yesterday, Mr Major said: 'I am entirely happy for the original words to be reinstated. 'The magazine I quoted from was GP Magazine, but similar sentiments to those I quoted, endorsing the reforms, have been expressed in the British Medical Journal, published by the BMA.'</p>

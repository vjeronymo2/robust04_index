			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Debt crunch round the corner Sir, I hope your readership took the trouble to read Mr Jonathan Ruffer's article on bond yields in an historical perspective (Personal View, October 25). Otherwise we may have to wait still further until there is a collective awakening to the peculiarly nasty debt crunch sitting round the corner. That the 'real yields now on offer may . . . prove completely unsustainable to service' is not only a pointer towards a tendency to default, but is a reason to anticipate a vicious circle leading in that direction, as markets retreat accordingly and real rates rise further. Moreover, the fear that will produce a self-fulfilling prophecy may do so also on the further count of inflation, as governments ultimately choose to reflate out of the deepening hole. The vicious circle may thereby be given both momentum and durability. It would be as comical as it is predictable if it were not deadly serious. Clearly, the dilemma is by no means confined to Canada, spotlighted by your editorial on the same day. America could be blamed for not hiking short rates fast enough to protect long rates, but perhaps it can smell the problem on its way. No, the most farcical nonsense is that perpetrated for the past five years in Europe, where the collective public debt/gross domestic product has reached a staggeringly high 72 per cent. On the manic and indefensible pretext of trying to convert Europe into a single state, a needless degree of slump was imposed with mindlessly protracted monetary tightness, and the error compounded with fiscal indulgence. (When will the UK authorities admit out loud that the European dream is the most naked of emperors? This idiocy is something to rebuff outright, not slide towards sullenly.) This is a self-imposed nightmare. We have been paying a heavy price, and we will keep paying it until we rid ourselves of the statist, social democratic vanities of the political elite. Since they cannot see beyond the end of their noses, truly, we ain't seen nothing yet. Andrew Shouler, 155 Conway Gardens, Grays, Essex RM17 6HS</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / US signs bilateral tax pacts The US yesterday signed new tax agreements with France and Canada, as US Treasury officials stepped up a programme of negotiations aimed at overhauling Washington's network of bilateral tax treaties, writes George Graham. In a protocol to their original 1980 treaty, the US and Canada agreed to big changes in withholding taxes expected to save multinational companies millions of dollars. Canada agreed to drop altogether its 10 per cent withholding tax on royalties, as well as to lower the withholding rates on interest from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and on direct investment dividends from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. The result is expected to be a large saving for US businesses receiving royalties from Canada since most are not able to deduct the withholding from their US tax bill. The two tax pacts are expected to be sent to the US Senate for ratification this month.</p>

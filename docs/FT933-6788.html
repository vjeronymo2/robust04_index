			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Croats urged to let in aid GERMANY and France sought yesterday to demonstrate a common approach to the war in former Yugoslavia, issuing a joint appeal to Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, to enable emergency relief to get through to Bosnian Moslems in Mostar, Our Foreign Staff reports. Foreign ministers Mr Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Mr Alain Juppe of France, speaking after a day of talks in Dresden, said they would also urge Mr Tudjman to ensure that Croat forces held back in the Krajina region of Bosnia. 'At the least, the delivery of humanitarian aid must be facilitated by the Croat side,' Mr Juppe said. He said the two countries would approach Mr Tudjman through diplomatic channels, adding: 'I think a joint demarche by France and Germany could have influence.' Mr Kinkel said the two countries, whose approaches to former Yugoslavia have diverged because Paris has troops there while Germany's laws bar it from sending soldiers, would co-ordinate their policies more closely. Both countries supported the efforts of the United Nations to find a negotiated peace in Bosnia and urged the three warring parties to co-operate with UN officials. Washington has also continued to raise the tone of its warnings to the Croats. Last week the State Department said economic sanctions against Croatia were under consideration, but not military action. This week, however, US officials have said that a warning of possible air strikes issued by Nato applied not only to the Serbs but also to other groups preventing the delivery of humanitarian relief.

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 70m work for Gammon Construction Contracts worth over Pounds 70m have been won by GAMMON CONSTRUCTION, the Hong Kong-based company jointly owned by the construction division of Trafalgar House and Jardine Matheson. The largest is a subcontract with Chiyoda Corporation valued at Pounds 35.3m for the design, approvals, procurement and construction of all civil, building, mechanical and electrical services and fire protection work for Mobil Oil's Hong Kong fuels terminal project. Gammon was appointed the company's principal subcontractor early last year following completion of work with Chiyoda in Malaysia. Gammon is already at work on site following an earlier contract award from Mobil Oil for the design and construction of the marine pier. The second major contract award, worth Pounds 24.6m, involves the construction and fitting out of a seven-storey members' club house with an outdoor pool and deck area as well as all associated drainage and external works for the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. Gammon's piling division has won new work worth over Pounds 10m for site investigations, substructure and bored piling.</p>

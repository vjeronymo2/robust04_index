			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Croatian  Government Office in Belgrade Will Deal With Practical Issues,"  published on page 9 of the 16 March issue of the Zagreb daily  VJESNIK, correspondent Ivkica Bacic reports that Dr. Zvonimir  Markovic, head of the Croatian Government Office, had already  arrived in Belgrade and was scheduled to present a letter from  his government to Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic on 23  March, thus marking the official opening of the Croatian  "Embassy," which will begin to operate "within days." Bacic  notes that at present the staff consists of Dr. Markovic, Dr.  Dusan Bilandzic, and Davor Vidis.    Interviewed by Bacic, Markovic describes his first  impressions of Belgrade and expresses satisfaction that  bilateral relations are finally improving, adding that "all  people, here and in Croatia, must do away with narrow-mindedness  and arrogance and realize that nobody can live in isolation from  the world," which is "just as unnatural as the state of war."    Asked about the role his office is going to play, Markovic  states: "We are not going to pursue high politics here but try  to solve the problems of the common man. We will try to help on  a human level." In this regard he mentions plans to establish  communication and transportation links between Zagreb and  Belgrade, as well as offer legal aid in solving property issues.  Commenting on Belgrade media reaction to the opening of the  Croatian Government Office, VJESNIK notes that all dailies and  local television stations had reported the initial statements  made by the Croatian representatives, with the exception of  state television, which kept silent, and state radio, which  mentioned Markovic's arrival only briefly, citing Croatian  sources.</p>

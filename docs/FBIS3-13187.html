			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 9 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  says that the visit Pope John Paul II is expected to make to  Iraq will be an opportunity for him to implicitly reaffirm the  Christian world's rejection of U.S. imperialist and Zionist  plans to wage new wars.    Commenting on statements by Iraqi Chaldean Catholic  Patriarch  Rufa'il Bidawid I to the effect that the Pope has promised to  visit Iraq at the appropriate time, the paper today, in an  article contributed by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, adds that  a positive stand by the Pope now could make an effective  contribution to thwarting attempts to spark such wars.    AL-JUMHURIYAH goes on to say that the neo-imperialists have  chosen Iraq as a target for their vindictiveness, and as a major  springboard for sparking wars designed to last hundreds of years  by inflicting colossal harm that will not be forgotten by Iraq,  the Arabs, or the Muslims. This harm engenders vengeance.    The paper says: Iraq is determined to shed light on the  unreligious motives for this Western hostility toward the Arabs  and Muslims. However, Iraq's efforts in this regard need to be  supported by efforts from other camps, which the United States  wants to wage the war against Iraq.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The Pope can play a role in thwarting  the scheme of Western imperialism. A visit by the Pope to Iraq  would address a clear message to all, telling them that  Christianity has nothing to do with capitalism's covetousness  and criminal schemes, and that Islam and Christianity have  coexisted without wars for thousands of years, and that there is  no reason for this coexistence to be discontinued.    The paper asserts that a visit by the Pope would also be a  message to the Iraqi people, telling them that Christians have  nothing to do with their suffering, that they are sympathetic to  their ordeal, and that they want to see the embargo lifted.    The paper hopes that the visit by the Pope will be made  before the embargo clamped on the Iraqi people is lifted,  because the timing of the visit is immensely significant. This  is because the visit must encourage the countries of the  Christian world to take bolder steps to lift the embargo, or  push for a lifting of the embargo.    The paper concludes by noting the failure of the Bush  administration to dominate the world in the name of the new  world order. The paper adds that there are currently moves  toward a new stratagem even more horrible and criminal than  Bush's, namely, that of pushing the world into the crematorium  of ethnic and religious wars in a bid to make them the bases for  future conflicts.</p>

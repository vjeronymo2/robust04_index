			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (7): Soil appeal wanes - Down on the farm IN THE LEAFY driveway beside the farmhouse, two-year-old Brook Wannop is clambering into his toddler-sized plastic tractor. Nearby, a contented tup, resting after a blissful month in a field with 500 ewes, is nonchalantly nibbling the grass. The cows are mooing, the limpid sun dapples the autumn leaves; it is the sort of scene that makes city dwellers long for the good life. But Brook's father Alistair, the National Farmers' Union Cumbria county chairman and the third generation of Wannops to farm this land near Carlisle, hopes his son will study for a profession, if only as a second string to his bow. Throughout Cumbria, a county where farms are typically small and family-run, the tradition of sons following fathers into agriculture is weakening, he says. 'I'm about the last generation which has really gone into it in a big way,' says 30-year-old Mr Wannop. He has no personal complaint about his choice; dairy farms such as his are by far the most buoyant sector of Cumbria's agricultural economy. Even so, his farm's 5 per cent return on capital employed is not sparkling, given the effort and constant commitment involved in running a 900-acre farm with 280 cows. And for many Cumbrian farmers, running lowland livestock holdings or upland hill farms, earnings are meagre and prospects poor. 'The dairy farmer in the county has high overheads but a high return; the hill man has a low return but lower overheads,' explains Mr Wannop. 'The lowland livestock farmer tends to get the worst of both worlds; he has relatively low income but high overheads.' Cumbrian agriculture is dominated by dairying, beef and sheep; in 1990 it had 6,382 holdings providing direct employment for 14,600, nearly 4,000 of whom were spouses or other family members. According to Cumbria county council, net farm income in the county's less favoured area - virtually all its upland - averages only around Pounds 10,000 annually and is expected to fall further in real terms in the 1990s. In 1989/90, some livestock farmers depended on grants and subsidies for up to 95 per cent of their income. During the 1980s, Cumbria's agricultural employment dropped by nearly 900, yet this has not triggered a large exodus from the land. Instead Cumbrian farmers seem to have resorted to cost-cutting and ingenuity. During the decade, the number of full-time hired workers dropped by 34 per cent; numbers of full-time farmers dropped by 11 per cent but the proportion of part-time farmers rose by 22 per cent. Even before the government started urging diversification, Cumbrian farmers had begun exploring its potential, often by hiring out themselves and their machinery on a contract basis. Mr Wannop believes more than half the county's farmers rely on income from diversification, ranging from bed and breakfast to wind farms. Still, times are tough. 'Many are borrowing deeper and deeper from the banks, selling off the odd asset, doing more outside work,' he says. 'I don't think there's any fat to be cut in the agricultural industry.' According to Rural Development Commission projections, Cumbria's agricultural sector is expected to lose 1,360 full-time jobs in the 1990s; indirect job losses are likely to double this figure to 2,720. The implications for Cumbria's farming communities are clearly grim and the county is trying to attract European Commission funding. The impact of job losses on this scale should excite concern, too, among the millions of visitors from Britain and overseas who each year pour into the county, and especially the Lake District, to admire the scenery which farming has helped create. Lakeland farmers' hopes were raised last autumn by the government's announcement that it was considering declaring the Lake District an environmentally sensitive area. The proposal promised financial support for farmers carrying out environmentally-friendly work, such as drystone walling, and following less intensive methods. But now it is rumoured that tight constraints on the latest public spending negotiations may cause ESA status to be shelved. 'If it's abandoned it will be a tragedy not only for those farmers and their families but also for the Lake District landscape itself and the 20 million people who visit every year,' says Mr Wannop. On this matter, tourists and farmers have common cause, but, even though tourism has provided a valuable means of diversification for farming families, it has also imposed strains on the rural fabric, including its housing stock. In the Lake District national park, where strict planning controls inhibit new building, demand for holiday homes, second homes and retirement properties has priced many modestly-paid locals out of the market. A recent survey by the RDC and South Lakeland District Council revealed that nine out of 10 people on the council's housing list could not afford to buy a home locally. Fewer than 10 per cent had an annual income of Pounds 16,000, yet in South Lakeland a three-bedroomed semi in need of modernisation could be marketed for Pounds 135,000, said the report. Rents, too, were affected by tourism. A contraction of general shopping facilities, in favour of tourist-related enterprises, was also recorded in a survey last year by Voluntary Action Cumbria. And like many rural communities, Cumbria's countrydwellers are also tussling with problems of scant public transport, and of maintaining vital rural facilities like local schools and village halls. This, though, is only part of the story. For many Cumbrians, farming exerts a pull which goes far beyond economics. Young Brook Wannop may yet, in 20 or so years' time, be climbing into his own, fullsize tractor.</p>

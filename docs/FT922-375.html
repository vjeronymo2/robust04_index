			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: No increase from Bank of Scotland THE BANK of Scotland said it would not increase its offer for Countrywide Bank beyond the present NZDollars 2.05 offer price. National Mutual, the pension fund, said its meeting with a Bank of Scotland representative still did not convince it to accept the bank's takeover of Countrywide Banking Corp Ltd. Bank of Scotland needs to pick up 90 per cent of the outstanding stock, of which National Mutual owns about 8 per cent. The offer, which values Countrywide at about NZDollars 140m closes next Friday.</p>

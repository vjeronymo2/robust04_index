			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ugur Akinci] </F>   [Text] Washington, D.C.--Mahmut Kilinc, Democracy Party  (DEP) Adiyaman deputy, has suggested the Cyprus model as a  solution to the Kurdish problem during his visit to Washington.  Kilinc, who paid a visit to the U.S. State Department as well  as holding talks with Sen. Claiborne Pell (Democrat-Rhode  Island), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and  Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (Democrat-Indiana), chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Clinton administration was  very interested in the Kurdish issue and that they were trying  to understand what's exactly going on in southeastern Turkey.    Kilinc talked to the Turkish Journalists during the 35th  annual convention of the International Studies Association in  Washington Hilton. Accompanying Kilinc were some members of the  Kurdish community in the United States and representatives of  the American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN).    Kilinc said he asked the Americans to facilitate the process  to find a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey. "Without  solving the Kurdish problem, Turkey can solve none of its other  problems," Kilinc said.    When asked if the U.S. officials put forward any concrete  proposals, Kilinc said that they did not make any comments on  the situation and their main interest at this point was to  gather information.  <H5>  "Turkey Applied Political Solution in Cyprus" </H5>   When reminded that the U.S. State Department has already  spelled out a "political solution" to end the conflict in the  Southeast, Kilinc said that such a political solution is not  alien to Turkey since it was already put to practice in Cyprus.  "What Turkey defends in Cyprus should also be put into practice  in Turkey," Kilinc said.    When the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] asked Kilinc if a  "bi-zonal  federation" is what he was referring to by the term "Cyprus  model," Kilinc confirmed it but said that a federation need not  be just between Turks and Kurds.    "What's important is the recognition of Kurdish identity and  its preservation by legal sanctions and measures. Yet we should  not insist on any given rigid format. It could be federation or  maybe not. What's important is to bring this issue onto our  agenda and discuss it. They have federations elsewhere in the  West and it works. I like the American federal system, for  example. I think it's wonderful. So is the German federation."    When a Turkish Journalist reminded Kilinc that the American  and German federations were not based on ethnic divisions and  that such an ethnic-based federation might lead Turkey to  disaster, Kilinc said that Turkey could adopt a different  geographic principle and end up "let's say, with seven or eight  federations."    "A rigid two-part system is not necessary," Kilinc said and  reemphasized the need for discussing everything openly.  <H5>  Explaining Refah Victory </H5>   TDN asked Kilinc to explain the recent election victory of  the fundamentalist Refah Party (RP) in the Southeast where  Kurdish national sentiment is assumed to be dominant. Kilinc  said that DEP was forced to pull out from the elections due to  the bombing of DEP offices and murder and harassment of DEP  deputies and sympathizers. "Refah won because in the last Refah  General Convention (RP leader) Erbakan declared that when in  power they would recognize the linguistic and cultural autonomy  of the Kurdish people.    The message was not lost on the Kurdish electorate. When DEP  candidates couldn't run, all their votes shifted to the RP. If  we were in the elections, Refah could not win even a single  province in the Southeast."    Kilinc added that he did not approve of the Refah Party and  what it stands for. "Refah won only 14 percent of the votes in  Diyarbakir. In other southeastern cities about 50 percent did  not vote. This goes to show that Refah's support is not that  overwhelming and that DEP could have won the elections in the  Southeast if it participated," Kilinc added. "If we entered the  elections and won, the government would have somebody to talk to  on the Kurdish issue. Now they have no counterpart."  <H5>  "If I Criticize the PKK, I Can't Go Back to Adiyaman" </H5>   When asked why he did not condemn PKK's terrorist acts,  Kilinc said that to speak out openly against the PKK would  jeopardize his function as a "catalyst." "The PKK is an  objective phenomenon. It's outside my determination. It is  outside anybody else's wishes. It;s simply out there. Therefore  we have to consider the existing conditions and act accordingly.  If I criticize the PKK today, I can't go back to Adiyaman. And  what would that accomplish, really? I'm a catalyst. We have to  be rational on this issue."    Kilinc will return to Turkey next Tuesday after undergoing  surgery to correct an eye problem.</p>

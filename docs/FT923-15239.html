			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Health service complaints rise 19% COMPLAINTS to the health service commissioner last year were the highest since the establishment of the health ombudsman system in 1973. Mr William Reid, the commissioner, received 1,176 complaints - a rise of nearly 19 per cent on the previous year. 'The similar experience of other ombudsmen suggests that the increase owes much to growing public awareness of how to complain and to whom,' Mr Reid says in his annual report. He stresses that it is vital that patients, faced with 'an array of new authorities and organisational arrangements' under the National Health Service reforms, should know how to make their complaints. He had been assured by the government that all dissatisfied NHS patients would have access to the ombudsman system. Health Service Commissioner, Annual Report for 1991-92. HMSO, Pounds 10.30.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRAQ CRISIS SLOWS ARRIVAL OF 2 PACING CLASSIC FAVORITES  </P> <P> The preseries favorites for the American Pacing Classic, T.K.'s Skipper and  Keystone Raider, are having problems getting to California for the Los Alamitos  event because the crisis in the Middle East has upset flight plans.  </P> <P> T.K.'s Skipper, the fastest aged pacer of all time, has been unable to leave  the Chicago area because his plane was commandeered for the Middle East.  </P> <P> The veteran 5-year-old, which has earned more than half a million dollars  lifetime, now will be taken by van to Lexington, Ky. From there T.K.'s Skipper  will fly to Los Angeles and is expected in town next Wednesday. He will be  entered in the $35,000 second leg of the American Pacing Classic, which will be  run Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Keystone Raider, winner of the $148,000 American National Pace at Sportsman's  Park in Chicago on Sept. 1, has also had his flight plans altered by the Middle  East crisis as his cargo plane was commandeered. Travel plans are still  pending, but Keystone Raider is expected to compete in the second leg of the  series.  </P> <P> The American Pacing Classic makes its return to California after a nine-year  absence with Joseph C. Alflen's Dare You To topping the field of eight set to  face the starter in the $35,000 first leg of the series Saturday night. First  post time Saturday night will be 7:40 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1700 GMT on 31 January, in the penultimate program  of a series of party political broadcasts on Ukrainian TV,  broadcasts a 10-minute party political broadcast by The State  Independence of Ukraine [DSU], an all-Ukrainian political  association, introduced by Hryhoriy Hrebenyuk, a member of this  association's leadership.    The speaker begins the broadcast by defining the State  Independence of Ukraine as an association of ethnic Ukrainians  fighting "to build a Ukrainian Ukraine." He then sets out the  association's election platform, which is as follows: The  association works to "stop immediately the uncontrollable export  to Russia, Israel, Poland, and other countries of food and  consumer goods," and "to close the Ukrainian borders and thus  stop the filthy wave of Russian and Western pseudo-culture,  pornography," drug addiction and immigration from Russia, the  Caucasus, and Third World countries.    The association is against "the democratic and communist  clique of Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy," which sold Ukraine down the  river, and expresses non-confidence in "the so-called democratic  opposition zealously following orders from the West" and "the  communists whose hearts are with Moscow, the capital of the  Russian empire of evil." It is in favor of a crushing blow to  the Mafia, state monopoly in foreign trade and currency  operations, state regulation of prices, "expropriation of the  new bourgeois of non-Ukrainian decent that enriched itself by  violating the law and exploiting the Ukrainians." It is in favor  of the retention of industry in state ownership and a new  citizenship law that will only make loyal Ukrainian citizens  eligible to vote and prevent "privatization of Ukraine by  aliens."    The speaker then proclaims that in order for Ukraine "to  survive as a nation, preference in our state must be given to  anything Ukrainian. Ukrainians must be given precedence in  employment, social security, provision of cheap housing, and  privatization."    He maintains that the peasantry should be given land that  can  be bequeathed to their children but not sold, stating that  "politicians must encourage the Ukrainian peasant to the full."    He goes on to say that the association will "stop the  conversion of the military industrial complex and unilateral  disarmament," put an end to "democratic chaos and communist  rule," and promote strong nationalistically minded authorities  and "a powerful Ukrainian Army armed with nuclear weapons."    All this goes to show, he continues, that there is every  precondition in Ukraine for a military dictatorship to be  established, to rid Ukraine of such phenomena as chaos, the  Crimean crisis, separatism, and crime. He adds that "Ukrainian  servicemen must come to power," which will be followed by  decreeing censorship, banning democratization, "resolutely  restoring order in Ukraine," introducing an economic state of  emergency, disbanding anti- Ukrainian organizations, and  "deporting the disloyal."    He continues: "A national dictatorship alone will lead  Ukraine out of chaos and see it through until it becomes a  state. The DSU calls on the Supreme Council to draw up a  Ukraine law on the impeachment of the president, and immediately  remove Leonid Kravchuk from power as a traitor to the national  interests of the Ukrainian people who broke his promise," given  to Ukraine when he took up this post "so important to Ukraine."    He concludes his speech by appealing to the Ukrainian people  to rise, and proclaiming: "Ukraine will win! There will be the  Ukrainian state."</p>

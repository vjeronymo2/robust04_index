			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Asda active Turnover in food retailer ASDA Group jumped to a hefty 29.5m, making it the day's most actively traded stock after a broker reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The shares closed 3 ahead at 67p, as Morgan Stanley reiterated its buy stance on the stock and predicted likely profit upgradings. Mr Nick Bubb at the broker said: 'If the stores renewal programme continues to deliver results and industry margins continue to recover then current profits estimates will look conservative.' His current prediction is for full-year profits of Pounds 200m. Investment bank Lehman brothers were also said to have been active in the stock. The sector has been left behind in recent sessions and dealers took the opportunity of a strong market yesterday for bargain-hunting, thus boosting other food retailing stocks. Kwik Save jumped 10 to 612p, Argyll Group 8 to 296p and Tesco, 4 to 249p. Tesco said yesterday it had received acceptances for 58.11 per cent of Wm Low, the Scottish grocer at the centre of the recent bid battle, and also claimed acceptances for 49.77 per cent of the preference share offer. Securities house UBS was said to have had the big buyer of WH Smith Group, the high street retailer which reported figures in line with market expectations yesterday. The shares gained 12 to 481p, after trade of 2m. However, Mr Tony Shiret at BZW was decidedly lukewarm about the figures and said: 'The results were in line but I think the progress of the main WH Smith chain was muted.' Presentations to institutions by Boots boosted the shares another 11 to 563p. News that Body Shop is under investigation by US authorities in relation to its US franchise operations left the shares trailing 8 to 219p. MFI Furniture rose 3 to 149 1/2 p after BZW, a long term bear of the stock, moved it from the sell list and gave it a hold recommendation following the stocks' recent strong underperformance. Kingfisher put on 6 to 534p, ahead of today's visit by institutions to one of its warehouses. Pharmaceuticals groups gained ground as takeover stories circulated in the market. Wellcome, which is considered to be a prime bid candidate lifted 11 to 720p, with some additional help from the potential benefit from a legal fracas with SmithKline Beecham, which fell 2 to 446p in the A's. Meanwhile Zeneca which has also been mentioned as a potential UK target, improved 17 to 848p and Glaxo, considered to be looking for an acquisition, gained 7 1/2 to 652 1/2p. Shell Transport improved 11 to 729p as SG Warburg discussed the group's interim dividend prospects. The house was arguing that the company would boost its UK dividend by 12 per cent to 11.4p and its full year payout by 16 per cent to 27 1/2 p putting the yield at a 15 per cent premium to the market and giving a 10 per cent upside to the shares. Meanwhile, BP benefited from news that it had successfully completed tests at its Cupigua field in Colombia. The shares gained 6 to 412p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries improved 10 to 432p as optimism over the prospects for tobacco profits in the US prompted Salomon Brothers to upgrade its recommendation on rival Philip Morris.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 1 April (AFP) -- Tbilisi police chief David  Zaikidze has been sacked, the Interior Ministry said Friday [1  April], a day after hundreds of his men stormed the Georgian  Parliament.    General Zaikidze, an ally of President Eduard Shevardnadze,  was sacked late Thursday, the ministry said.    Hours earlier hundreds of police, many armed with automatic  weapons, stormed the parliament building to protest the  nomination of a new interior minister they charged was unfit for  the job.    Shevardnadze, who was present in the legislature at the time  of the incident, persuaded Zaikidze to withdraw his men.    The police chief then blockaded himself in his office at  service headquarters, demanding the dismissal of new Interior  Minister Shota Kviraya, whose nomination was confirmed Thursday.    Zaikidze, whose dismissal was ordered by Georgia's military  court and the Interior and Security Ministries, remained  barricaded in his office Friday morning.</p>

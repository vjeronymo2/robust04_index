He said: "We are building a civilization, whose main  foundations are culture, insight, wisdom and the perfection of  human thought."    The leader's message at 23:58 hours local time, ushered in  the new calendar year, 1373 [21 March] of the solar Hijra, which  is in official use in Iran and Afghanistan instead of the  Gregorian Christian calendar (1994).    Monday the 1st of Farvardin is the vernal or spring equinox,  a day celebrated as 'Nowroze' or New Year Day in Iran and  several other countries.    Ayatollah Khamene'i laid stress on ethical values and  commitment to work in view of the fact that Iran enjoys a new  system, lofty ideals and important objectives "which appeal to  every just person.    "The Iranian people with their bright culture rooted in  history together with abundant material wealth, should under the  circumstances, bring about ethical promotion", he added.    Terming ethics and self-reform as "one of the secrets of the  human move towards perfection", the leader said: "Whoever we  are, and whatever our degree of knowledge, wisdom and  perfection, we must supplicate to God to help us move towards  further perfection".    He also urged the nation to respect social regulations at  all  levels, and referring to commitment to work and discipline as  "two important and essential factors in individual and social  life", said the efforts of a nation dedicated to work always  yield good results and guarantee the welfare of society.    Ayatollah Khamene'i praised the families of the martyrs of  the revolution and the imposed war, as well as the disabled, the  former POWs and war veterans.    He also saluted the soul of the father of the Islamic  revolution, Imam Khomeyni.    In the use of the resources of the country mines and  industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran  is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major  elements for the industrialized world, he added.    Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during  this period has almost quadrupled, and "if this movement  continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large  extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are  mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence  on the scene."    He said that for youth this year and in the future years  there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of  population our country is a young country, and our young forces  require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the  course of the revolution well."    The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by  Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said  "grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this  policy will continue to be exercised so that this year from the  point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and  especially women we will have a successful year."    He was all praise for the Armed Forces and the unknown  soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilance and  sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era  of holy defense (1980-88).    The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy  industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants  such as steel and petrochemicals.    "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of  them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to  some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectable  traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We,  too, will support them.    "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God  willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities,  especially for the people active in exports."    He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing  people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled  and the former POWs and their proud families and with the  efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran  is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to  embark on the tasks ahead.    He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year  foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of  the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year  we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a  chance to have more power on the market."    Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam  Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache.    "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan,  Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places  Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world  arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam."    He said Iran was trying its best to help Muslims and will  continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems.    "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I  think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and  with cooperation," he was confident [sentence as received].</p>

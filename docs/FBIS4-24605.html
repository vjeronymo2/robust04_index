			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Ethiopian Ambassador to  China Addul Menan Sheka called on the international community to  give his country urgent food aid since starvation is threatening  nearly 6.7 million Ethiopian people.    He said this at a press conference marking the third  anniversary of the downfall of Ethiopia's military dictatorial  regime.    He said that since the overthrow of the military  dictatorship, the transitional government had succeeded in  promoting peace and stability in the country, and a charter for  the transitional period was also signed.    The Ethiopian Council of Representatives had adopted the  draft Constitution and would submit it to a constituent assembly  which would be established following the forthcoming elections  in Ethiopia next month, he said.    The ambassador said that the Ethiopian Government had drawn  up a new policy which outlines measures and tasks in economic  development.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS TO MEET AGAIN OVER SEWER FEES  </P> <P> Agroup of La Crescenta homeowners will meet again tonight to discuss an  increase in sewer fees imposed last fall.  </P> <P> Majorie Falloure, the leader of a loosely organized protest group, said rates  and discounts offered by neighboring districts and cities will be discussed.  </P> <P> Robert E. Yanez, an attorney who will become the newest member of the Crescenta  Valley Town Council in April, said he has researched fees charged by the  Crescenta Valley County Water District and will attend the meeting to answer  questions.  </P> <P> However, Yanez said, he has declined Falloure's request to initiate legal  action against the water district. "It is not my place to spearhead special  interest groups," Yanez said.  </P> <P> The meeting is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. at Crescenta Valley High School, 4400  Ramsdell Ave.  </P></p>

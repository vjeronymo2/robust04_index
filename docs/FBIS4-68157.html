			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Solidarity To Abort Foreign </F> Funding of Terrorism"]    [Excerpts] There may be a gray cloud over Egyptian-Kuwaiti  relations as a result of some irresponsible behavior by certain  groups or societies, either through good intentions or bad, on  the pretext that they are working for the Islamic call, even if  this conflicts with the values, principles, and tolerance of the  religion. No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti  organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it.    Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer  for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue,  which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the  fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey  home from China to the material and propaganda support the  terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies.    Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it  exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view  well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who  has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in  Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a  suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to  publish some books. [see item NC3004193394 in 5 May Terrorism  Report] [passage omitted]    The fact that the security organs found large amounts of  foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions  about its sources.    It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that  there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend  set up and carry out terrorist crimes.    It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that  hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some  groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on  the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a  just religion. But these funds are actually being used to  support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly. [passage  omitted]    As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he  spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations  between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti  citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear  terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any  Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that  harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti  Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest  measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains  ideas of this kind or violates the law.

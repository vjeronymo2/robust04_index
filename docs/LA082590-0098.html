			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAHONY'S RELIGIOUS SUGGESTION TO JEWISH UNIONIST STIRS ANGER;  </P> <P> LABOR: ARCHBISHOP SAYS HE THOUGHT JACK SHEINKMAN WAS A CHRISTIAN. THEIR LETTERS  HEAT UP A FEUD COMPLICATED BY THE ABORTION ISSUE.  </P> <P> Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has insisted that he did not know Jack  Sheinkman is Jewish.  </P> <P> If he had, Mahony said recently, he would not have ended a letter to Sheinkman  with the admonishment that he was "praying that the spirit of Jesus Christ  might take deep root in your own life."  </P> <P> But Mahony did, and a simmering feud over labor philosophy and abortion stances  between the Los Angeles archbishop and Sheinkman, president of the  200,000-member Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, has flared once  more.  </P> <P> The New York-based labor leader said he was angered by the religious suggestion  in Mahony's May 21 letter. Sheinkman closed his June 5 response to Mahony by  writing: "Perhaps you should . . . let the spirit of our common Judeo-Christian  heritage take deep root in your own life."  </P> <P> Asked about his reference to Jesus Christ after Sheinkman recently made the  correspondence public, Mahony said he thought Sheinkman was a German Christian  name. "I know some people with that name who are German," he said.  </P> <P> The exchange of letters between the two mostly concerned a lingering dispute  over efforts to organize gravediggers at the Los Angeles Archdiocese's 10  cemeteries and their differing views on abortion.  </P> <P> The volatile abortion issue has intensified a conflict between organized labor  and Mahony -- an ongoing clash regretted by both sides because Mahony's support  for farm workers in earlier years had made the prelate a hero to union leaders.  </P> <P> In his May 21 letter, Mahony said he looked forward to knowing the textile  union's position on "the only vital and important issue of the day: the rights  of the unborn to their human lives as created by God himself."  </P> <P> Sheinkman's June 5 response challenged the archbishop's contention, referred to  the gravediggers dispute and charged that Mahony had mocked past papal  encyclicals on worker rights and had violated church teachings on unions.  </P> <P> Mahony shot back in a June 18 letter that he was shocked at Sheinkman's  "pro-abortion stance." And, if Sheinkman understood church teachings better,  Mahony added, he would realize that the cemetery workers had voted at one point  for union representation because of "lies, misinformation and threats made by  your representatives."  </P> <P> Mahony said he was ending the correspondence "since your organization and the  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles share nothing in common."  </P> <P> The relationship had already deteriorated badly when the textile workers union  in February, 1989, narrowly won a vote to represent gravediggers at archdiocese  cemeteries. Mahony objected, saying union organizers used intimidating tactics.  Late last year an arbitration panel, selected by the archdiocese and the union,  ruled 2 to 1 that the union should be the bargaining representative.  </P> <P> But after only a few weeks of bargaining, the archdiocese discontinued  negotiations and instead called a second election for cemetery workers on Feb.  9, contending that the one-year agreement from the first vote had expired. That  second election went solidly against the union, which refused to participate  and sued to force Mahony to resume negotiating. The case is pending in Los  Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> The abortion issue also added to tensions, at first only subtly.  </P> <P> Last year, Mahony and Patrick Henning, head of the layman-led Catholic Labor  Institute, agreed to separate the decades-old Labor Day Mass and Breakfast in  Los Angeles into two events on successive days. Both said the main reason was  because the breakfast had become a heavily attended platform for politicians  and the preceding Mass was lightly attended.  </P> <P> But before that announcement, Mahony had written a scathing letter to Henning  saying that neither he nor any auxiliary bishop would attend the breakfast  co-sponsored "by the so-called 'Catholic' Labor Institute." Mahony wrote that  the institute was a "hostile anti-Catholic union" and that there was "no  redeeming value" in the Labor Day breakfast.  </P> <P> In a later statement, the archbishop said that at one breakfast Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) "spoke most favorably for the right to abortion. I was  stunned that he would come to a Catholic-sponsored event and support a position  which is so morally repugnant to our Catholic beliefs and tradition." Mahony  also objected to what he called the "pro-(Michael) Dukakis, anti-(George) Bush"  flavor of the 1988 breakfast.  </P> <P> Labor leaders, who have traditionally been courted by the Democratic Party,  said Cranston had referred to abortion rights but the topic was not the subject  of his talk.  </P> <P> The recent clash between Mahony and Sheinkman also arose over abortion.  </P> <P> Before its constitutional convention last fall, the AFL-CIO had come under  pressure from several of its affiliates, including the textile workers union,  to take a stand supporting abortion rights. But fearful of alienating some  segments of its 14-million-worker membership, leaders of the labor federation  referred the question to further study.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the AFL-CIO's executive council, made up of most of the  presidents of the nation's large unions, voted overwhelmingly this month to  remain neutral on abortion, leaving the question to be decided by individual  unions and members.  </P> <P> When the question was still unsettled last spring, Mahony had written letters  to all members of the AFL-CIO's executive council, including Sheinkman, urging  them not to adopt a stance favoring abortion rights, the archbishop said.  </P></p>

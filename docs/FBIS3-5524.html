			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Post and Telecommunications Ministry source  disclosed on 3 March that the government is planning to give  financial support to the Japan Mobile Communications (IDO) to  help it invest in plant and equipment as part of an expansion of  base stations. The government has decided that the Japan  Development Bank [JDB] can increase its loans to IDO for this  project. As there are signs that progress will be made at  Japan-U.S. negotiations, the government wants to help bring the  negotiations to a successful conclusion and believes that  supporting plans to increase the number of base stations will  help.    Increasing the number of base stations for the Motorola  cellular phone system became a focal point of Japan-U.S.  negotiations on mobile and car telephones and the IDO submitted  a compromise proposal designed to front-load the expansion plan.  The JDB awarded the IDO loans amounting to 17 billion yen in  fiscal 1992 and 25 billion yen in fiscal 1993. Under current  regulations the loans can cover a maximum of only 50 percent of  the investment total. The government, however, is trying to  increase this about 70 percent. If it fails to achieve this, it  will provide full support for loans to be provided at the 50  percent level.</p>

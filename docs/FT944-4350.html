			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (6): Fluctuating fortunes - Kieran Cooke on agriculture Foreign investors and local entrepreneurs are busy weighing up opportunities in Vietnam's industrial and service sectors. But agriculture is still the foundation of the country's economy, involving more than 70 per cent of the population. In 1993 agricultural goods, including forestry and fishery products, accounted for more than 50 per cent of total export revenues. Vietnam now ranks as the world's third biggest rice exporter, after Thailand and the US. The fortunes of the agricultural sector have fluctuated both because of the weather and the vagaries of government policies. According to officials, recent widespread flooding has resulted in losses of more than 1m tonnes of rice. But earlier surpluses mean that Vietnam is still likely to achieve a record production figure of 25m tonnes of rice and paddy equivalent this year, of which about 2m tonnes will be exported. The export figure includes an estimated 300,000 tonnes of rice that is smuggled across the northern border and sold in southern China. Government policies have had a more serious effect on agricultural production. When the country was reunified in the mid-1970s, the Hanoi leadership embarked on a five-year economic plan which sought to integrate the northern and southern economies. Agricultural collectives, formed in the north in the 1950s, were introduced in the south, which accounts for about 70 per cent of Vietnam's total rice production. The idea was for the richer south to help the poorer north, with southern earnings from agricultural surpluses funding industrialisation, particularly in the north. The policy was a failure. Michael Williams, in his book 'Vietnam at the Crossroads' outlines the reasons. 'The plan took little account of the resistance of the peasantry in the south to collectivisation and was anyway far too ambitious in thinking that the land would generate sufficient surpluses to fund industrialisation. It also took insufficient account of the damage inflicted on the country by decades of war. Finally, in its hopes for international funding of postwar economic reconstruction, it was wildly optimistic.' By the early 1980s the government was rolling back its collectivisation policy, allowing families to control some land and permitting the sale of produce surplus to quota requirements on the open market. Production soared. By the late 1980s the family farm was established as the main unit of agricultural production: state sector farms now account for only about 4 per cent of the agricultural sector. In 1989 Vietnam turned from being a rice importer to exporter. But while Vietnam, is one of the world's most densely cultivated countries, population growth of more than 2 per cent each year means the country still faces problems feeding its people. Furthermore, Vietnam once relied on the old Soviet Union and countries of eastern Europe as a market for its rice exports. Though it has recently entered into long-term rice purchase agreements with Malaysia, Brazil and the US, it lacks marketing expertise. Compared to other big rice producing countries in the region, such as Thailand and Indonesia, yields in Vietnam are low and quality is poor. Thai rice fetches Dollars 50-Dollars 100 per tonne more on the international market. The main problem is a lack of rural credit,' says Chu Van Lam, a Hanoi based agricultural specialist. 'Most farmers cannot get hold of funds to improve their land, to buy fertilisers, to purchase tractors. It's the same in most sectors of the economy - everyone is in need of capital.' The state run Agricultural Bank gives loans to about 40 per cent of rural households, but at high interest rates and for only six-month periods. The World Bank has given Vietnam a Dollars 96m loan for restructuring the agricultural sector - with Dollars 50m of the loan going to rural credit programmes. 'The policy of the government is to keep rice exports at about 2m tonnes while putting more emphasis on cash crops such as rubber, coffee, tea, fruit and vegetables,' says Mr Lam. 'These crops offer far better returns but again there is a need for capital to rehabilitate old plantations and improve the land.' Some progress has been made. Rubber production rose by 10 per cent in 1993. Corn production has also increased recently. Over the past three years the coffee crop has nearly doubled. But Vietnam lacks not only marketing skills but processing facilities. Most of the benefits of its seafood industry - a potentially big growth area - are reaped by Thai traders who buy seafood from Vietnam and carry out the high value added processing and marketing. The years of war continue to take their toll. The spraying of 'Agent Orange' defoliants by the US in many parts of the country poisoned the land. A large percentage of the rubber plantations were destroyed by US bombing. A headache for the government is a growing imbalance between incomes in urban and rural areas, and the resulting rural migration to urban areas. National average per capita income is estimated at more than Dollars 200 per year. But in many rural areas it is probably less than half that figure. Donor agencies estimate that 51 per cent of Vietnam's population lives below the poverty level, most of these in rural areas. The government, aware that such developments threaten long-term social stability, is encouraging investors, local and foreign, to set up plants in rural areas. Under a new scheme the official Farmers Association has created Vinanimex, a company charged with channelling investments into the countryside. Vinanimex intends to establish hundreds of garment manufacturing facilities in the countryside and says it has found at least one foreign company willing to co-operate.</p>

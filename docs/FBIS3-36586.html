However, I would like to ask all  these categories of people to enhance their struggle against  crime and to further strengthen the legal order.    [Bezveselnyy] This task better fits militia organs, does it  not?    [Hryb] Not only. Servicemen can help militia organs maintain  civil order by carrying out joint patrols. In addition,  maintaining military discipline among the troops is of primary  importance as well. Therefore, the leadership of the executive  branch ministries (I have already spoken with all of them) do  not oppose this issue. I believe that we can still do this work  and we can activate our fight against crime to give our people  the chance to live and work.    [Bezveselnyy] In a word, you have nominated new ministers  instead the old ones....    [Hryb] Not yet. I spoke about people who act as power  ministers. In the immediate future, a corresponding Supreme  Soviet and Cabinet of Ministers commission will nominate  candidates for these posts.    [Bezveselnyy] Well, one last question: Who will head the  Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security, Defense, and  Crime Fighting?    [Hryb] We have not yet discussed this issue. In my mind, we  will do so in due time.</p>

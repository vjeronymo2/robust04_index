			<p>920824 FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: Closing off an open season Sir, It seems incongruous that securities analysts are permitted to write reports, presumably without direct corporate contact, during a company's 'close season'. An altered profit forecast, without a right of reply, can have a devastating effect on a company's market capitalisation. These regulations hardly seem sensible, particularly for a nation that believes in fair play. Perhaps the deafening silence from the corporate sector on this can now be broken. Peter Kleeman, chairman, Allside Asset Management, 7 Old Park Lane, London W1Y 3LJ</p>

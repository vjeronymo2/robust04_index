			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ER FANS EXUBERANT OVER 3RD BOWL VICTORY  </P> <P> Blowing horns and waving signs, tens of thousands of noisy fans flooded the  city Monday to cheer the San Francisco 49ers, last-minute winners of Super Bowl  XXIII, as they paraded down Market Street in cable cars and antique  automobiles.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol, relying on a helicopter spotter above the 1  1/4-mile parade route, estimated that 250,000 people filled the sidewalks or  watched from windows and rooftops.  </P> <P> More revelers perched atop phone booths, news stands and trash receptacles or  shimmied up leafless trees and ornate, cast-iron light standards, which were  decorated with 49er flags and balloons in the team's colors, red and gold.  </P> <P> "Was it worth the wait? Are you kidding? Definitely!" said Tommy Barrett, a  49er fan from San Francisco. "The only disappointment is that they didn't have  a rally at City Hall like they did in the past. But it really doesn't matter.  We're dedicated fans, 49er faithfuls."  </P> <P> "Bud, too," added Barrett's girlfriend, Etta Roberts of San Francisco,  referring to their pit bulldog, which sported a 49er championship T-shirt.  Humans in the crowd were similarly attired in all manner of souvenir garb:  T-shirts, helmets, sweat shirts, hats, jackets -- even helmet-shaped umbrellas.  </P> <P> San Francisco Police reported one arrest after the late-afternoon parade and  they characterized the crowd as noisy but good-natured.  </P> <P> Coach Bill Walsh, team owner Eddie DeBartolo and Mayor Art Agnos led the parade  in an antique Jaguar Phaeton, with Walsh drawing roars by waving the hefty  silver Vince Lombardi trophy awarded annually to the National Football League  champions.  </P> <P> Star quarterback Joe Montana rode in one of the 15 cable cars -- actually  motorized replicas, because Market Street is not equipped to run real cable  cars -- with his wife, Jennifer, a local television personality, and their two  daughters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pink Cadillac  </P> <P> Wide receiver Jerry Rice, the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player, followed in a  1950s pink Cadillac convertible. Randy Cross, a popular offensive lineman who  announced his retirement before the championship game, rode in a similar car.  </P> <P> San Francisco beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, with a 10-yard touchdown pass  from Montana to wide receive John Taylor with just 34 seconds left in the game.  It was the closest Super Bowl score in a decade and the only last-minute  come-from-behind victory in the history of the game.  </P> <P> Although Monday's parade was the official city commemoration of the Super Bowl  triumph, it was by no means San Francisco's only outpouring of joy.  </P> <P> Spontaneous streetside victory parties began just minutes after the winning  touchdown pass Sunday evening and continued to build over the next six hours  until rain showers near midnight finally dampened celebrants' enthusiasm.  </P> <P> Strangers kissed strangers, and streams of celebrants snaked down sidewalks  exchanging a seemingly endless series of "high fives" with people moving the  opposite way.  </P> <P> Some people said they drove up to 35 miles to join the outpouring. Traffic in  North Beach soon grew bad enough to back cars onto the Embarcadero Freeway,  forcing the Highway Patrol to close that entire elevated highway.  </P> <P> Despite 90 arrests Sunday night -- most for drunkenness -- police said there  was relatively little violence or property damage. A few store windows were  broken, two cars were overturned and a couple of outbreaks of bottle-throwing  had to be quelled by swift musterings of helmeted riot officers.  </P> <P> The tone was in marked contrast to similar festivities after 49er Super Bowl  victories in 1982 and 1985. In both cases, police reported fights, many broken  windows, minor looting and the setting of street corner bonfires by  over-exuberant fans.  </P></p>

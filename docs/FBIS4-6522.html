			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Automakers rolled out  some 552,000 motor vehicles in the first quarter, a 10.8-percent  increase from the same period last year, Trade, Industry and  Energy Ministry officials said Saturday.    In March alone 207,000 units were made, a 15.0-percent rise  that marks the second largest monthly figure after last December.    Of all, cars produced in the three months totaled 161,000,  up  12.9 percent, and commercial vehicles reached 46,000, up 22.8  percent. The sharp gain in the commercial vehicle production  was largely helped by a recovery in construction activity,  officials said.    Domestically 354,000 automobiles were sold, a rather  moderate  7.2-percent increase, indicating that the economy, which  previously showed signs of overheating, started to stabilize.    In the period, a record 161,000 automobiles were exported,  up  18.1 percent, thanks to the yen's continued strength and strong  sales in the U.S. market.    Of the exports, cars numbered 143,000, up 11.9 percent, and  commercial autos 18,000, up 110.5 percent.</p>

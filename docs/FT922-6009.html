			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: US machine tool orders down 9% as exports lag THE US machine tools industry suffered a 9.4 per cent decline in orders in April, compared with the month before, but the level of orders still showed a recovery against the depressed orders of a year ago, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Orders for the industry were Dollars 220m in April, down from Dollars 243m in March, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a US machine tool trade organisation. But the orders were 13.6 per cent higher than the Dollars 193.7m achieved in April 1991. The industry's main problem is garnering export orders. Export orders were 37.6 per cent lower in April than in the same month last year, while domestic orders rose by 29.7 per cent year-on-year.</p>

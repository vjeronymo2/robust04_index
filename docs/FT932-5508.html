			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Scientists hot on the trail of elusive flu virus SCIENCE may at last have outwitted the fast-changing influenza virus. Researchers at Monash University in Australia have designed a promising anti-flu drug that is now being developed by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceutical group. First details of the drug, known by the code name GR121167X, are published today in the research journal Nature. Laboratory tests in cell cultures and on ferrets show that it has 'potent anti-influenza activity' against different strains of the virus. Human volunteers are expected to begin taking GR121167X - as a nasal spray - within a year. Clinical trials would then last three to five years before Glaxo could seek regulatory approval for the drug. Influenza is one of the world's most serious infectious diseases, laying low millions of people and killing many thousands even in a non-epidemic year. The virus's extraordinary variability and speed of mutation are matched only by the Aids virus, HIV. This has so far prevented scientists developing a general-purpose flu drug. Flu vaccines are limited in their effectiveness and a different cocktail has to be injected every year, depending on which strains are prevalent. The Australian researchers tackled the problem by identifying an enzyme on the surface of the virus which does not vary between different strains. They then used computer modelling to design a drug that would fit into the enzyme molecule and stop it working. Other companies are investigating anti-flu drugs. Wellcome of the UK has an experimental compound aimed at a different enzyme, which would be taken by mouth. But Dr Garry Taylor, a Bath University biochemist, says GR121167X seems to be the most promising so far, 'though it is possible that drug-resistant forms of the virus could arise during the clinical trials'. At the same time, vaccine manufacturers such as Merieux of France are working to develop longer-lasting and more effective flu jabs. Everyone's aim, says Dr Taylor, is to have an effective treatment ready when the next great pandemic strain of flu emerges. The Australian research suggests that science may get there in time.</p>

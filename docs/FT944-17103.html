			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Syndicated loans return to favour - International Heavy with capital and hungry for new assets, many banks have become very eager to start lending again - and have turned aggressively to the market for syndicated loans. This sector of the international capital market allows banks to participate to varying degrees in a loan to a borrower. The loan is usually arranged by one or two lead banks but an unlimited number of banks can contribute to the loan, enabling them to generate income while at the same time sharing the risk with other lenders. Banks have repaired the damage done to their balance sheets by the bad debts of the late 1980s and many of the loans granted at the end of the last decade are now close to maturity. 'There is a vast amount of liquidity in the syndicated loans market at the moment, mainly because banks have a shortage of assets,' said Mr Martyn Powell, vice-president and head of syndication origination at UBS in London. As a result, there has been fierce competition among banks for new loan business, often from reluctant borrowers who still have painful memories of the difficulties which arose from excessive borrowing during the last recession. This has driven the cost of the loan to borrowers down to extremely low levels. Over the past year, the spread over Libor on a syndicated loan to a typical European corporate borrower, with a Single A credit rating, has dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20 to 22 basis points. The interest rate on a syndicated loan is usually set at a 'spread' or margin over Libor, the benchmark interest rate for the market. Many borrowers, however, faced with such a low cost of borrowing and deterred from entering the bond markets by the current painfully high yields, have begun to turn back to the syndicated loans market as an alternative source of funds. 'Pricing is down to levels where the loans market is very competitive with the bond market,' said Mr Powell. 'Borrowers are now closely examining both options, and in many instances the loan market is turning out to be the most attractive to them.' He added: 'As prices (continue to) fall, the (volume of deals) will pick up. Corporate treasurers are looking at the bank market and realising there is an opportunity there.' Most regions of the world have been witness to this growth in syndicated loans this year, although recently Scandinavia in particular has seen a marked pick-up in activity, sparked by a dramatic fall in pricing spreads. 'A significant number of Scandinavian borrowers with existing transactions have been watching the market closely and have decided now is the time to refinance or reprice their existing deals,' said one syndicate manager. Mr Powell said: 'A Scandinavian borrower would have had to pay 25 to 30 basis points (over Libor) for a five-year loan at the end of the 1980s; two years ago he would have paid 60 to 70 basis points. But now we have come back almost full circle to a price of 25 to 30 basis points (over Libor).' Both Televerket of Norway and Vattenfall of Sweden have been able to come to the syndicated loan market this year and secure loans priced at around 19 basis points over Libor, whereas last year they were forced to pay around 40 basis points over Libor. 'Scandinavia suffered a deep recession which caused a lot of problems for companies and as a result it was out of bounds for many banks for a long time,' said one syndicate manager. 'Now it is back in favour and many companies are taking advantage of the opportunity.' Rumours swept the market last week that Securum, the Swedish state-owned company, is considering a SKr20bn syndicated loan to refinance outstanding debt. 'Something of that volume could have a dramatic impact on pricing,' said one syndicate official. The syndicated loans seen in Scandinavia have tended to be large, 'jumbo' financings of around at least Dollars 500m. In Norway, for example, Phillips Petroleum Company is currently involved in a Dollars 500m syndicated loan, which is also interesting because of its relatively long maturity of seven years. As well as price, many banks have been prepared to sacrifice maturity and other terms and conditions on loans in their attempts to win business. It is also no longer the case that only borrowers with high credit ratings have access to syndicated loans with low spreads and favourable terms. Increasingly, competition between banks is blurring the difference between the higher and lower quality borrowers. 'Why are banks doing this? Because the loans are relationship-driven,' said one banker in London. 'The asset itself is not the only reason for doing the transaction - banks will lend where they see opportunities for doing other business.' Southern Europe, including Spain, Greece and Italy, is a region which has also seen a marked increase in syndicated loan activity. This is probably linked to the fact these countries' bond markets have suffered particularly badly in this year's bear market. The Kingdom of Spain recently borrowed Ecu6bn over five years at a spread of just 4 1/2 basis points over Libor. The Kingdom of Italy is also rumoured to be considering a syndicated loan.</p>

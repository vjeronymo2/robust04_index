			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Receivers are called in at Warringtons RECEIVERS have been appointed at Warringtons, the commercial property company. The shares were suspended last month at 17 1/2 p. Yesterday the company said its bankers had appointed joint receivers, Mr N Hamilton and Mr W Martin, from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm. The share suspension was made pending the outcome of talks with the company's lenders. Midland is its principal bank. Warringtons first informed the stock market that it was in financial difficulties in February, when it said that it was involved in refinancing talks. The company has not reported results since June last year when it announced a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.03m). Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, said last week that it had fully provided for its 37 per cent stake in Warringtons in its 1990 accounts. Warringtons' shares hit a low of 7p earlier this year, before recovering slightly to the suspension price. The company expanded rapidly after emerging in 1987 from an earlier incarnation as a building contractor.</p>

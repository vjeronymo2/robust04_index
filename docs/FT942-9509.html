			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Turkey struggles as IMF team flies out Officials of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fly out of Turkey this week, leaving Mrs Tansu Ciller's conservative-led coalition and its economic policies in limbo. Agreement on a stand-by facility from the Fund is at least six weeks away, and it will probably be September before structural adjustment credits from the Bank can be approved. In the meantime, Turkey has to hold the line on wages, meet its own extremely tough targets on fiscal adjustment and service its Dollars 66bn (Pounds 45bn) foreign debt. The Fund's endorsement of the austerity programme which Mrs Ciller unveiled on April 5 is vital to unlock funds, without which Turkey may have difficulty financing its balance of payments. The domestic markets remain jittery. Even with interest rates in the overnight market soaring, the currency is tottering at around TL34,000 to the dollar, representing a 60 per cent devaluation since the start of the year. Bankers are concerned that without the Fund's approval, further commotion could hit the international markets. Turkey's long-term debt credit rating has already been downgraded three times this year by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. For this reason alone, the Fund seems likely to endorse the programme and agree a letter of intent, even with some misgivings. In particular, the Fund is understood to be doubtful about whether the inflation targets, on which the whole programme is based, can be achieved. Inflation touched 24 per cent in April, in the wake of the one-off price rises on official commodities. According to Mr Necati Ozfirat, head of the State Planning Organisation, inflation will fall to 7 per cent in May, and 28 per cent for the second half of the year as a whole. Turkey's year-on-year inflation was 107 per cent in April. Achieving such a target will depend in part on a political consensus; wage talks are due in June with both the civil servants and workers in the state industries. The revenue side looks more solid. One-off tax charges on the rich have been passed by parliament. Parliament passed decree powers for three months allowing the government to prepare companies for sale. Indeed in April the budget deficit fell from TL7,300bn in the same period in 1993 to 300bn last month - although the fall is partly explained by the large amount of tax falling due in April. Last week, in another encouraging development, the Treasury sold bills at the domestic auction for the first time since the start of the year. The issue was a small one, the Treasury receiving offers for TL6,000bn-worth of one month paper at 12 per cent a month. With international markets temporarily closed off, domestic debt auctions are the only way, short of printing money, that Turkey can finance its domestic budget. Together with agreement from the banks to convert a part of their maturing Treasury bill portfolio into three-year paper, inflation-indexed plus 6 per cent, the government is slowly restoring confidence in the markets.</p>

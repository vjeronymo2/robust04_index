			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Finnish Prime Minister  Esko Aho today met with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC), to discuss ways of furthering friendly  relations between the two countries.    Li, who arrived here Monday [2 May] for a goodwill official  visit at the invitation of the Finnish Government, said that  China and Finland, with a traditional friendship, have been  enjoying sound relations despite the changing international  situation.    He praised the Sino-Finnish relationship as a model of  friendly cooperation between nations with different social  systems.    The CPPCC chairman attributed the successful Sino-Finnish  relations to mutual respect, frequent exchanges, cooperation  based on equality and mutual benefit, and consultations aimed at  seeking common ground while reserving differences.    Li said the two countries have tremendous potential for  mutual cooperation because China is a developing country  adopting a policy of reform and opening to the outside world  while Finland is a developed industrial nation.    He hoped that relations between the two countries will be  enhanced to a new level on the current basis.    Prime Minister Aho, who has visited China recently, was glad  to meet with Li again and described his recent trip to China as  a great success.    Aho was satisfied with the development of relations between  the two countries, saying that Finland and China have succeeded  in developing their friendly cooperation in all fields since  they forged diplomatic ties.    Especially in recent years, he said, economic, trade and  scientific and technological cooperation between the two  countries has been boosted greatly.    Through a repeated exchange of visits, he said, both  countries have also found a lot of common ground and reached  understanding on many issues.    Helsinki is the first leg of Li's five-European-nation tour  which will also take him to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium.    This is the first time for China's CPPCC chairman to visit  these countries.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese coal export surge predicted CHINESE COAL exports will reach between 30m and 35m tonnes a year by the year 2000, according to a senior official in China's coal industry, reports Reuter from Sun City, South Africa. Mr Hua Zugui, deputy managing director of China Coal Import and Export Company, will give the figures in a speech prepared for delivery at an international coal conference. He says exports reached 20.2m tonnes last year - 80 per cent of it shipped to other Asian countries - compared with 6.44m tonnes in 1982. 'The fact that China has been able to more than double her exports in just one decade reflects the competitiveness of the Chinese coal industry within the world market,' Mr Hua says. 'The improvement of China's railway system and port facilities remain the key tasks for increasing coal exports,' he adds. He forecasts that China's annual demand for coal will reach 1.23bn tonnes by 1995 and 1.4bn tonnes by the end of the century. Japanese steam coal demand could more than double by the year 2002, a senior Japanese power company official will tell the conference. 'It is estimated that demand for steam coal for the electrical industry will rise from the present 31m tonnes, 25m tonnes imported, to some 75m tonnes in 2002 or a decade later,' says Mr Koichi Takewaka, fuel department director at the Electric Power Development Company. He adds that the long-term, stable procurement of imported coal has become very important. South African coal exports could reach 77m tonnes annually by the year 2000, says Mr David Kotze, director of energy studies at the Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg, in his speech prepared for the conference. He says exports through the Richards Bay terminal should grow to 53m tonnes a year by 1995.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE futures plunged again to touch new 22-year lows. 'We've seen no origin selling, but the market's just drifted down in an apathetic kind of way,' one dealer said. After being called to open about Dollars 5 a tonne lower on New York's overnight performance, near July soon fell through support at Dollars 750 a tonne to a low of Dollars 733, before closing Dollars 20 down at Dollars 738. Near May touched support at Dollars 700. Some dealers said coffee was due for an upturn as origins would refuse to sell at these levels. 'A lot of traders are short, so if origins don't come to the market, then prices will have to come up,' one said. In New York arabica prices were also down at midday. On the London Metal Exchange three-month ZINC continued to retreat from the Dollars 1,300 a tonne level, while prices for cash metal remain supported by technical tightness. The ALUMINIUM market recovered in the afternoon from a five-week low struck after talk of a labour contract deal at Alcoa and Reynolds. There was still no definite news of damage halting output at Yugoslavia's Mostar smelter, although there is heavy fighting in the region, traders noted. Compiled from Reuters</p>

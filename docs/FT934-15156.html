			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: William Sinclair down 17% to Pounds 3.8m WILLIAM Sinclair Holdings, a supplier of products to the garden, leisure and pet markets, yesterday reported profits down 17 per cent at Pounds 3.82m. This was in line with its warning on June 28 that profits for the year to June 30 would be 15-20 per cent below last time's Pounds 4.61m. However, under FRS 3, the profit and loss account showed that pre-tax profits increased from a restated Pounds 2.96m, after an aggregate Pounds 1.45m exceptional charge in the restated 1992 figures for two disposals. Interest receivable was sharply cut to Pounds 146,000 (Pounds 345,000), partly as a result of lower interest rates and partly because cash balances declined to Pounds 6m (Pounds 7.5m), after the payment of the cash element of the acquisition of Secto. Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, described the year as 'one of mixed fortunes'. The group's profits shortfall was due to 'the cold and wet weather conditions' affecting the horticultural division. Operating profits here declined to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 3.14m) on turnover of Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 26.9m). The almost doubled rainfall in Scotland led to a poor peat harvest and the need to buy peat from other suppliers for Sinclair's J Arthur Bowers products. However, market share was increased across Bowers' three products: compost up to 19.1 (17.1) per cent; bark to 14.5 (6.5) per cent; and fertiliser to 31.7 (28.4) per cent. On the pet, aquatics and household products side profits grew 41 per cent to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 977,000) on turnover of Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.76m). Group exports expanded to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.87m), with pet products going mainly to Europe and horticultural products to the Middle and Far East. Earnings under FRS 3 grew to 12.2p (8.3p) per share, though on the headline profits basis, they fell to 11.9p (14.8p). The final dividend is held at 5.3p for a maintained 7p total.</p>

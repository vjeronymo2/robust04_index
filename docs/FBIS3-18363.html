			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Johannes Gerster, deputy Christian </F> Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag chairman and  member of the Parliamentary Control Commission on Espionage, by  unidentified announcer -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Mr. Gerster.    [Gerster] Good morning.    [Announcer] Mr. Gerster, the above-mentioned exposure [of  the  two U.S. KGB spies] caused surprise throughout the world. Do  you share that surprise?    [Gerster] Not at all. We knew, and of course know, that the  KGB is still spying to the same extent, especially in Germany.  The strange thing is that it has been split up; three  different, and I say this in quote marks, [word indistinct]  departments have been formed out of an originally single KGB,  which conduct espionage both abroad and at home.    Efforts are being made for official contacts; there have,  for  example, been contacts with the Bundestag Parliamentary Control  Commission in order to organize the secret service, shall I say,  according to a Western model, that is, democratically and on the  basis of a state based on the rule of law. But we know,  incidentally, that not only Russia, but other states in East  Europe are conducting espionage to the same extent and that, if  you like, while the policy of detente has certainly had  consequences for the military sphere, it has not for the  intelligence services.    [Announcer] Would you like to hazard a guess as to the  extent  of KGB espionage here?    [Gerster] That is always a matter for speculation, as you  know. If we knew everything we could put an end to this dreadful  game. But I can say that as far as we know, there has been  absolutely no change in the level [of espionage]. What is  surprising is that it is not only old comrades who are, for  example, placed in Germany as spies, but we know, for example  from the MfS [Ministry for State Security] sphere, that is, the  GDR State Security Ministry, that individual employees -- not  just three out of five, but a somewhat larger number -- have for  example gone over to the Soviet Union and have offered their  services to the intelligence services there. That means that  the repertoire of people prepared to spy in Russia has become  bigger rather than smaller.    [Announcer] If the scope of espionage activity has therefore  increased, can one then say that the focus of the espionage has  switched to other spheres?    [Gerster] I know that another East European state, which  really is making efforts toward democracy, directs over 50  percent of its efforts specifically at Germany.    [Announcer] Which state do you mean?    [Gerster] I do not want to name it. The only positive thing  from our point of view in this case is that although these  efforts are continuing, financial resources are limited. (?As  you know) we are making efforts for a type of security  partnership with the East European states -- this (?concerns)  NATO -- which naturally also has an effect on the EC. I think  one should try -- the Germans cannot do this on their own -- to  convene a type of conference with the East European states in  order to hold talks and make it clear to them that there cannot,  on the one hand, be efforts for cooperation with the EC and a  security partnership with NATO, while simultaneously virtually  continuing subversive actions. I think this really must be made  an international issue and that we have every reason, especially  as a target of these espionage efforts, [words indistinct].    [Announcer] Can one assume that the targets of espionage  have  moved more from the military to the economic sphere?    [Gerster] One cannot say that. Both spheres are affected,  whereby there were always two main pillars in East European  espionage, economic espionage on the one hand, and on the other  espionage in the political sphere, thus not only in the  military, but in the overall political sphere.    [Announcer] Let us stay with economic espionage. Is it in  fact still worth finding out things through espionage in the  West, given that there are now numerous cooperation, training,  and further qualification agreements between the East and West?    [Gerster] Let me put it this way. Democracy is still very  fragile in Russia as well. What the official policies pursued  by President Yeltsin and others are really aimed at, namely an  opening up and real friendship with the democratic states of the  West, has obviously not yet sunk into those who over decades saw  us purely and simply as the enemy and are simply (?carrying on).  It is probable that with the efforts for a market economy and  democracy and survival in increasingly democratic conditions,  conditions are so tense there that the spheres of classic old  defense mechanisms, the old mistrust of all these have not yet  been dismantled.    Therefore, I repeat that we have deliberately, as the  Parliamentary Control Commission, offered our services. The  former KGB held a conference over a year ago, when experts from  the democratic parliaments of Germany, England, France, the  United States, and other states were (asked?) to Moscow to  advise them. What astonishes me is that all these good talks had  no results at all.    [Announcer] Perhaps they did have the result that the  Western states will help modernize the KGB?    [Gerster] Definitely not. We are not development aid workers  in matters concerning the revamping of the Russian secret  service. Rather we are helping --and this is a task for  parliamentarians -- to make it clear to people that  parliamentary control, that is transparency, is for example, the  duty of a secret service, or at least that it is conducted at  the very core of parliament in our country. It is necessary,  and efforts are made to avoid arbitrary acts and mistakes in the  secret services. Thus, it is if anything a lesson in democracy  and not a lesson in the technicalities of intelligence activity.    [Announcer] You have clearly shown, Mr. Gerster, that the  secret services of the Eastern states are still active here in  the West. Is it not the other way round too?    [Gerster] First, I think the fact that states should  (?conduct) information work on world developments is obvious.  Second, worldwide, I should say -- the Federal Intelligence  Service still exists after all -- but an intelligence service on  the basis of a democratic state is not an aggressive institution  but an information organization and continues (?to be so).    [Announcer] But the KGB spy in the CIA also only wanted  information?    [Gerster] Well yes, your question is justified. There is a  difference. What for example the KGB was well-known for in past  years, that it used illegal methods -- you can be sure that that  is not possible in a democracy that gathered information  legally, made it available it to the government, but [word  indistinct]....    [Announcer, interrupting] ...but not according to the laws  in  which the espionage is carried out?    [Gerster] Well, all right, but the democratic laws are much  more narrow, much more strict, and much more restrictive.  Therefore, I would prefer the Federal Intelligence Service to  work under the laws of the Federal Republic than under Russian  laws, with all due respect.    [Announcer] In view of the indignation about the exposure of  a KGB spy in the United States, don't you think that this  indignation is at least in part hypocritical?    [Gerster] I would not say that, because you can be equally  certain that we have not placed any agents in presidential  offices, in the office of Russian president, nor in the  political leadership. Our acquisition of information is partly  based on publicly available sources. The Western intelligence  agencies have always worked differently to intelligence services  in communist states. They should (?do) it on a different basis  in the future. To put it in a somewhat slangy way -- the  Federal Intelligence Service is as a rule significantly more  harmless than the public assumes, and I say that not to absolve  myself, but in complete awareness of what I am saying.</p>

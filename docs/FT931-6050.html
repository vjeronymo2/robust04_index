			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident So the gauntlet of Commercial Union's rights issue has not been taken up by General Accident. Sterling's exit from the ERM must take some credit. With a substantial portion of shareholders funds parked in dollar assets, a devalued sterling has been a prop for GA's balance sheet. Rising stock and bond markets have equally offered timely capital gains. That, and some judicious use of preference capital, has produced a comfortable solvency ratio of 46 per cent without recourse to shareholders. But yesterday's Pounds 110m preference issue does not plug the hole in the balance sheet created by another uncut, uncovered dividend. Although GA could raise more preference capital this year, that can only be taken so far. Since further currency and investment gains cannot be taken for granted, premium growth will ultimately require backing from retained earnings or a rights issue. Yesterday's figures reveal GA's ambition: UK premiums grew at an annual rate of 25 per cent in the fourth quarter, albeit boosted by a block of business taken from Municipal &amp; Mutual. With Pounds 1.2bn annual premium income in the UK and its chain of 400 estate agencies, GA looks geared to an upturn. Given another respectable result in Asia and a fair wind in the US - literally, given the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew - the 1993 dividend could be covered for the first time in four years. But there is little margin for error.</p>

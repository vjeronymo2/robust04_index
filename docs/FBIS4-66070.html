			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "m.t.l.": "The New Foreign Ministry Team is </F> Ready"]    [Text] Rome -- Antonio Martino has formed his team. The  new foreign minister made his decisions shortly before leaving  for the United States, but these are minor moves, at least for  the time being, and they do not touch the fundamental structure  of the Foreign Ministry.    As cabinet chief, Martino has appointed Emanuele Scammacca,  previously ambassador to the Holy See and then "exiled" to  represent Italy in Belgium. His deputy will be Giancarlo  Aragona, a security policy expert and in recent years diplomatic  adviser to the Ministry of Defense. The appointments have given  rise to a series of remarks in the corridors about the "Messina  lobby" which has installed itself at the Foreign Ministry. The  minister is from Messina, as is the secretary general,  Ferdinando Salleo (also his cousin), and Aragona, and, according  to malevolent tongues, Scammacca too. "But what do you mean?" a  smiling diplomat intervenes, "Scammacca is from Catania and, as  an ambassador's son, a citizen of the world."    Another "heavy" appointment is in the Press Service, which  has been entrusted to Maurizio Moreno, previously cabinet chief  to Emilio Colombo and then coordinator of Somalia policy at the  height of the crisis in Italy's intervention in this African  country. Piero Francese, who was then in charge of the service,  should become private secretary to the minister, a task which  traditionally goes to an "outsider" to the ministry.    Under Salleo's leadership, the recently renewed structure of  the general directorates remains unchanged for the time being.  Mouths closed, for the most part, including the large number of  civil servants detached as diplomatic advisers to the various  ministries. With the exception of Aragona's very delicate  posting at Defense, the others ought to remain substantially  unchanged.    In particular there are no plans for changes in the office  of  diplomatic adviser to the prime minister's office, where  Ambassador Sergio Vento remains for the moment, in the post to  which he was called by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato and  remained also under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Only in the coming  months, once the new ministers' teams have been put to the test,  could we expect rotations. At that time, something could also  change at the Foreign Ministry.</p>

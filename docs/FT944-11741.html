			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney The rumour that Euro Disney might close, which always looked implausible, suited Walt Disney while it was negotiating the theme park's rescue refinancing earlier this year. But it did nothing to help the business. Worried that they might arrive to find the gates shut, many potential customers decided not to book - leading to a sharp fall in visitors between March and May. They started to pick up from June, when the refinancing was concluded, though the total for the company's financial year was still down 10 per cent to 8.8m. Price cuts aimed at combating the park's expensive image left revenues 15 per cent lower. Despite tough overhead reductions, operating profits before financing costs fell to a mere FFr335m. The recovery in the shares, which jumped 13p to 96p, had more to do with the absence of the usual disappointments rather than anything more positive. There are some grounds for optimism. Those visitors the park does attract appear to leave well-satisfied, with a good proportion coming back again. Euro Disney should get a boost from the economic recovery in continental Europe and the recent weakness of the franc will help. But with rival parks planned for Spain and Germany, the prospects are hardly exciting.</p>

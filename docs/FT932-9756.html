			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria offloads AMB holding FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group controlled jointly by Ferruzzi and the Gaic holding company, yesterday sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs to a group of German institutions for DM985m (Dollars 616m). The deal concludes a long-running battle between the formerly-allied Italian and German insurers, and provides a much-needed cash injection to Fondiaria, Italy's third-biggest private-sector insurer. The buyers are Deutsche Bank (10 per cent), Allianz (5 per cent) and Dresdner Bank and Munchener Ruckversicherungs, which are taking about 3 per cent each. The deal follows months of secret negotiations over the stake, the existence of which had threatened to disrupt co-operation between AMB and Assurances Generales de France, the French state-owned insurer which owns just over 25 per cent in the German insurance company. Hostilities between AMB and AGF ended last summer and Fondiaria tried, unsuccessfully, to use its holding to block shareholder approval of the co-operation agreement between the French and German companies. The agreement involved the sale of AMB's holding in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth largest bank, to Credit Lyonnais in a transaction valuing BfG at DM2.1bn. The deal is a much-needed lift to Fondiaria, which has suffered falling profits as a result of difficulties in the Italian market and growing debts as a result of its foreign ambitions. Last year, Ferruzzi, which is facing a heavy debt burden, warned it intended to take a closer involvement in Fondiaria's affairs. The changes culminated in the departure of Mr Alfonso Scarpa, Fondiaria's managing director and architect of foreign expansion plans. Although Ferruzzi has emphasised its determination not to sell Fondiaria, a disposal is still widely expected by analysts in view of the parent company's severe debt problems. Among possible scenarios, short of selling Fondiaria, are the disposals of the group's Milano and La Previdente insurance subsidiaries.</p>

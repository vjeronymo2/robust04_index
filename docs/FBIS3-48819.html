			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Malaysia and Australia will investigate whether  opposition leaders in the country have received bribes from the  Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, as reported by an  Australian newspaper. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad  Badawi said if the report by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH is true, it is  a serious matter and it shows foreign interference in Malaysia's  affairs. He said the matter was among several issues he  discussed with Australian High Commissioner to Malaysia John  Dauth when the latter called on him at the ministry yesterday.  He added that Malaysia and Australia will try to verify the  report. So far it is only a press report.    Speaking to newsmen in Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Abdullah also  stressed that his meeting with Dauth was fixed some time ago and  had nothing to do with the report. According to the report,  ASIS agents had paid thousands of Australian dollars to certain  senior political leaders in Malaysia and Singapore since they  became members of parliament. Government leaders and DAP  [Democratic Action Party] leaders have strongly criticized the  report and called on Canberra to name those involved if the  allegations were indeed true.</p>

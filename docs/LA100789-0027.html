			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EGYPTIAN SENTENCED TO 11 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ROOMMATE'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A 21-year-old Egyptian was sentenced to 11 years in prison Friday for fatally  stabbing a Van Nuys man with whom he had been living.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne A. Stoltz imposed the maximum term on  Mohamed Abdelrazek, who had pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the  March 29, 1988, slaying of Suk Yun Yong, 51.  </P> <P> In asking for the maximum sentence, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert P. Imerman called  Abdelrazek, who was in the United States on a student visa but was not  attending school, "brutal, vicious and callous."  </P> <P> A probation report described Abdelrazek as a person with "no feelings for other  human beings" and a "spoiled brat" who lived off his wealthy Cairo family.  </P> <P> The victim was found in his Victory Boulevard apartment with nine deep stab  wounds, police said.  </P> <P> Stoltz ordered a second man who participated in the slaying, Michael Dean  Wieland, 20, to undergo a psychiatric evaluation before his sentencing,  scheduled for Jan. 5. Wieland, who also lived with Yong, pleaded guilty to  participating in the slaying.  </P> <P> Stoltz said while she accepted the probation report's assessment of Abdelrazek,  letters sent by Wieland's relatives "mystify me as to what kind of person he  is." She did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Abdelrazek and Wieland, who were arrested driving the victim's car, originally  had been charged with murder but were permitted to plead guilty to the reduced  charge.  </P></p>

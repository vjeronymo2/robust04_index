			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Ion Botnaru, by </F> Jerzy Haszczynski; place and date not given: "Problems  Inherited From Soviet Union"]    [Text] [Haszczynski] When the Soviet Union was  collapsing, the Moldovan authorities expressed their criticism  of the concept of the CIS. But last year, Moldova joined the  CIS anyway. How do you explain the change of attitude?    [Botnaru] Our links with the CIS are of a specific nature.  We are a de facto member of the CIS's economic union, but not  de iure, since we have not ratified the appropriate documents.  My view is that from an economic standpoint, Moldova should be  in the CIS's economic union since that is the real situation  from which we cannot get away. Our economic relations with the  West still leave a lot to be desired, but one must live somehow  until that situation changes. Generally speaking, the economic  relations of a new country should be multifaceted.    [Haszczynski] Is Moldova interested in the CIS only  from an economic standpoint?    [Botnaru] We do not participate in the CIS's military and  political structures. So far, we have not signed any agreements  which would relate, for instance, to security. What is  important, is what shape the CIS will take in the future.  Experience shows that those countries which have traditionally  been together, can make their lots easier if they act together.  But one should take part in such cooperation arrangements only  insofar as it does not endanger a country's sovereignty.    [Haszczynski] Do you not feel threatened by Russia?    [Botnaru] I regard our relations with Russia to be correct,  but there are still many problems which were inherited from the  Soviet Union, first of all the problem of the 14th Russian Army  which is stationed in Moldova. In my view, all problems can be  solved if both sides conduct a dialogue. I paid a visit to  Moscow recently, where I spoke with Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev. We listed the unresolved problems in  Russian-Moldovan relations and we signed a bilateral agreement.  Moldova has ratified it but Russia has not done so yet, and  because of that, solving other problems is being delayed, for  instance the problem of gasoline supplies to former Soviet  military personnel residing in Moldova.    A withdrawal of the 14th Army would have an exceptionally  positive impact on the development of Russian-Moldovan  relations. The problem of the Cisdniester region is linked to  that.    We think that some elements of Russia's relations with the  Cisdniester region could be described as interference in  Moldova's internal affairs. I mean the issue of Russian aid for  the Cisdniester region, both in material and political terms.    [Haszczynski] Was there any specific date set during  your Moscow talks, for the 14th Army's withdrawal from the  usurpatory Cisdniester Republic?    [Botnaru] Moldova's position is that the Russian Army should  withdraw by 1 July of this year. I regard that date as  realistic. Despite everything, there are fewer [Russian] troops  on our territory than used to be the case with Poland or other  East European countries. The withdrawal should be unconditional  and in accordance with international law and CSCE provisions.  Talks are under way. Moldova is absolutely against having  foreign troops stationed on its territory. I want to remind you  that all countries recognize Moldova within the boundaries in  which it proclaimed its independence in 1991, and that includes  the Cisdniester region.    [Haszczynski] How do you imagine a calming down of the  situation in the Cisdniester region? After all, fights have  already erupted there a few times and hundreds of people have  died. Is it possible, for instance, that Moldova should be  transformed into a federation?    [Botnaru] No. I think that the variety of nationalities and  their distribution in the various regions, make a federal state  impossible. Moldova is a small territory (33,700 square km)  which would be split into many small units if a federation was  to be established. Besides, the base criterion of a federation  is not completely clear, either. We used to live in the Soviet  Union and we were told then that it was a federation.    As far as the Cisdniester region is concerned, we granted  very far-reaching concessions and we guaranteed that if the  issue of Moldova's joining Romania came up, then the people of  the Cisdniester region could decide the territory's fate through  a referendum. Almost all political forces in Moldova think that  the Cisdniester region should have some kind of special status.  The necessity of a decentralization is linked with that. Some  amendments to our laws are indispensable, including the law on  languages. We must talk about a possibility of using several  languages in the country's offices: Let us say one of them  would be called the state language (Romanian), and the other two  would be called official languages (Ukrainian and Russian). The  new parliament and the new cabinet should start working on these  changes soon.    [Haszczynski] Do you really believe in a compromise?  After all, the authorities of the Trans-Dniester region have  announced that the region will take part neither in the  parliamentary elections (27 February) nor in the referendum on  Moldova's sovereignty and integrity (6 March).    [Botnaru] We do not seek the authorities' participation,  especially given that these are not lawful authorities. We are  after the people's participation; the usurpatory authorities'  control does not extend to the entire Cisdniester region. There  are areas and villages which cooperate with us. According to  what we have found out, the people living in the parts not under  the control of the usurpatory regime, will vote.    [Haszczynski] In official documents, your country is  known as the Republic of Moldova. Do the authorities of the  republic (which gained independence more than two years ago)  think that using the old name of "Moldavia" (which was used in  the Soviet period, among others) is inappropriate?    [Botnaru] "Moldavia" is a word of Russian origin. Right  now, Romanian is our official language, and in Romanian, our  country's name is "Moldova." But we have nothing against  someone using the Russian-derived name in newspapers, for  instance, as long as the name is used with respect.    [Haszczynski] How strong are the desires of Moldova to  join Romania, to which most of today's Moldova had belonged  before World War II?    [Botnaru] There are opposition political forces both in  Moldova and in Romania, which are in favor of a merger of the  two countries. I think the opposition is short-sighted. There  will be a referendum on 6 March which will finally decide the  issue of Moldova's sovereignty. But a referendum like this had  taken place before -- I mean the presidential elections of 1991.  The main slogan of the election campaign of Mircea Snegur --  who gained over 80 percent of the vote -- was Moldova's  independence. A majority of Moldovans (Romanians) is in favor  of independence. Almost all representatives of national  minorities are against the merger, as well; these minorities  comprise about 30 percent of the population. I think that those  who are in favor of merging with Romania comprise no more than 5  percent.    [Haszczynski] But still, Moldova's national flag is  the same as Romania's (three vertical stripes -- blue, yellow,  and red) and the national anthem -- which begins with the words:  "Wake up, Romanian" -- is also the same.    [Botnaru] The colors of the flag are indeed the same, but  there is a state emblem on our flag. I think that since the  parliament adopted the flag along with the state symbol, then  that is the way it must stay, especially since, for instance,  the Russian and the French flags have the same colors and their  combination is the only thing that makes them different. So I  can see no problem with the national flag.    But it is a different story with the national anthem. A  sovereign state should have its own national anthem. As a  diplomat, I often encounter this protocol problem. My view is  that the anthem must be changed. One must write a new anthem  and the parliament should adopt it. And that will not be an  unfriendly gesture toward anybody, since nowhere in the world do  you have a situation of two sovereign states sharing the same  national anthem.    [Haszczynski] In your view, what should one call  representatives of the nationality which constitutes the  majority in Moldova? Are they Romanians or Moldovans? Is the  language that they use Romanian or Moldavian (as it was called  in the times of the Soviet Union)? President Mircea Snegur has  recently expressed criticism about using "a Romanian,"  "Romanian," instead of "a Moldovan," "Moldovan."    [Botnaru] It is a unique kind of problem -- it contains  elements of history, as well as linguistic, psychological, and  ethnic sciences. I would not like to go into such details.  What is more important is that Moldova be transformed into a  country of its citizens. Everyone should have a right to be  called what he wants.    [Haszczynski] On 14-16 February, you paid a visit to  Warsaw. You spoke with President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak, and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What  are Moldova's political and economic expectations vis-a-vis  Poland?    [Botnaru] Poland's and Moldova's economies complement one  another, so they can cooperate with each other as well. Some  contracts have already been prepared pertaining to avoiding  double taxation and protecting investments. Polish people will  like our alcohol -- wines, high-quality champagnes, and cognacs.  On a more serious note, Poland can import from Moldova  agricultural products, broadly speaking. We are aware that  Polish businessmen are afraid to invest because of the conflict  in the Cisdniester region, but the conditions for investment  will improve soon.    Poland is an active country and its voice counts on the  international scene. It is a big country with big  possibilities. We regret that our two countries have, so far,  failed to set up a legal framework for our mutual relations. We  are happy to take note of the establishment of a Polish Embassy  in Chisinau in the near future. I do not hide the fact that we  hope to receive assistance from the Polish authorities on issues  where we have problems. The 14th Russian Army is stationed in  Moldova, whereas Polish people have experience when it comes to  the withdrawal of Russian troops.</p>

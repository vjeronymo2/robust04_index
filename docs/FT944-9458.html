			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (11): Rapid delivery vital - Software development The ability to build programs quickly has always been a goal for computer software developers. Users always want their new applications immediately and seldom understand why it takes so long to translate their requirements into working code. Over the past decade, fast delivery of new software has become more viable, partly because hardware and software technologies have improved but also because the techniques for building software are better understood. Software construction can be viewed more as an exercise in engineering than the arcane craft it once was. Applications can increasingly be assembled quickly from pre-fabricated components rather than carved from solid blocks of stone. The competitive nature of financial services makes fast delivery of software more important than in many sectors. So it is no surprise that banks and insurance companies are pioneers in what has come to be called Rapid Applications Development (Rad). Early experiences of using Rad techniques show that companies can make new applications work fast enough to gain an edge over their competitors. David Sprott, marketing director of Texas Instruments' software division, says: 'An investment company we are working with in the US succeeded in putting in an advice system in 10 months instead of two years.' The system had to provide a service, giving investment advice to the public via a touch-tone telephone network - 'using our tools and Rad techniques, it was able to build the system in phases and deliver it well ahead of the expected schedule,' he says. The Sumitomo Bank is another example. It used Rad techniques and development tools from the software supplier Uniface to build a bond lending and tracking application in eight months. But Mr Sprott says that although tools are important, there is much more to Rad than automating the production of programs - 'it's more important to see it as a set of management processes. You need a method to allow you to put software together that suits the business problem.' He identifies user involvement, 'timeboxing' and what he calls iterative development as being as important as the tools. Texas Instruments moved into the Rad market from a strong base in computer-aided software engineering (Case) where its Information Engineering Workbench (IEW) has long been a respected software tool. Its experience in the Case market has shown that tools must exist against a background of sound management and an understanding of users problems - 'users must be heavily involved - preferably full time  - so that they can influence the end-product and make sure that it will do the job they want,' he says. Timeboxing ensures that a software development project concentrates on the business priorities and ensures that at least a part of the system is delivered - 'normally, time is a variable in software development. But in Rad you must make the elapsed time a fixed quantity and vary the scope and resources to make sure you deliver something,' says Mr Sprott. User involvement and timeboxing come together in Mr Sprott's iterative approach to development. Each part of the application is built, tested and approved by the user as the project progresses - 'if you use an iterative approach, you are agreeing what you are building with the user all the time, and parts of the systems become available early. Very often 50 per cent of an application is not needed from day one. So you can deliver the important parts and let users become familiar with them.' This approach is echoed in the move towards object-oriented (O-O) systems which emphasise the re-use of program code and component software - a technique which Mr Sprott says will help users understand their applications better. 'If you use the concept of business objects - such as an invoice or a sales order - the user can see what is being delivered,' he says. The O-O approach also supports the phased delivery of applications - indeed, it changes the whole nature of what an application is. Mr Sprott sees the definition of an application changing - 'instead of talking about applications you can start talking about the scope of a system. You can use existing infrastructures and code to build new applications. This obviously speeds up development.' Texas Instruments' view is endorsed by most software developers aiming to produce software quickly. A recently formed industry body has published a 13-point plan for Rad. The Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) consortium, formed in January 1994, includes British Airways, American Express, Allied Domecq and J P Morgan Investment Management among its corporate members as well as leading software developers Logica, Data Sciences and Cognos. The 13 principles advocated by the consortium expand those outlined by Mr Sprott. They emphasise user involvement, a concentration on business requirements and iterative development alongside practical advice such as continuous testing, tight deadlines and close partnership between the developer and the user organisations. Rad is not seen as a panacea to the problems of building software quickly but it promises to be another evolutionary step on the long road to understanding the complex problems of translating user-needs into working business applications. When combined with O-O design and sound project management, it can produce results quickly. And because Rad places greater emphasis on user involvement than earlier software development methods, it also moves the priority away from the technology towards the business problem. Building software will always be difficult - but it is likely to be less so as the Rad approach gains support. The DSDM consortium can be contacted on tel 0242 603971</p>

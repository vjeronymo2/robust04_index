			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water shows 25% advance INVESTMENT PROFITS and rises in water charges allowed Northumbrian Water to lift half-year pre-tax profits by 25 per cent, from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 39.2m, despite rising debt and the impact of recession on recent acquisitions. Profit included a one-off gain of Pounds 7.3m from the maturity of its equities portfolio. That helped push earnings per share up by 27 per cent to 56.7p (44.8p), allowing the interim dividend to rise to 7.5p (6.8p). Mr Michael Taylor, finance director, said the recession had been 'noticeable' in the north-east of England but although commercial demand for treated water had fallen by about 3 per cent in the six months to September 30, this category accounted for only a small part of revenue. Turnover from the core regulated water and sewerage businesses rose to Pounds 93.4m (Pounds 84.4m) after a 10 per cent rise in water charges, allowing operating profit to rise by 29 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 21.2m). Turnover in non-regulated water businesses - the Keilder reservoir and the supply of untreated water to industry - rose to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 10.5m) following an increase in charges, but operating profits were squeezed to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.6m). Other turnover rose to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 3.1m), mainly from acquisitions of water services and leasing companies. They were hard hit by recession and operating profit rose only to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.3m). Associated companies - the joint venture bid to open a new sewage sludge treatment plant - again cost Pounds 100,000. The Department of the Environment has turned down the project's appeal and the group will now have to investigate incineration schemes. Net interest payable was Pounds 3.5m, compared to Pounds 3.2m receivable. Capital expenditure of Pounds 52m and acquisitions of Pounds 7m in the first half took net debt to Pounds 54.4m, compared to Pounds 85.8m cash in September 1991 and Pounds 6.1m net cash in March 1992. Sir Michael Straker, chairman, said that he welcomed the stability given by the recent agreement with Ofwat, the water industry regulator, to allow increases in charges of 6 per cent above inflation in 1993-4 and of 7 per cent the following year. COMMENT The eye-catching increase in pre-tax profits owes even more to Northumbrian's investment fund than to its core businesses. That fund is now wound up, net cash has become net debt, and growing interest bills will begin to restrain profits growth. The group's attractions remain its larger than average non-regulated businesses and high dividend cover. But if the National Rivers Authority chooses to take a stringent interpretation of the EC Urban Waste Water Directive that could double the annual capital spending bill. That uncertainty, the likelihood of tighter regulation after Ofwat's 1994 industry review, and the strong performance of the shares so far this year may mean that short term performance is dull.</p>

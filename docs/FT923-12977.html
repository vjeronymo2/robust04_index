			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: UK should press for D-Mark to be revalued, says Kinnock Sir, It seems untenable that the UK government insists on holding the value of the pound against the D-Mark in the ERM, even if other governments forced a realignment. The only country in the ERM that is worried about inflation and high monetary growth is Germany, and the classic way to deal with the former is to revalue the currency. If Germany adopted this attitude and revalued unilaterally against all the other members of the ERM by a meaningful amount, then the current foreign holders of the D-Mark would readily accept lower interest rates having made a substantial profit by holding the D-Mark. This would not only help to relieve the recess-ionary tendencies we are all suffering from, but would also help Germany in its fight against inflation. Inflationary effects of its revaluation would only have a negligible effect within the UK. Ivo Fuchs, Braydon Hall, Minety, nr Malmesbury, Wiltshire SN16 9QX</p>

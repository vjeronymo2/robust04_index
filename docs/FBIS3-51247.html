At the same time,  Ernesto Perez [Balladares], PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party]  candidate, continues to lead the national voters preference poll  with a 13.1 percent margin.    The third CELA "Elections 94" poll was conducted throughout  the country at the end of December 1993, and interviewed 2,681  persons. Of the population sample interviewed, 75.4 percent  indicated they would vote during the coming 8 May presidential  elections, 16 percent were undecided, and 9 percent said they  would abstain.    The results of the poll were made public yesterday during a  news conference by CELA Secretary Marco Gandasegui who explained  that the sampling reflects a 3 percent, more or less, margin of  error. It was also reported that due to technical problems, the  poll does not include the Provinces of Bocas del Toro, Darien,  or the San Blas territory.    The Electoral Tribunal has indicated that 1.5 million voters  are eligible to select President Guillermo Endara's successor,  two vice presidents, 71 legislators, 65 mayors, 510  corregimiento representatives, and several council members.    CELA pointed out that voters most emphatic about abstaining  are mostly senior citizens, while the undecided voters are  mostly lower income groups and those with less education.    According to the sample, Ruben Blades, presidential  candidate  for the Papa Egoro party follows Perez with 9.3 percent;  followed by Arnulfist Party [PA] candidate Mireya Gruber with  5.3 percent; Guillermo Ford of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement] Party, 3.9 percent; former Comptroller  General Ruben Carles, 3.5 percent; and Ricardo Arias Calderon of  the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] with 3.1 percent.    In the metropolitan area of Panama City, Perez also leads  voters preference with 13.4 percent, followed by Blades and  former Comptroller General Carles. At the same time, Gruber and  Arias Calderon improved in comparison with the last poll. Mrs.  Gruber recorded 4.4 percent and Arias Calderon recorded 3.6  percent in the metropolitan area.    In Cocle, Veraguas, Los Santos, Chiriqui, parts of Panama  and  Colon, Gruber came in second with 6.5 percent, Blades was third  with 5.8 percent, while Perez headed voters preference with 12.7  percent.</p>

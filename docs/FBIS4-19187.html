			<p>BFN     [Text] In the National Assembly this afternoon the  Socialist and Communist deputies tabled a no-confidence motion  that had no chance of being adopted, and was furthermore,  rejected a few seconds ago, as it received only 87 votes, and it  would take 289 to bring the government down.    However, it was a good opportunity nevertheless, to  criticize  the social policy of the government of Edouard Balladur, and, as  the Socialist Martin Malvy said, to compare the promises made  with the results obtained. Communist Alain Bocquet for his part  advocated the abrogation of the five-year law on employment.  The prime minister replied during the afternoon: This  no-confidence motion was tabled by the very same people who are  responsible for the situation that we inherited.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Fox snaps up football from CBS Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network has dropped a bomb on the US sports television map with a Dollars 395m-a-year bid that has stripped American football broadcasting rights away from the venerable CBS network. Fox, still viewed as an upstart among the US television networks with programming built around teenage soap operas and mildly salacious comedies, offered Dollars 1.58bn (Pounds 1.06bn) over four years for the rights to broadcast Sunday afternoon games from the National Football Conference, the stronger of the two professional American football leagues. The bid was 50 per cent higher than CBS paid for the last four years and is believed to have been about Dollars 100m a year higher than CBS was willing to pay. CBS is now understood to have made an offer of more than Dollars 265m a year for rights to broadcast games from the American Football Conference, the weaker league, but NBC, which currently holds these rights, may match the bid. With ABC retaining the rights to a Monday night game for more than Dollars 225m a year, and the ESPN and Turner Network Television cable channels paying about the same for a Sunday night game, the professional American football leagues are expected to reap at least Dollars 4.3bn from television over the next four years. Although American football games are widely watched, advertising revenues have not matched the high fees paid in recent years, although the games provide an important lead into evening programming. CBS is estimated to have lost around Dollars 100m on its NFC contract last year. Mr Murdoch acknowledged Fox might lose money in the early years of the NFC contract, but said he expected to make money eventually, adding that the deal would make Fox into a real network. Other television sports executives, however, believe Fox is certain to lose heavily on the contract, and viewed the bid as a desperate attempt to prevent some of Fox's 139 affiliated stations from defecting to other networks.</p>

Richard West Jr., an Indian  activist attorney and former Stanford University professor, to direct the  National Museum of the American Indian it will build on the Mall.  </P> <P> West told reporters that he wants the $106-million museum to represent more  than just the "romanticized past" of American tribal people.  </P> <P> He said it will serve as a link to contemporary Indian culture throughout the  Western Hemisphere, and address politically charged issues such as alleged  genocide against Indians in Brazil and recent conflicts between Mohawk  tribesmen along the Canadian border.  </P> <P> The collections will consist largely of items to be received from New York's  Heye Foundation.  </P> <P> West, a Cheyenne-Arapaho, was born in San Bernardino. A 1965 graduate of  Redlands University, he earned a master's degree in American history from  Harvard University and a law degree from Stanford's School of Law, where he was  an adjunct professor.  </P></p>

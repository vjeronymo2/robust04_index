			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques restates cash flow CONTROL TECHNIQUES, the Powys-based electronic drives group, has been required to re-state the cash flow figures in its 1992 annual report after discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. In an unusual move following an examination of its accounts by the panel, the company has circulated amended numbers in a statement on Topic, the Stock Exchange news service, to correct what it calls a 'classification error'. The accounts for the year to September 30 1992 wrongly showed the cash impact of the disposal of two subsidiaries under FRS 1, the accounting standard on the format of the cash flow statement. This had the effect of incorrectly showing the company with a net inflow before financing of Pounds 100,000, while the amended version shows it with a net outflow of Pounds 1.14m for the year. Control said the change had no impact on the 1992 profit and loss account or balance sheet figures. The error was not picked up by the Birmingham office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand which approved the 1992 accounts without qualification. It charged Pounds 199,000 for its audit during the year and a further Pounds 117,000 for other services. Coopers, the UK's largest accountancy firm, said: 'It was a complex standard being applied for the first time. A technical error was made but it wasn't material and it has been corrected. There was a mistake. Everybody accepts that.' The original cash flow statement showed Pounds 1.39m in proceeds from the sale of Control Techniques Process Instruments and the Thermosensors segment of Control Techniques Process Systems. But it failed to exclude the elements of working capital of the businesses sold in the reconciliation from operating profit to net cash flow from operating activities in a note required by FRS 1.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STAR WARS'  </P> <P> While the thought of Dan Quayle ever holding the reins of presidential power  has frightened many of us, I suspect we may have grounds for being encouraged  now. The man must be proving himself more competent these days than we realize,  or he wouldn't have been entrusted with the job of laying it on the line about  the less than super "Star Wars" (Part I, Sept. 7-8).  </P> <P> Although White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater mouthed obligatory disapproval  of the term "political jargon" in regard to how President Reagan sold the  program, I suspect Quayle's label privately pleased the Administration  immensely. President Bush will be rightly seen, regarding defense matters, as  refreshingly more realistic, honest and intelligent than his predecessor. And  yet, by having Danny Boy do the job of setting the nation straight, Bush  retains all his loyalty points, not saying anything unfavorable himself about  his old boss. No, folks, Reagan wasn't dumb or ignorant about "Star Wars," and  of course we all know a nice guy like that wouldn't lie, would he? Indeed, the  man just got a little carried away with "political jargon."  </P> <P> In any event, maybe Bush deserves congratulations for choosing Quayle, in spite  of how foolish a move it seemed about a year ago. Ironically, Quayle's  ineptness can be artful, as his latest utterance shows. And with that in mind,  the man may prove to be an increasingly useful vehicle for Bush to safely say  certain things that need saying.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH WATSON  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

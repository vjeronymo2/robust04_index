			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in </F> Slovenia by an unidentified announcer in Zagreb; from the  "Slikom na Sliku" program -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Our Foreign Minister Mate Granic is on  the phone. Good evening.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Announcer] We were told that hot, topical issues were  discussed. What was your impression of today's talks, will  Croatian-Slovene relations finally begin registering an upward  trend?    [Granic] The atmosphere was very good and I believe that an  important step forward was made today. I am convinced that  eight to 10 agreements will be ready for signing on 7 February,  as agreed.    I am particularly convinced that considerable progress had  been made regarding the resolution of the Krsko [Slovene nuclear  power plant supplying electricity to Croatia] problem, the  resolution of the problem concerning the agreement on property,  and the agreement on the Ljubljana Bank. We presented our  proposals in these cases and I believe that we now have a  proximity of views. We will continue the talks and try to solve  this problem -- one of the major problems -- by 7 February.    Agreements on cultural and educational cooperation, trade,  regular air traffic, the water industry, employment, social  security, long-term cooperation in the use of the Slovene  transit gas pipeline, and fishing rights -- all these are ready  and should be concluded by 7 February.    [Announcer] Do the Slovenes reproach us in any way and why  have there not been such top-level meetings in the past?    [Granic] I believe that conditions have now become ripe,  that  both sides have realized that to sign all these agreements would  be extremely beneficial to both countries, and that compromise  solutions must found in certain areas.    [Announcer] Slovenia has much better relations with its  other  neighbors than with Croatia, and we have heard recently that  they fear the Croats the most. What is the reason for this, and  how do you think this will evolve in future?    [Granic] I believe that matters will begin moving in a  different direction after the signing of these agreements on 7  February, and that one cannot expect only one side to make  compromises. Anyway, most of the problems are a consequence of  the disintegration of former Yugoslavia, and these problems can  only be resolved through compromise solutions.    [Announcer] Today, you also addressed the Council of Europe  in Strasbourg. Today, you took part in two important events.  What happened in Strasbourg?    [Granic] In Strasbourg I had meetings with all officials of  the Council of Europe, from Mrs. Lalumiere, the secretary  general, Parliamentary Assembly President [Miguel Anjel]  Martinez, to [Gerhard] Reddemann, the Political Affairs  Committee president, and all other top officials including the  special envoy for Croatia, Baron Finsberg.    I would like to tell you in a few sentences about the gist  of  all these meetings: As the main obstacle for the speedy  admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe they singled out  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and obviously problems in  connection with halting the war and reaching an agreement. I  think this is the main obstacle, both when it comes to public  opinion, Europe, and all the problems proceeding from there.    They positively assessed Croatia's efforts in the course of  the latest meetings in Geneva and Brussels, but, in any case,  they said an agreement between the Muslims and Croats was  desirable.    On the other hand, I can also say that all positively  assessed the beginning of normalization of relations between the  Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and  the signing of the joint declaration as the first step in the  normalization of the relations, and in this connection they  expressed their support in very clear terms.    They had increasingly fewer remarks for the development of  democracy in the Republic of Croatia, even though there were  some remarks in connection with the media, to which I believe  they received satisfactory replies.    [Announcer] I am sorry to interrupt you. Can you tell us in  more detail what their concrete remarks to this were?    [Granic] They were concretely interested to know about the  issue of Mr. Ivancic [FERAL TRIBUNE editor in chief who was  called up on 31 December], for whom we said was mobilized as all  other able-bodied men of his age. On the other hand, if we  receive an application for compulsory work orders [for him], we  will in every case support it, and he will be treated as all  other press editors in the Republic of Croatia. There were some  remarks in connection with television without any particular  specifications of problems. I would like to say that there have  been no major criticisms.    [Announcer] So you said that they supported all Croatian  moves. Then how can you explain that Croatia's guest status to  the Council of Europe was frozen.    [Granic] We should note that some parliamentarians initiated  a process for the expulsion of Croatia, or for it to be denied  special guest status. However, the special guest status  remained; at the level of our bureau it has been frozen for a  certain period of time, but envoys for Croatia have been  appointed. I believe, that if we achieve some progress in  connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the process of  admitting Croatia as a permanent member to the Council of Europe  will be immediately resumed.    [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for being a  guest  of the Slikom na Sliku program.</p>

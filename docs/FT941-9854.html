			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / EU withdraws offer to open up banana trade The European Commission yesterday withdrew its offer of increased access for Latin American producers to the Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) European Union banana market. The Commission's decision came as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade published a report condemning the EU's banana trade arrangements. The Commission's move is likely to sour relations between the EU and the Latin American banana producers even further. Five Latin American exporters have complained to Gatt about the EU's preferential trade arrangements for bananas with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Gatt report yesterday upheld the Latin Americans' complaint, saying that trade with ACP countries under the Lome convention is outside Gatt rules. But since the adoption of the report can be blocked by any other Gatt member, it will almost certainly not be acted upon. To try to head off the Gatt report, the Commission had offered the Latin Americans improved access to the banana market as long as they withdrew their complaint. But the improved offer of an import ceiling for bananas of 2.1m tonnes this year rising to 2.2m tonnes in 1995 was rejected by Costa Rica and Guatemala. Costa Rica is looking for additional concessions. 'If we have to operate under an illegal system without fair trade, we want to make sure our growers get the best deal,' said Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign minister. Ironically, now that the EU and Latin Americans have failed to reach agreement on improved access, the banana regime implemented last July will remain in place. This leaves the Latin American producers worse off. However, some member countries led by Germany also oppose the EU's banana trade regime - Germany has lodged a complaint with the European Court. The Costa Ricans are hoping Germany will back them in pushing for a more open EU banana trade.</p>

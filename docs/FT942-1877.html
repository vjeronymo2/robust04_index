			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: Don't blame the messenger - Television First indications that something odd was happening reached me at 2.45 on Saturday morning. Listening to Radio 5 Live as I cleaned my teeth I heard Richard Dallyn (sensibly grabbed from LBC by the BBC's new continuous news network) patching into a live transmission between a helicopter in Orange County, California, and Ted Turner's 24-hour television news channel, CNN. Someone called OJ Simpson was being chased up Interstate 405 by umpteen 'black and whites' (Los Angeles police cars) with TV choppers following overhead. By noon of the same day I was talking live on air, via the telephone, to Brian Hayes in his Radio 2 programme Hayes On Saturday. We were discussing the way in which matters develop instantaneously into media events these days. Before Saturday I had never heard of OJ Simpson. By lunchtime of that day, having been tanked up with media coverage like a racing car at a pit stop, I was able to suggest knowledgeably to Radio 2 listeners that in order to understand American interest in the incident we needed to imagine 18 Metropolitan Police cars on the M1 chasing a Range Rover in which passenger Gary Lineker was holding a gun to his own head while talking on a cellular phone to a detective in Scotland Yard, explaining his suicidal instincts after being accused of the murder of his wife and her toy boy. All this I had gathered from virtually non-stop coverage of the incident on Sky News which relayed America's ABC News to British viewers, and from terrestrial television news which also provided extensive inserts of American footage. However, it is the subsequent reactions in the other mass media that are so interesting. More often than with any other medium, the television messenger is routinely blamed for the messages it delivers, and here was a classic instance. News stories of this sort - visually dramatic, long lasting, and occurring in peak viewing hours - are meat and drink to 24-hour news channels, though they occur very rarely. Apart from wars, CNN has won its top ratings with coverage of the frantic attempts by emergency services over some days to rescue a child trapped down a well. Television did not put her there, nor force the public to watch: it simply provided the newsreels, but CNN was likened to a vulture. So too with the OJ Simpson story. In Monday's Daily Mail we were told that 'Big Brother television' had been watching, and that 'the dividing line between true life and movie fantasy has become dangerously blurred'. As with much commentary elsewhere this seems to have been prompted by the fact that many American viewers left their screens to drive out on to the freeway and cheer their hero (Simpson having moved on from fame in American football to greater fame in Hollywood films). But the viewers chose of their own free will to do that; television was merely the technology which conveyed the pictures - a technology which, incidentally, in these sorts of circumstances leaves newspapers and even radio looking pretty flat footed. What is so striking is the widespread desire to blame television for matters over which it has little if any control. You might imagine, from the vilification being aimed this week at television sports departments, that broadcasters had conspired to arrange a clash between World Cup football, Wimbledon tennis and Test cricket. 'A hundred and fifty hours of sport in one week] How can they possibly justify it?' ask the radio and newspaper commentators. The answer, presumably, is that the television chiefs would be the first to avoid such clashes if they could; they must be at their wits' end finding enough outside-broadcast equipment, and seething at the way that the different sports will damage one another's potential ratings. Yet many people seem to feel a need for something other than ourselves on which to blame the baser instincts of mankind. There have been supercilious reactions to the inclusion in the final episode of ITV's excellent documentary series about the British royal family, The Windsors, of extracts from the 'Squidgy' and 'Camillagate' tapes. In the first someone who sounds awfully like Princess Diana uses the 'F' word while talking to a man friend about the royal family, and in the second someone who sounds awfully like Prince Charles says how he needs several times a week the woman on the other end of the line who sounds awfully like Camilla Parker Bowles. Television did not commission or create those tapes and I for one was grateful to hear them, rather than simply to see them transcribed in print. Royalists may not like what they convey, but viewer/voter/subjects in this mature old democracy are surely entitled to consider such vivid bits of evidence. Television can rightly be blamed for its messages when the broadcasters are responsible for commissioning them. Last week's Dimbleby Lecture was an example. By inviting as lecturer the head of MI5, the BBC made itself a part of an old British problem (a powerful instinct among politicians and civil servants to conceal matters from those who elect and pay them) rather than part of a possible answer (mass media with an instinct to disclose and a policy of digging and challenging). Stella Rimington was given 45 minutes of public service broadcasting time to deliver a PR hand-out - the gist being 'We are honest, trustworthy, over stretched, endlessly accountable and generally rather charming don't you like this buttercup yellow outfit?' - and of course nobody was allowed to challenge her. She admitted 'A cynic may say 'How can I know that what you are saying is true?'' Actually you only need to be ordinarily sane to ask that question, to which, of course, she had no answer. But the most important time to blame television is when it fails to provide the messages that it ought to. True, it was not the broadcasters' fault that cameras, and thus the general public, were excluded from the Scott Inquiry investigating the arms-for-Iraq imbroglio which so vividly illustrated both the institutionalised secrecy of the British state and the contempt in which some politicians and civil servants now hold the public. In the US, television coverage would have been routine and public interest consequently enormous. But if fringe theatre can come up with a way of tackling the job, so should television. Nicholas Kent's production, Half The Picture, currently at the Tricycle in Kilburn is a fascinating stage documentary on the Scott Inquiry which could easily be transferred to the small screen. The quicker somebody in television snaps up this message and delivers it to a national audience, the better.</p>

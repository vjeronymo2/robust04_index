			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Furnishing shown as suffering in recession THE FURNITURE and carpet retailing sectors experienced 'appalling' trading conditions in 1990 and continue to be the most depressed area of the high street, according to a report by Verdict research consultants. Spending on furniture fell by almost 6 per cent in real terms last year, while the market for floor coverings declined by 7.6 per cent. Verdict forecasts that the sector will be one of the last to recover from the recession as buying furniture and carpets will remain at the bottom of the shopping list for most consumers. High interest rates have depressed overall demand, sapped the strength of the housing market and affected many retailers struggling with debt. Lowndes Queensway has already succumbed to the recession. MFI and Magnet are burdened by heavy borrowing. Verdict on Furniture and Carpet Retailers 1991. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6JS. Pounds 595.</p>

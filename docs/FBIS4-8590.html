			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the BALKAN NEWS AGENCY the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] could demand the resignation of the  cabinet if it allows the United Nations to use a corridor  through Bulgarian territory.    During a break in the National Assembly session today, the  BSP parliamentary group discussed this issue but did not reach a  specific decision. There were equal numbers of votes for and  against.    The parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces  is postponing its decision on the same matter, because it is not  clear whether the United Nations really requested a military  corridor through Bulgarian territory.</p>

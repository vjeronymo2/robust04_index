			<p>BFN     [Text] Delegations of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA]  of Croatia and the Croatian National Council of  Bosnia-Herzegovina headed by their chairmen, Dr. Semso Stankovic  and Dr.Ivo Komsic, met in Zagreb today. At this meeting, the  delegations resumed the talks that were begun in Sarajevo on 1  June with a view to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  implementing the Washington and Vienna agreements. A high  degree of accord was reached on many issues. Regarding  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, both delegations start from the  stand that Bosnia-Herzegovina is indivisible and sovereign  within its internationally recognized borders, that its peoples  are sovereign on the entire territory of the state, and that the  Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is only a road toward a final  reintegration of all parts of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  within its borders.    The two delegations do not recognize the results of the  genocide and will invest maximum effort toward having all  escaped and displaced people return to their homes. The  delegations agree that the persons responsible for crimes  committed in war cannot be entrusted mandates within the  establishment of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  particularly in the authorities.    The delegations also agree that the creation of permanent  cooperation between Croatian and Bosniak peoples should be  worked upon with a view to preserving the independence of  Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders.</p>

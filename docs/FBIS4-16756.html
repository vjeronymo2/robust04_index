			<p>BFN     [Text] The case of the State Committee for the State of  Emergency [SCSE] has been transferred for further consideration  to General of Justice Viktor Yaskin, judge of the Russian  Supreme Court. The Russian legislation allows only 28 days for  a judge to come up with a decision - in this case, either to  resume the court trial of the SCSE or to abort it and close this  trial for good.</p>

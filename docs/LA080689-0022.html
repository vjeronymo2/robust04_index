			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE KITCHEN: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NOTES ON FRESH CHEESES, AND GARDEN AND ANIMAL EVENTS;  </P> <P> FRESH CHEESES  </P> <P> SOME KINDS OF cheese get better as they get older, hitting their peak after  they've been aged for a few years. Other cheeses, however, are at their best  when they're made, then begin to wane almost immediately.  </P> <P> Mozzarella falls into the latter category. So does rich-tasting ricotta.  Mascarpone, the soft, creamy and slightly tangy Italian version of cream  cheese, is another cheese that is never better than in the first moments of  life.  </P> <P> At the grocery store, your chances of getting freshly made cheeses are pretty  slim. But that doesn't mean you have to settle for old cheese. The Mozzarella  Co., a Texas outfit, carefully packs its cheeses into Styrofoam coolers the day  they are made, adds an icepack and ships them by overnight mail.  </P> <P> Postage is expensive (2 to 4 pounds, for example, is $15) -- you'd have to need  a lot of cheese to make ordering it worth your while. Still, if you were having  a party and planning on serving an appetizer of mozzarella with tomatoes and  basil, or a simple mascarpone dip, or you need a lot of ricotta for a  cheesecake or lasagna, this cheese would surely be a hit. The mozzarella is  tangy and soft ($7.50 a pound), the ricotta ($3) is absolutely fresh and  delightful, and the mascarpone ($7.50) is addictive. The company also makes a  wide range of other cheeses, including a fromage blanc made from cow's ($4) or  goat's ($9.50) milk, various goat cheeses and caciotta ($7), a semi-soft,  mellow wheel cheese. As an introduction, try the Classic Italian Sampler -- two  pounds of mozarella, and a pound each of ricotta and mascarpone -- for $42.50  (includes shipping). The company ships Monday through Thursday for delivery the  following day.  </P> <P>  For a product list of fresh cheeses, write to The Mozzarella Co., 2944 Elm  St., Dallas, Tex. 75226; or telephone (214) 741-4072.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Wider Customs powers attacked Labour protested yesterday at government proposals to extend Customs officials' powers of inspection and complained that a planned two-stage review procedure would not allow companies a fair chance of appeal against Customs &amp; Excise decisions, Graham Bowley writes. New proposals in the finance bill would give Customs officials the power to inspect the books of companies that 'finance or facilitate' businesses involved in import and export activities. Mr Andrew Smith, a Labour treasury spokesman, said: 'Banks, lawyers and accountants would certainly come within this definition. Customs would now have the right to demand these people breach client confidentiality.' But Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, said that the move away from the physical control of goods as they passed the borders towards an audit-based system in the collection of Customs duties meant that such powers were necessary to give auditors access to the information they required. He said such measures already existed for the collection of excise duties and VAT.</p>

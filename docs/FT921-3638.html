			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: PFG Hodgson makes Pounds 10.5m cash call PFG HODGSON Kenyon Int-ernational, the UK's largest quoted funeral services company, yesterday announced a 2-for-3 rights issue to raise Pounds 10.5m. The cash will be used to reduce borrowings. The company is changing its name to Plantsbrook Group. The cash call came as the group reported pre-tax profits down 19 per cent from Pounds 8.08m to Pounds 6.55m on sales of Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 50.8m) for the year to December 31. The national death rate remained flat, with market share stabilising at 9.5 per cent. A reduction in staff of 119 to 1,331 cost the group Pounds 900,000, taken above the line. An extraordinary provision of Pounds 867,000 was made to cover the anticipated losses of closing the crematorium in Bury St Edmonds and the withdrawal from the manufacture of monumental masonry. The new shares are being issued at 40p, against yesterday's closing price of 43p, down 5p on the day. The proceeds will reduce pro-forma borrowings to Pounds 19.2m, for pro-forma gearing of 108 per cent, against 415 per cent on December 31. Omnium de Gestion et de Financement, of which Pompes Funebres Generales, the French funeral group and PHKI's biggest shareholder is a subsidiary, is to act as underwriter. PHKI is also proposing to delay redemption of its unlisted B preference shares by five years coupled with an amendment to the rate of their conversion into ordinary shares. An agreement has been reached with Pompes which holds 99.6 per cent of the B preference shares to move the proposed redemption date to October 31 1998. In return the conversion rate is being raised from 0.4 to 1.6 ordinary shares for each B preference. Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive of PHKI, said the group did not want to face a redemption in 1993 which would have cost it Pounds 15.5m. The Takeover Panel has waived the requirement for Omnium and Pompes to make a full offer, subject to the agreement of the minority holders. The two could hold a total stake of almost 70 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 8.05p (9.77p). A recommended final dividend of 2p, (1.5p) makes a total of 3p.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BA suspends plan to make further USAir investment British Airways is suspending further investment in USAir until its US airline partner restructures itself to cut losses. USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, is expected to inform its unions this week of BA's decision. The UK carrier has already invested Dollars 400m in a 24 per cent stake in USAir. It made its initial investment of Dollars 300m in January 1993 and then invested a further Dollars 100m in May 1993 in a rights issue to maintain its 24 per cent stake in the airline. Under the original agreement with USAir, BA also planned to invest a further Dollars 450m in the US carrier over the next five years in two separate phases to bring its total stake to around 44 per cent. But the UK carrier is now suspending any further financial investment in USAir, whose management has been seeking union approval for significant restructuring and cost reductions to return the carrier to profit. USAir has faced particularly fierce competition from low-cost US airlines and has continued to lose money. It made a pre-tax loss of Dollars 180m in its latest quarter. BA's decision to freeze its investment in USAir does not appear to have any relation to the current difficult negotiations between the US and the UK governments over a new aviation agreement between the two countries. American Airlines and Delta Airlines, two of the biggest US carriers, have asked their government to renounce the agreement with the UK and withdraw BA's ticket co-sharing rights with USAir unless they can secure more access to the UK market and especially to London's Heathrow airport. BA's co-sharing agreement with USAir runs out on March 17. The UK government has warned it would retaliate should the US government not renew the agreement.</p>

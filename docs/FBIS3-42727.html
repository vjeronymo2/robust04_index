			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador-at-large of </F> the Russian Federation and special representative of the  president of the Russian Federation for Nagornyy Karabakh, by  Aydyn Mekhtiyev; place and date not given: "`The Main Thing Is  To Prevent Internationalization of the Conflict'"]    [Text]    [Mekhtiyev] Vladimir Nikolayevich, the situation has once  again deteriorated in the zone of the Armenia-Azerbaijan  conflict in recent days. How might you evaluate the present  situation in the region?    [Kazimirov] "Karabakh" has, unfortunately, on the vast  territory of the former Soviet Union, and beyond, perhaps,  become a byword for ethnic and territorial conflicts primarily  in the sense of duration, unlimited brutality, and irrationality  even. This was not only the first armed conflict on the  territory of the USSR but has also been the most protracted and  bloody. I would put among its salient features the following:  ancient historical roots and the gradual growth of a focal--more  precisely, multi-focal--power conflict into a large-scale war;  its expansion far beyond Nagornyy Karabakh, up to the borders of  other states, to the dangerous brink of internationalization,  and the massive use of modern heavy arms, including aviation,  tanks, and other armored equipment, artillery, and salvo-fire  missile launchers, very often against populated localities and  civilian targets, what is more. Large casualties among the  peaceful population, mass flows of deported and displaced  persons, refugees, broad economic, power, and transport  blockades infringing the interests of other states also, and  flagrant and mass violations of international humanitarian law.    All this makes simply imperative the need for a settlement  of  the Karabakh conflict, both speedy and lasting, what is more,  which is possible now only with the active assistance and  guarantees of the international community. These and other  salient features of the conflict, including the parties' immense  mutual distrust, irreconcilability, and inflexibility, and the  general destabilization of the region are creating particular  difficulties for an end to the bloodshed and a political  settlement. Whence the need for impartial mediation and the  limited nature of the peacemaking resources which may be engaged.    Russia's mediation efforts are continuing with all due  persistence and in the most diverse forms. The president and  foreign minister of the Russian Federation are constantly  keeping this issue in their field of vision. Messages between  heads of state are being exchanged, and there are telephone  conversations with them and trips by the president of Russia's  special representative to the conflict region.    A.V. Kozyrev's negotiations 18-20 January in Moscow with G.  Gasanov and V. Papazyan, ministers of foreign affairs of  Azerbaijan and Armenia respectively, and also with A. Gukasyan,  representative of the leadership of Nagornyy Karabakh, were  significant. A certain convergence of the positions of the  antagonists on questions of the conclusion of an agreement on a  complete cessation of military operations was noted. Mutual  understanding concerning the intensive continuation of this work  was reached.    The military situation in the conflict zone demands this  also. We regret that the new spiral of military operations has  entailed heavy losses on both sides. This is unforgivable,  especially since the negotiating process confirms the  possibility of a peaceful resolution of all problems of the  conflict.    [Mekhtiyev] Nonetheless, could you describe in more detail  the essence of the proposals that the leadership of the Russian  Federation has addressed to the parties to the conflict?    [Kazimirov] Since June 1992 practically our efforts have  been  concentrated on the accomplishment of a fundamental task--an end  to military operations, total and universal, by way of the  conclusion of an agreement among all the antagonists. We believe  that this is the key to a resolution of other problems born of  the conflict. This is dictated not only by natural  considerations of humanity but also by a whole number of  pragmatic considerations. We are insisting on an immediate  termination of military operations, liberation of the captured  territories, and the lifting of the economic and transport  blockade and also on conditions for the return of refugees to  the places they have abandoned. All this would create favorable  conditions for the transition to the parties' political  settlement of the contentious issues, including the definition  and specification of the mutually acceptable legal status of  Nagornyy Karabakh.    I would recall that in April 1992 the parties to the  conflict  were offered an approximate outline of a two-stage settlement,  which they received positively, on the whole. The expansion and  intensification of the conflict in May-June 1992 held up the  practical implementation of this plan of action and required  additional measures on the part of the Russian mediator. New  proposals of Russia aimed at de-escalating the conflict and  normalizing the life of the peaceful population were handed over  in June the same year.    Russia's mediation efforts were stepped up particularly as  of  the fall of 1992. In developing the Sochi agreement between the  defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which was of a  military-technical nature, the parties were offered in October a  draft political agreement on the principles and paths of a  settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh.    [Mekhtiyev] Is the Russian Federation coordinating its  peacemaking efforts with the United Nations and the CSCE's Minsk  Group? Some observers are conjecturing that there are certain  differences in approach to a settlement of this problem between  Russia and the CSCE Minsk Group.    [Kazimirov] The activity of Russian diplomacy is closely  linked with the peacemaking efforts of the international  community. We are assigning the United Nations and the Security  Council a particular role in a settlement and believe that it  could grow. It is important that the Security Council and the UN  secretary general have continued to keep events in this region  in their field of vision. A mediation mission, which  periodically visits Baku and Yerevan and also Stepanakert and  Nakhichevan and conducts numerous meetings in Moscow, has been  created especially for current business under the auspices of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Painstaking and quite  diverse work is having to be performed along a broad front:  first, directly with all the parties to the conflict, second,  within the framework of the CSCE, which has created under its  aegis the Minsk Nagornyy Karabakh Conference, and, third,  individually with the participants in the Minsk Group and with  United States, Italy, Sweden, and other states, including Turkey  and Iran.    There are no fundamental differences, I believe, between  Russia and the Minsk Group in the approaches to a resolution of  the problem. At the same time the Russian Federation is paying  far more attention than the Minsk Group to the question of the  formulation of an effective mechanism of the termination of  military operations and is the most active in the framing,  study, and detailed elaboration of this question. We are for the  removal of all obstacles to the opening of the Minsk Nagornyy  Karabakh Conference. We are concentrating particular attention  on measures that could exclude the possibility of a resumption  of military operations in the future. The Russian Federation is  proposing the most practicable mechanism of assurance of a  stable armistice in the region--the use of a disengagement force  as a guarantor of observance of the armistice.    [Mekhtiyev] Yes, indeed, Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign  affairs of the Russian Federation, has put forward an  initiative--giving Russian troops in the region of the  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and other "flash points" of the  former USSR the status of peacekeeping force under the aegis of  the United Nations or the CSCE. But the whole problem, as far as  I understand it, is that Russia has as yet been denied a mandate  for such operations....    [Kazimirov] It is a question wholly of the kind of  peacekeeping resources that would be sufficient for dependably  guaranteeing the armistice. If owing to the seriousness of the  situation there could prove to be insufficient observers, the  question of the use of a more effective means--a disengagement  force--would arise. This could be a peacekeeping force of a  third country, better, of several states, which would be capable  of a multifaceted operation. Specifically, formations of  European neutral countries with great experience of  participation in peacekeeping operations along UN lines,  Finland, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, for example, could be  used as the disengagement force. But the main, obligatory  condition for the commitment to the region of a disengagement  peacekeeping force is the consent of all the parties involved in  this conflict. And after a dependable cease-fire has been  established, of course.    [Mekhtiyev] The wording "neutral countries" unequivocally  rules out, evidently, the possibility of participation in such  an operation of such countries as Iran and Turkey, which have  their own interests in the region?    [Kazimirov] I repeat that the main condition will be the  consent of all the parties to the conflict. If at least one of  these parties objects to the participation of any third country  in the operation or is altogether completely opposed to the  commitment of a peacekeeping force to the region, this cannot,  naturally, be imposed by force.    [Mekhtiyev] But recent experience shows that the mere fact  of  the commitment of a peacekeeping force to some region of  conflict without the elimination of the causes of the conflict  itself does not always produce positive results. The commitment  of peacekeeping forces in the Dniester region and South Ossetia,  say, performed a stabilizing role, but there is another example  also--the failure of the peacekeeping operation under the aegis  of the United Nations in Somalia....    [Kazimirov] Each conflict has its own specific features, and  the means that are applicable for the resolution of one conflict  are ineffective in another. An analogy should hardly be drawn  between Somalia and the Karabakh conflict. The KSDL [Senior CSCE  Officials Committee] will shortly be studying the question of  the use of a peacekeeping force of the CSCE members. This is a  complex issue: the problems of the mandate and the funding of a  peacekeeping force within the framework of the CSCE and  international supervision of its activity need to be resolved in  balanced fashion.    [Mekhtiyev] What is the response of the parties to the  conflict to the Russian plan for a peace settlement?    [Kazimirov] We have the impression that each party to the  conflict is becoming increasingly aware of the need for the use  of the most effective means which guarantee a nonresumption of  hostilities. The parties to the conflict are now acknowledging  in words that it does not have a military, power solution and  are calling this war senseless. We believe that such  affirmations are insufficient and are insisting that they  advocate precisely a settlement exclusively by peaceful,  negotiated means and bolster this by practical action. It is  time for the state and political leaders to adopt on this score  firm commitments to their peoples and the world community.    [Mekhtiyev] What topics were discussed in the course of your  recent trip to Tehran?    [Kazimirov] The consultations in Tehran were held on the  initiative of the Iranian side. We responded to this proposal  for the simple reason that military operations are being  conducted in direct proximity to the borders of this state. We  share the concern being expressed in this connection in Iran and  other countries of the region. We agreed in the course of  negotiations with the Iranian leadership, therefore, that the  internationalization of the Karabakh conflict, so-called  creeping internationalization, that is, the enlistment of a  variety of mercenaries, fighters for the faith, and so forth  included, was impermissible. This is fraught with the danger of  a gradual expansion of the scale of the combat operations. Our  states should aspire to constructive cooperation.    [Mekhtiyev] As we all know, in the past year Russia has  harmonized its mediation efforts with Turkey, but one has the  impression today that there is a trend toward a lessening of  contacts on this subject between Moscow and Ankara....    [Kazimirov] On the question of a peaceful settlement of the  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict we are prepared to continue  cooperation with the Turkish side, and if the need arises,  consultations will be conducted with the leadership of Turkey  also.    [Mekhtiyev] Vladimir Nikolayevich, many attempts were made  in  the course of the past year to achieve a peaceful settlement of  the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, but none of these attempts was  crowned with success. How realistic, in your opinion, is the  achievement of progress in the course of Russia's present  mediation mission?    [Kazimirov] Attempts to resolve the Karabakh conflict at a  stroke, at a rush, are doomed to fail--we have seen this  repeatedly. This is why the mediation mission of the Russian  Federation has put the emphasis on systematic work with the  parties to the conflict requiring efforts and patience. A number  of meetings of the president of Russia and of other Russian  leaders with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the  leaders of Nagornyy Karabakh have been held. There have been  visits by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to the conflict zone.  There is every reason to believe that these peacemaking efforts  will permit an easing of tension in the region. Russia's role in  the process of a Karabakh settlement enjoys the positive  appraisal of the parties to the conflict and recognition on the  part of many states, including for objectivity and impartiality.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Italy The Italian government has been so preoccupied with agreeing a budget that it has allowed its privatisation programme to flag. The coalition partners have squabbled over how and, indeed, whether groups such as Stet (telecoms), Enel (electricity) and Eni (oil and chemicals) should be sold off. The companies have jockeyed for position over which should go first. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, last week tried to inject some momentum into the process by announcing a new timetable: Stet and Enel would be sold by June 1995. He made no mention of Eni, though the government later said it had not been forgotten. Italy clearly needs to get a move on. Not only do the overall budget projections depend on privatisation proceeds of L10,000bn in each of the next three years; IRI, the debt-laden state holding company which owns Stet, badly needs cash. But setting a timetable on its own is not enough. Previous deadlines have slipped. Before Stet and Enel can be sold, the coalition needs to agree on the companies' structures. In Stet's case, the central question is whether it should merge with its main subsidiary Telecom Italia. In Enel's case, the questions are whether competitors should be allowed into electricity generation and whether the distribution network should be split on regional lines. The new timetable provides a short breathing space in which such issues can be resolved. But it could too easily be wasted unless Mr Berlusconi moves smartly to knock heads together.</p>

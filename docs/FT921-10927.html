			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Anglo United prepares for coal bid with sales MR DAVID MCERLAIN, chair-man of Anglo United, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, has detailed his strategy for selling businesses worth about Pounds 100m which would enable him to proceed with his ambitious plan to buy British Coal's assets. The Department of Energy is studying Anglo's plan to acquire British Coal through a reverse takeover of the corporation. A new company would be established to acquire both Anglo and British Coal by issuing new shares. But Anglo does not want to acquire the corporation through borrowings and would thus like to reduce its current debt. The latest disposals will also reduce Anglo's interest payments which in the last six months totalled Pounds 16.6m. Cash generated from the planned disposals will be used to repay the largest part of the loan repayment schedule established after Anglo bought Coalite for Pounds 487m in 1989. While the present schedule is being paid from the first wave of disposals and cash generation, Mr McErlain has decided to embark on a second round of disposals to enable the group to pay back Pounds 108m - the biggest single amount owed and due in 1996, within the next 18 months. Mr McErlain is confident that he can raise about Pounds 100m, possibly within the year, by selling the following businesses: Liquid fuels, with sales of Pounds 200m and operating profits of Pounds 11.2m for the year to end-March 1991 and valued in the balance sheet for Pounds 23m, may raise some Pounds 50m by way of a flotation. If a public offer takes place Mr McErlain would maintain a 20 per cent stake so he could classify it as an associate. Chemicals, with turnover of Pounds 28m, operating profits of Pounds 5.6m and valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 7m, is lined up for a possible management buy-out for about Pounds 40m. If Anglo did proceed down this route Mr McErlain said he would want to keep 15 per cent in order to benefit from the increased productivity that MBOs normally generate. Instruments, Seaham Harbour and Pozament, with combined sales of Pounds 19.7m and operating profits of Pounds 3.8m, may be sold as a package to one entrepreneur for Pounds 3m. The Falkland Islands Company and its associated businesses on the south Atlantic Islands, with net assets of Pounds 7m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m, is on sale for about Pounds 10m. Mr McErlain has already received offers of interest.</p>

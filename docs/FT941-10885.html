			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Mexican official to meet Chiapas rebels Mr Manuel Camacho, the government-backed peace commissioner in the Mexican state of Chiapas, is set to meet rebel guerrilla leaders in the middle of this week, according to officials involved in the peace process. The planned meeting would be the first between armed guerrillas, who seized several towns on New Year's Day, and Mr Camacho. The two sides are likely to meet privately, although they may put out a joint communique after the first encounter, according to the officials. The guerrillas appear to have reached a compromise with Mr Camacho, whereby the peace commissioner will listen to their demands for national political changes, but will not make any concessions on such issues. Instead, direct negotiations are likely to focus on the political and social conditions in the state of Chiapas. Mexico's governing party recently reached broad agreement on democratic reform with the opposition, which Mr Camacho hopes will satisfy rebel demands for political change in Mexico. The guerrillas, known as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, have nevertheless continued attacks on what they view as Mexico's authoritarian political system. In his first interview since the uprising, Commander Marcos, the spokesman for the Zapatista, declared the rebel revolt a 'spectacular victory'. The government is now paying attention to the country's indigenous peoples, no-one is now talking about the success of the Mexican economy, and the issue of poverty has emerged, he said. Mr Marcos, who is of mixed descent, formally reports to a committee of six indigenous leaders. But it is evident he is the principal political and military strategist of the group. In the interview, extracts of which were published in La Jornada newspaper, he comes across as highly educated, self-confident, humorous, and undogmatic. Mr Marcos made it clear the aim of the Zapatista had been to mobilise society against government policy, rather than win a military victory. 'We see the armed struggle not in the classic sense of guerrillas before, that is to say, the armed struggle is the only way. . . Instead, we have always seen the armed struggle from the beginning as part of a series of steps and forms of fighting.' The rebel commander leaves no doubt that his fight is a national one, even if he accepts that the government will not directly negotiate such issues with an armed force. 'The peasants are very clear; it is a lie to think that our problems can be solved at a state level' he says 'This can only be solved if there are changes higher up.'</p>

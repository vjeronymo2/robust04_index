The Commission is removing the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines and the Far Eastern Shipping Company of Russia, from the list of controlled carriers. Information received indicates that they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier pursuant to section 3(8) of the Shipping Act of 1984. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Robert D. Bourgoin, General Counsel, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5740. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 3(8) and 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(8) and 1708, provide for the identification and regulation of certain state-controlled carriers operating in the waterborne foreign commerce of the United States. The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') has determined that Vietnam Sea Transport and Chartering Company (``Vietnam Sea Transport''), headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and POL-America, Inc. (``POL-America'') headquartered in Gdynia, Poland, meet the definition of a controlled carrier under section 3(8) of the 1984 Act, and are, therefore, being added to the list of controlled carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon inquiry by the Commission, Vietnam Sea Transport responded that its operating assets are directly owned by the Government of Vietnam (``GOV'') and that the GOV has the right to approve or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, including the chief operating or executive officer of the carrier. Vietnam Sea Transport advised that it intends to operate at least two Vietnamese-flag vessels in its service in the U.S. cross-trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POL-America responded that Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia, Poland, a government-controlled carrier, holds the majority interest (70 percent) of POL-America. Under the 1984 Act, government ownership is deemed to exist where the majority interest of a carrier is held by a government entity or instrumentality. In this case, Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia, according to Commission records, is owned by the Polish Government. All vessels operated by POL-America are under the Polish flag. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has determined to delete the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines (``NSCP'') and the Far Eastern Shipping Company (``FESCO''), currently named ``FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C.,'' from the list of controlled carriers, because they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier set forth in section 3(8) of the 1984 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information submitted to the Commission by NSCP indicates that the Government of the Philippines (``GOP'') sold all of its rights, title and interest in NSCP's three vessels of Philippine registry, as well as all of the issued and outstanding shares in NSCP, to Madrigal-Wan Hai Lines Corporation (``Madrigal''), a private corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines. Sixty percent of Madrigal is said to be owned by A. P. Madrigal Steamship Company, Inc., a private Philippine Corporation owned by Philippine nationals, and forty percent is owned by Wan Hai Lines Limited, a private Taiwan corporation owned by non-Philippine nationals. The Commission is also advised that the GOP has no right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, or the chief operating or executive officer of NSCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has determined that because NSCP is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the GOP, it no longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list of controlled carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C., the legal successor to the Far Eastern Shipping Company, provided information advising that it was created pursuant to the Russian Federation President's Decree No. 721, which enacted measures allowing state enterprises to incorporate as private limited companies_stock societies. FESCO was organized and registered in the Russian Federation on December 3, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FESCO reported that as of July 15, 1994, fifty-five percent of the company's shares belong to individual shareholders comprised mainly of current and former employees of FESCO. FESCO further advises that: twenty-five percent of the shares belong to 70 legal entities; the remaining twenty percent of the shares belong to Primorsk Region Committee for the State Property Management, a government entity, which is required to sell these shares either to legal entities or individuals before December 3, 1995; FESCO's operating assets are neither directly nor indirectly owned or controlled by the Russian Federation or any governmental entity; and that the Russian Federation does not have the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of the directors or the chief operating or executive officer of the company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has determined that because the Russian Federation neither owns a majority interest in FESCO, nor has the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of its directors, or its chief operating or executive officer, FESCO no longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list of controlled carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended list of controlled carriers is shown below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Baltic Shipping Company_Russia <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Bangladesh Shipping Corp._Bangladesh <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Black Sea Shipping Company_Ukraine <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Black Star Line_Ghana <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

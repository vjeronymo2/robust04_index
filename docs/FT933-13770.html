			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Stocks 'thwart British Coal' BRITISH COAL has been unable to win new contracts because of the 'high levels' of stocks held at power stations and improved performance of nuclear energy, Mr Andrew Horsler, the corporation's marketing chief, said yesterday. The high level of coal stocks were a key factor in the generators' decision to buy just 40m tonnes from British Coal this year, falling to 30m tonnes in each of the next four years. The High Court hearing on whether British Coal can use its half share of a Pounds 1bn surplus in a pension fund to provide enhanced pensions for employees being made redundant ended yesterday. Judgment is expected within two weeks.</p>

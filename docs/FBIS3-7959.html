			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- Federal Foreign Affairs  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic today said that yesterday's  Croat-Muslim agreement could be positive if it were to lead to  an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Talking to reporters in the federal assembly, Jovanovic  stressed that he was not familiar with the crux of the agreement  but he nevertheless cautioned that nothing good would come out  of the agreement if it constituted a block of two sides in  opposition to the third side, the Serbs, along the lines of  "take it or leave it."    "In that case the agreement would be no contribution to  peace  -- on the contrary," Jovanovic said. In his words, the signing  of the agreement may mean that the Croats and Muslims abandoned  "what was agreed at an earlier stage in Geneva."    "Depending on the essence of this agreement, the Serbian  side  will formulate its attitude to it," Jovanovic said.</p>

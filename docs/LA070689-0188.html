			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DUERSON REPORTEDLY ASKS TRADE  </P> <P> All Pro strong safety Dave Duerson has requested to be traded from the Chicago  Bears and probably will be dealt, a report published today says.  </P> <P> Ted Phillips, the National Football League team's director of finance, said the  Bears and Duerson are at "an impasse" in negotiations after months of talks.  The sides are believed to be about $100,000 apart in annual salary figures, the  Chicago Sun-Times reported.  </P> <P> "We made a substantial offer that has been rejected," Phillips said. "Now we're  approaching the season as if he won't be here. Things can change, but we have  to make some assumptions as we go toward training camp."  </P> <P> Phillips said the Bears don't want to lose Duerson but will try to accommodate  his request to be traded.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 25-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE OF RUDY PEREZ CAREER AT LACE  </P> <P> At Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) for two weekends, the invaluable  25-year survey of Rudy Perez's choreographic career also offers a cavalcade of  American self-delusion: the subject of so many of his finest pieces.  </P> <P> Danced by Anne Goodman, Jeffrey Grimaldo, Anet Margot Ris and Robert Keane  (Perez's current company), the six-part program traces the evolution of  postmodern camouflage, from the unyielding, proletarian, warrior-woman facade  shown in the 1964 "Bang-Bang" solo to the mindlessly ingratiating, unisex  veneer of the group in Perez's new untitled work-in-progress.  </P> <P> Beyond their bold spatial statements and inventive sequencing ploys, most of  these works are character portraits. Nearly all of them heighten and abstract  the defensive subterfuges of our society and then provide startling revelations  of vulnerability.  </P> <P> All of a sudden, isolated and self-absorbed individuals may huddle together  protectively as in "Parallax" (1975). Or a face-in-the-crowd may stop  methodically measuring himself by his job and touch himself tenderly, as in  "System" (1975). Perez has a sharp eye for the way we define ourselves by  stance and style -- but these works are filled with compassion for the fear and  pain under all that role-playing.  </P> <P> In the solos "Coverage" (1970) and "In Plain Sight" (1981), he explores  shopworn symbols of masculinity and femininity in our culture: the jock  construction worker and the vixen in lingerie.  </P> <P> The movement cliches adopted by these archetypes may be different -- forceful  athleticism for the man, seductive undulation for the woman -- but Perez finds  the same desperation underneath, the same agonizing loss of control.  </P> <P> Even the smirking imbeciles of the newest piece periodically slap their necks  and wince, as if stung by insects, and doesn't the pole-wielding Amazon of  "Bang-Bang" momentarily slump (soften), too?  </P> <P> If the Perez retrospective confirms that the focus of our counterculture has  shifted over the past quarter century from social activism to  fashion-mongering, it suggests that we are still unable to efficiently insulate  ourselves from our humanity. And that may be our only hope.  </P> <P> To perform these pieces requires great clarity of gesture and pose, plus  mastery of their demanding, interlocking movement disciplines. But none of this  is worth very much if the soul doesn't speak -- and the level of eloquence  proved definitely muted at LACE last Thursday.  </P> <P> The spectacular exception -- Keane's meticulous portrayal of eroding machismo  in "Coverage" -- supplied exactly the kind of moment-by-moment permutation that  makes time stop in a Rudy Perez work and a chain of hidden insights become  brilliantly coherent. If Keane's colleagues often looked tentative or  generalized in comparison, this was still a major event in local dance-theater.  </P> <P> The final three performances of the Perez retrospective take place Thursday  through Saturday , with changes in casting for the solos on alternate nights.

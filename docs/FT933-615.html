			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts behind recovery at HTV HTV GROUP, the ITV company for Wales and the West Country, returned to the black in the first half with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m. This compared with a previous loss of Pounds 5m. Earnings per share were 1.5p (5.4p losses). Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said the figures were the result of 'strict, continuing cost control procedures'. The group was not declaring an interim dividend as the board 'considered it wise to continue to conserve cash and to allow the benefit of the full year cost savings to reach the bottom line'. The group, which underwent a management shake-up in June, reduced operating costs by Pounds 15m in the half. It has cut more than 70 jobs, leaving a staff of 390. Mr Sherwood said that in spite of the cuts, HTV's local programme production was 37 per cent ahead on the 1992 half. Profits from television operations rose from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11.2m before a payment to the Treasury of Pounds 10.2m, equivalent to half its Pounds 20.5m bid to retain its franchise. Previously the group paid a Channel 4 subscription of Pounds 9.6m. Total turnover fell from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 61m. Advertising revenue fell from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 40.7m, reflecting the fact the group no longer sells airtime for Channel 4, but is in direct competition with it. HTV said the loss of revenue had been more than balanced by the removal of the Channel 4 subscription at the start of the year. It put the net benefit of the changes at Channel 4 at Pounds 5m for the half-year. The group's share of ITV's net advertising revenue grew from 5.8 per cent previously to 6 per cent in the half. Mr Sherwood said the creation of a joint sales force with Meridian Broadcasting would generate economies of scale and strengthen sales potential in the southern television regions. It also handles airtime sales for Westcountry Television, S4C and Channel Television.</p>

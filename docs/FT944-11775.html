Essential fatty acids have been added to make it more like mothers' milk. The idea could spread to western countries. Several companies, including Sandoz Nutrition of Switzerland, Nutricia of the Netherlands, which owns the Cow and Gate brand, and American Home Products, have signed up with the biotechnology companies that make the fatty acids. There has long been evidence that mothers' milk is better for babies than artificial alternatives. The difference is most marked in premature babies, whose brains develop better on mothers' milk, according to researchers and the UK Medical research Council's Nutrition Unit in Cambridge. There may be several explanations, but one of the more likely is that essential fatty acids present in mothers' milk are absent from formulas. Scientists say that fatty acids are probably important in brain and eye development. These fatty acids are difficult to make in industrial quantities. One source is UK biotechnology company Scotia, which is supplying Snow Brand. Another is Martek of the US, which has signed letters of intent to supply Sandoz and Nutricia. As foods rather than drugs, the new products do not have to undergo clinical trials. The fatty acids appear to be harmless, but without trials it is hard to demonstrate that the doses are right. Further, these formulas do not have the antibodies found in mothers' milk that protect against infection. Martek and Scotia do not make serious medical claims for the new infant formulas. 'We're saying that they are more like mothers' milk,' says Martek. 'But no one will make therapeutic claims right now.'</p>

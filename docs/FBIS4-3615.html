			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime  Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said that his recent visit to China  was a great success.    In a special interview with XINHUA before he left Macao,  Cavaco Silva said while in Beijing he exchanged views with  leading Chinese leaders on the current Sino-Portuguese political  and economic relations, as well as matters relating to Macao,  adding both sides were happy with good bilateral political  relations and agreed to strengthen contact in economic and trade  fields.    The Portuguese prime minister also said on Macao issue, both  sides held that it was necessary to maintain Macao's stability  and economic development through dialogue between the  governments of China and Portugal.    During his visit in Beijing, Silva said, a loan agreement  involving 200 million U.S. dollars was signed to support  Portuguese exports and investment in China, and his entourage of  over 60 Portuguese businessmen had wide contacts with Chinese  enterpreneurs, noting that these have laid a foundation for the  development of economic and trade relations between the two  countries.    Silva also praised the rapid economic development on China's  mainland, saying it should be attributed to the reform and  opening policies launched by the Chinese leaders and the  enterprising spirit of the Chinese people.    On Macao issue, Silva again stressed the importance of  dialogue and cooperation between the two countries, adding it  would guarantee the settlement of matters relating to the  transition in Macao.    He eventually said, the Portuguese Government, as will the  Chinese side, would make all-out efforts to maintain the  stability and progress in Macao.</p>

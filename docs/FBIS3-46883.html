			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and opposition  parties have begun to take action to dampen the already  overheating atmosphere for elections of heads of local  autonomous governing bodies more than a year from now. No  sooner had 1994 dawned on this land of politics-preoccupied  people than they began to talk about the local elections, aided  by the speculation, gossip and even idle chat being circulated  widely as "political news" in newspapers and on television.    There have been suggestions that the government and ruling  party will scrap the current system of special cities, like  Seoul and Pusan, merging them with rural areas and redrawing  election districts in a Korean version of gerrymandering.  Immediately, vehement charges were leveled against what  apparently was a balloon floated by someone to test the  reaction, mainly from opposition parties, to the idea of  redistricting.    There have also been reports that the government and ruling  party are planning to reshuffle provincial governors and large  city mayors soon in an attempt to put them in advantageous  positions in preparation for the local elections.    Surprised at how quickly their political game overheated,  the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and main opposition  Democratic Party (DP) hastily called party postholder meetings  Tuesday and declared that "It is undesirable to go into the  election campaigns already."    There are too many items on the political agenda that  require  immediate attention, they said. But there is a gulf between the  DLP and the DP in their views on what they have to do right now  and what they would do for the local elections.    The ruling party says what it has to do now is to carry out  the national policy of President Kim Yong-sam smoothly and help  him to strengthen the nation's economic competitive power in the  era of globalization.    At the same time, the ruling party is tacitly showing that  its electoral strength is not so "weak" that it needs to redraw  the boundaries of administrative districts.    DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said that if his party  and  the government succeed in reforming and boosting the competitive  power of the country, they can even win the mayoral election in  Seoul, traditionally a bulwark of the opposition.    Meanwhile, the DP has picked three major issues --  inflation,  the North Korean nuclear question, and the effects of the  Uruguay Round of trade negotiations -- as needing quick  solutions.    In order to discuss these issues, the DP is demanding that  the National Assembly hold an extraordinary session in January.    The reason for the DP to show a sharp reaction to any  suggestion of administrative redistricting is because it is wary  of the purpose behind the move by the ruling party and the  government, rather than the redistricting itself.    Rep. Cho Se-hyong, a member of the Supreme Council of the  Democratic Party, alleged that Kim Yong-sam helped "overheat"  the election atmosphere from January 1992 in order to win the  preidential election that December.    "Local elections have to be held normally," he said, without  elaborating on what he meant by "normally."    In any event, the DP believes that there is a strong  possibility that the ruling party and government will redraw the  administrative districts in order to put themselves in a better  position for the local elections.    The DP bases its belief on the fact that Choe Yang-pu, who  was recently appointed senior presidential secretary for  agricultural affairs, published a book in 1988 that advocates  rational administrative redistricting, merging large cities with  rural areas.    The gist of his idea was to form one special city and 16  provinces.    The opposition, while protesting the move for administrative  redistricting, is already working on countermeasures, party  sources said.</p>

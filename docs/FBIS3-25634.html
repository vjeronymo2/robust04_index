In a lengthy interview he granted to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, the  FAA chief of general staff reaffirmed the need for the Angolan  people to be ready for war. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that even  if consensus is achieved in Lusaka, an extremely violent war is  likely to erupt between the time an accord is signed and its  implementation. According to him, all that may happen in the  country during that period will be viewed as incidents, even  though war would describe the situation more accurately.    The FAA chief of general staff warned that no peace accord  will last for long as there is a military balance between the  government and UNITA. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that, for peace  to last, there has to be an imbalance in favor of the  government. He recognized, however, that there is no military  solution to the Angolan war, adding that he believes war in  Angola also depends on developments in South Africa.    The FAA chief of general staff also expressed the belief  that, contrary to what Jonas Savimbi claims, UNITA does not have  the capacity to withstand another 10 years of war. Gen. Joao de  Matos believes that what Jonas Savimbi says is one thing, and  what really happens is quite another.</p>

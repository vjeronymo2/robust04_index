			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Mates denies he talked to Sinn Fein MR MICHAEL MATES, former Northern Ireland minister, last night rejected claims that he had talked to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, on the government's behalf. 'It is absolutely untrue. I have never heard such complete rubbish,' said Mr Mates. Mr Mates was identified by a leading unionist politician as the previously unnamed envoy alleged to have talked to Sinn Fein earlier this year. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has bluntly denied that any contacts have taken place with Sinn Fein, other than talks on local issues with the party's elected representatives. Both unionist and republican political leaders continue to claim privately, however, that contacts took place until just before the Ulster Unionist party agreed to support the government on the crucial Commons Maastricht vote. Republican sources say Sinn Fein was represented by Mr Martin McGuinness, its vice-president, who is said to have close links with the IRA. Mr Mates, who resigned as Northern Ireland security minister earlier this year because of his involvement with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, said the allegations were 'black propaganda' put out by Sinn Fein. However, Mr Mates said: 'I suppose it is possible that some loony freelance Tory backbencher could have gone and had a meeting without telling anybody because you can never tell what loony Tory backbenchers are going to do. 'But I think I would have known about it if it had happened during my time (at the Northern Ireland Office) because we have ways of knowing these things.' The impression that progress towards peace in Northern Ireland is accelerating was reinforced yesterday by the UUP, which said it would continue to support the government even if it had been having secret talks with Sinn Fein. Mr Jim Wilson, UUP general secretary, said that in such circumstances, relations with Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be 'severely strained', but the party would not withdraw its support. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said on a visit to the US that there were 'grounds for hope and encouragement' in the offer made on Monday by Mr Major to talk to Sinn Fein if the IRA lays down its arms. He also called for 'an urgent response' to peace plans from Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.</p>

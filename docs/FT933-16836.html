			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian selling season ended last week with the market indicator at 444c/kg, seven cents higher than at the end of the previous week, but tending to soften a fraction at the close. The final weeks of the season saw small and erractic fluctuations but no resumption of the strong rise which led to improvement in buying activity throughout the industry at the end of April. Holidays and the lack of auction test of wool prices are likely to mean a dull and static market in the forthcoming weeks.</p>

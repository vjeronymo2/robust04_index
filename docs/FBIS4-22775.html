An oversight council, no less than 60 percent of the  members of which shall be non-affiliated persons, is created for  the purpose of monitoring the activity of the investment manager  and protecting the interests of the participants. Individuals  who are not participants in the investment fund may also be  elected members of the oversight council. The decisions of the  oversight council are made by a two-thirds vote of the overall  quantity of members.    The members of the oversight committee have the right to be  present at general meetings of the founders, and to receive  information on the activity of the investment fund and on the  term of fulfillment of the deposit agreement by the depositary.  The making of changes and amendments to the investment  declaration and the contract with the investment manager shall  be coordinated with the oversight council.    A general meeting of the founders is obligated to recall or  re-elect members of the oversight council in a case where  participants who are the owners of not less than one percent of  the investment certificates have made a written demand for it.    A member of the oversight council of an investment fund may  not be a member of the oversight council of another investment  fund at the same time.    13. The investment manager administers the assets of the  investment fund in the name of the investment fund without power  of attorney, and prepares drafts of informational announcements  on the issue of investment certificates. The investment manager  may not be the depositary of the investment fund.    The investment manager organizes the sale of the investment  certificates of the investment fund. He may enlist agents in the  distribution of securities of the investment fund for that  purpose.    The investment manager, in conjunction with the depositary,  estimates the value of the net assets per investment certificate  issued, and publishes the corresponding information once every  six months.

The agreement with the investment manager may be a  constituent element of the founding agreement, if the investment  manager is a founder of the investment fund.    The investment manager should act exclusively in the  interests of the founders and participants of the investment  fund in the performance of his duties.    In a case when an agreement is made to administer the assets  of more than one investment fund by an investment manager, he is  obligated to inform the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine of  that fact within ten days from the time the agreement is  concluded.    15. The depositary of an investment fund may perform  operations with securities by means of bookkeeping entries using  computers. A written document created on the basis of an entry  in a computer shall include the name of the depositary, the  signature of the authorized individuals of the depositary, and  the particulars to which the investment certificate should  conform.    The depositary may not be a founder or investment manager,  as  well as a creditor, of the investment fund. The depositary has  the right to convene extraordinary meetings of the council of  founders of an investment fund in a case where the value of the  net assets of the fund that he accumulates decreases to 90  percent of their nominal value. The depositary is obligated to  submit a report to the oversight council pertaining to  operations with the assets of the investment fund under the  procedure stipulated by the deposit agreement. The assets of the  investment fund that are kept by the depositary may not be used  by the depositary as its own credit resources.

The deposit agreement may be broken off by one  of the parties with advance notice to the other of such  intention of no less than six months, if not otherwise  stipulated by the deposit agreement. The investment manager  should conclude an agreement with another depositary before the  effective term of the agreement with a depositary comes to an  end.    17. The investment fund does not have the right:    --to issue debt instruments and notes;    --to acquire more than five percent of the securities of one  issuer or to invest more than 10 percent of its own securities  in a single issuer, aside from investment in the instruments of  domestic state loans, obligations of the state treasury and  other securities, the receipt of income from which is guaranteed  by the Government of Ukraine;    --to hold less than 70 percent of the assets of the  investment fund in securities;    --to buy investment certificates of another investment fund  with privatization vouchers;    --to engage in representative activity with privatization  vouchers;    --to assume bank credit, aside from cases of the use of an  open fund using that credit to redeem its own investment  certificates;    --to make investments in securities whose issuer is an  affiliated individual of the investment fund;    --to issue property guarantees secured by the property of  the  fund for third parties, or to conclude mortgage agreements;    --to acquire securities of unlimited and limited  partnerships.  <H5>  Section II. The Investment Company </H5>   18. A trader in securities which, aside from the conduct of  other types of activity, may attract funds for the making of  joint investments by means of the issue of securities and their  placement, is deemed an investment company. An investment  company is created in the form of a joint-stock company or a  company with limited liability under the procedure stipulated  for those companies, and performs its activity with regard to  joint investment in accordance with this Statute. The authorized  capital of an investment company that makes joint investments is  formed under the procedure stipulated by the Law of Ukraine  "Public Companies," and shall be not less than 50,000 times the  minimum wage defined at the moment of the registration of the  investment company.    19. The investment company, in conducting its activity with  regard to joint investments, is obligated to found a mutual  fund, register the issue of investment certificates, and publish  the investment declaration and information on the issue of  investment certificates by it. The investment certificates that  are issued by an investment company shall conform to the  requirements stipulated in Paragraph 9 of this Statute. The  restrictions indicated in Paragraph 17 with regard to investment  funds extend to joint investments that are made by means of the  issue of investment certificates of an investment company. An  investment company obtains investment certificates in an amount  that corresponds to the value of the property transferred by it  to the mutual fund. The investment certificates of the founders  are kept in a depositary, and may not be offered for sale. The  restrictions indicated by Paragraph 4 of this Statute extend to  the founders of an investment company that makes joint  investments.    20. The mutual fund is an affiliate of the investment  company  that is created by decision of its supreme body. This body also  approves the statute and the investment declaration of the  mutual fund. The decision to create a mutual fund is considered  to be made if no less than 3/4 of the shareholders  (participants) present and taking part in the voting at a  general meeting of the investment company have voted for it. The  mutual fund has a separate balance sheet and business account,  and is subject to state registration under the procedure  envisaged for the registration of affiliates of the subjects of  business activity. The investment company may transfer property  in the form of securities and real property to the balance sheet  of the mutual fund. Penalties under the obligations of an  investment company not connected with the activity of the mutual  fund may not be imposed on the property of a mutual fund. The  investment company obtains profits from activity connected with  joint investment in proportion to the value of the property  transferred by it to the mutual fund, if not otherwise specified  in the investment declaration. The investment company may found  open or closed mutual funds that conduct activity pertaining to  joint investment under the procedure stipulated by this Statute  for investment funds. The investment company is obligated to  submit information on the activity of the mutual fund to the  general meeting of shareholders (participants) no less than once  a year.  <H5>  Section III. The Activity of an Investment Fund and a Mutual </H5> Fund of an Investment Company Pertaining to Joint Investments    21. Investment funds, as well as investment companies, that  have founded mutual funds (hereinafter, funds), issue investment  certificates that are offered for placement among the  participants in order to carry out joint investment. Open funds  invest the funds that are received from the participants in  securities of other issuers. Closed funds have the right to  invest in securities and acquire real property, and the portions  and shares that belong to the state in the property of public  companies in the process of privatization. The investment  certificates of open funds may be acquired for the funds of the  participants, and those of closed funds for the funds of the  participants and privatization vouchers.    22. The issue of investment certificates is accomplished  after the registration of their issue at a financial body under  the procedure defined by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The  funds have the right to make a general issue of investment  certificates in an amount whose size should not exceed 15 times  the amount of their authorized capital. Open funds issue  investment certificates that are not subject to unrestricted  resale, and closed funds issue certificates that are subject to  unrestricted resale. The investment certificates are offered for  placement and are redeemed by the fund at a price that is equal  to the value of the net assets, at the time stipulated by the  investment declaration. The value of the assets in which the  funds of the founders and participants of the fund are placed in  current prices at the moment of valuation is deemed to be the  net assets of the investment fund.    23. The investment certificates of closed funds may be  exchanged for privatization vouchers, if those funds have  received permission to carry out commercial activity with  privatization vouchers under the procedure stipulated by the  State Property Fund of Ukraine. The closed funds serve the  owners of privatization vouchers with the restrictions that the  investment certificates are subject to redemption by the fund no  earlier than the conclusion of the term of utilization of the  privatization vouchers, and that the participants in the  investment fund are not guaranteed a fixed amount of dividends.  Privatization vouchers that are under the ownership of the fund  are subject to indexing in a case of the general indexing of  privatization vouchers. The fund has the right to make  additional issues of investment certificates at 50 times the  amount of the privatization vouchers accepted for placement,  under a procedure that is approved by the State Property Fund of  Ukraine and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine.    24. The valuation of the net assets of the fund is performed  in accordance with the Statute on the Procedure for the  Valuation of the Net Assets of Investment Funds and Mutual Funds  of Investment Companies as approved by the Ministry of Finance  of Ukraine. The value of the net assets per investment  certificate of an open fund is calculated quarterly, on a date  that is stipulated by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. A  mutual fund is obligated to redeem the investment certificates  from the fund participants at that price.    25. The income of the fund is formed from dividends and  other  receipts from securities that are under the ownership of the  fund, and income from operations with securities and other  assets. The income of the fund and its founders and participants  is taxed in the payment of dividends under the procedure  stipulated by prevailing legislation. The profits of the fund  are subject to division among the founders and participants in  the form of dividends. The profits of the founders of the fund  may be applied, in accordance with the investment declaration,  toward increasing the size of the authorized capital.    26. The fund composes and publishes information on its  activity at the times and in the amounts that are defined by  prevailing legislation. The accounting and monitoring of the  activity of the fund with regard to the placement of  privatization vouchers are performed under the procedure  stipulated by the State Property Fund of Ukraine and the  Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The open funds are obligated to  report to their participants every six months and publish in the  press a financial report, which shall contain the accounting  balance sheet with a listing of the investment fund (quantity,  types and market value of the securities that are under the  ownership of the fund), a report on income and expenses, as well  as dividends paid over the period, a report on the value of the  net assets of the fund, a report on the quantity of investment  certificates issued by the fund, the nominal value of one  investment certificate and the value of the net assets of one  investment certificate as of the date of compilation of the  report, and information on changes in the composition of  affiliated individuals and members of the oversight council, as  well as changes in the investment manager and depositary. The  financial report on the results for the year must be verified by  the auditor. Closed funds every six months publish the following  data: the value of the net assets of the fund (including the  value and quantity of non-utilized privatization vouchers that  are certified by the findings of an auditing organization), a  listing and the quantity of securities from a single issuer (in  an amount greater than one percent of the assets of the fund)  that are under the ownership of the fund, the value of other  assets that are under the ownership of the fund, a report on the  indebtedness of the fund, and data on the overall quantity of  investment certificates of the fund that are in circulation at  the end of the six months. The investment company conducts an  accounting of the presence and circulation of the property of  each mutual fund separately from its own property. The funds  that place privatization vouchers are obligated to save the  documents on all agreements made by them with privatization  vouchers for a term of five years. If the funds are liquidated  prior to that time, the documents on their activity with  privatization vouchers are transferred to the State Property  Fund.    27. State monitoring of the activity of a fund is provided  for, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "Securities and the  Funds Exchange" and this Statute, by the Ministry of Finance of  Ukraine and local financial bodies. State monitoring of the  commercial activity of funds with privatization vouchers is  provided by the State Property Fund of Ukraine. Violations of  the requirements of this Statute entail civil, administrative  and criminal liability in accordance with prevailing legislation.    28. Monitoring of the upholding of anti-monopoly legislation  in the process of carrying out joint investment by an investment  fund, investment company or mutual fund of an investment company  is provided by the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine in  accordance with prevailing legislation. The investment fund or  investment company should inform the Anti-Monopoly Committee of  Ukraine, either directly or through the investment manager, on  their conclusion of agreements between the investment fund,  investment company or mutual funds of an investment company and  third parties pertaining to the acquisition of securities, as a  result of which the fund or company obtains more than five  percent of the securities of a single issuer. That information  is submitted within five days from the moment of reaching the  agreement on the purchase of the securities.    29. The fund curtails its activity in accordance with  prevailing legislation and with a regard for the requirements  stipulated by this Statute. Closed funds that serve the owners  of privatization vouchers may be liquidated before the end of  the time period for the use of privatization vouchers only by  decision of a court of arbitration. In a case of the bankruptcy  of an investment company, penalties may be imposed on the  property of a mutual fund only after settlements with all  participants in the mutual fund except the founders. The  liquidation commission publishes in the print media, by location  of the fund, information on its liquidation and the procedure  and time periods for the making of claims by creditors. The  commission shall publish the first information a week after its  creation, and repeat it not less than twice for a period of two  months. The property of the fund is sold exclusively at auction.  The receipts from the sale are applied toward satisfying the  demands of creditors. The funds that remain after this are  distributed among the participants in proportion to the quantity  of investment certificates. In a case where the value of the  property per investment certificate is less than its nominal  value, the difference to the participants is covered at the  expense of the funds of the founders. The fund is considered to  be liquidated from the moment of its deletion from the state  register. A closed-type fund curtails its activity after the  completion of the declared time frame. A closed fund may also be  converted into an open fund by decision of its founders.</p>

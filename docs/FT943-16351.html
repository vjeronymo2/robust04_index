			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Waste regulation sustained - European Court An action brought by the European Parliament against the European Council challenging the legal basis of the council regulation on the supervision and control of shipments of waste in the European Community was rejected by the European Court of Justice last week. In 1990, the European Commission put forward an initial proposal for a council regulation dealing with the supervision and control of waste shipments within, into and out of the EC. It was based on provisions of the Rome Treaty relating to the internal market and the common commercial policy. The European Parliament was consulted. In 1992, the Council decided the correct legal basis for this legislation was in fact the treaty provisions dealing exclusively with the environment. Those gave the European Parliament fewer powers of influence in the legislative process. In spite of protests from the Parliament, the Council adopted the regulation on February 1 1993 with the changed legal basis. The Parliament brought an action against the Council for annulment of the regulation. It argued the parts of the regulation dealing with the shipments of waste between member states, exports and imports, plus transit of waste from outside through the EC for disposal or recovery outside the EC, should have been based on the single market and common commercial provisions in the Rome treaty. The Council, supported by Spain, argued the proper legal basis for the regulation was the environmental provisions of the treaty even though the regulation did have an impact to an extent on competition in the Community and trade with third countries. The Court ruled the Parliament's submissions on the provisions relating to the common commercial policy were not admissible as those provisions did not foresee any decision-making role for the Parliament. Parliament was only entitled to bring actions such as the present case in order to safeguard its own powers. This was not the case with regard to the common commercial policy. The Court then dealt with the question of the legal basis. It said the choice of legal basis for any given Community act had to be founded on objective factors which were amenable to judicial review. Those factors included in particular the aim and content of the act in question. It found from examination of the regulation's recitals that the system established for the surveillance and control of shipments of waste between member states was based on the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment, and that the system envisaged that the authorities would take all measures necessary to protect human health and the environment. It also found that the organisation for such surveillance and control of waste shipments came within the Community legislative framework on waste generally, the aim of which was to reduce the movement of waste. As to the regulation's content, the Court found that it set down certain conditions and procedures for authorising the inter-state transfer of waste. The conditions and procedures were adopted in order to guarantee environmental protection and, in particular, they allowed member states to prohibit waste transfers. The Court thus ruled the regulation came within the framework of environmental policy rather than that relating to the internal market in that it did not seek to regulate the free circulation of waste within the EC. The Council had therefore been right to base the regulation on the environmental provisions of the Rome treaty. This was so even though the operation of the regulation could have an impact on the working of the internal market. The mere fact that the establishment or operation of the internal market was somehow affected through the operation of a given act was not sufficient to justify that act having as its legal basis the internal market provisions of the Rome treaty. It was only when there was more than just an incidental impact on the internal market that the position might change. C-187/93: European Parliament v Council, ECJ FC, June 28 1994.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Bank's shares fall on provision warning: Standard Chartered's expected losses SHARES in Standard Chartered fell almost 5 per cent yesterday after the group disclosed that it was making provisions of Pounds 100m to cover expected losses stemming from its involvement in the Indian securities trading scandal. The international banking group had already disclosed that it would make a Pounds 50m specific provision to cover the losses. Mr Rodney Galpin, chairman, said yesterday that it was adding a further Pounds 50m to general provisions because of the 'continuing uncertainty'. As a result of these charges, Standard Chartered's pre-tax profits fell 23 per cent to Pounds 64m in the six months to August 5. Mr Galpin admitted that he was bitterly disappointed that profits had fallen, because of the progress the group had made in its worldwide operations outside India. He was confident that the Indian problems are 'unique and isolated'. Nonetheless, Standard's share price fell from 440p to 420p. Standard's Indian losses stem from its exposure to 'bank receipts' - an unusual form of IOU by which a bank promises to deliver government stock or equities to another bank on a due date. At the beginning of the year, when Bombay share prices began to soar, there was a surge in the creation of these receipts. Some of the transactions were allegedly fraudulent. Standard has filed 'a complaint for Pounds 162m' with the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Indian government department investigating the scandal. The complaint alleges criminal fraud and conspiracy against several individuals, including stockbrokers and two of Standard's dismissed employees. Standard's first half profits were depressed by a further Pounds 18m because of a sharp rise in Indian interest rates, which followed the trading scandal, and other related costs. The bank's managing director, Mr Malcolm Williamson, said that - without the Indian losses - the group's profits would have risen from Pounds 81m to Pounds 185m before tax. Profits received a Pounds 25m boost from an out of court settlement of Standard's case for damages against the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the US. Coopers had been sued by Standard over losses the bank incurred from the collapse of a computer disk drive manufacturer, Miniscribe. The biggest contributors to Standard's profits were its Asia Pacific operations, which made Pounds 146m, including the Pounds 25m Miniscribe credit. There was also a modest increase in the profit of the Middle East and South Asia businesses, from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19m, if the Indian losses are kept separate. African profits rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 20m, but the UK made a Pounds 3m (Pounds 55m) loss. The dividend is being maintained at 7p. Lex, Page 16 Market report, Page 34</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Algeria's PM is casualty of his 'war economy': The problems inherited by a new prime minister after the failure of the last one DURING the 13 months that he was prime minister of Algeria, Mr Belaid Abdessalam displayed a genius for putting people's backs up. His appointment, in the wake of the slaying of president Mohamed Boudiaf, owed much to his reputation for decisiveness, a reputation which he gained when he was Algeria's economic overlord from 1965 to 1978. Mr Abdessalam was sacked at the weekend and replaced by the minister of foreign affairs, Mr Redha Malek, one of the five members of the High State Council (HCE) which has ruled Algeria since the forced resignation of Mr Chadli Bendjedid in January 1992. Mr Abdessalam's dismissal is the direct consequence of his unwillingness to usher in essential economic reforms and broker an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Both are essential if the spiral of economic decline, one of the chief causes of unrest, is to be reversed. Despite many brave words, Mr Abdessalam's 'war economy' has left the country's factories and finances in a more parlous state than a year ago. His campaign to clear out corruption and stamp out the black market has come to nil. Ordinary Algerians who believed his promise that their standard of living would not suffer from economic reforms feel betrayed. The former prime minister proved only too true to his past. He re-imposed tight state control on foreign trade and refused to allow the dinar, which had lost half its value between 1989 and 1991 - the two years during which Algerian leaders were implementing bold reforms aimed at liberalising their country's economy - to continue depreciating. Massive injections of cash into state companies which remain unreformed has turned a budget surplus equivalent to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1991 into a deficit of 14.2 per cent this year, and pushed inflation beyond the 30 per cent mark. Mr Abdessalam's policies have ruled out any agreement with the IMF. The one-year standby agreement reached in June 1991 was scuppered in December that year. Officials at the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission privately bemoaned what they felt was Mr Abdessalam's lack of understanding of economics. They regretted his suspension of key articles of the Law on Credit and Money which, in April 1990, opened Algeria to foreign investment and which, by December 1991, had led 131 foreign companies to sign joint ventures with planned investments of Dollars 2bn. The appointment of Mr Malek as prime minister has been welcomed by senior European and US officials. He is known as an implacable opponent of the populist Islam propagated by the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Mr Malek knows that some kind of agreement with the IMF and Algeria's leading creditors, notably France, is indispensable. His government is expected to seek a dialogue which would enable Algeria to loosen the noose of the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt. Servicing that debt absorbs three-quarters of export earnings. The new French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, gave public support to the Algerian leaders in their fight against the FIS earlier this summer, a reversal of the policy pursued by the former Socialist administration. Western countries appear to be prepared to turn a blind eye to the abuses of human rights so long as economic reforms are pursued. The growing violence in Egypt and the fear of the consequences of FIS propaganda among poor north African immigrants in France has made French politicians more cautious about castigating its former colony for being undemocratic. Indeed, Mr Malek has had some success in convincing US, French and Italian officials that an FIS victory would not usher in a period of democracy. Unlike many of his peers, who professed to believe in democratic elections, Mr Malek never bothered to hide his contempt for what he described as the 'demagoguery' of those, on both sides of the political spectrum, who professed to build a democracy out of the ruins of a single-party state overnight. He consistently argued that until the economy was reformed and the authority of the state vested in competent and cleaner hands, free and fair elections were a chimera.</p>

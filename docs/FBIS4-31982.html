			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 15 (CTK) -- At their current session  in Prague, the Committee of High Commissioners of the Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) today urged Latvia  to re-evaluate its law on state citizenship adopted last week.  The CSCE was asked to take a stance on the issue by the Russian  Foreign Ministry.    The law, which sets hard conditions for acquiring Latvian  citizenship, is a thorn in the flesh of the strong Russian  minority living in the country. CSCE spokesman told journalists  that the Latvian delegate to the Prague session, Ivars Pundurs,  did not rule out that his government would make certain changes  in the law. CSCE commissioners accepted this stance with  satisfaction, the spokesman said.</p>

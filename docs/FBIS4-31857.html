			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Coalition Council held a meeting in  Bratislava this morning at which Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik  was present. The aim of the meeting was to find an acceptable  consensus on the issue of the so-called road-sign bill.    At the last council meeting, representatives of Hungarian  parties suggested that the list of villages with bilingual  place-names include 13 villages named after Slovak  personalities. Other members of the council disapproved of this  proposal. The deputies' clubs of the coalition parties were to  take a stance on the matter by today. Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik briefed journalists on the results of the meeting.  Ivan Samel was present on behalf of Radiozurnal.    [Samel] At the beginning of the briefing, Jozef Moravcik  announced the result of the Coalition Council deliberations.  Today, once again, its members failed to agree on a joint  stance on the road-sign bill. They will discuss a possible  course of future action on 17 June. The prime minister added:    [Begin Moravcik recording] At present, it seems that it  would  be appropriate to submit the bill in the form that has been  discussed and voted on [as heard], and, if 76 deputies sign this  bill, we will submit it to parliament. It is not clear yet  whether we will succeed. [end recording]    [Samel] When speaking about 76 deputies, Moravcik is  counting  on the votes of all Hungarian representatives. He went on to  say that the controversial 13 villages remain a stumbling block.  According to the prime minister, it is unlikely that a consensus  can be reached on this point. In the event that the  representatives of the coalition parties fail to reach a joint  stance and the bill fails to obtain the 76 votes needed for the  road-sign bill to be adopted, the solution to this issue will  remain the responsibility of the future parliament.

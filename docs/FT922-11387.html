			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Perspecitves: Japan fails to face its shame - Tokyo's dilemma over forced prostitution IN THE days of Stalinism, the Russians had a saying: 'The trouble with the past is that you never know what you'll find in it.' Now that both Stalin and his Soviet Union have gone, perhaps the phrase should be bequeathed to the Japanese. Shim Mi Ja's visit to Tokyo last month was a traumatic experience - for her, and for those who heard her testimony. Now 70 and living just outside Seoul, she was one of between 80,000 and 200,000 young Korean women forced to be prostitutes for the Japanese imperial army in the 1930s and '40s. Speaking in Japan's parliament building, she told Japanese women (many of whose fathers or grandfathers were in the army) of how she was forced to serve in a 'comfort station' - or military brothel - in Fukuoka, southern Japan. From childhood, her hobby was embroidery. One day at secondary school, she was asked to make a Japanese cherry blossom; instead, she made a Korean flower. It was seen by the Japanese military police. She was taken away, raped, tortured - she still has the scars on her back and beneath her fingernails - and sent to Japan. 'We dealt with 20 or 30 men a day,' she said. 'But, when truckloads of troops stormed in from the front, then you'd have 40 or 50 men each. I was a young girl dealing with 40 or 50 men in one day - can you imagine that? On weekends, there would be long queues in the yard outside. It was a mechanical job; you couldn't get up or wash. Just one man after another, endlessly.' Faced with the testimony of Shim Mi Ja - and that of a growing number of other former 'comfort women,' prodded by Christian and women's groups to speak out for the first time in almost 50 years - the Japanese government launched an official investigation. It claimed, however, that the comfort stations were run privately and that it had no legal or moral responsibility. That argument was disproved spectacularly in January when Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a professor of history at Chuo university, spent eight hours in the Defence Academy library in Tokyo. He found six documents which showed that the army and the government both were involved in setting up comfort stations for soldiers on the Chinese front late in the 1930s. Two of the documents record an order from the commander-in-chief of the North China expeditionary army in 1938. It told units to set up brothels as quickly as possible because rape by Japanese soldiers was making it difficult to control the local population. Other documents talk of procedures for checking the women for venereal disease, and fears that contaminated soldiers returning home would spread VD. A few days after Yoshimi's documents were published, foreign minister Michio Watanabe said he 'could not help but admit' that the imperial army was involved. Prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, about to start a state visit to Seoul when the story broke, spent much of his time there apologising. But the government has yet to provide any explanation of why its official investigation failed to uncover documents which Yoshimi found within hours. Yoshimi says: 'Some of them are hard to find, but most are catalogued and can be found easily. There is no way Japanese historians wouldn't know about them. They didn't want to investigate it.' The issue of the comfort women has brought to the forefront, painfully, the way in which the Japanese authorities have resisted coming to terms with their colonisation of Asia in the first half of this century. In Germany, the fall of Hitler was followed by attempts to teach the younger generation the lessons of history, and to compensate victims of the Nazis. In Japan, there has been silence. Allied tribunals tried many individual soldiers for atrocities after the war, but the Japanese government has not pursued cases since. Occasionally, the resentment of Japan's neighbours has surfaced in public. Ten years ago, there was a row with China and South Korea over the history textbooks used in Japanese schools. These either fail to mention the atrocities committed by the imperial army in Asia, or treat them in the most cursory way. The books all are vetted by Japan's education ministry. Angry protests by the South Korean government in 1990 elicited an apology from the new emperor, Akihito; he referred to the 'unfortunate past between our two countries and for which my country was responsible.' His father, Hirohito, had simply regretted 'the unfortunate past.' The addition of the seven extra words was thought by Japan to be an enormous concession. The reluctance of the Tokyo government to acknowledge the past has left resentment and distrust among most of the occupied countries. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's former prime minister, declared: 'If they are not willing to confront the past and educate their children on what happened, instead of sloughing it off as an 'advance into south-east Asia,' it means that a younger generation of Japanese would be less reluctant, if pushed, to take the military road.' Hajime Funada, an MP of the ruling Liberal Democratic party who heads a group studying reform of Japan's post-war (and pacifist) constitution, adds: 'We can't carry on like this. It's creating too many problems we will have to face sooner or later.' He fears that, without a rethink, 'Japan will end up as a special case, left out of world concerns.' The anxieties of other Asian countries are likely to become increasingly prominent as Tokyo struggles to find a political role to match its status as the world's second-largest economy. Adding largely to the problems is the continuing debate over whether Japan should have a military role outside its borders - something banned at present by the constitution. In the wake of the Gulf war, the government has been trying - so far, unsuccessfully  - to pass a bill allowing the military to take part in United Nations' peace-keeping operations. This is unlikely to banish the deep-seated fear of Japan's neighbours about its possible re-militarisation, or a related concern that the institutions of democracy there may not be strong enough to enable Japan to behave - as Funada would wish  - in a 'normal' way. As its power grows, coming to terms with the past is becoming more necessary in order to come to terms with the future. Gordon Brewer is the BBC Tokyo Correspondent.

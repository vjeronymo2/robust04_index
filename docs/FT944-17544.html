			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow in US deal Taylor Woodrow, the British construction group, in a joint venture with Kenco Communities, a US developer, has paid Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.6m) for 653 acres of prime development land in Florida. The British company has previously announced its intention to expand its housing interests in the rapidly-growing Florida market. The development is located in Palm Beach County in the Boca Raton area, where it has planning permission for up 1,500 homes. There are also plans for a 27-hole golf course, tennis centre and country club. Work is scheduled to begin early next year. House prices on the development are expected to range from Dollars 200,000 to more than Dollars 1m. Mr Colin Parsons, Taylor Woodrow chairman, said: 'We have previously stated that our strategic policy is to redirect assets to achieve growth in chosen areas of opportunity. The market for new homes in Florida remains strong and we see much potential for future profit.' The group more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 22m during the first six months of this year, led by a sharp rise in house sales. Taywood Homes in the UK increased its contribution by 50 per cent to Pounds 3m. Housing profits from the US, Canada and Australia rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m, after discounting a Pounds 3.2m write-down last year in southern California.</p>

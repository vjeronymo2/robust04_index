			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jan Bohets: "Growth Must Rise Consistently, But </F> It Is Not Clear How"]    [Text] Whether or not Belgium overcomes its financial,  economic, and social problems will depend to a great extent on  economic growth. Things do not look good unless the rate of  expansion can be brought above the average of the recent past.  However, there are no indications that we can raise growth  consistently.    Of course, further economic growth has results which a  mature  industrial society does not favor; nevertheless, it is  essential. Very few people would discourage progress in material  terms. Sufficient economic growth represents just the beginning  of the solution to the government's financial problems and the  unemployment problem. The rate of economic growth is also of  crucial importance in coping with the problem of the aging  [population].    It is important that the growth not be accompanied by a  significant rise in inflation or a sharp rise in interest rates.  That would create more problems than it would solve.    However, nobody can see where this faster growth will come  from. The average over the past 20 years is just 2 percent,  compared to 5 percent annually in the period from 1960 to 1973.  If we look at the figures for each decade -- a questionable  idea since it would be better to compare the entire economic  cycle -- the systematic drop is even more striking: an average  of 4.8 percent per year in the 1960's (1960-69), 3.5 percent in  the 1970's, 2 percent in the 1980's, and 1.3 percent -- so far  -- in the 1990's.    When evaluating the figures, account must of course be taken  of the level effect: High growth figures are more difficult to  achieve as the economy grows. All the more reason to wonder how  the Belgian economy will manage in the coming years to perform  better than in the past 20 years.    A difference of 1 point per year seems insignificant, but  that is not true of course. If the economy maintains a cruising  speed of 2 percent per year, then that would yield a cumulative  total of 15 percent by the year 2000, and 71 percent by the year  2020. If an average of 3 percent were achieved, the respective  percentages become 23 and 122. If growth were to reach just 1  percent per year, then the respective cumulative amounts would  be 7 and 31 percent.  <H5>  More and Better </H5>   The increase in the gross domestic product determines the  growth in tax revenue and also influences spending. It has  become apparent that growth of more than 2 percent is needed to  avid a worsening condition in government finances and the labor  market.    What can be said about the growth prospects, with the  necessary caution? One can depart from a reassuring conclusion:  Growth is almost inevitable. Scientific and technological  progress will continue, and this will spontaneously lead to a  further increase in productivity. Higher productivity means  more production with just as many people, or just as much  production with fewer people. The policy would have to be very  bad, or the circumstances would have to be strongly opposite to  neutralize this productivity effect.    Growth must primarily be brought about through a greater or  better effort by labor, capital, and management.    The percentage of people working in Belgium is lower than  elsewhere in the industrial world, and the rise in unemployment  and the trend toward early retirement further aggravate this  problem. Further reductions in working time would accentuate  this trend even more: lower employment because of slow growth,  less growth because of falling employment.    The way in which capital is used also does little to promote  growth. The high volume of savings by individuals serves, in  the first instance, to cover the government's borrowing  requirement. It is good that the government only needs to turn  to foreign financiers to a limited degree, but the situation  would be better if it were not dependent on the creation of  further debt. In all fairness, it should be added that money is  always found for worthy and vital projects.    As for management, there is no reason why we should have  fewer clever entrepreneurs than other countries. It should be  clear that over the past 30 years Belgium, more than any other  industrial country, has depended on foreign investments, while  the required capital was often found here. In recent years,  there has been great concern about Belgium's declining  attraction for foreign investors and the shrinking Belgian share  in American and Japanese foreign investments, among others.  <H5>  Spending </H5>   If we want to increase the potential growth of the Belgian  economy, then investment must be increased. One requirement has  already been met temporarily: Private savings have risen to 20  percent of disposable income, a level that has probably not been  reached since the war. However, experience shows that such a  high rate of saving can only be reached at the lowest point in a  recession, if the people are very concerned, and if businesses  do not feel much need to invest. In order to maintain a high  level of saving in the coming period, with its improved economic  climate, the government's lack of saving -- i.e., its deficit --  must be lowered.    In addition, the cost effectiveness of capital, in other  words the profitability of businesses, must be brought back to  the level of the 1960's. In order to promote employment and  make it possible to increase profits, wage costs must not rise  for some time. Any wage increases may not absorb the entire  increase in productivity.    Lastly, Belgium must continue quickly adapting to changing  international circumstances. World trade will probably be the  most powerful driving force behind growth, and the best chances  will be offered by the young industrial countries which strike  fear in our heart.</p>

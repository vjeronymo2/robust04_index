The 14th Army took steps to find out who were the  people who had voted in the parliamentary elections and the  referendum,. The employees of the Ministry of Interior of the  Republic of Moldova did not have the right to vote in the  referendum, just as the they did not have the right to vote in  the parliamentary elections either. As far as the results of the  referendum are concerned, all the international observers  announced that there was a much reduced presence at the polls in  case of the referendum polls than in the parliamentary  elections, and the government-backed television of the republic  announced a presence of over 70 percent at the polls. Just as  it has always been the case so far, the population was used to  explain the prosoviet policy promoted by President Snegur.</p>

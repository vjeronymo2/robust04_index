			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Good taste for tiny tots / A look at children's fashions and gift ideas . . . with a little help from her friends Strictly speaking, I suppose, clothes do not constitute a child-friendly Christmas present - unless it be the spot-on pair of trainers, the 'must-have' jacket or any other essential part of the tribal uniform. As a seven-year-old, my own tastes in clothing, indulged by my mother, ran to fairy tutus embellished with silver stars in which I tore around the neighbourhood on my bicycle (fortunately no photographic evidence survives). Children's tastes today seem infinitely more sober. Good taste has reaped its harvest and at every price there are creamy Aran sweaters, crisp gingham shirts and rompers, sweet Peter Pan collars and infinitely desirable little Viyella dressing-gowns. Those who deem Christmas a suitable moment to replenish a child's wardrobe will be pleased to know that all this exquisite good taste is available by mail order. Eleanor House is a small operation based in Gloucestershire which offers just a few, beautifully designed and made-up children's clothes. Mostly knitwear (see the photograph of the jumpers above which range in price from Pounds 33.90 to Pounds 37.90; the matching hats are Pounds 7.90), all of it is wearable, desirable and also just that little bit special. There are enchanting navy and cream cardigans for the small set (from six months to two years for between Pounds 31 and Pounds 35), there are thick Aran cardigans and jumpers for children aged from two to 10 (price ranges from Pounds 32.90 to Pounds 47.90), some cheeky hats (Pounds 9.90) and some round-collared soft cotton shirts from France (Pounds 14.50). The catalogue is available from Eleanor House, PO Box 49, Stroud, Glos. GL6 8YA. (Tel: 0453-884192). Wigglets, 50 Stockwell Park Crescent, London SW9 ODG (tel: 071-738-5124) sells charming nightwear - everything from brushed cotton tartan pyjamas (Pounds 23-Pounds 29) and dressing-gowns (Pounds 32-Pounds 41) classical striped and piped cotton ones (Pounds 23-Pounds 29). When it comes to toys and entertainment there are three two catalogues in particular that I think it worth mentioning. Firstly, there is Frog Hollow, 21 High Street, Pewsey, Wiltshire SN9 5AF. (Tel: 0672-64222). There is wide choice at almost every price range but it is particularly good at the cheaper end. For older children and the catalogues brought out by the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum in London have some splendid ideas. The Science Museum catalogue includes books on a scientific note (Can You Believe Your Eyes? - more than 250 visual oddities for Pounds 8.95), pocket microscopes, the famous potato clock, puzzles, or a large telescope (Pounds 109.95) for stargazers. And there is much, more. From The Natural History Museum there is a lot of what it calls 'Dino-fun' as well as kits to make your own archaeological replicas (Pounds 19.95 for Jerusalem, Pounds 24.95 for Jericho, Pounds 19.95 for Qumram), a fine solitaire set (Pounds 49.94) and a solar-powered watch (Pounds 89.95). Both catalogues are available from Innovations (mail order), Euroway Business Park, Swindon, SN5 8SN.</p>

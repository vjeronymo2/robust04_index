			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (27): Group E - Ireland In 1990, Ireland rolled up for their first World Cup with the oldest squad in the competition, failed to win a game and still found themselves in a quarter-final against Italy in Rome. The strengths and weaknesses that characterised that campaign will still be the hallmarks of the Irish team this time. They work hard, stick to manager Jack Charlton's simple plan and have much better players than many critics realise - except in attack. They will again struggle to score goals. In Italy they drew all three group games before beating Romania on penalties after a goal-less draw and then restricting the hosts to a 1-0 win. This time they are in the toughest group. The change to three points for a win in group games will penalise Ireland, who have lost the best of their lacklustre crew of goalscorers, Niall Quinn (Manchester City), to injury. Charlton's squad includes just four attackers. But it has had a much needed infusion of youth: Roy Keane (Manchester United), a midfield bull, Garry Kelly (Leeds United) a pacey defender and Jason McAteer (Bolton Wanderers), a promising Liverpudlian midfielder who has opted for Ireland. They are potentially top class and perfectly suit Charlton's system. - If some of Charlton's ageing stars, notably Paul McGrath, Andy Townsend and Ray Houghton (all Aston Villa), can shake off the lethargy that has settled over their club play, Ireland will again be difficult to beat. Recent friendlies, capped by a 2-0 win in Germany, have gone well. Tony Cascarino, an ungainly centre forward not good enough to command a starting place in Chelsea's routed FA Cup Final team, has brought aerial power to Ireland's direct attacks.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Korean candidate quits Mr Lee Jong-chan, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Kim Young-sam for the presidential nomination of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP), has dropped plans to stand as an independent in the December elections, writes John Burton in Seoul. His withdrawal should improve the chances of Mr Kim. Mr Lee threatened to erode Mr Kim's support among DLP voters. Mr Kim is now the leading candidate in opinion polls: one recent survey gave him 33.2 per cent support, against 21.3 per cent for Mr Kim Dae-jung of the main opposition Democratic party.</p>

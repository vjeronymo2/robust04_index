			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "After the </F> KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA Statement--'Pensioners Are in a  Panic...'"]    [Text] The Kazakh Ministry of Finance examined the article  "Pensioners Are in a Panic. The Government Is Silent," and it  reported the following to the editorial staff.    In accordance with the "Temporary Procedure for the Receipt  and Expenditure of Resources for State Social Insurance in the  Pension Fund of the Kazakh Republic Through the Republic's  Budget," which was approved by the Finance Ministry on 1 April  1994, resources for paying pensions and benefits to the  unemployed population are being allocated from the republic's  budget. According to item No. 3 of the presidential Edict No.  1529 on the republic budget for 1994, dated 27 January 1994, the  Finance Ministry will execute financial measures associated with  the implementation of functions, particularly the Pension Fund,  as resources are received for them, but not more than the  maximum scale of expenditures established by this edict.    From the time of the inclusion of the Pension Fund in the  republic's budget system, that is, from 1 April to 1 June of  this year, receipts amounted to 936.7 million tenge. In  addition, credits were allocated three times from the republic's  budget to the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population  for the payment of pensions in May in the sum of 778 million  tenge.    Considering the acuteness of the question, the Finance  Ministry on 8 June additionally formed yet another credit from  the republic's budget for the payment of pensions in the sum of  200 million tenge, which already exceeds the budgetary receipt  of insurance premiums by 41.3 million tenge.    "The Temporary Procedure for the Receipt and Expenditure of  Resources...in the Pension Fund..." in effect at the present  time is really cumbersome, but it is necessary to consider that  this procedure is temporary and was adopted for the period of  formation and transfer of files of premium payers from the  Pension Funds to the tax inspectorates. As a consequence, it is  proposed to simplify it to a maximum and to use the insurance  premiums collected at the oblast level, but only the premiums  remaining after the payment of pensions will be subject to  redistribution.    However, to shift at the present time to such a procedure  means to leave citizens without pensions who live in the oblast  and who for objective reasons--a reduction and halt in  production--cannot ensure the collection of insurance premiums.    To explain the "confusion" with the payment of pensions  simply with the transfer of Pension Fund resources to the  republic's budget system, which follows from the article that is  being reviewed, would be very simple, and it can be eliminated  easily. The reasons lie deeper, they are in the general economic  crisis that has stricken our economy. Therefore, the situation  would have developed the same way regardless of who at the  present time would engage in the collection of insurance  premiums--the structures of the Pension Fund or the tax  inspectorates.    To hope that the structures of the Pension Fund could make  it  incumbent upon enterprises to transfer premiums is at the very  least naive, since this is not within the power even of the tax  inspection organs.    The Wage Fund, according to data of the Goskomstat [State  Committee for Statistics], totaled 4.101 billion tenge just for  April of this year. If it is taken into account that in May the  Wage Fund would have remained on the same level, although it was  really increasing, than the calculated size of payments for  April and May should be not less than 2.200 billion tenge.  Actually, not more than 43 percent of this sum was received on 1  June.    Pensioners are not to blame for the difficulties that the  economy is experiencing at the present time. Undoubtedly they  are first to need material and social assistance. But, it should  not be thought that heartless bureaucrats are sitting in the  Finance Ministry and the government. Specific measures are being  employed in paying pensions, given the first real, most of all  financial, opportunity.    The situation is being monitored, and, as soon as  circumstances permit, the "Temporary Procedure..." that has  aroused so much censure, including in the press, will be  simplified to the maximum so that the path that insurance  premiums take from enterprises to direct pension payments is  shortened.    In any case, the special purpose of the insurance premiums  that are transferred to the Pension Fund is not violated in any  way, even when the latter is in the republic budget system, and  the burden of the of republic's budget expenditures is not  shifted to the pensioners.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   KAZAKSTANSKAYA PRAVDA was also informed that the newspaper  gave an incorrect interpretation of the explanation of the text  of the Cabinet of Ministers Decree on making changes to Decree  No. 34 of the Kazakh Cabinet of Ministers of 6 January 1994,  which was given by the manager of the department of finance,  labor, and social protection of the population. As G.V. Guseva  explained, according to the decree, the delivery of pensions and  benefits is conducted through organs of the Ministry of Social  Protection of the Population by enterprises of the Ministry of  Communications and establishments of the People's Bank, which  conforms to Article 81 of the law on pension support of citizens  in the Kazakh SSR.</p>

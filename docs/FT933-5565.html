			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Skandia in first-half turnround SKANDIA, one of Sweden's two leading insurers, swung back into the black in the first half, due largely to rising asset values and exchange rate movements. The group made an operating profit of SKr734m (Dollars 89.81m), against a SKr344m loss in the same period of 1992. If changes in the surplus value of assets are included, it turned a SKr636m loss into a SKr1.6bn profit. The insurance business also showed an improving trend, with profits rising to SKr241m from SKr195m. Gross premiums rose 23 per cent to SKr21.4bn, mainly due to the weaker Swedish krona. The group saw another strong performance from its Nordic insurance unit, Skandia Norden, where insurance profits reached SKr404m. It is also benefiting from a decision to reduce its exposure to the non-life reinsurance sector and place increased emphasis on life insurance and savings products. Net asset value stood at SKr13.2bn at June 30, and by mid-August had reached SKr14.2bn, said Skandia. This compares with SKr11.4bn at the end of 1992 when the group decided for the first time to scrap its dividend. Skandia has gained a more stable ownership base after 40 per cent of its shares held by the Norwegian insurer Uni Storebrand and Hafnia, the Danish insurance group, were placed with international investors in June for SKr3.2bn.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Metals set for a quiet week - Commodities Metals markets are likely to be quieter than usual this week because many aluminium traders have made their way to Paris for the annual Metal Bulletin aluminium conference which opens this morning. Meanwhile, many copper traders have descended on New York to attend the annual Metals Week copper conference, followed tomorrow evening by the Copper Club dinner. Aluminium traders will not give all their attention to the distinguished speakers in Paris until they have seen today's statistics from the International Primary Aluminium Institute, giving stock figures for the end of July. These are expected to provide more evidence that the unprecedented international trade agreement, encouraging aluminium producers to cut output, is having an increasing impact on the huge surplus that depressed prices for so long. Between February, when delegates from six big aluminium producing areas signed a 'memorandum of understanding' about production cuts, and the end of June, producer stocks fell by 141,000 tonnes, or 6.6 per cent. London Metal Exchange stocks have also fallen - by 104,000 tonnes in July, the biggest single monthly fall since the exchange launched its aluminium contract. If IPAI stocks also are shown to have fallen in July, it will be only the second time in four years that both IPAI and LME stocks fell in tandem. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, suggested: 'The memorandum of understanding clearly is working. But the industry still has a big task ahead.' Stocks were still equivalent to 16 weeks of consumption and they needed to be 6 1/2 weeks before producers could relax. So another 2.8m tonnes - or 40 per cent - had to be cut from combined IPAI and LME stocks of 4.8m tonnes. Also this week, Dalgety, the agricultural merchant, on Thursday gives its annual harvest review, while on Friday the Opec quota compliance committee meets to discuss August oil production figures.</p>

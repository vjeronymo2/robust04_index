The funeral rites were held in a combination of the  traditional customs of the Baoule people and the ceremony of a  modern state funeral. In the morning, the "Biogny Peace  Foundation Building" was filled with solemn silence, with  Biogny's bronze coffin well placed in the middle of the mourning  hall where his portrait was hung. At 1100, the cortege left the  "Peace Foundation Building" for the "Ave Maria Peace Cathedral"  for a memorial mass. The remains were later buried at the  Biogny Tomb within the compound of the Presidential Residence.    Leaders and special envoys from over 70 countries, and  representatives of nearly 40 international and regional  organizations, attended Biogny's funeral.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a condolence cable. Liu  Chengguo, vice agriculture minister and special envoy of the  Chinese Government, was all the way here to attend Biogny's  funeral.    Born to the family of a tribal chief in Yamassoukro on 18  October 1905, Biogny practiced medicine in his early days and  was president of the Ivory Coast since its independence on 7  August 1960. He was a pioneer of the African nationality  independence movements and an influential senior statesman.</p>

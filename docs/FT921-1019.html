			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nestle's bid for Perrier suspended for EC inquiry NESTLE'S FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.74bn) bid for Perrier was suspended for a further four months yesterday when the European Commission announced it would launch an investigation into the deal's impact on the French mineral water market. The Swiss food group only overcame the opposition of the Agnelli family to its offer two days ago. But the Commission said yesterday that, following its one-month automatic inquiry into the bid, it had decided there were serious doubts about the takeover's compatibility with the European market. Competition officials said the decision to move to a full investigation took into account Nestle's pledge to sell Volvic, one of the Perrier waters, to BSN, the food group. If the Commission decides the bid is anti-competitive it could ask Nestle to unwind the merger or amend it, for example, by selling some Perrier brands. Nestle and its allies had already anticipated the EC inquiry. Earlier this week, Mr Reto Domeniconi, Nestle's director-general, told a press conference in Paris he thought it probable that the commission would opt for an in-depth investigation given the 'complexity' of the affair. The inquiry will hinge on the comparative shares of the French mineral water market held by Nestle/Perrier after the bid. Nestle, which would be adding the eponymous Perrier and several smaller brands to Vittel, which it owns, estimates its eventual share at 41 per cent in volume. The Commission says that in the overall French market for bottled water, and separate segments - such as still or sparkling water - the merged company will have a share of more than 50 per cent. Meanwhile, BSN is expected to increase its share of the same market to 32 per cent. Apart from Volvic - promised to BSN as the price for alliance with Nestle in the Perrier battle - the group's other waters include Evian and Badoit. Lex, Page 28</p>

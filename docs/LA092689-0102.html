			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC CENTER: A DREAM COME TRUE CELEBRATED  </P> <P> On a balmy late-summer night, 25 years of Music Center history culminated with  two hours of performances from its resident companies and the presentation of  the first Dorothy B. Chandler Performing Arts Awards.  </P> <P> But for a moment on Sunday, the whole city felt like it had come to a stop --  at least it did for some of the Music Center's most loyal supporters, including  dozens of its founders, from Kirk and Anne Douglas to Edward and Hannah Carter,  Lew and Edie Wasserman to Earle and Marion Jorgensen.  </P> <P> Trekking along a red carpet stretching from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to a  party at the Walt Disney Concert Hall site on First and Hope streets, the  black-tie 25th anniversary crowd stopped in its tracks and stared silently into  the sky as fireworks shot through the city's imposing skyline.  </P> <P> "To see all these people, who have probably seen everything and been  everywhere, absolutely transfixed, probably summed it up," said Dodger  announcer Vin Scully. "It's a magnificent anniversary party." Sunday's event,  more than a year in planning, was the highlight of a weekend of 25th  anniversary celebrations.  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago, of course, there was no Music Center. For that matter,  there wasn't even a skyline. "All you saw was a block of old houses boarded up  waiting for the wrecker's crane," reminisced Bob Hope, who spoke at the Music  Center's site dedication Sept. 27, 1964 ("I opened the thing," he said), and  performed this time for a show that was taped for broadcast in January.  </P> <P> The program itself, featuring sequences from "Phantom of the Opera" (but  without the Phantom, Michael Crawford, who was ill) and "Tosca," was an  exercise in progress. Music Center patrons aren't exactly accustomed to taking  in performances with TV cues to applaud like they really mean it or to excuse  scenes out of sequence, being told the order will be corrected at a later date.  But even that didn't detract from the evening. "I thought it was so L.A.,"  enthused Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet LA/NY.  </P> <P> Zubin Mehta, former conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, drew a mass  chuckle when, after a glitch, he informed the audience: "Ladies and gentlemen,  you don't want to hear a Bach cantata again. This is just a logistical mix-up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dinner Patrons  </P> <P> Afterward, 1,000 patrons paying $1,000 apiece (do your own arithmetic)  celebrated over dinner, underwritten by Wolfgang K. Flottl, on the Disney Hall  site, today a tented parking lot; tomorrow, in the parlance of the evening,  another cultural temple. "We'll be sitting here five years from now watching  God knows what," predicted state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, there with his  wife, Andrea.  </P> <P> "I keep wondering where they'll have the 50th anniversary party," mused Hannah  Carter, "because this parking lot won't be here."  </P> <P> If there was a buzz in the air, it had to do with a sense of hometown pride.  "This is a celebration of a city culturally maturing," said Orion Pictures'  Mike Medavoy. "And it's international in scope, not just national."  </P> <P> "It just shows me that L.A. has reached the major leagues," said Fred Nicholas,  chairman of both the Museum of Contemporary Art and of Committee for the Disney  Concert Hall, which he said will open three years from now. "L.A. will then be  the No. 1 arts center of the world, I believe."  </P> <P> "The fact is," emphasized Van de Kamp, "L.A. is intent on becoming the cultural  capital of the U.S."  </P> <P> The Music Center's 88-year-old founder, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, who was unable  to attend the festivities, was represented by her daughter Camilla Frost and  her husband, F. Daniel Frost. He served as co-chairman of the 25th anniversary  committee along with Lodwrick M. Cook and Nancy Olson Livingston.  </P> <P> "We saw my mother yesterday to tell her everything that's going on, and she  thought it sounded very exciting," related Camilla. "She was particularly  excited Zubin made such an effort to be here tonight." Her mother, she noted,  was head of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when the maestro Mehta was appointed  music director.  </P> <P> Said Music Center president Esther Wachtell: "They keep telling me in my press  office I'm not supposed to say this, but tonight marks 25 years of celebrating  that we made Buff's dream come true. She said it was a lot of work -- a lot of  hard work -- getting us here today," added Wachtell, who talked with Mrs.  Chandler earlier in the day. "It's amazing, isn't it?"  </P> <P> For many, the evening evoked memories of Mrs. Chandler's dogged determination  in raising the money to build the Music Center. "She was one of the most  wonderful fund-raisers I've ever known, and the toughest," recalled Prentis  Cobb Hale, one of the founders. "I'm from San Francisco and San Francisco is  imbued with music. I asked, why should I support the Music Center? But I did."  </P> <P> Over at table No. 31, everyone raised glasses in a private toast. "My thoughts  totally focus on Mrs. Chandler," said Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, whose table  mates included sculptor Robert Graham, Gerald and Robin Parksy and Joan and  John Hotchkis.  </P> <P> The swagged tent was appropriately theatrical, glowing with tiny lights, silver  palm trees and masses of white orchids. "It's a little on the glitz side, but  it had to be for something like this," allowed Terry Stanfill, who took charge  of the decor. Dinner began with fettucine with Sevruga caviar, chicken breasts  stuffed with veal and spinach, and peach ice cream with fresh peaches served  with chocolate sauce.  </P> <P> Among those attending were Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Mayor Tom Bradley, L.A.  county supervisors Ed Edelman, Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich, Councilman  Gilbert Lindsay, state assemblymen Mike Roos and Lucille Roybal-Allard, Music  Center Board of Governors Chairman J.J. Pinola and his wife Dorie, David  Murdock, Harriet and Armand Deutsch, Tom and Patti Skouros, Harold Prince,  Keith and Bill Keischnick, Joanne and Roger Kozberg, Deborah and Tom Tellefsen,  Marco and Joan Weiss, Wendy Goldberg, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Doug Cramer and  Ames Cushing, Betsy Bloomingdale, Walter and Pat Mirisch, Wallis Annenberg,  Leonore and Bernard Greenberg and Sheldon and Sandra Ausman.  </P> <P> As the evening drew to an end, founder John Hotchkis glanced around the tent  and proclaimed, "They used to think of L.A. as a cultural desert, but not any  more. Thanks to good old Buff."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Calendar: Page 1  </P></p>

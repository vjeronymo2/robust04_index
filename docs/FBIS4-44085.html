			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet by </F> Jean-Louis Peytavin; place and date not given: "Gerard Longuet:  `Priority to Services and Programs'" -- first paragraph is LE  FIGARO introduction]    [Text] The information superhighway is one of the major  projects of the future. Gerard Longuet, minister of industry,  postal services and telecommunications, and foreign trade, gave  us his "liberal voluntarist" view on this major project (worth  several hundred billion francs) without expecting state  interventionism to take care of everything.    [Peytavin] What hopes do you put in the information  superhighway?    [Longuet] To bring all French people revolutionary services  to their homes, services which are all based on the exchange of  images and data. These include personal exchanges, such as the  videophone, as well as cultural and educational exchanges, and  the development of teleworking. All in all, there has been a  spectacular rise in transactions made from home, something which  Minitel is giving us a preview of already. The convergence  between optical and digital technologies enables this  integration of telephone, television, and computer technologies.  Hitherto unexplored areas are being opened up for consumers and  new careers are appearing which will make it possible to create  hundreds of thousands of jobs.  <H5>  Public Effort and Private Initiative </H5>   [Peytavin] The Bangemann report is being examined today in  Corfu. Do you agree with its approach on the liberalization of  telecommunications?    [Longuet] With one important reservation concerning the  insufficient space given to missions of general interest, for  example, town and country planning and tariff equalization, I  broadly subscribe to his approach: namely, the active  participation of the private sector, the liberalization of  markets, and the launch of projects bringing together private  initiatives and the public sector.    [Peytavin] How will the telecommunications monopolies  evolve?    [Longuet] The national monopolies made it possible to  implement universal telephone service. However, they are not  compatible at European level with the deployment of networks and  services that meet a considerably diversified demand.  Competition provides the opportunity to decompartmentalize  national markets and give new operators a chance in a booming  market.    Nevertheless, it would be naive to believe that the market  can just open up by magic and that the fruits of the information  society will drop fully ripened into the hands of Europeans.  Minitel is a good example of this: Major innovations are  primarily the fruit of audacious strategies, most often  combining public effort and private initiative. In other words,  in a sector with a very high level of technology, such as the  information superhighway, market dynamics have everything to  gain from being complemented by a certain amount of state  interventionism. This is what I call liberal interventionism.    [Peytavin] Should the state once more play an  interventionist  role as a planner of infrastructures?    [Longuet] Paradoxically, state intervention is less  justified  for infrastructures than for services. On the one hand, public  planning of infrastructures is less and less necessary since  there is no lack of private investors prepared to assume the  sometimes extremely high costs of new infrastructures. This has  been demonstrated by mobile phone networks.    Interventionism by the public authorities can even prove to  be disastrous, as we saw with the cable plan, which was  initiated by the Mauroy government in 1982. These kinds of  economic mistakes must not be repeated at a time when France  Telecom is preparing to confront competition in 1998.    On the other hand, the public sector must contribute, by  setting regulations and acting as a catalyst, toward creating  reference services and programs. Here, I am thinking in  particular of health, education and vocational training,  research, and town and country planning. These are all sectors  where the information superhighway can meet very pressing needs  in terms of social usefulness. The interventionism of the  authorities will make it possible to kill two birds with one  stone: putting the information superhighway at the service of  society, and demonstrating to all economic operators the  concrete merits of new communication technologies.</p>

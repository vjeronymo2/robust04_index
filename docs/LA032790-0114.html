			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1-BILLION PENTAGON RENOVATION REJECTED  </P> <P> The chairman of a Senate panel on military construction said Monday that a Bush  Administration request for $1.1 billion to renovate the Pentagon is "out of the  question."  </P> <P> Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) acknowledged that the 47-year-old building is in need  of repair but said the Administration's call for $1.1 billion over seven years  would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets.  </P> <P> "The military construction bill is going to get smaller, not larger," Sasser  told Pentagon officials.  </P></p>

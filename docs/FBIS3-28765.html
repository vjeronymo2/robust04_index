			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- MINJOK SIBO, a  newspaper of Koreans published in Japan, February 1 in an  article strongly demanded the United States and the South Korean  authorities officially announce that they would discontinue the  "Team Spirit" war maneuvers and all other military exercises.    Noting with resentment that the United States and the South  Korean puppet authorities are scheming to hold new large-scale  military exercises integrating "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" joint  military exercises, the paper said this is a grave challenge to  peace and reconciliation.    It warned that if the United States and the South Korean  authorities continued to cling to war maneuvers, they would be  held wholly responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Knin, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- By deploying more than  50 armored personnel carriers and approximately 1,500 soldiers  around 0630 [0530 GMT] this morning UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] completely cordoned off all roads in western Slavonija  bound for the Sava bridge between Stara Gradiska and [Bosanska]  Gradiska.    In that way, as assistant minister of internal affairs of  the  republic of Serb Krajina, Nebojsa Pavkovic, told TANJUG, the  western Slavonia area has been almost completely severed from  the rest of the world and no longer has any connections with  other Serb lands.    Members of the Krajina special police are still on the  bridge  and around it. Around 1100 [1000 GMT] this morning several  hundred local citizens rallied in protest at the complete  closure of all roads.    The special police units, as Pavkovic said, have been  ordered  to behave in such a way as not to provoke possible tension or  conflict with the blue helmets. Because of the newly created  situation, which has not shown any signs of normalization, a  sharp protest has been lodged with UNPROFOR.    According to reports coming into the Krajina Ministry of  Internal Affairs, members of the peacekeeping force today  refused to let through a vehicle transporting bread to Okucani  and there have been difficulties in organizing a funeral. In  this respect UNPROFOR members yielded, but only after a long  argument.    Talks between the Krajina authorities and UNPROFOR are  expected to be held on the spot today in order to find a  peaceful solution.    A delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina to these  negotiations will be led by Vice President Branko Lubavac.  [passage omitted]</p>

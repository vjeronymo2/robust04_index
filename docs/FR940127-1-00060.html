			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service received a draft proposal from ICCAT Watch, a coalition consisting of the National Audubon Society, the Center for Marine Conservation, and World Wildlife Fund-US, to list bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic in Appendix II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previously, a notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 33894, July 24, 1991) seeking comments on a proposal from the National Audubon Society to list the western Atlantic stock of bluefin tuna in Appendix I. The NMFS initially recommended that public comment be received on the merits of proposing the species for listing in Appendix II. After review of all comments and available information, the Service decided not to propose listing of the species in either appendix. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna falls under the responsibility of parties to the ICCAT. Provisions of Article XIV of CITES relieve ICCAT member countries from CITES obligations with respect to trade in specimens of marine species included in Appendix II, if such trade is in accordance with the provisions of ICCAT and if a certificate stipulating to this condition is given by the CITES Management Authority of the country of introduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For western Atlantic bluefin tuna, the current stock assessment (1993) by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) estimated stock trajectories showing a significant decline from 1970 to 1992 but with a small increase in 1993. The 1993 median estimate of abundance for 8-year-old and older tuna is 10.9 percent of the 1970 median, 20 percent of the 1977 median, 43 percent of the 1982 median, and 78 percent of the 1988 median. In terms of spawning biomass, current abundance is estimated at between 6 percent and 12 percent of that which could produce maximum sustainable yield. Projections by the SCRS stock abundance, based on the assumption that the current relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment will prevail in the future, suggest that there is about a 50 percent chance of preventing further decline in mature stock size if catches between 1994 and 2001 were limited to 1,200 metric tons per year (mt/yr). Lower catches result in higher odds of preventing further reductions in spawning stock. The allowable catch in 1994 is, 1,995 mt. The allowable catch in 1995 is 1,200 mt, subject to scientific review of the most recent assessment results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there is an uncertainty about the proper north-south dividing line between the western and eastern populations. In recent years, Japanese vessels have harvested a substantial tonnage of bluefin tuna just east of the original N&hyph;S line. At least a portion of this take may have included tuna from the western population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, the 1992 assessment shows great variability in the abundance of the youngest age groups (ages 1&hyph;4) over the period 1970&hyph;91). Estimates of abundance of fish 5 years old or older, which includes most of the spawning stock, have shown a consistent downward trend, the average abundance of fish 5 years old or older for 1990&hyph;92 being about one half the average estimate for 1970&hyph;72. Abundance estimates for the oldest fish of this stock (ages 10 and older) have shown an even greater downward trend since 1970. The average estimated abundance of fish in this age group for the period 1990&hyph;92 was about one third of the average estimate for the 1970&hyph;72 period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent (1991) estimated fishing mortality rates for eastern Atlantic bluefin are between 2 and 7 times the common fishing mortality rate reference levels which are thought to result in long-term average yields near maximum sustainable yield and provide adequate safeguards against recruitment failure. Over the long term, fishing mortality rates as high as those estimated are likely to result in increased risks of stock collapse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At COP8, Sweden proposed the listing of the western Atlantic population of bluefin tuna in Appendix I and the eastern Atlantic population in Appendix II. The proposal was withdrawn by Sweden at the meeting based on a set of conditions which primarily included the requirement that ``ICCAT continue its initiatives, with particular emphasis on quota reductions, to restore and maintain Atlantic bluefin tuna populations *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

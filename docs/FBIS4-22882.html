Vatulyan and I.M. Syunyakova (Rostovon </F> Don); received May 8,1992; UDC 539.3]    [Abstract] Dynamic contact problems of isotropic and  anisotropic theory of elasticity for massive and weightless dies  lying on the surface of a medium simulated by either a layer or  half-plane have been studied in sufficient detail. This type of  problems are topical in foundation construction, vibroseismical  prospecting and when designing various critical structures  operating under complex dynamic conditions. But taking into  account the actual plate depth and anisotropy of the foundation  call far a different approach based on the method of boundary  integral equations. The article examines the problem of steady  state oscillations of a massive die connected to a foundation  that is an orthotropic half-plane with an uneven boundary; in a  particular case the die can be embedded into the half-plane to a  certain depth. The derived special basic solutions make it  possible to formulate boundary integral equations (BIEs) for the  finite portion of the half-plane boundary. The use of a classic  version of the boundary elements method with the simplest  approximation of contact stresses makes it possible to reduce  the resulting BIE system to a linear algebraic system. Results  of calculations for various frequencies depending on the number  of elements used. Figures 2, references 8.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says he may still take part in the election. Speaking  near Ulundi, he said this would depend on the outcome of a  summit meeting with the government, the ANC, and Zulu King  Goodwill Zwelethini next week.    [Begin Buthelezi recording] If the negotiations, or rather  the discussions, that are taking place next week between the  state president, Mr. Mandela, the president of the ANC, his  majesty the king, and myself, do not come up with something that  can make it possible for us to participate in the elections even  at this late hour, then of course we'll continue to play the  role of being opposed to the status quo. [end recording]    Dr. Buthelezi said though the declaration of a state of  emergency in kwaZulu-Natal was not conducive to good  negotiations.</p>

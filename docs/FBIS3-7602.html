The growth pace was slower that  January's 1.0 percent increase.    The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and  manufacturing sectors stood at 88.9 against a base of 100 for  1990, MITI announced in a preliminary report.    The reading compares with projections of output increases  for  February ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 percent made by 20 major think  tanks in a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE earlier.    A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector  indicates a rise in March and a downswing in April. The future  course of final demand is uncertain, necessitating further  monitoring of coming movements, MITI said.    Shipments climbed 1.2 percent in February, with the index  standing at 91.1, compared with a 0.7 percent rise in January.    The inventory index dropped 1.0 percent to 106.8, following  a  0.4 percent decrease in January.    The February inventory-to-sales ratio fell 2.6 percent  against a 2.9 percent slide in January, with the index standing  at 119.1.    Industrial output had swung up and down in the six months to  January -- showing a 1.2 percent fall in August, a 2.2 percent  gain in September, a 5.5 percent slide in October, a 2.2 percent  rise in November, a 1.9 percent drop in December and a 1.0  percent increase in January.    On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in February  slid 4.2 percent from a year before, extending a record string  of year-to-year declines to 29 months.</p>

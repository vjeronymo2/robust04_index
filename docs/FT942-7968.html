			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / World new car sales likely to increase by 5.4% New car sales worldwide are expected to rise by 5.4 per cent this year to 34.95m, ending three years of falling demand. Sales fell last year to a six-year low, but demand is forecast to begin a sustained period of growth in 1994 and rise to record levels throughout the second half of the 1990s, according to the latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the London-based automotive analysts. The short-term recovery is being driven chiefly by a strong rise in demand in North America, where new car sales are forecast to increase by 11 per cent to 10.46m this year, as well by the continuing expansion of demand in the Asia-Pacific region. The study suggests that the recession in the new car markets of both western Europe and Japan has bottomed out and the focus for growth is expected to switch to those regions next year. 'The relatively prolonged recovery phase in Europe and Japan, plus the take-off of developing countries particularly in Asia, should set the scene for a steady improvement towards record levels of global car demand throughout the mid 1990s,' the study says. Sales in western Europe are likely to rise by 3 per cent or more this year to 11.77m, as the region begins a fragile recovery from last year's precipitous decline of 15 per cent, the biggest drop since 1945. The study says that the recovery in western Europe is uneven - German  and Italian car markets are expected to continue to contract in 1994. The UK recovery remains strong, however, and sales are rising in much of Scandinavia. The recovery will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and Italian markets emerge from recession, and sales in western Europe are forecast to rise by between 6 and 7 per cent in each of the three years from 1995 to reach a record level of 14.2m in 1997.

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: US acquisition helps Amersham to 71% advance EXCHANGE rate movements, a US acquisition and underlying business growth helped Amersham International, the health science group, to increase pre-tax profit by 71 per cent from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 17.4m in the six months to September 30. The advance was achieved on turnover, which rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 153.7m (Pounds 124.8m). The increase included a Pounds 15.8m first time contribution from US Biochemical, acquired in April, partly offset by a Pounds 13.3m reduction from the Clinical Reagents business which has been sold. Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said that like-for-like sales increased by 9 per cent. Trading profits increased by 54 per cent to Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 17.3m) with US Biochemical accounting for Pounds 2.1m of the increase. After increased research and development spending of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 7.6m), operating profits were up 79 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 9.7m) including a Pounds 5.6m benefit from exchange rate movements and Pounds 1.3m from US Biochemical. Underlying growth was 10 per cent. Net interest costs of Pounds 200,000 this time compared with net receipts of Pounds 400,000. At the end of September the group had net borrowings of Pounds 100,000 compared with net cash of Pounds 2.6m six months before. The turnround was after a Pounds 8m outflow in connection with the US acquisition. Life sciences, the largest division, which sells reagents to medical and pharmaceutical research establishments, was boosted by the US acquisition and posted operating profits of Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 9.8m) on turnover of Pounds 72.4m (Pounds 46.9m). Healthcare operations showed improved operating profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 200,000) on turnover at Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 42.3m). Earnings per share rose to 18.6p (11.4p) and the interim dividend is being increased by 10 per cent to 4.4p. COMMENT Amersham's management should be congratulated for its success in capturing all of last year's exchange rate movement gain. However, future performance gains will come from Amersham's new and more dynamic strategy built around closer customer focus and higher margin, branded products. Its three new proprietary healthcare products could generate sales of about Pounds 100m within five years. In the short term, pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 41m this year producing earnings of 44.5p. The stock shed 11p to 927p yesterday following a recent run-up and is now trading on a prospective p/e of 20.8.</p>

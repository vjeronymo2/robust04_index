			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TITAN 4 IS KEY TO AIR FORCE GOALS;  </P> <P> ROCKET: THE POWERFUL LAUNCH VEHICLE IS THE SERVICE'S ANSWER TO NASA'S SPACE  SHUTTLE. IT TOO HAS SUFFERED MAJOR SETBACKS.  </P> <P> The Titan 4 booster rocket that erupted in fire at Edwards Air Force Base on  Friday while being assembled by crane is a key part of the Air Force's answer  to the space shuttle -- a powerful, unmanned rocket that can launch heavy  payloads into space.  </P> <P> But the $200-million-a-shot Titan, like its civilian counterpart, has had its  problems.  </P> <P> The Titan 4, the latest in a generation of rockets that grew out of the  intercontinental ballistic missile program, is a "top-of-the-line launch  vehicle," said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George  Washington University.  </P> <P> At the same time, he added, it is over budget and far behind schedule.  </P> <P> Air Force officials have never been comfortable relying on the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch its satellites into orbit -- as  Congress ordered it to do more than a decade ago as part of an effort to make  the shuttle "economical" by ensuring an ample supply of customers. After the  space shuttle Challenger exploded in January, 1986, the Air Force successfully  renewed its effort to win congressional approval to get back into the launching  business.  </P> <P> The Titan 4, designed to carry as much payload into orbit as the shuttle, is  supposed to free the Air Force of its dependence on NASA.  </P> <P> But Friday, with the civilian space shuttle fleet grounded because of hydrogen  fuel leaks, the Air Force was left trying to explain a massive fire that is  bound to raise the same kind of questions in Washington that NASA has been  trying to answer about its shuttle program.  </P> <P> The fire, of course, is not the same sort of problem that has been confronting  NASA -- which in addition to its shuttle problems has a space telescope that  doesn't work right -- but the accident once again reveals the vulnerability of  any space program.  </P> <P> "This (the Titan 4) is our way of lifting heavy payloads for the future,"  Logsdon said. "This is it."  </P> <P> And the Air Force, he added, may be guilty of placing all its eggs in one  basket, just as NASA did with the shuttle.  </P> <P> "It's fair to say there has been criticism of the Air Force for placing all its  eggs in a new basket, called Titan 4," he said. "It owns the Titan 4, whereas  it didn't own the shuttle."  </P> <P> Thus, Logsdon noted, problems with that vehicle would leave the Air Force open  to the same kind of criticism that NASA faces -- placing too much reliance on  one system.  </P> <P> Although the overall record of the Titan program has been good, with more than  200 successful launches dating back to 1962, the newer-generation vehicles have  had their problems. Two Titan 34D rockets -- the Titan 4's immediate  predecessor -- failed during launch attempts at Vandenberg Air Force Base in  1985 and 1986, the second coming just months after the Challenger disaster.  </P> <P> In addition to Vandenberg, Titans can also be launched from the Cape Canaveral  Air Force Station in Florida, just south of the Kennedy Space Center. Both  sites have seen the launches of Titans in the past, but the Titan 4 represents  a new stage in the nation's space program.  </P> <P> Rockets are not launched from Edwards because they would have to travel over  populated areas during their hazardous early ascent. The Titan involved in  Friday's accident was at the Air Force's Astronautics Laboratory at the  sprawling base, where it was undergoing tests.  </P> <P> The powerful rocket uses a two-stage, liquid-fueled main propulsion system,  plus two solid rockets strapped to its sides. The solids give the rocket its  initial lift off the pad, and the first-stage main engine fires shortly after  the boosters separate from the rocket. The second stage ignites last, carrying  the payload either into Earth orbit or, at least potentially, into deep space.  </P> <P> Solid rockets, like the one that caught fire Friday, have been controversial  since they were introduced in the U.S. space program. Critics argued that once  a solid is ignited, it cannot be shut down. Supporters argued that solids would  be the most reliable way of boosting the carrying capacity of large rockets.  </P> <P> The fuel used in the Titan 4 booster, as in all solid-fuel rockets, is highly  flammable, as Friday's accident demonstrated.  </P> <P> "Basically, a solid rocket is like a firecracker," Logsdon said. "You treat it  with a great deal of respect."  </P> <P> Once the two solid rockets are ignited, the fuel is supposed to burn for two  minutes in a controlled fire that generates 1.4 million pounds of thrust.  </P> <P> The solids are blasted free of the main rocket after their fuel has been  exhausted, and the liquid-fueled engine takes over.  </P> <P> The Titan 4's capacity is slightly less than the shuttle's. It can put almost  10,000 pounds into geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth. At that  altitude the payload orbits at just the right speed to remain stationary over  one spot on the Earth's surface, an ideal situation for communications  satellites.  </P> <P> The capacity varies according to which launching site is used. Any rocket can  carry a heavier load into space from the Cape than it can from Vandenberg.  Payloads are launched into equatorial orbit from the Cape, so the rocket  benefits from the spin of the Earth, which is equivalent to around 1,000 miles  an hour at the Equator. The effect is similar to that of throwing a rock out  the window of a moving car.  </P> <P> But payloads are launched into polar orbit from Vandenberg, and that slingshot  effect is lost, so the weight of the load must be reduced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF TITAN ACCIDENTS  </P> <P> Here is a chronology of Titan accidents, involving various models, over the  last 25 years. Several accidents also occurred in earlier years.  </P> <P>  Sept. 5, 1988: An expended first stage section of a liquid-fuel Titan 2 rocket  launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base exploded after separating from the  second stage of the craft, which was otherwise successful in completing its  mission of placing four spy satellites in orbit.  </P> <P> April 18, 1986: A Titan 34D carrying a secret spy satellite exploded nine  seconds after being launched from Vandenberg, causing minor injuries to 58  people. Insulation on one of the solid-fueled booster rockets separated from  the rocket casing, causing a "burn-through."  </P> <P> Aug. 28, 1985: A Titan 34D was destroyed along with a spy satellite in a launch  failure at Vandenberg Air Force Base caused by an oxidizer leak and a pump  malfunction in the core booster.  </P> <P> Sept. 19, 1980: A Titan 2 missile exploded in its silo near Damascus, Ark.,  after a workman dropped a wrench and punctured its fuel tank. One man was  killed and at least 21 were injured. Several others were stricken ill by toxic  fumes during the days after the explosion. A nuclear warhead, thrown 200 yards  by the explosion, landed without incident. The explosion was the eleventh Titan  missile accident in Arkansas in 18 months.  </P> <P> March 25, 1978: A Titan 3C with twin military communications satellites was  ordered destroyed shortly after malfunctioning on liftoff from Cape Canaveral.  In other accidents in 1978, two people were killed and 27 were hospitalized in  Kansas and Arkansas after exposure to highly toxic fumes associated with the  liquid propellants.  </P> <P> Aug. 26, 1966: A Titan 3C rocket launched from Florida exploded shortly after  liftoff, destroying a payload of eight communications satellites.  </P> <P> Aug. 9, 1965: A flash fire caused when a welder's torch struck a line carrying  combustible fluid killed 53 civilian workers who were renovating a Titan 1 silo  near Damascus, Ark., to accommodate a newer Titan 2 missile.  </P> <P> Compiled by Times editorial researcher Michael Meyers  </P></p>

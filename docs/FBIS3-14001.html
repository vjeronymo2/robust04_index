Sensing the National Front-Left combine's resolve not to  support the resolution unless the United States was named in it,  the ruling party sought the BJP's help in convincing  recalcitrant parties to give up their demand.    It was also agreed that since most parties had differed on  how the Kashmir tangle should be handled, the proposed debate on  the strife-torn state will be held later.    The strongly-worded resolution, passed by both Houses of  Parliament this afternoon, focused its attack mainly on  Pakistan. Though there are oblique references to the Clinton  Administration for its support to Pakistan, it has not been  named. The resolution says: "Any attempt from any quarter to  interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met  resolutely."    Sources said after yesterday's abortive attempt to convince  the NF-Left combine not to insist on naming the United States in  the resolution, the Speaker convened another meeting this  morning in his Parliament chamber.    The leader of the Opposition and senior BJP member, Mr. Atal  Behari Vajpayee, along with Left party leaders, Mr. Indrajit  Gupta, Mr. Chitta Basu and Mr. Saifuddin Chowdhury, were present  at the meeting. The Union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, and  the parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, were  representing the government.    Both Mr. Chavan and Mr. Shukla made it clear to Opposition  leaders that the government was in no position to name the  United States in the resolution. But Left party leaders stuck to  their stand and argued that the Clinton government had been  encouraging Pakistan by questioning not only India's human  rights records in Kashmir but also its territorial integrity.  Hence, without naming the United States, the resolution on  Kashmir would be meaningless.    But Mr. Vajpayee convinced the dissenting parties to agree  to  what the government was saying and not to question the wording  of the resolution since its main objective was to convey a clear  message to the world that Indian political parties, despite  their differences, were firmly behind the government when its  territorial integrity was at stake.    He insisted that the main thrust of the resolution was to  isolate Pakistan. "Instead of doing that should we waste time  arguing whether the United States should also be named in the  resolution?" He warned if Parliament failed to get the  resolution passed unanimously it would only help Pakistan's  gameplan and prove that even on such a vital issue, the Indian  people were divided.    This did the trick and Left leaders gave up their obstinate  stand and decided not to insist on naming the United States. Mr.  Chitta Basu said: "The argument put forward by Mr. Vajpayee  convinced us and we decided not to press for naming the United  States. We too felt that it is more important to get the  resolution passed unanimously than exposing our differences."    Despite the Left's decision to go along with the resolution,  the CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] general secretary,  Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in a statement hit out at the  government for failing to mention the United States in its  Kashmir resolution. The statement said: "The resolution has  failed to nail down the Clinton Administration which, under the  guise of protecting human rights, is encouraging such activities  for establishing its hegemony."    Later, all members of Parliament, cut across the party lines  in decrying Pakistan's continued support of terrorism in  Kashmir. The resolution, moved in the Lok Sabha by the Speaker,  Mr. Shivraj Patil, and in the Rajya Sabha by the Chairman, Mr.  K.R. Narayanan, firmly said India had the capacity to counter  all designs against its unity and integrity.  *</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marseille, Dec 1 (AFP) -- Six Greenpeace militants  scaled a nuclear reactor cooling tower on Wednesday in protest  against an experimental reactor meltdown planned for Thursday.    The six, two Germans, two French and two Belgians, broke  into  the Cadarache Nuclear Test Centre near here at dawn. Carrying  geiger counters, they draped banners from the top of the cooling  tower reading: ``Atomic experiment don't play with our lives.''    Penelope Komites, head of Greenpeace France, denounced the  experiment because of the presence of numerous other nuclear  installations at Cadarache and because of ``major seismic  risks.''    The experiment, to be carried out in a PHEBUS reactor, will  simulate on a small scale a meltdown in the heart of a  pressurised water reactor -- the type most frequently in service  in the west -- and is aimed at increasing security.    Komites said the experiment should be called off because it  would provide a ``false sense of security'' over serious nuclear  accidents.    Scientists and ecologists will be able to watch the  experiment live by teletransmission either at Cadarache or at  Fontenay-aux- Roses, in the eastern Paris suburbs, home of  France's Nuclear Safety and Protection Institute (IPSN), which  is organising the meltdown.    On Tuesday, 20 militants of the Austrian ecological group  Global 2000 demonstrated outside the French embassy in Vienna,  saying there was a ``considerable risk'' that radioactive  materials would leak during the experiment ``which has no  meaning and exposes the people of France, Europe and the  wholeworld to pointless nuclear danger.''    The Cadarache experiment began on November 21 with pre-  irradiation of 10 kilogrammes (22 lbs) of nuclear fuel and is  the first of six simulations costing a total of 150 million  dollars.    The French electricity utility EDF is paying 25 percent of  the programme, the European Community 30 percent and the United  States, Canada, Japan and South Korea are contributing 15  percent.    The first experiment was to have been carried out last  summer  but was delayed after metal shavings were found from a hole that  had been drilled in a seal support.    In October, a bolt dropped out of a heat measuring  mechanism,  causing another delay.    But Cadarache director Michel Suscillon says there was no  danger. ``Even in the case of a failure during the experiment,  the radioactive products will stay confined behind four  impermeable barriers.''    Greenpeace-Germany has spearheaded the campaign against the  experiment, campaigning for a tourist boycott of the Provence  region in southern France and prompting major tour operator  Turistik Union International (TUI) to join in.    Half of the students of a German high school dropped out of  an exchange programme with a French secondary school.</p>

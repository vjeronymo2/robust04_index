Some  enterprises in the coal, metal, electricity, machinery and  petro-chemical industries would be helped to meet their debts,  pay wages and maintain normal production. The reports said the  State Council would select which enterprises would be helped.  Meanwhile, the State Economic and Trade Commission would join  hands with other ministries in searching for a solution to the  problem of so-called triangular debts, those owed by enterprises  to each other.    Documents compiled for NPC delegates acknowledge more state  firms were running at a loss and that the chronic problem of  triangular debts had worsened. The Ministry of Labour said an  acute problem of the economy was growing losses in a  considerable number of state enterprises. Worst hit were  enterprises in the coal, textile, military, forestry and  mechanical industries. The number of cases of suspension, or  part suspension, of production has grown. "Some enterprises  were only able to provide enough for the living expenses of  workers. Some even failed to do this," the report said. Much  had been done but the problem had not been solved.    The State Council met earlier this month to discuss the  issue  and called for prompt action to maintain stability. The report  said the Government would take immediate steps to solve  livelihood issues facing the people while intensifying reform of  state firms.    Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security reported an  increase in public petitions last year over work-related  matters. In Liaoning, a major bastion of state enterprises,  some workers were not paid for up to two months. The provincial  governor, Yue Qifeng, warned such problems could not be allowed  to continue. Mr Yue said their state firms carried triangular  debts of 46 billion yuan (HK$40.8 billion) last year, up from 36  billion yuan in 1992. Although no strikes took place in  factories, the governor said more people have petitioned the  Government for assistance.</p>

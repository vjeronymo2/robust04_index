			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REHEARSAL FOR THE UNTHINKABLE AT SAN ONOFRE  </P> <P> For the first time in seven years, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials  watched Wednesday as an emergency test was conducted at the San Onofre Nuclear  Generating Station, located just three miles south of San Clemente and  thousands of South County residents.  </P> <P> It was just a test, a simulated emergency that officials say is unlikely to  occur. But for Harold Ray, a senior vice president with power plant owner  Southern California Edison Co., it was an exercise in confronting the  unthinkable.  </P> <P> Ray was huddled down, surrounded by nuclear engineers and technicians, trying  to grasp the magnitude of the apocalyptic scenario before him: a major disaster  at the San Onofre atomic plant that led to wide scale evacuations in Orange and  San Diego counties.  </P> <P> During the drill, orders came to evacuate 35,000 people in San Clemente and  thousands of others in San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point who live in a 10-mile  radius around the plant in what is called a nuclear emergency zone. This zone  also includes portions of Camp Pendleton and San Onofre State Park. Local  agencies were asked to map out what it would take to get tens of thousands of  people out of those areas.  </P> <P> The annual test was run from the San Onofre facility, located on a 257-acre  site next to the Marine base and alongside Interstate 5. The San Onofre station  is comprised of three nuclear units that at full power can produce enough  electricity to meet the needs of nearly three million people.  </P> <P> The emergency scenario involved a complicated script devised by Edison and NRC  officials, who monitor the responses of those involved and score them later in  a detailed report. Participants, including Ray and 20 NRC employees, did not  know what to expect and were forced to deal with a series of emergencies.  </P> <P> Lou Phelps, Edison's vice president of corporate communications, said the  script was designed to strip the plant of several built-in layers of defense  mechanisms against disaster. It also condensed a period of several days into a  six-hour period.  </P> <P> The mock countdown to disaster began with a coolant leak in one of San Onofre's  three reactors, followed by a fiery propane tanker truck collision on the San  Diego Freeway just north of the plant.  </P> <P> Next, two television helicopters trying to film the truck accident collided in  the air and crashed into the power plant's electrical switchyard, causing a  complete power loss to the plant and the surrounding area.  </P> <P> Then, there was a failure in a backup diesel-powered generator, which keeps the  reactor's cooling system running in a power failure, causing a release of  radiation into the air. The final blow came when a crack appeared in the  protective shell covering the reactor, allowing radioactive material to escape.  </P> <P> "We are practicing something that is highly unlikely to occur in the real  world," Phelps said. "The odds of all these things happening are incalculably  small. But we (theoretically) have to do that to lose the ability to put water  in the coolers, and in order for people in the cities to participate."  </P> <P> Edison officials had no figures of how many casualties might occur under such a  scenario.  </P> <P> Many Edison employees in the drill were matched with an NRC counterpart, said  Russ Maribito, an NRC spokesman called in to assist from the agency's Chicago  offices. And all were watched by a handful of NRC observers.  </P> <P> Aside from handling technical problems and coordinating emergency responses,  company officials also practiced relaying information to the media -- a crucial  element in trying to handle such a dire emergency.  </P> <P> Maribito said that getting accurate information to the public plays as  important a role as stopping a radiation leak, a lesson officials learned  during the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster. In that incident, considered the  worst to date in the United States, radiation escaped from a malfunctioning  nuclear reactor, and company officials were criticized for being too slow in  getting accurate information out to the public.  </P> <P> "The whole emergency response scenario is an outgrowth of Three Mile Island,"  Maribito said. "If there is a lesson to be learned, it is that you have to be  prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency, and that includes notifying the  pubic. Three Mile Island was a public affairs disaster."  </P> <P> Ray said that a report detailing how the NRC scored the emergency response test  would be available to the public in about 30 days and that company employees  would be briefed on preliminary results by the end of the week.  </P> <P> During the drill, Ray and the plant's emergency coordinator quietly reviewed  information from nuclear engineers, radiation specialists and emergency  response teams.  </P> <P> Around them, workers bustled in and out of cubicles, listening to two-way  radios, keeping track of each move on a series of charts.  </P> <P> The response to the mock accident was played out in a "fishbowl," a  glass-partitioned office area in a radiation-proof building near the power  plant. In a real emergency, this area would become the control center for  Edison workers and NRC officials, Ray said.  </P> <P> "The hardest part is to keep in proper focus . . . to have an awareness of all  the pieces of information necessary to make a decision," said Ray, who is  responsible for emergency decisions at the San Onofre plant.  </P> <P> Maribito, the NRC spokesman, said that Edison officials seemed to have handled  the drill well but that if the NRC finds fault with their response, the federal  government could suggest ways to improve Edison's emergency program.  </P></p>

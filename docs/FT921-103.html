			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo may resume insurance for dealings with Vietnam JAPAN is close to resuming the provision of trade insurance for dealings with Vietnam, but remains wary of offending Washington, which has yet to lift its economic sanctions against Hanoi. The dilemma over dealing with Vietnam has become an important test of Tokyo's claim that it is developing an independent foreign policy, as Japanese officials have already decided, in principle, to resume trade insurance. Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) indicated yesterday that they were pleased with Vietnam's 'attitude' over the repayment of about Y10bn (Pounds 43m) in commercial debts outstanding since the late 1970s, and they are encouraged by the country's economic reform programme. A Japanese delegation visited Hanoi in January to discuss the commercial debts, most owing to trading houses, and another Y28bn in arrears on Japanese government loans. Repayments were stopped when Japan and other countries suspended aid after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The expected settlement of the debt question and the likelihood of government assistance resuming in the near future has encouraged Japanese companies to take a greater interest in Vietnam, but they, too, are concerned about causing offence to the US. Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, has taken a personal interest in the Vietnam issue, but he and Miti fear that a US decision on lifting its embargo has been delayed by the unexpectedly close US presidential race. Japanese officials believe that the Bush administration would like to lift the embargo, but is concerned about the political costs in an election year. That delay has prompted Tokyo to consider resuming trade insurance coverage in advance of the lifting of the US sanctions. Japan is also considering opening a trade information office in Vietnam next year, but a public announcement of the proposal has also been delayed out of deference to Washington.</p>

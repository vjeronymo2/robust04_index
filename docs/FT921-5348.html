			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Recruitment: When a change is as good as a rest - The benefits of sabbatical leave to both companies and their employees Sabbatical leave - once restricted to academic circles and a few media organisations - looks set to catch on more widely in the UK. Managers of post offices, for example, recently won the right to take periods of extended leave. Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chief, is said to refer to his spell in Ford Open Prison as his 'sabbatical in Sussex'. A sabbatical does not necessarily mean having to engage in worthy self-improving activities directly related to the job; it may mean spending more time with family, fulfilling a long-held dream or simply rebuilding the patio. John Lewis Partnership, which has operated 'long leave' since 1979, cites the example of a man whose hobby was to keep boa constrictors in his drawing room. His sabbatical enabled him to do voluntary work in the reptile house at London Zoo. A woman from the Peter Jones department store went trekking in the Himalayas which, she says, was 'not too strenuous after having been on her feet all day for years'. Employee representatives concede that, with inflation falling and the recession squeezing, the scope for delivering impressive-looking pay rises is limited. More effort is being put into fringe benefits and measures to improve the quality of life. Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the Communication Managers' Association, the union of the 3,000 post office counter managers who recently won their sabbaticals, is frank about pay prospects for many groups. 'The point has been reached where, in pure pay bargaining terms, there is not much further to go,' he says. The particular attraction of the sabbatical is that, unlike many other perks, it is not taxed as a benefit in kind, Mr Deegan adds. One of the most powerful arguments in favour of an extended break from work from time to time is that, at the very least, it allows employees to recover fully from the stresses of the job. Longer periods off may also enable managers to think innovatively and strategically, according to Professor Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester's Institute of Science and Technology. 'My business is blooming,' says Prof Cooper, who acts as a consultant to organisations battling against the effects of stress. Pressures on executives and managers are acute, according to Prof Cooper. 'So much is changing. They don't have time to refresh themselves or absorb new information. There's burn-out all over the place.' Having to take a few months off work because of burn-out is a kind of enforced - and for the employer more disruptive - sabbatical, he points out. In Australia and Prof Cooper's native US, sabbaticals are more common, although Americans do less well than their UK counterparts when it comes to annual holidays. According to New Ways to Work, a London-based charity which promotes more flexible patterns of working, more than 13 per cent of US companies offer their employees some form of paid sabbatical leave. Some of these US companies have exported sabbaticals to Europe. McDonald's, the fast food chain, offers sabbaticals of eight weeks after 10 years of service. This can be tagged on to the normal five weeks' annual holiday, giving a block of three months. The benefit is available only to full-time staff but applies to all ranks. Unlike McDonald's, Prudential, the UK's biggest life insurer, restricts the breaks to managers. Three days are awarded for each year of service as a manager, with sabbaticals of 10-12 weeks the norm. This is in addition to the normal leave entitlement of six weeks a year, although very senior managers have no set holidays. Details of sabbatical schemes do vary considerably. The post office counter managers' scheme consists entirely of banked leave which can be taken together with a period of unpaid leave. However, the union is hoping to build on this by negotiating further paid leave. John Lewis's 'long leave' is up to six months fully paid for those with over 25 years' service. Secondment, perhaps to a voluntary organisation or overseas, is a variation on the theme. Prudential, for example, sometimes allows employees to work with charities or government departments. Mr Gwes Lloyd, who is in charge of the company's corporate identity, was seconded. He is credited with having invented the 10-year passport - which largely replaced the less economical five-year model - when he spent six months with the Foreign Office. The charity Voluntary Service Overseas says ICI and IBM are examples of companies that sponsor individuals on foreign two-year placements. ICI currently has a manager who is teaching science in Tonga and IBM has allowed one of its employees to be a training officer in the ministry of finance in Malawi. British Coal has agreed to sponsor one of its employees who has actually left the company to go and work as a land surveyor in Zimbabwe. Secondment need not necessarily be overseas: the charity Action Resource Centre matches secondees from industry, commerce and the public sector with community organisations in the UK which would like to benefit from their skills. Mr Andy Powell, the charity's chief executive, says organisations used to use secondment as a way of easing employees into retirement or to fill awkward gaps between jobs or when, for example, workers returned from postings abroad. Now, however, secondment is more likely to be used for career development - as a way of making managers 'broader and more streetwise in a chaotic and increasingly complex world', says Mr Powell. Marks and Spencer and Nationwide Anglia Building Society are two examples of organisations that use secondment in this way early on in potential managers' careers. British Rail provides an example of mid-career secondment: Ms Jane Crofts, who has been with BR for 10 years, was working in customer relations but wanted to develop skills as a trainer. She has spent six months each with two local training organisations helping to set up new courses and developing an accreditation system. Secondment may even be used as part of an 'exit package'. IBM, for example, runs a programme which enables employees wanting a second career in the voluntary sector to take a year's paid secondment. The option of unpaid or part-paid leave may be used as a way of reducing staff numbers. British Airways told its 50,000 staff worldwide a year ago that they could apply for unpaid leave of between one week and three months. It is this link between time off and slimming down - or 'decruitment' as Prof Cooper heard it called recently - that has led to another common phenomenon: the employee who is entitled to a sabbatical but refuses to take it. The reason, in a word, is fear, says Prof Cooper. 'The individual is worried they won't be missed or that someone else will step into their shoes,' he says. Nor is this necessarily paranoia: fears may be fully justified in today's corporate jungle, he adds. The academic's year off to think, research and travel may be more than most highly-competitive and autocratic organisations, or their insecure managers, can cope with but Prof Cooper pleads for a start to be made with shorter periods of leave of between one and three months. 'We need more people from industry in universities, so does government, and people need to go from government to the private sector,' he says. Failing that, there are many suburban patios in need of reconstruction. Michael Dixon is away.</p>

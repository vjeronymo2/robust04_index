			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Bonds: French deal meets firm demand despite heavy supply DESPITE heavy supply and a slightly weaker market, a FFr2bn nine-year deal for Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the French motorway financing agency, met firm demand. Dealers said that the 9 per cent bonds were considered reasonably priced to yield 35 basis points above the comparable French government bond, with demand concentrated among overseas investors. Domestic investors remain rather more worried amount the political uncertainty in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last week. In addition to the CNA deal, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) launched a FFr1bn deal in the domestic market. Elsewhere, the market was dominated by a number of Latin American deals. Lehman Brothers launched an innovative bond issue backed by the revenue from a Mexican toll-road. MCTTR-TRIPS (Toll Revenue Indexed Participation Securities for the Mexico City - Toluca Toll Road) is the first of a series of deals in the privatisation of Mexico's road infrastructure. Three more principal roads are expected to be financed in the same way. The development of Mexico's infrastructure has in the past been financed solely by the Mexican government. The Dollars 207m deal, issued in the form of global depositary units, will be used to repay a government grant. The bonds, which have an average life of seven-years, will be priced later today to yield 11.15 per cent to 11.40 per cent. Elsewhere, Merrill Lynch structured a Dollars 100m repackaging of Bonex floating rate notes through special purpose vehicle, Argentina Bonex 1989 Trust. The fixed-rate seven-year bonds are priced to yield just over 11 per cent. Autolatina Brasil launched a Dollars 100m five-year deal via ABN Amro, which had not been priced by the end of trading yesterday. Societe Generale has launched an issue of 5m call warrants on the shares of Northern Foods, the UK food company. The warrants give the holders the right to buy shares at 615p per share, a premium of 17.3 per cent.</p>

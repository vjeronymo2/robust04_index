			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Training began long time ago Sir, Mr Howard Jordan of Scottish Engineering (Letters, December 7) says that he has been campaigning for better supervisory training 'for a number of years now', and draws attention to its impor-tance. The first conference to which I was sent by my company, in 1951, was on the importance of training for first line supervisors. This was well attended and was run by the then Industrial Welfare Society, which later dropped the middle word in its title. As Rudiger van Wechmar said in his adjoining letter about the EC, that was 41 years ago. Peter McGregor, Dacre Cottage, Longworth, Oxfordshire OX13 5HH</p>

Foreign Minister Melescanu had talks with A. Filali,  minister  of state and foreign minister of the Kingdom of Morocco about  the present stage and the prospects of the Romanian-Moroccan  relations, and about international and regional matters of joint  interest. Minister Melescanu met with the president of Morocco's  Chamber of Representatives, with the Moroccan ministers of  mining and energy, public works, and cultural affairs.    The talks with the Moroccan personalities gave the two sides  the opportunity to express their wish that partnership be the  basic principle of the future development of their bilateral  relations. To this effect the possibility was examined of taking  actions apt to render the Romanian-Moroccan relations a  privileged nature.    The exchange of opinions on international and regional  issues  revealed similitude or closeness in assessing the developments  in the areas in which the two countries are located and on a  wider international plane.    Concomitantly with the visit to Morocco of the Romanian  minister of foreign affairs, the Romanian-Moroccan Joint  Governmental Committee for Economic, Technical and Scientific  Cooperation held its 8th session under the chairmanship of the  two countries' foreign ministers. The committee agreed on  cooperation projects in port facility development, drilling,  energy, mining, agriculture, professional training. Both sides  admitted that the trade exchanges had been below their economic  potential and agreed to favor direct contacts between public and  private businesses, between medium and small ventures.    At the end of the official visit to Morocco and of the 8th  session of the joint committee, the Romanian and Moroccan  foreign ministers signed several bilateral juridical documents:  the convention for the mutual guaranteeing of investments, the  statement on establishing regular consultations between the two  foreign ministries, the programme of the cultural accord for the  years 1994 and 1995.</p>

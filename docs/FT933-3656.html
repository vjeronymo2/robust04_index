			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Cable revolution rumbles into the residential zones: The established telecoms providers are facing stiff competition from new operators UNTIL RECENTLY most of us had no choice but to use British Telecommunications at home. Mercury was something for business, and cable companies were almost nowhere. No longer. Mercury now has 375,000 domestic subscribers linked to its trunk network. Cable companies, building local telephone networks across Britain's urban areas, have signed up 164,000 residential customers - more than treble the tally a year ago. That is just the start. Most new phones have a blue button, giving direct connection to Mercury for Pounds 11.75 a year. For those with old phones, a new Mercury service will enable about half of all BT subscribers to use Mercury by dialling 132 before their long-distance number. By the end of the year '132' will be available in most areas with modern telephone exchanges. Londoners can sign up now, and a marketing blitz is imminent. As for cable, 14.5m homes are covered by franchises granted to companies to build combined cable telephone and television networks. A total of 27 companies - 20 of them North American - have 127 franchises between them. Networks are under construction in 62 areas and others will start later this year. Virtually all cable subscribers have severed their BT connections, relying for their long-distance calls on inter-connection agreements negotiated by the cable companies, mostly with Mercury. The sight of yet another outfit digging up the streets has not endeared the cable companies to their potential customers. And once the roads are re-surfaced many are reluctant to ask about the services for fear of invasion by sales teams. The salespeople come anyway. A day in the Portsmouth area, where Nynex, the US-owned cable operator, is constructing one of its 18 networks, revealed a high degree of enthusiasm for the new services. To Nynex's surprise, cable telephone is proving more popular than cable television. Nynex's team of 38 'cable advisers' are trudging the streets of Portsmouth and its environs, armed with glossy brochures showing large savings on phone bills and the benefits of 29 basic TV channels and another six premium channels. So far council estates have offered the richest pickings. On the city's Lee Park estate take-up is more than 40 per cent. But it is significant across the franchise area, which extends from Fareham in the west to Petersfield in the north. A team out for a week in Fareham reported 27 per cent of homes visited taking cable telephone, 25 per cent cable TV, and nearly 30 per cent one or the other. A few months after their initial foray the advisers go back to 're-market'. One city area re-marketed in July was reporting total take-up of more than 38 per cent. Telephone was again the best seller, attracting 35 per cent of homes visited compared with 32 per cent for cable TV. 'Without the advisers, we'd get nowhere,' said Mr Karl Gross, managing director of the Nynex's Solent franchise and a former Unilever executive. 'We need them to get over people's hesitation that we're double-glazing merchants.' The advisers are paid Pounds 70 a week. The rest is down to them, with commissions paid not just on sales, but on everything including direct debits, worth a pound each to them. An average sale earns an adviser Pounds 15. One experienced hand said: 'It's not particularly hard-sell. You start with the average 10 per cent off the phone bill, that always gets you a hearing. Then you throw in the TV.' Once word has gone around, the job is far easier. Those taking cable telephone were mainly concerned to save money. They seemed to accept the glossy charts showing that they would save by switching to Nynex - although some might be better off keeping their BT line using Mercury for trunk calls (see table). Few were worried about having to change their phone number. They wanted to be assured about reliability and long-distance links. Mention of Nynex's US experience and its connection to Mercury's long-distance network was enough for most people. Surprisingly, BT seemed to be doing nothing in response, apart from letters advertising its 'Option 15' discount rate. Nynex's connection charge for TV is Pounds 35.99. An extra Pounds 20 (Pounds 15 for direct debit subscribers) gets you the phone too. The phone alone comes for Pounds 60 (Pounds 55 with direct debit). Over 60s and the disabled gain installation free, provided they take both the phone and TV. Perks include itemised phone bills for all calls costing more than 20p. The monthly telephone line rental is Pounds 6.45, with itemised billing for all calls of more than 20p. Portsmouth is Nynex's most advanced network, but Blackburn, Brighton, Bromley, Derby, Bolton and north Surrey are progressing. The jewel in the company's UK crown is Manchester, where work will start later this year. Mr Eugene Connell, Nynex's UK director said: 'We plan to spend around Dollars 3bn in the UK over the next five years - our commitment is total.'</p>

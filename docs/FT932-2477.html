			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BAe British Aerospace's management is clearly moving on to the front foot if the imminent corporate reorganisation is any guide. The new structure is unlikely to upset BAe's banks or, by implication, the share price and is a more rational basis for a modern industrial holding company. Indeed, once it has digested the current changes, it might make sense for BAe to go further and group its overseas subsidiaries together. The confidence to tinker with the corporate structure clearly flows from success in tackling the problems which led to BAe's very own Black Wednesday last September. Yet developments since the new team took charge are also a glaring condemnation of the past. Under Sir Roland Smith, the company grew like topsy, but management controls were sadly lacking. Perhaps an unfortunate coincidence of the secrecy in defence and slackness elsewhere proved an explosive cocktail. The board will need to use management controls to spread transparency and accountability through the group if the shock of last year is not to fade and the risk of further mishap resurface. That will be a slow business, as the enthusiasts in the stock market seem inclined to forget.</p>

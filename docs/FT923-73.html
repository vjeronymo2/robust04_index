			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Drowning Germany clings to the franc Sir, May I express the wholly unorthodox view that, in recent days, the Bundesbank was trying less to save the French franc than to protect Germany from the consequences of its refusal to pay for being reunited? 'Hard-core Europe,' that child of Messrs Delors, Kohl and Mitterrand, is only a device allowing the drowning German economy to cling as long as possible to the French one (the fundamentals of which were the best in Europe two weeks ago) until both are finally sunk. Otherwise, there is no reason for France to go on living with an uncompetitive exchange rate and real interest rates twice or thrice as high as what is sustainable in the long run. If a united Europe is thought necessary, then let the other 11 countries go ahead and leave Germany alone until it is willing to solve its own problems.

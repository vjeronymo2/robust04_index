			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Some you win . . . What price excellence in technology? The New York Conference Board's 1992 prize for same, sponsored jointly by the Gartner information- services group, has gone to Donald Fites, the chairman of Caterpillar . He won it, we're told, for his use of information technology to improve the group's productivity and links with suppliers, dealers and customers. In the meantime, however, he has led his company not only to a Dollars 404m loss for 1991, but into a labour dispute threatening to bog down performance this year. Perhaps that's why he won't be collecting the prize in person at the Waldorf-Astoria tonight, sending vice-chairman James Wogsland instead.</p>

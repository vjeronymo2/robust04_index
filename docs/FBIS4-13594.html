			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F> unidentified correspondents in Beirut on 20 April--recorded]    [Text] [Buwayz] Today we are dealing with some issues  relating to decisions that have already been made. The  deportation of the Iraqi diplomats might not be carried out  tomorrow [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Buwayz] There is a problem and [words indistinct] by  tomorrow.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] will U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher tour the Middle East?    [Buwayz] Yes.    [Correspondent] When?    [Buwayz] No dates have been given. I believe it will be next  week.    [Correspondent] Do you know whether he will come to Lebanon?    [Buwayz] No. I don't know.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Buwayz] The issue is a legal one. [Words indistinct] it was  a political decision that the government had to make. It did  so. It decided to sever relations and to deport the diplomats  who are here. As for the judiciary decision, since there is  immunity in this particular case and in view of the overall  circumstances of the case, it is up to the court to decide. The  court, the judiciary, will be the one that will take the Vienna  Convention and its own interpretations and apply them to this  case. It will decide either that this case falls within the  context of the Vienna Convention and, therefore, there is  immunity or that the circumstances are beyond the Vienna  Convention and that the Lebanese judiciary is not qualified to  decide on the issue. The decision is up to the judiciary.    [Correspondent] Which judiciary?    [Buwayz] By judiciary I mean the court.    [Correspondent] Minister, Iraq is asking for the Lebanese  investigation committee, is it not....    [Buwayz, interrupting] The state's employees should stop  speculating.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Russia's peace role wins US backing Ms Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday approved Russia's peacekeeping role within the Commonwealth of Independent States but stressed that it fell short of an optimal solution for settling disputes in the region. Ms Albright also insisted 'the burden of proof is on Russia' to demonstrate that what it sees as peacekeeping activities - sometimes described by leaders of non-Russian republics as a veiled form of neo-imperialism - are benign. Ms Albright's qualified acceptance of Russian military presence in some of the former Soviet republics along its borders appears to give substance to an emerging 'pragmatic' American approach to Russia. The policy, articulated by Ms Albright during a tour through Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia, appears to take a middle ground between US hawks wary of Russian neo-imperialism and Russophiles, willing to grant Russia a free hand. On one hand, during her trip, Ms Albright spoke out sharply for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the European republic of Moldova, which borders Ukraine. But, at a press conference in Moscow yesterday, Ms Albright said the US would be prepared to accept the continued presence of Russian peacekeepers in the more volatile republics in the Caucasus and central Asia. Ms Albright struck this balance yesterday when she said of the newly independent states that 'Russia has the resources, direct interest and the leadership required to help resolve the problems in this region'. But Ms Albright also warned that 'Russian policies and actions must reflect the fact that it is no longer surrounded by vassals, but by independent, sovereign states.' Ms Albright, who is a member of President Bill Clinton's cabinet and National Security Council, said it would be preferable for the UN to police the trouble spots in the former Soviet Union but that this was impractical because of demands on its resources. 'Were it possible to have a normal peacekeeping operation I think we all agree it would be for the best. But one of the things I have learned in the past year and a half is that there are more peacekeeping options than peacekeepers. Peacekeeping is a new growth industry,' she said. Russian - and other CIS - forces have intervened to keep the peace in Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But some local leaders have accused Russia of acting in its own national interests. Ms Albright said she was fully aware of the danger but was satisfied Russia was now adopting a neutral stance. 'In my mind it is better to do something than nothing. It is a pragmatic solution. It is not the optimal solution but it is not the worst solution.' Ms Albright's comments appeared to flesh out indications from President Clinton last month that the US would not object to a purely Russian peacekeeping force in Nagorno-Karabakh, so long as all parties agreed to it and there was oversight by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The instability in Russia's 'near abroad' was highlighted yesterday as it emerged that 14 people had been killed and 46 wounded in a bomb blast in a marketplace in north-east Armenia. The Russian counter-intelligence service also warned that terrorism could be unleashed in Russia if instability worsened in breakaway Chechnya.</p>

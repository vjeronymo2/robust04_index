			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Ponomarev, staff correspondent: "Bread </F> Distributed on Credit, According to Lists"]    [Text] Khabarovsk--Almost 90 percent of the population of  Bikinskiy Rayon have a standard of living below that established  by the kray administration. Of the 3,618 large families in  Komsomolsk-na-Amur, 3,115 are in need of immediate material  assistance. More than 130 enterprises in the kray are standing  idle and their workers have been forced to take unpaid leave. At  the same time wages have been held back since September on the  majority of sovkhozes in the Amur region, and bread is  distributed on credit in the rural consumers' cooperative  stores, according to lists....    These facts, heard at the annual meeting of deputy  administration chiefs of cities and rayons of Khabarovsk Kray  and leaders of departments and committees for social protection,  illustrate better than anything else the condition of despair  that now prevails in the remote areas of Russia. Speaking before  participants in the conference, the chairman of the kray  Committee for Social Protection of the Population, Nikolay  Telyatnikov, noted: "We have taken on a heavy burden with empty  pockets."    Today, in his words, it is easier to name those whose  existence can be defined as more or less bearable because added  to the traditional categories of underprivileged--pensioners,  disabled persons, the chronically ill, workers of the budget  sphere--in recent months have been those who are officially  registered and actually unemployed, single mothers, especially  those living in dormitories and receiving wages that are less  than what is needed to pay for housing, and also school  graduates who have been left without work.    The only reason social upheaval has not occurred so far,  thinks the deputy chief of the administration of Bikinskiy  Rayon, Raisa Kabanchenko, is that the people of the Far East are  too patient. But very soon, in her opinion, the explosion will  have to occur both in "the defense sector" and in rural areas as  well as other places. It is no accident that the kray's  governor, Viktor Ishayev, in order to provide at least some  emergency payments to the needy, a couple of days ago issued a  directive to stop payment instructions for a total of 7 billion  rubles [R] earmarked for the Pension Fund of Russia, which had  been filled out by the Khabarovsk division.    The first deputy minister of social protection of the  Russian  Federation, Boris Dudenkov, participating in the meeting and  evaluating such actions on the part of the administration as  "local hooliganism" which could lead to the "collapse of  Russia," admitted, however, that attempts to get into the  pension fund are being made not only in the krays and oblasts  but also at the very highest level. In particular, the Ministry  of the Economy is now actively working out plans to use this  money for financing the miners.    Those who have survived the social and economic wilderness  have no hope yet. According to Dudenkov's information, the  Ministry of Finance has not yet transferred to the Republic Fund  for Social Support of the Population R28 billion withheld since  1992. True, thinks one of the leaders of the social ministry  itself, there must be a different approach to forming these  funds: Not through direct taxes but with excise taxes on luxury  items and some of the funds received from privatization.    And while the ministry staff is building castles in the air  and thinking about how to take some money from the rich in order  to help the most deprived, the Khabarovsk Kray authorities are  hoping for financial support from the capital. As the deputy  governor, Irina Strelkova, put it, "It would be wrong to ask for  a lot but we have indicated the main sore spots in the package  of documents prepared for the government."    This has to do with the so-called targeted allotment of  funds  for a sum of about R10 billion. Above all for conducting child  summer health protection measures and completing the  reconstruction of a specialized boarding house for people  suffering from chronic psychological illnesses.</p>

Speaking after a session of the ODS  Executive Council, he said that the party stuck to its stand  that the state was the entity to return property to the  churches, and that the former church property, now possessed by  communities, would be returned only with their approval. The  church property was expropriated after the communists seized  power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948.    Strasky said that particularly the buildings, which serve  religious purposes and which are necessary to ensure the  churches' existence, would be returned. Another criterion will  be the cost of the consequences of property restitution, he  added. The Executive Council has defined items to be returned  according to the type, exclusively or enumeratively, and of  items that will not be returned at all, Strasky said. He noted  that the ODS has partially changed its previous stand and  decided that also certain parts of farming and forest land and  buildings related to them would be returned exceptionally and  exclusively to religious orders.    The council also confirmed its previous stand that the  property which would not be returned be handled as any other  property, Strasky said. The council charged Strasky to defend  in future negotiations on church property its negative stands on  further restitutions and further proposals to alleviate property  injustices.    The three other government coalition parties -- the  Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), the  Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic  Party (KDS) favor either comprehensive or almost comprehensive  restitution of church property. The council also supported  partial remedy of the wrongdoings caused to Czechs during the  Nazi occupation for political or racial reasons and will soon  initiate "advance, compensation from Czech resources, Prime  Minister and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus said. He added this move  was motivated by humanitarian points of view. "This does not and  cannot mean in any case that we are abandoning our claims to  Germany," he stressed.    The idea to compensate the Nazi victims from Czech resources  was first formulated by Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec  last year. It takes into consideration the high age of the  eligible persons, but counts on continuing negotiations with the  Germans on funding the compensation. The compensation concerns  about 13,000 people.</p>

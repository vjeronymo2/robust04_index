			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON REJECTS VATICAN PROPOSAL TO END DEADLOCK  </P> <P> The Lebanese government has rejected a Vatican proposal aimed at breaking the  deadlock in implementing a peace plan to end the 15-year-old civil war,  newspapers said Saturday.  </P> <P> The Vatican had suggested amending the Arab League peace plan to make it more  acceptable to rebel Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who has refused to  recognize President Elias Hrawi's authority, the newspapers said.  </P> <P> But Beirut's independent An Nahar daily said the Vatican proposal was rejected  by Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic, and by Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni  Muslim, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Muslim.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, police said Aoun's mainly Christian troops and the rival  Lebanese Forces militia led by Christian warlord Samir Geagea skirmished during  the night with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in East Beirut.  </P> <P> No casualties were reported, and the fighting died down at dawn, police said.  </P> <P> It was the latest violation of an increasingly fragile month-old cease-fire  mediated by the Vatican to halt the fighting between Aoun and Geagea, who are  locked in a power struggle for control of the Christian enclave north of  Beirut.  </P> <P> By police count, 1,036 people have been killed and 2,774 wounded since the  Aoun-Geagea fighting erupted in January. Their battles have forced 40% of the  enclave's 1 million people to flee to safer areas or leave the country.  </P> <P> Aoun released 37 Lebanese Forces militiamen who were taken prisoner during the  power struggle.  </P> <P> Officials said the militia members, who were held in underground jails, were  handed over Saturday to officials of the International Committee of the Red  Cross in the town of Kfarchima southeast of Beirut.  </P> <P> Sources close to Aoun called on Geagea to follow suit and release some kidnaped  army troops.  </P> <P> An Nahar and the leftist Beirut daily, As Safir, said the Vatican initiative  was relayed to Hrawi's government in Muslim West Beirut by Papal Nuncio Pablo  Puente earlier this week.  </P> <P> The reports said the Vatican had proposed amending the Arab League peace plan  in return for Aoun's recognizing the Hrawi government's authority.  </P> <P> The peace plan was endorsed last October by Lebanon's Parliament at the Saudi  Arabian resort of Taif. It calls for the equal distribution of power between  the traditionally dominant Christians and the majority Muslims.  </P></p>

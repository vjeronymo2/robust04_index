			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Rocky Fans Line Up in Philly: The thousands queued up outside the Philadelphia  Civic Center last Thursday were waiting for tickets to a big fight. Not for  Tyson, but for Rocky.  </P> <P> Fans slept outside the center hoping to get a ticket to the fight scene in  "Rocky V." Within about an hour, people had grabbed up 16,000 of the 20,000  tickets for two days of filming in Sylvester Stallone's latest installment of  the Rocky Balboa saga. For each day of filming, Thursday and Friday, an  audience of 10,000 is needed. Dave Fulton, the film's publicist, has refused to  say who would fight in the movie's final scene. The movie is scheduled for  release in November by United Artists Pictures Inc. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

These sessions are intended to promote conversation with DOE representatives available to answer questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oral and written comments will be received at public scoping meetings to be held at the locations and times indicated above. The meetings will be chaired by a presiding officer and attended by DOE officials. The public scoping meetings will not be conducted as evidentiary hearings; speakers will not be cross-examined, although the presiding officer and DOE representatives present may ask clarifying questions. The DOE panel members will respond to comments and questions from the public. In addition, DOE representatives will be available to discuss the Defense Waste Processing Facility in informal conversations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate scheduling of speakers, requests to speak at these meetings may be made in advance by calling (800) 242&hyph;8269 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, or by calling Mr. Stephen R. Wright at (803) 725&hyph;3957 at least two days before the designated meeting. To ensure that everyone has an adequate opportunity to speak, five minutes will be allotted each speaker. Depending on the number of persons who request an opportunity to speak, the presiding officer may allow more time for speakers representing multiple parties or organizations. Persons wishing to speak on behalf of organizations should identify the organization in their request. Persons who have not submitted an advance request to speak may register at the meetings and will be called on to speak in the order of registration as time permits. Written comments also will be accepted at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record. DOE will prepare transcripts of the scoping meetings. Individuals may review the transcripts, other NEPA documents, and background information on Defense Waste Processing Facility at the following DOE public reading rooms during normal business hours.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S. Department of Energy Reading Room, University of South Carolina, Aiken Campus, University Library_2nd Floor, University Parkway, Aiken, SC 29801; (803) 648&hyph;6851.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Department of Energy, Freedom of Information Reading Room, Room 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20585; (202) 586&hyph;6020.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Development of the Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE will consider comments and suggestions received during the scoping period in its preparation of the draft Supplemental EIS.

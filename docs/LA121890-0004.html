			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN LINKAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> We are seeing a substantial number of articles about Israel "giving up land for  peace" in order to settle with the Arab nations on the Palestinian issue.  </P> <P> It is so interesting that never do these same articles indicate that the Arab  nations should consider "giving up land for peace."  </P> <P> We see a number of articles on the anniversary of the intifada uprising,  usually accompanied by the number of Palestinians killed by the Israelis during  their period. Rarely do we see articles written on the number of Palestinians  killed by fellow Palestinians because they are moderates and seek an alternate  settlement with Israel.  </P> <P> HAL FEDER, North Hollywood  </P></p>

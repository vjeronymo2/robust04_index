			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (1): Vendors put the price up  -The stock market's rise has offered investors an attractive exit route, but created a dilemma for providers of capital.  Divisions of large companies are being floated at p/e ratios above the levels that venture capital backers will pay Almost every month, the stock market demonstrates the attractions of management buy-outs to the managers involved. Devro, Holliday Chemicals and Inveresk, which floated this year, all showed dramatic increases in value for investors. To varying degrees, they provide role models for future buy-outs, demonstrating the rewards that can be reaped when managements are freed from the constraints imposed by a parent company. The failure rate has also been greatly reduced, suggesting that the risks involved are falling. Successful exits of MBOs through flotations or trade sales - the common goal for funders and the liberated management - rose to 24 in the first nine months of the year, compared with 15 during the whole of 1992. From the venture capital industry's point of view, there have also been rich pickings. Some 48 per cent of the 75 commercial company flotations in the 12 months to June, were funded by venture capital, according to the British Venture Capital Association. But the UK stock market's rise this year, while providing a more attractive exit route for investors, has also placed the providers of MBO capital in a difficult spot. In the first place, there has been a fall in the number of management buy-out deals that venture capitalists are prepared to fund. As mergers and acquisitions activity has declined, so has the supply of potential MBOs that corporate takeovers tend to generate. While in 1992 there were 520 MBOs, worth Pounds 3.04bn, the year to November 1993 has seen only 390 with a deal value of Pounds 2.19bn, according to KPMG. The largest, the Pounds 250m buy-out of BP's consumer products division, was a minnow beside the Pounds 2.4bn Gateway deal in 1989, and considerably smaller than last year's largest deal, the Pounds 400m purchase of Gardner Merchant, the catering group. What is more, companies wanting to sell a division to raise cash or to pursue the new Holy Grail - concentration on core businesses - have found that they have direct access to the stock market. Divisions of large companies are being successfully floated at p/e ratios significantly higher than the levels that venture capital backers are currently prepared to pay. Vendors are also becoming more demanding, having seen large increases in the values of companies, often in a relatively short time between MBO and flotation. Some of this increase in value has undoubtedly resulted from an increase in management effort and motivation that direct control inspires. But some of the teams that led recent MBOs were fortunate to be working for companies primarily interested in refocusing their activities. If it meant selling a division to an MBO just as it was on the point of recovering, that was of secondary importance. That has now changed, and vendors are holding out for higher prices. There are fewer distress sales of divisions to MBO teams, and with the pressure off, some vendors are increasingly getting venture capital suppliers to tender for the opportunity to back the MBO team. The most extreme example was the BP deal, where four venture capitalists competed in a beauty contest. The second issue facing the venture capital industry is its own funding. Venture capital providers have made a concerted drive this year to raise new funds from their own investors. More than Pounds 1bn is probably being sought. All the signs suggest some of the 30 or so institutions raising funds will either not succeed or will raise less than they had targeted. As a result, the market is awash with talk of a shake-out in the industry leading to a concentration of the available funds in fewer hands. Mr Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, which expects to raise in excess of Pounds 200m for a new fund, says casualties are inevitable. 'I think there are winners and losers - there will be fewer players and smaller funds than hitherto,' he says. News of the death of smaller venture funds has been exaggerated before. But this time around, the fund-raising will be tough. Back in 1989, a record year for fund-raising, the industry had just enjoyed a wave of MBO exits, first through flotations and then with trade sales. Many venture capital funds boasted impressive internal rates of return to support their marketing efforts. Institutions fell over themselves to invest - at precisely the wrong time in the business cycle, it turned out - and in 1989 alone the industry raised Pounds 1.6bn, some Pounds 956m for buy-outs, according to the University of Nottingham Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. With some notable exceptions, the recent record of certain funds has been less impressive. Some of the earlier investments after the 1989 fund-raising were disastrous, while many of the more recent successful buy-outs have yet to exit. Furthermore, the stock market offers stiff competition. Institutional investors, now having to decide whether to lock up funds in an illiquid venture fund, will be comparing the excellent returns they have recently enjoyed from highly liquid listed investments. Venture fund raisers accept that they are marketing in a more competitive environment, but argue that the current stock market returns may not persist. And for many of the larger funds, the returns are likely to continue improving as the number of MBOs which are floated or sold, increases over the next 18 months. They are also optimistic about a new source of funding - the US. 'A number of the US state pension funds are beginning to look at international investing,' says Stephen Curran, chief executive of Candover which is currently raising at least Pounds 200m. Some of these US groups are beginning to see the attraction of placing small percentages of their enormous funds in 'alternative assets,' Mr Curran says. The UK unquoted sector is particularly attractive. Candover expects to raise about half of its fund in the US - up from the one third it raised from American institutions for its 1989 fund - and recently secured a Dollars 30m commitment from Calpers, the Californian pension fund. If the venture funds are spreading their net wider to raise funds, they will also have to seek deals more actively once they have completed the time-consuming fund-raising round. Some observers suggest that new deal structures will emerge. One approach, increasingly favoured by 3i, but likely to gain greater currency, is the Bimbo - the buy-in and management buy-out, where internal management expertise is married with a team brought in by the MBO funder. There may also be a return to higher ratios of debt-to -equity financing in buy-outs, as the economy recovers and financiers become prepared to take more risks. No one foresees a return to the dizzy levels of the US-style leveraged buy-outs of the late 1980s, which were, in any case, rarely attained in the UK, but having fallen to a ratio of a little over one to one, there is room for gearing to rise. 'The UK economy is moving in the right direction, so it is a safer time to put on gearing than at any time in the last three years,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, at Electra. A modest increase in the financial risk of MBOs would be acceptable, particularly as the business risk appears to have fallen quite sharply. The first nine months of this year saw a dramatic fall in MBO failures to just three, from nine in 1992, according to KPMG. This may reflect the recent more conservative approach to pricing and gearing. But as the economy emerges from recession and it becomes easier to predict business performance, the funders of MBOs may have to accept lower returns or risk becoming uncompetitive.</p>

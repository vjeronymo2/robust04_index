			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST AND CONRAD  </P> <P> A mystifying phenomenon of our national scene is the continuing prominence of  Jeane Kirkpatrick as a foreign policy guru despite her demonstrated  deficiencies of experience and judgment. What entitles a person who has never  served outside the U.S. to pontificate about the incredibly sensitive situation  in the Middle East ("Baker's Inappropriate Role As an Evenhanded Broker," Op-Ed  Page, May 28)?  </P> <P> Let's face it: This academic Amazon has long been the darling of an influential  sector of the far right. She first came to the attention of Ronald Reagan by  accusing Jimmy Carter of unjustifiably abandoning the Somoza regime in  Nicaragua. Also, as a woman and ex-Democrat, she offered some convenient window  dressing to a blatantly macho Republican Administration.  </P> <P> As ambassador to the United Nations, she satisfied Reagan's flag-waving  objective by beating up on the often naive and irresponsible critics of the  U.S., especially in the largely symbolic General Assembly. On substantive  issues, her biases intruded, particularly on human rights, where she sought  support for her pet thesis that we might need to consort with "authoritarian"  -- read anti-communist -- dictators. She was much criticized for her opinion  that several American nuns may have been at fault in getting themselves killed  by a Salvadoran death squad.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most questionable part of her controversial record was her  notorious flirtation with Argentina's last military junta. When she was  Reagan's mentor on Latin America, what role may she have had in involving  Argentine "security advisers" in training the Nicaraguan Contras and the  Salvadoran police?  </P> <P> If the junta were being invited to play an increasingly important role in our  Central American anti-communist crusade, could this have led them to believe we  would stand aside while they invaded the Falklands? She acknowledges having  favored American neutrality, but she lost and so did the junta.  </P> <P> MARSHALL PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Labour says plan only postponed LABOUR MPs accused the government in the Commons last night of postponing instead of abandoning the proposals for the closure of 31 pits, and stepped up their demands for an independent inquiry to establish the facts about the collieries' viability. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on dissident Tory MPs to recognise the limited nature of the concession offered by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and to back a Labour motion advocating an independent inquiry in the vote tomorrow night. The motion demands that no closures take place 'until the select committee on trade and industry concludes a review of the costs and benefits of closing the pits and the comparative costs and benefits to the nation of retaining them in production'. To a roar of approval from the Labour benches, Mr Cook challenged Mr Heseltine to demonstrate his confidence in the case for proceeding with the closure proposals by submitting them to independent judgment. Labour fears that most of the 31 pits still face closure were heightened when Mr Heseltine, subjected to a sustained assault from the opposition benches, indicated that any change of policy was likely to be 'at the margin'. Mr Mark Fisher, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, stressed that Mr Heseltine had announced not a new policy, but 'slow death by delay'. Resisting the demands for an independent inquiry, the trade and industry secretary argued that it would be unable to produce an agreement because the different 'vested interests' in the energy industry would hold to their stated positions. A warning by Harrow East Conservative MP Mr Hugh Dykes that without the promise of a more fundamental review of policy the government was likely to be defeated in tomorrow's vote appeared to make little impact on Mr Heseltine. Limiting his expressions of regret over the political storm, he questioned whether his Tory backbench critics really wanted to see public expenditure increased to keep open 'uneconomic pits against the advice of those who manage those pits'. He emphasised that any extra spending resulting from prolonging the life of un-economic pits would have to be 'matched against a whole range of other investment or revenue consequences; hospitals, schools, roads'.</p>

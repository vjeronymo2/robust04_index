			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Yeltsin seeks stronger CIS ties PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday laid out proposals for the closer 'integration' of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, claiming that the 15-month-old organisation had so far been ineffective. Mr Yeltsin, in a declaration read out by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, described the association of former Soviet republics as amorphous and 'unable to fulfil the hopes invested in it'. 'While not aspiring to any 'leading role', we are conscious of our responsibility to co-operate closely with all independent states,' the declaration said. Mr Kozyrev continually stressed that the initiative was not designed to reassert the 'big brother' role of Russia. 'I don't think any magnifying glass will help you find any neo-imperialist designs in this,' he said. He said the move was primarily intended both to address the burgeoning conflicts on Russia's borders and to establish some financial discipline over those states which remain in the rouble zone and are thus bankrolled by the Russian central bank. Mr Kozyrev said the initiative was designed to increase economic co-operation, in particular through the creation of 'modern market techniques of integration' - the setting up of multinational companies and the encouragement of investment in each other's projects. This line has been foreshadowed by a gathering of CIS heads of state in Russia's oil region of Tyumen, where they were encouraged to invest in production. The declaration follows a speech last month by Mr Yeltsin asking for 'understanding' from the United Nations and the international community for Russia's intention to intervene in conflicts in the former Soviet Union, and to remain the hegemonic power in the area. That speech was denounced by the leadership of Ukraine - the most reluctant of the CIS members with Moldova and Turkmenistan. It is unlikely that the present initiative will fare much better, despite agreements said to be in the offing between Ukraine and Russia on gas prices and on the sharing of the former Soviet debt. His move came as he held meetings of the Security Council and his Presidential Council of advisers to address the political and economic crisis - though his advisers said the declaration on the CIS and the crisis were not to be linked. Many members of the Presidential Council told Mr Yeltsin that the introduction of presidential rule at the expense of the Russian parliament would be fully justified, according to Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the presidential spokesman. 'Many (members) say the president has all the moral and constitutional rights to introduce presidential rule.' Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, told Itar-Tass news agency that the army was under control and would abide by the constitution - though what the constitution prescribes for different levels of the Russian power structure is a big point at issue.</p>

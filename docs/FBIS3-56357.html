He recalled one thesis from the CIS Charter confirmed by  heads of states January 22, 1993 in Minsk. The document  stipulates that "those sponsor states which adopt commitments  according to the present Charter within a year after its  adoption by the Council of Heads of States are member-states of  the Commonwealth." At the same time Korotchenya stressed that  "the Charter is brought into force for all sponsor-states, from  the moment they hand over instruments of ratification for  storage or for sponsor-states which will hand over their  instruments of ratification in a year following adoption of this  Charter."    According to Korotchenya, as of today only six states have  ratified the CIS Charter, namely Armenia, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Korotchenya  said that they expected ratification from Azerbaijan and Georgia  in the near future. Russia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have  already forwarded their instruments of ratification to Belarus'  governmental archives, to the country-depository of the CIS.    At the Ashgabat summit leaders of the Commonwealth countries  have prolonged the term of ratification of the CIS Charter for  Moldova for three months more, said Korotchenya.    The session of the Belarussian parliament is to resume its  work in Minsk on January 18. Korotchenya, a people's deputy of  this representative body, believes that the issue on  ratification of the Commonwealth Charter "must be considered  without any delay during the first day of the session's work."</p>

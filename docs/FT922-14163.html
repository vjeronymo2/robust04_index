			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Addison rights left with underwriters A Pounds 16.3m rights issue designed to pay for Addison Consultancy's purchase of the main businesses of AGB Research has been left with the underwriters. AGB was bought in February from the administrators of the private interests of the collapsed empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell in a deal worth Pounds 14.75m. Only 2.4 per cent of the issue was taken up, with main Addison shareholders such as Lord Hollick's MAI group deciding not to take up their rights. The issue was underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, and was fully sub-underwritten by a number of institutions. Flemings were putting a brave face on the outcome yesterday and said the financing had always been regarded and marketed as more of a placement than a rights issue. MAI made it clear at the time the rights issue was announced that it intended to sell its then 24.8 per cent stake if the acquisition was completed. As a result of the rights issue the original Addison shareholders have had their stakes diluted and the company now has, by design or otherwise, a raft of institutional investors. Flemings declined to say last night who the sub-underwriters were other than to say that they were a group of well-known institutions. Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive of Addison, was unavailable for comment yesterday. A number of former AGB executives were also able to subscribe. Acceptances were received for a total of 3.6m new ordinary shares offered under the rights issue. Certificates for the new ordinary shares will be sent to shareholders by May 22. Addison shares closed down  1/2 p at 10 1/2 p.</p>

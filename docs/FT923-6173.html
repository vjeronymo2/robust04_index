			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Tec chief warns on cuts to budgets THE QUALITY of training for school-leavers and unemployed adults may have to be sacrificed and some of the smallest Training and Enterprise Councils could close if there are further cuts to their budgets, a senior Tec representative warned yesterday. The forecast was the strongest public statement yet from Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent to the government the concerns of Tecs, the employer-led bodies which administer training schemes in England and Wales. Earlier this summer Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, warned Tecs that their budgets for training could be cut in this year's public expenditure survey. Tecs then warned the government privately of the possible adverse effects of cuts to their training budgets, which last year were cut in real terms. G10 has recently been getting feedback from the other Tec chairmen, who have been in initial consultations over their spending priorities with the Department of Employment. Many chairmen have said that even the maintenance of funding at current levels will not enable Tecs to meet the growing demand for training programmes for young people and rising numbers of unemployed adults. Tecs fear that if the skills of the unemployed are not improved the UK will not be in a position to take best advantage of any economic upturn. Mr Edwards said: 'This is the time for government and industry to invest further in the single most important national resource, our people. 'Tec boards are not prepared to see the Employment Department budget for training and enterprise reduced without full consideration of the wider alternatives.'</p>

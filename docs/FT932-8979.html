			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: All you can taste and lots you can't - From crawfish and Tabasco to gumbo, Giles MacDonagh samples Cajun cuisine LOUISIANA'S gastronomic traditions are quite separate from the rest of the United States. They stem from the earlier French and Spanish control of the state, which did not become join the Union until the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Half a century before that, the swampy Mississippi delta had become an asylum for the French-speaking Acadians of Nova Scotia who fled from British rule after the fall of Quebec. The Acadians became 'Cajuns' and their primitive life style persisted until oil was found in the delta in the 1930s. Their isolation had two advantages: it allowed them to retain the French language, which all but disappeared from the rest of Louisiana; and it preserved their distinctive cookery (although, in the absence of refresher courses from France, some of the terms and ideas have begun to look very deformed). The Cajuns' basic diet was culled from the swamps and bayous - the distinctive dead-end rivers of southern Louisiana. They ate fish, crab and crayfish (which they called crawfish), turtles and alligators. From dry land, they culled a variety of game: deer, bear, squirrels and opossums. In short, anything that moved - and one or two things which had ceased to move. All these treats were served in spicy sauces designed, as much as anything, to hide the taste. Chillis played an important role in Cajun cooking; not for nothing is the apex of Cajun country, Avery island near New Iberia, the home of Tabasco sauce. Tabasco is made a little like sauerkraut: the chilli peppers are fermented under salt (for three years), then steeped in vinegar. There are few Cajun recipes in which Tabasco plays no part and, even when it is not stipulated in the ingredients, Cajuns tend to dribble it onto the dish. Crawfish are the Cajuns' favourite food and, given their scarcity in the rest of the world, the locals eat quite monstrous quantities of them. One local told me that he reckoned one 35-40lb bag was too little for 12 people whereas two bags was too much. Personally, there is a limit to how many I can eat. They tend to be rather muddy and are better in sauces. The other drawback to the Cajun crayfish blow-out is the omnipresent spice box, which makes everything taste more or less the same. But Cajun cooking does not stop there. One stock in trade is gumbo, a nourishing soup which derives from an African word for okra, the vegetable which forms the main ingredient. Besides okra, virtually anything can go into gumbo - and does. One favoured element is andouille sausage. Put all thoughts of the Norman or Breton tripe sausage out of your mind, though: Cajun andouille is more like a Polish Kielbasa. Equally confusing for francophiles is the boudin. The Cajun version is a meaty, spicy rice stuffed into an inedible sausage skin. In New Orleans, a boudin appeared as a rice, spice and duck meat patty dipped in beaten egg. Another French word with a distinctly local usage is an etouffee. The Cajuns translate this to mean 'smothered' (although, in many cases, suffocated would be more fitting). Indeed, there is even a French term etouffe chretien which describes dishes which suffocate by their flouriness. The basis of the etouffee is a thick, brown roux of a sort which was laid to rest in France by the first onslaughts of the nouvelle cuisine. For the rest, much is deep fried: cubes of alligator, catfish, prawns and mushrooms stuffed with crab meat. Cajun food has much in common with the Creole cooking of New Orleans but the latter is deemed to be more refined. In some of the more robust dishes, such as jambalaya - a sort of Creole paella - this distinction would be hard to maintain. In New Orleans' restaurants such as Commander's Palace, the kitchen aims to produce a more elegant cuisine. There is, nonetheless, something old-fashioned about the style of the dishes - above all, a turtle soup so thick that it could be spooned only after half a cup of sherry was added. No visitor to New Orleans should miss having a meal at K-Paul's; it is the best induction course into the Creole-Cajun question you are likely to find. The small dining room in the nub of the French Quarter is immensely popular, and queues for lunch start forming at 11.30 am. The menu contains all you need to know about Louisianna food. It is astonishingly cheap for anyone used to London prices. In the corner sits Paul Prudhomme, the chef, looking like the legendary gourmand Dodin-Bouffant under his jowls. Prudhomme has put both his mind and his belly to the whole bizarre repertory of Cajun-Creole cooking. Commander's Palace restaurant, 1403 Washington Ave (Garden District), 504-899-8221; K-Paul's, 416 Chartres Street (French Quarter), 524-7394.</p>

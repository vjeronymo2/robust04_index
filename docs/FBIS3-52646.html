Is that true? Has  Israel stated conditions which you have accepted in order to  have the negotiations resumed?    [Sha'th] We will return to the negotiating table, most  probably early next week without any preconditions and without  any new additions to what we are committed to. We are committed  to the agreement which we signed in Washington. No doubt there  has been progress in the negotiations over the past three  months. We will all benefit from this progress in returning to  the negotiations to reach an agreement. In any case, we have  passed the storm which Israel has created over an agreement that  was not reached in Cairo. It was a working paper on which  President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin added their  comments. We are returning to the negotiations without any  preconditions.    [Al-Shubashi] How was it possible for Israel to go back on  that document which it called the Cairo agreement?    [Sha'th] In fact, we have not used all our cards. I have not  published the hand-written agreement which the Israelis wrote  and then thoroughly amended, and again changed later. I have  not published the paper which we received from Rabin which  includes reservations that are no fewer than 'Arafat's  reservations because we do not want to escalate the situation.  However, we faced them with what had happened. No doubt, the  brother Minister 'Amr Musa helped us and was a witness to  everything when he said: There was no agreement, there were  working papers and the leaders had to comment on them. That is  what Israel returned to at last.    [Birru] Has there been any progress concerning points of  difference, especially crossings and the Jericho area?    [Sha'th] In fact, closer views were realized in Cairo, Oslo,  and Paris negotiations. But what spoiled the broth was changing  this progress into a claim that a final agreement was reached.  If they said progress was achieved then we would have happily  agreed with them, but now we have to go back to the negotiations  to place all that we have on the table. We do not want to go  back on any progress that has been realized. We want to  negotiate on what we have not agreed on.    [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, both of you have agreed to  defer the question of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Jerusalem is being  Judaized daily. What can the Palestinians do to stop this  ongoing process of Judaization?    [Sha'th] As a matter of fact, there is nothing in what we  have agreed upon that allows the Israelis to take advantage of  time. Therefore, any attempt prior to a final agreement on  Jerusalem and the rest of the areas of the West Bank, as well as  the other issues which we have not discussed now, will sabotage  the goodwill and trust that should prevail between us to arrive  at a final solution. We will not sit idle toward any premature  attempt. We can protest in various ways. We can also go to the  U.S. and Russian sponsors, who signed this agreement with us.  Everything should remain the way it is. Anything on which we  do not negotiate now should remain frozen until we discuss it  two years later.    [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat told our radio that withdrawal means withdrawal, and not  redeployment. As journalists who follow what happens, we have  read that the United States has earmarked funds to finance  Israeli redeployment. Do we understand from this that the  United States blesses redeployment, and not withdrawal?    [Sha'th] I do not think the Americans want to change or  amend this agreement. The opposite is true. However, we should  distinguish between what we agreed upon in Gaza and Jericho and  what we agreed upon in the rest of the West Bank, which is  called redeployment. Any funds that Israel will have to pay  will be as a result of redeployment and not withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho. They will have only small forces in Gaza and  Jericho to defend the settlements from within. But the real  redeployment will happen in the rest of the West Bank.    [Al-Shubashi] Is there a plan to have a future agreement on  the future of the settlements inside the Gaza Strip?    [Sha'th] The settlements are the same as Jerusalem and the  return of the 1948 refugees. The final status of these  questions has been deferred to the final negotiations to be held  within two years.    [Al-Shubashi] The fact that the settlements will remain in  Gaza requires Israeli forces to protect them, because Israel  insists that the security of the settlements should be in its  own hands. How will this problem be resolved?    [Sha'th] The problem is already solved because the agreement  we signed in Washington states that Israel is responsible for  the security of the settlements. However, the disagreement is  about the security belt that surrounds the settlements. We have  agreed after long negotiations that protecting the security of  the settlements will be from inside and not outside the  settlements. The negotiations are now about the security  framework of these settlements. This is because we think there  is enough territory usurped by Israel for the settlement  activity to station any small force over there without a need  for any further territory.    [Birru] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you.    [Sha'th] You are welcome.</p>

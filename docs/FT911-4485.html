			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Mice get out of the rat race TRANSGENIC mice, which are now being bred in the US, could help chemicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals manufacturers to test their products for carcinogenic traces more quickly, while using far fewer animals. GenPharm International, which is breeding the animals in Mountain View California, says the mice hold the potential for experiments to be cut to six months using 100 to 200 transgenic mice, compared with the two years and the 1,000 mice used today. The mice, developed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, in Amsterdam, have been made sensitive to carcinogens by the insertion of an extra gene, known as an oncogene. These oncogenes are one of a series of biological triggers which result in animals developing tumours. It therefore takes fewer carcinogens to trigger cancer in the mice.

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: BAG BALM FOR COW'S UDDERS UTTER SUCCESS ON DRY SKIN  </P> <P> Every once in a while we get a letter from a reader of this column that makes  us laugh. That's how we reacted when a farmer's wife recommended Bag Balm, an  old-time udder cream, for dry, cracked skin.  </P> <P> When we shared this remedy with our readers, we were astounded by the response.  Hundreds of people wrote in to confirm that what's good for cows also works for  people.  </P> <P> Many people were distressed that they could not find Bag Balm or its  alternative Bova Cream in their local pharmacies or department stores. They  didn't think to check an agricultural supply for their beauty aids. Farm co-ops  are not easily accessible to city folk.  </P> <P> When we offered an address for the co-op distributor of Bova Cream, thousands  of letters poured in. But dozens of disappointed readers wrote us to say that  their nearest distributor would sell Bova Cream only by the case. Twelve  10-ounce jars could be a lifetime supply of this stuff for a person who doesn't  have a barnful of milk cows out back.  </P> <P> You can order the same genre directly from the manufacturers. Udder Cream,  which smells more like hand cream than a barnyard product, can be ordered by  calling 1-800-345-7339 or writing Redex Industries Inc. P.O. Box 939, Salem, OH  44460.  </P> <P> Bag Balm is made by Dairy Assn. Co., Lyndonville, VT 05851. This small company  has been making Bag Balm for decades in the same familiar green tin. They sell  directly to consumers, or you can order through the Burpee catalogue or the  Vermont Country Store mail order office (P.O. Box 3000, Manchester Center, VT  05255). Two 10-ounce cans cost $10.50.  </P> <P> For seriously chapped hands, you can also buy a pair of cotton sleeping gloves.  After applying the udder salve at bedtime, pull on the gloves for better  absorption.  </P></p>

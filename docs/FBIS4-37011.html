			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, last night received brother  Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali.  Talks dealt with several issues related to the fact-finding  mission of the UN secretary general's envoy in implementation of  Security Council Resolution 924. Brother Lakhdar Brahimi  briefed the brother president on the results of his contacts  within the framework of the mission entrusted to him by the UN  secretary general.    The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized anew  our  country's commitment to Security Council Resolution 924. He  also noted the Yemeni Government's cease-fire initiatives since  the resolution was adopted in order to give those who rebelled  against legitimacy the chance to stop fighting and spare Yemeni  blood. However, they foiled all these initiatives and did not  respond to the calls made by brothers and friends to cease fire.  They violated the cease-fire and did not commit themselves to  the Security Council resolution with the aim of prolonging the  conflict and internationalizing the Yemeni crisis.    He stressed our country's readiness for an open-minded  dialogue to activate the entire joint military committee, which  comprises the Yemeni side and a military team from the Hashemite  Kingdom of Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman, and the U.S. and  French military attaches to our country, to supervise adherence  to the cease-fire. This dialogue can take place in any of the  following Arab capitals: Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo, or Rabat,  within the framework of commitment to the principles that  maintain unity, democracy, constitutional legitimacy, and  sovereignty and independence of the one Yemen.    He emphasized our country's appreciation for Lakhdar  Brahimi's efforts and its desire to extend all possible support  to render his mission successful in a manner that realizes  security, stability, and peace for Yemen.    The meeting was attended by brother Muhammad Salim  Basindwah,  foreign minister, and 'Awni al-'Ani, UN Bureau representative in  our country.    Following his meeting with brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, Presidential Council chairman, brother Lakhdar Brahimi  replied to questions posed by [Yemeni] television by saying that  he has been acquainted with the Yemeni views as well as the  views of others in the region, and he will complete this task  within the next two days in a way that will enable him to carry  out his basic mission--the submission of a report to the UN  secretary general.    He added: I think I held useful talks on two basic points at  this stage. These are ceasing fire to stop the bloodshed and  starting dialogue.    Brother Lakhdar Brahmi left Sanaa last night at the end of a  short visit to our country.</p>

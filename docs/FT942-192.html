			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Beckett manifesto aimed at softening her image Mrs Margaret Beckett will today release a personal manifesto designed to soften her image as the most leftwing of the three candidates to succeed John Smith as Labour leader. Mrs Beckett, the acting leader, is widely thought to be trailing Mr Tony Blair, the modernist shadow home secretary, and Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist employment spokesman. Friends say the manifesto has been timed to coincide with the despatch of voting papers to the 4.5m members of the party's electoral college. The eight-page document contains little fresh policy but it presents Mrs Beckett as a 'unification' candidate positioned between the party's modernist and traditionalist extremes. It also raises questions about the electoral appeal of the other candidates, such as Mr Blair's ability to defend Labour's heartlands, and whether Mr Prescott can win fresh support in the south. As an example of Mrs Beckett's 'middle way' approach, the manifesto offers full support for both Mr Blair's plans for welfare state reform and Mr Prescott's demands for commitment to full employment. Mrs Beckett says that the two policies are compatible because full employment will be essential to provide sufficient tax revenues to finance reformed social and health services. A friend said: 'The intention is that it should give people a flavour of the honest and inclusive style of leadership they can expect to see in a Beckett-led Labour government.' Mrs Beckett's move to moderate her image may have more impact in the contest for the deputy leadership, in which she appears to be level with Mr Prescott. It may ease concern among supporters of Mr Blair that Mrs Beckett would be a difficult deputy because of her strong links with the left. Her attempt to massage her image will not be assisted by a caustic editorial in the summer issue of Renewal, the quarterly journal of the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, which backs Mr Blair for the leadership and Mr Prescott for the deputy leadership. The committee, which has the support of about 30 MPs, says that Mrs Beckett has done a 'competent' job as interim leader. But it criticises her 'opportunistic career' and complains that she lacks 'ideological distinctiveness'. Blair statement, Page 12</p>

He met with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin this  morning. Later, the official Turkish-Thai talks were held.    In a statement at the meeting, Cetin said that geographic  distances no longer affect relations between nations. Pointing  out that Turkey and Thailand are two countries with significant  economic power in their respective regions, Cetin added: We  will discuss ways in which we can cooperate in the economic  field and the two countries can combine their respective  influences in their regions. There might be significant  developments in the field of tourism. We can also develop our  cultural and trade relations.    Recalling that Sunsiri arrived in Turkey after attending the  Nonaligned conference in Egypt, Cetin added that Sunsiri will  brief him on that conference and that various regional problems  will be discussed.

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM  </P> <P> Israeli police have mercilessly killed 19 young and old Palestinians near the  Al Aqsa Mosque of Jerusalem. It was a show of brutality and barbarism by the  Israeli government.  </P> <P> The world order has been changed; all nations, including the Soviet Union and  China, are talking world peace and cooperating with the Western world in the  United Nations Security Council. These world leaders have passed five strong  resolutions against Saddam Hussein without much trouble. They should stand up  now against the fascist regime of Yitzhak Shamir and force him to vacate the  occupied lands of Palestinian people or face a blockade and isolation similar  to Iraq.  </P> <P> After the Cold War is over, the strategic value of Israel is almost zero, and  the United States cannot afford to keep a friendship with such a fascist regime  at the cost of our interests in a peaceful world.  </P> <P> Z.

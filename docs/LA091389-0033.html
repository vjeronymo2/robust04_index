			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Anton Lubowski, the only white to hold a leadership post in the South-West  Africa People's Organization guerrilla movement, was assassinated outside his  suburban Windhoek home, police said. Lubowski, 37, was an unofficial spokesman  for SWAPO, the Namibian independence movement that had waged a bush war against  South African rule of the territory since 1966. Lubowski was also a member of  SWAPO's election directorate, which is overseeing the movement's campaign for  U.N.-supervised elections scheduled for early November. South Africa has agreed  to grant independence, expected by early next year, as part of a regional peace  accord also calling for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.  </P></p>

			<p>920824 FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Very rarely do television travel programmes hit the mark - there is usually a nagging feeling that the narrator and crew have brought the life style of Hampstead, or, in Alan Whicker's case, Mayfair, to the part of the world they are theoretically exploring. You can never really forget that however shrilly the front man squeals there are a cameraman and producer and all the comforts of civilisation close at hand. A new series of Traveller's Tales does little to dispel the doubts. Six 'characters' were allowed to visit a country of their choice. Nigel Farrell kicks off with a trip on Lake Malawi. Since the country rarely enters the news this opener sounds promising but Farrell actually has a nice time drifting along on a lake steamer, and the programme ends up exposing Farrell rather than the destination. (Channel 4, 9.00). Nature Special (BBC2, 8.30) examines the last-minute attempts to save the London Zoo by making it more environmentally friendly. Only a late flurry of visitors in the next few weeks can produce the revenue to enable the zoo to make the transition into a conservationist paradise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpt] Similar to his revelations on the excesses  committed at the La Catedral Jail, Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff once again hit the nail on the head. This time he  supplied evidence to the government that Colombian guerrillas  and a bishop attended a secret summit in Cuba in January, which  EL TIEMPO newspaper has been reporting. The prosecutor general  today reported that part of the Guerrilla Coordinating Board  leadership met in Havana, Cuba, with a Colombian bishop.    Although he did not give any names to avoid violating legal  proceedings, it was learned that over the past few hours the  prosecutor visited President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo and Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin. He delivered a document and informed them  about the status of the investigations into a trip to Cuba by  guerrilla leaders Alfonso Cano [Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia, FARC, general staff], Ivan Marquez [FARC], Alberto  Gutierrez Bermudez, and Lionel Pardo.    [Begin recording] [De Greiff] We have evidence that shows  that guerrilla leaders or subversives, whatever you want to call  them, went to Cuba.    [Ayala] Was Monsignor Nel Beltran also there?    [De Greiff] A bishop was there; I cannot say who. [end  recording]    The Colombian Episcopal Conference insists that Bishop Nel  Beltran was not the one in Cuba. However, intelligence  organizations report that the priest traveled to San Jose, Costa  Rica, to attend a religious summit, rested 15 days in the United  States afterwards, and on his way back returned via Cancun,  Mexico, from where he traveled to Havana to attend the meeting  which EL TIEMPO newspaper has reported.

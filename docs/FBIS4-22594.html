			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ravil Muratov, deputy prime minister of the </F> Republic of Tatarstan, by INTERFAX correspondent Guzel  Fazullina, especially for IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA, under the rubric  "Point of View"; place and date not given: "Ravil Muratov:  `Assertions About Prosperity in Tatarstan Are Still Far From the  Truth'"]    [Text] Having signed a package of intergovernmental  agreements with Russia, Tatarstan [lines missing as received]  according a greater degree of economic freedom. However, even  during the two years in which negotiations were underway and the  republic insisted on its "special position, special status," the  leadership had an opportunity to pursue its own economic policy,  which could be somewhat different from that of Russia. How fully  did the government of Tatarstan take advantage of this  opportunity to conduct reforms? Did it not restrict itself to  social programs and support for rural areas from the budget,  failing to provide conditions for transformations in the  agrarian sector?    Ravil Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of  Tatarstan, answers this and other questions in an interview by  an INTERFAX correspondent.    [Fazullina] The advantages of the policy of a "soft" entry  into a market economy, which Tatarstan has opted for, are  obvious. The government has succeeded in somewhat cushioning the  shock of a cataclysmic price liberalization and halting a drop  in production in the agrarian sector. However, both the programs  of targeted social protection and financial infusions for the  rural areas were effected at the expense of the budget and oil  exports. The current nonpayment crisis, the tax burden, and a  decline in world prices for oil call into doubt these  traditional sources of financing for the republic. What lies  ahead for the economy of Tatarstan?    [Muratov] Unfortunately, the government has actually let go  of long-term programs while it has focused its attention on  social programs and supported the rural areas, i.e. it has  fought to survive in an elementary fashion. Independent exports  of oil have indeed helped to somewhat contain a complete  collapse in the economy. However, relative stability is merely a  launching pad for the beginning of reforms, first of all of the  financial and tax systems and in the agrarian sector. We were  among the first to put into circulation bills of exchange that  were to mitigate the nonpayment crisis and the absence of  centralized credit resources. However, the extensive use of  bills of exchange was hampered by banks, primarily the National  Bank: It is more advantageous for it to deal with ringing cash  rather than bills of exchange, and to collect a high percentage  of profits for the Central Bank of Russia. Enterprises did not  receive bills of exchange well, either. We wasted time and an  opportunity. Russian banks are introducing bills of exchange  now; we must say that they are doing far better than we are.    We are beginning to plainly fall behind some regions which  develop their programs. Our enterprises are bogged down in the  quagmire of nonpayments, but they are persistently clinging to  the old pattern for settlements. The government has been forced  to allocate billions from the budget for Nizhnekamskneftekhim  Joint-Stock Company to pay its debts to Tatneft. However, one  enterprise carries on the technological sequence of the other.  It is possible to make arrangements with the oilmen for  settlements after the finished products of petrochemistry are  sold! Alas, each of them prefers to be awash in his own debts.    The government embarks on quite costly social programs,  which  in and of itself is a favorable fact. However, one gets the  impression that we do not quite care about forming real sources  of funding for them, primarily the budget. Who is going to pay  taxes? Enterprises that are indebted to one another?  Entrepreneurs who are smothered by the tax press to such a  degree that it is time to wind down production? Kolkhozes and  sovkhozes that draw subsidies and are unprofitable for the most  part?    We are wasting the time and the opportunity of conducting  reforms with smaller losses. Our rural areas are still  unaffected by transformations. The government continues to  invest billions in the rural areas by supporting unprofitable  farms, whereas it should implement land reform, introduce  private ownership of land, as is laid down in the Constitution,  and transfer it to those who will be able to operate profitably.  However, here [lines missing as received] owner-operated  farming. As a result, meat sold by private traders at markets  costs as much as state meat in the stores. In the future, it is  going to get still worse. Not billions, but rather trillions, of  rubles will be needed in the fall when we have to pay for  finished products. What kind of budget can bear this? We should  encourage those who want to and are capable of managing  efficiently rather than support the bankrupt at the expense of  the taxpayer.    [Fazullina] What stood in the way of the government  developing a program for the support of private business in both  the rural and urban areas? At present, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast  has no more rights and powers than Tatarstan, but it is  precisely its format of agrarian reform that is being proposed  as a model. Governor Boris Nemtsov did not seek special powers  in the conduct of foreign economic operations; nonetheless, the  West is now prepared to invest capital in the economy of the  oblast, including the development of small business....    [Muratov] Perhaps it was our conservatism, deliberation, the  desire to take a close look at Russian reforms and to avoid  mistakes. However, at the same time we allowed our own mistakes  to occur by failing to develop a concept of economic  development. We talked a lot about supporting small- and  medium-size businesses, having failed to take any practical  steps at the same time. As early as one year ago, the need was  obvious to provide conditions and a system of preferences for  the priority development of the business infrastructure--banks,  leasing, marketing, and brokerage companies. At present, many  small- and medium-size banks are on the brink of bankruptcy,  despite the high rates of interest on credit. Can we count on  production developing under such circumstances? Can we expect a  surge of entrepreneurship as we set excessively high taxes? Can  we count on the prompt emergence of a class of medium-size  entrepreneurs if in our republic, merchants and businessmen are  virtually on a par with criminal elements in public  consciousness? The government is not the only one to contribute  its share of conservatism. Alas, our parliament is not  particularly radical either, as it passes a law forbidding the  managers of enterprises to engage in entrepreneurship or  proposes to close down commercial stands. And what about the  primary accumulation of capital?    As far as our independence in foreign economic operations is  concerned, so far it has, unfortunately, existed on paper for  the most part; we are yet to defend real rights. I will give  examples. Recently, exclusive rights to transport and export oil  through the port of Odessa were assigned to the Russian company  Koneks by a directive of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of the  Russian Federation, notwithstanding the fact that agreements  signed with both Russia and Ukraine provide for the free and  unhindered movement of freight, including oil, through the  territories of both countries, and that Tatarstan has the right  to independently engage in foreign economic activities. They are  trying to dictate their terms to us nonetheless.    Export and import duties are established by the Russian  Government. What real guarantees of the repatriation of capital  can we give to foreign investors under the circumstances?  Moreover, even government programs are being frustrated because  of an increase in customs duties; we cannot import  telecommunications equipment.    I would not like to paint an excessively gloomy picture, but  assertions about prosperity in Tatarstan are still far from the  truth, even if our indicators are somewhat better than those of  our neighbors. We should not give in to the illusion of a better  tomorrow if we are virtually standing in place at present. The  treaty has been signed; the agreements have been concluded. At  present, it is very important to take full advantage of the  rights granted to us and to ensure unconditional compliance with  all agreements.</p>

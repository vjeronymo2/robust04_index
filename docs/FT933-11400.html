			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Financial services hold Imasco back in second quarter IMASCO, the Canadian financial services, tobacco and food retailing group in which BAT Industries of the UK has a 40 per cent stake, reports slow second-quarter profits following a reduced contribution from financial services. There was a continued recovery in the US fast-food business and better results from tobacco products and drug stores, but net income for the quarter could only emerge at CDollars 94.8m (USDollars 74m), or 74 cents a share, against CDollars 94.6m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. Net revenues for the quarter were little changed at CDollars 2bn. First-half earnings were CDollars 161.3m, or CDollars 1.24, up 2 per cent from CDollars 158.2m, or CDollars 1.21. Six-month net revenues showed little movement at CDollars 3.9bn. Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman, said the Canada Trust operations maintained a high level of provision in the six months, despite improving credit conditions and a decline in overall non-performing loans. Retail banking results were good but Canadian demand for home mortgages remained soft. Prospects for the current half and 1994 had improved but the financial services unit's contribution to Imasco's 1993 earnings will not match 1992. Imperial Tobacco's share of the domestic cigarette market rose to 66.9 per cent and its share of the export market is being regained. Hardee's Food Systems is controlling costs well, maintaining margins and continuing to recover, said Mr Crawford. The drug store subsidiary maintained growth in a very competitive market. BCE, the telecommunications group which owns 52 per cent of Northern Telecom, plans to sell its fully-owned Case-Hoyt printing unit in the US to Avanti Press, a Miami-based graphic arts company. The price was not disclosed. BCE bought Case-Hoyt as part of a major diversification into commercial printing in 1984. Since then it has divested the other printing units. Case-Hoyt has annual sales of USDollars 60m and is profitable. BCE's non-telecom interests are now confined to property group, BF Realty, and its Montreal Trust financial services unit which has assets in excess of CDollars 50bn.</p>

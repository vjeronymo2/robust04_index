			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three members of a U.S.-based dissident Chinese group left Shanghai after  police accused them of breaking the law, the official New China News Agency  said. It said the three -- Huang Wencheng, a Chinese-American; Huang Han, a  Chinese-Canadian, and Tang Guangzhong, a Chinese student studying in the United  States -- are heading for other countries but did not specify if they have left  China yet. The news agency said the three acknowledged belonging to the New  York-based Chinese Alliance for Democracy, a group -- set up by a former  Chinese citizen in 1983 -- that advocates a democratic revolution in China.  Chinese officials have declared it an illegal, reactionary organization.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CHARGES MAY BE FILED OVER GUARDS AT POLLING PLACES  </P> <P> A U.S. Justice Department attorney investigating the Orange County Republican  Party's 1988 placement of uniformed guards at polling places in Latino  neighborhoods said in a recent letter that "it will be difficult" to bring  criminal charges in the case.  </P> <P> In the first comment about the nearly two-year criminal investigation, U.S.  Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Bruce C. Navarro wrote that federal laws may not  apply because there was no violence involved and that the only laws it has  found regarding voter intimidation say it is illegal to attempt to alter the  outcome of a federal race -- not one for state Assembly.  </P> <P> Navarro, in a response to inquiries by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), added,  however, that there has not been a final determination about whether criminal  charges will be filed.  </P> <P> The case stems from the decision by county Republican Party leaders and the  campaign of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) to hire guards at 20  polling places in predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Santa Ana for the 1988  general election. Some of the guards carried signs written in Spanish that  warned non-citizens that it is illegal to vote.  </P></p>

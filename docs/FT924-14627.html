			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (13): New-found freedom - Profile of Copenhagen Airports THE working files of Mr Niels Boserup, chief executive of Copenhagen Airports, are in boxes scattered across his office. Outside in the corridor is the sound of workmen hammering. Mr Boserup says that the chaos is a good sign. The group's headquarters are being renovated, an indication of his company's new-found freedom to invest as it pleases. Copenhagen Airports, the state-owned group that runs Kastrup and Roskilde airports, has only been a public limited company since October 1990. 'Before then we were a state body, covered by all of the restrictions of a state body,' says Mr Boserup. He explains that the authority's expenditure was put into one account while it drew income from another. If the airports made money, it still had to ask a treasury sub-committee of parliament to spend it. 'The transformation into a public limited company has led to big changes,' he says. 'We can't ask the state for money any more. We have to earn it. The group has used its new opportunities to tighten its ship and rein in expenditure.' The number of employees has been cut by about 4 per cent. The company has stopped using outside electricians to repair the airports' monitor screens, employing instead internal staff who had to be on site anyway, for emergencies. The group's financial performance remains steady, if not glowing. It made DKr169m on a turnover of about DKr1.2bn during its first 15 months to December 31 1991. Mr Boserup expects the profits for the 12 months of 1992 to be greater than last year's 15 months figure, on turnover of about DKr1bn. The group, given its modest profits, faces some formidable capital investment in the near future. Kastrup airport is set for rapid growth, the company believes. At present, it has capacity for 15m passengers and handles about 12m a year. A recent study for the company reckons the airport will be used annually by 18m passengers by the end of the decade. Scandinavian Airlines System, the main airline at Copenhagen, estimates it could reach 20m by then. That is despite a 6.4 per cent fall in numbers last year because of the Gulf war. Passenger growth will be partly driven by worldwide expansion in the use of air travel, argues Mr Peter Hoeland, managing director of SAS Denmark. However, he expects passenger throughput to increase significantly because of political events in the region, in particular the entry of Sweden, Finland and possibly Norway into the EC. This will generate significant traffic through Copenhagen, Scandinavia's main hub. In addition, SAS has already set up regular flights to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Further routes to St Petersburg, Leipzig, Krakow, Kiev and Minsk, either already exist or will be established within a year. 'Europe is moving north and west and Copenhagen is ideally located to become Europe's northern hub,' says Mr Hoeland. Further growth will also be driven by new infrastructure projects. In particular, the completion of motorway and high-speed train networks linking Copenhagen with south Sweden will add 3.5m people to the airport's existing 5m catchment area, says Mr Hoeland. A railway station is planned at Kastrup itself, linking the airport with the high-speed trains to Scandinavia and Germany. A light railway capable or reaching the city centre in seven minutes is also planned. The airport has already embarked on a new DKr500m concourse at pier A, but will need more terminal capacity to meet projected demand. There are two plans on offer, one from SAS, the other from Copenhagen Airports. SAS wants to create a terminal specially designed for SAS that will give the airport and airline significant competitive advantage as a European centre. It plans a DKr8.5bn terminal with a capacity of between 15m and 20m passengers a year. SAS wants the first stage of its terminal to be completed by July 1997, the same date that the railway opens. The only problem is who pays for the building. The airport's balance sheet is incapable of handling the largest single airport investment in Europe. Last year, the company spent only DKr396m on capital investment. Meanwhile, SAS reported pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1992 at only SKr502m on turnover of SKr16bn. Neither SAS nor Copenhagen Airports wants to pay for the project. Mr Boserup is proposing an alternative terminal, for use by all airlines. This terminal, which he describes as modern but more conventional than SAS's plans, would add about 7m passengers a year to existing capacity and would cost about DKr2bn. He says if the SAS terminal is not started during the next year, he will go ahead with the alternative plans. The problem facing Mr Boserup is that an investment of DKr8.5bn would almost certainly cast a shadow over Copenhagen Airports' future; the group is due to be partly privatised. The Danish parliament passed legislation earlier this year to sell 25 per cent of the company on the Danish stock exchange. Mr Boserup says the flotation is unlikely to take place for 18 months, when the company would be able to report three years' results - a requirement of the Danish stock exchange. 'This is a major political challenge,' says Mr Hoeland. 'Although the airport cannot carry such a large project on its balance sheet, there are lots of financial instruments available. In the very near future we will open negotiations with Mr Boserup on possible financial structures on how to implement this project. We will be looking for institutions, such as pension funds, in either Sweden or Denmark, which are prepared to look at a project with a perspective of 20 to 30 years. I have no doubt the terminal will be built.'</p>

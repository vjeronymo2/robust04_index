			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BNA TIKER report: "Statement That the Yugoslav Army Has </F> Been Pushed Back Is Ridiculous"]    [Text] Belgrade (BNA TIKER) -- A statement by Macedonian  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Defense  Minister Vlado Popovski that the Macedonian Army has pushed back  the Yugoslav Army from certain posts within the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] is more of a political statement  intended for the Macedonian public then a serious approach to  the normalization of relations between the two neighboring  countries -- TIKER has learned unofficially at the FRY Defense  Ministry.    The Yugoslav Army border patrols are situated exclusively on  the territory of the FRY and have not on a single occasion  entered Macedonian territory. The same sources claim that the  activities of the Macedonian Armed Forces have been observed in  the vicinity of the border, but the Yugoslav Army will not react  unless the FRY's sovereignty and territory integrity are  endangered.    Yugoslavia and Macedonia do not share a state border but  merely an administrative border. The border problems will be  resolved when a mixed commission goes into the field and marks  the border with stone markers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  in Skopje says.    An UNPROFOR observer team has already been deployed on the  border crossing between the FRY and Macedonia near Kriva Palanka  for 12 days. Some 10 Blue Helmets are monitoring the activity  of the FRY soldiers, UNPROFOR spokesman in Skopje Elizabeth  Baldwin told TIKER. Macedonia has presented its maps to us and  it claims that this is its territory, Elizabeth Baldwin says.  She added that Yugoslavia did not present its maps to UNPROFOR  even though it was requested to do so.</p>

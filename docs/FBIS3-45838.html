Since last year, some lawbreakers in Fujian society have  disguised themselves as armed police officers and policemen and,  under the pretense of performing official duties, have  blackmailed restaurants and dance halls to extort money from  them, detained people under the pretense of checking identity  cards, or have manufactured fake armed police driving licenses  to carry out criminal activities, thus damaging the image of the  armed police among the people.    According to reports, the Fujian Provincial Armed Police  Headquarters has set up special organs to crack down on bogus  armed policemen. It has also sent armed police inspector teams  to the streets to arrest people who wear armed police uniforms  without collar insignias, confiscate their uniforms, and  severely punish those who carry out illegal activities under the  disguise of policemen. In September last year, as two young men  in armed policemen's uniforms wearing caps with a large peak,  but without police insignia, were buying fruit at a stall in  front of Fuzhou Railway Station, they accused the owner of the  stall of blocking the way and demanded fines. Three armed  policemen on patrol approached, exposed the fraud on the spot,  arrested the two young men, and took them to the police station.    Hong Shaohu, head of the Fujian Armed Police Headquarters,  said that work to crack down on bogus armed policemen would  continue for a long time to come.</p>

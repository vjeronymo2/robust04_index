			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Lonely seas and the sky: Charles Batchelor samples life aboard a coastal tanker It is a calm evening and Agility, a small coastal tanker, is barely a mile out of the shelter of Milford Haven. Out of the lee of the land, the bow dips suddenly into the waves and the deck of the 3,100 tonne vessel is awash. Agility is far too neat a ship to be compared with that 'dirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack'. But John Masefield's poem comes to mind as we butt into the rising Atlantic swell off the south-west coast of Wales. Agility is one of a fleet of 28 coasters - tankers and dry bulk carriers - owned or managed by family shipping company FT Everard &amp; Sons. It normally carries oil cargoes up and down the east coast of England but for the past week or so she has been brought over to the west coast of Wales because her sister ship, Alacrity, is laid up for repairs. Tying up in Milford Haven at 5.30am on a Monday morning Captain Keith Reading had hoped to start loading his cargo of 1,700 tonnes of gas oil and kerosene immediately. But a fault with the pump which injects a liquid dye into the kerosene - required by Customs &amp; Excise to show the product is duty-free - has delayed the start of operations. In the old days a Customs officer would have poured a bucket of the dye into the tank and relied on the motion of the ship to mix it in. But the requirements are now much stiffer and the pump must be repaired. It is not until 11.30am that loading can start. The whole of a sunlit day then passes with the first mate tending his pumps and checking a bank of dials to ensure that all goes according to plan. Twenty years ago a vessel the size of Alacrity would have had a crew of 15. But intense competition in the shipping industry has forced owners to reduce manning levels, employ foreign crews and register their vessels with flags of convenience. Captain Reading has just seven men under his command though Everard ships still employ British crews and fly the red ensign. With luxuries such as stewards and galley boys ancient history, deck duties have to be shared and juggling the watches is a constant problem. But the smallness of the crew makes for greater informality and the officers and crew now mess together. Across the bay, the town of Milford Haven is visible. But tankers are not welcome close to other human activities in most ports and Agility is moored at the end of a half-mile long jetty. 'It's a lonely life,' says Reading. 'We don't get off a great deal.' Any idea that the entire crew spends nights out carousing on the town is soon dispelled. Ports such as Ipswich and Poole, where even oil tankers can tie up close to the town, are a welcome relief from bleaker oil terminals, such as Teesport or Peterhead, where a convivial evening out can be a Pounds 12 taxi ride away. The isolation of the crews from conventional shore life is increased by the pattern of their tours of duty. Everard crews spend 10 weeks on and five weeks off. 'It doesn't get any better with time,' says Reading, 47, who has a wife and two children at home in Epsom, Surrey. 'It takes longer to get into home life and it is more difficult to leave at the end. It's an anti-social existence.' So why do people go to sea? Reading says his father put him down for sea training school and it seemed natural to join the merchant navy. He obtained his master's ticket at the early age of 26 and went on to work for many of the well-known names of British shipping, such as Rowbotham and North British Shipping. 'I was a master very young, earning a lot of money,' says Reading. 'It has given me a reasonable life style.' Reading has spent nearly a quarter of a century at sea but 20-year-old Nigel McKinstrey, the trainee on Agility, is at the start of his career. McKinstrey has spent the past two years at sea and in February takes the exams which, he hopes, will gain him his second mate's ticket. He, too, compares favourably the money he can earn at sea with what he could get ashore. McKinstrey says he is happy to work on coasters and is not attracted to deep sea routes. But the lure of exotic destinations is often a cause of rapid crew turnover on the coastal trades. 'I keep losing second mates, mostly for the deep sea,' says Reading. On this trip, Agility's destination is Belfast, a steady 20 hours' sailing at a speed of 11 1/2 knots (13mph). As darkness falls, the ship's radar picks up several ships heading into Milford Haven. Built in 1990 at the Lowestoft yard of Richards (Shipbuilders), Agility has self-steering gear which takes account of currents and the wind and means that much of the voyage can be completed on an automatic setting. Captain Reading makes adjustments to the course by means of a hand-held device no larger than the remote control handset you use to change channels on a TV set. The closest the Agility comes to a traditional ships 'wheel' is a small metal fold-away helm which can be used in emergencies. Reading settles down to the first watch which will take the Agility round the south-west tip of Wales and up into the calmer waters of the Irish Sea. The regular noises of the sea and ship's engines are broken every few minutes by the warning tone of the 'dead man's handle'. This will sound an alarm in the crew's quarters if the helmsman does not respond by pressing a button. First light reveals a calm sea and a low-lying mist which soon burns off. The tomato plants which Captain Reading is growing on his bridge appear set to enjoy another day in the sun. Agility is out of sight of land but away to the east is Anglesey while to our west are the Wicklow Mountains. At quiet times like this there is usually at least one member of the crew engaged in the permanent task of painting the vessel. The corrosive effects of the sea and the wind can only be combated by constant activity with the paint brush. The breaks in the crew's duties are filled with television, videos and reading. The port agent is their regular source of contact with land, bringing on mail and the day's newspapers. The men spend their spare time either in the small dining cum recreation room or in their surprisingly roomy cabins. As Agility steams north she threads between fleets of fishing vessels while her bows provide a resting place for the occasional passing seagull. Away to port the Irish coastline emerges from the haze and as the afternoon wears on we near our destination. As we head into Belfast Lough, Reading radios for a pilot to come on board. Masters can gain 'exemptions', meaning they can dispense with a pilot, saving fees of Pounds 1,000 and more, when they are regular visitors to a port. Reading has kept up his exemption for Milford Haven but it has lapsed for Belfast. As we enter the line of buoys leading into the harbour the pilot cutter rushes up and the pilot steps aboard. Under his guidance we continue down the dredged channel, squeezing past a grimy Polish tanker 10 times our size. It is 5pm by the time we finally tie up at the small oil terminal and the main engine is switched off. The first mate assembles the crew and a cluster of shore hands to start pumping our cargo ashore. A steady 12 hours work lie ahead before Agility's tanks have been pumped dry and cleaned. By morning she will be ready to set sail again.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Engineering dealmakers return to the market - Next month's flotation of Quadramatic and the plans for its expansion TWO OF the most active dealmakers in the UK engineering sector during the last decade are bringing another company to the stock market. Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley are part of a team which is floating Quadramatic, a coin-handling and optical group with a market value of about Pounds 45m. The intention is to expand the quoted vehicle by acquiring high-margin engineering companies with good international opportunities. Both men had a roller-coaster ride during the eighties with FKI, the electrical engineering group which expanded rapidly by turning round loss-making companies. However, the Pounds 415m acquisition of Babcock International a few weeks before the 1987 crash proved a deal too far, and the groups were demerged two years later. Mr Whalley is still chairman of FKI, which is responding to a refocusing strategy, and is both deputy chairman and acting chief executive at Babcock International, the engineering contractor which is also involved in substantial reorganisation. Mr Gartland has since 1991 been concentrating on the venture capital business set up with Mr Whalley in 1989. This business, Gartland and Whalley Securities, brought together the group which is to be floated. Quadramatic comprises Coin Controls International, Oldham-based maker of coin-handling equipment, and Combined Optical Industries a Slough company moulding plastic optical products. Gartland and Whalley Securities, supported by banks, bought Coin in March for Pounds 20m cash, so no time has been lost in coming to the market. Combined Optical was purchased in 1990 for Pounds 929,000 from Pilkington, the glass group. Mr Gartland, chairman of Quadramatic, said the group was being floated speedily because it wanted to pay off bankers and take advantage of the current opportunities to buy companies. He said: 'Most public companies are still coming out of recession, so their main priority is to rebuild their damaged balance sheets, rather than make acquisitions.' He was 'not planning an FKI, Mark 2' - partly because he believed there were now far fewer bad managements sitting on good companies. 'Instead, we intend to buy good businesses that we believe should be exceptional businesses.' Mr Richard Williams, chief executive of Quadramatic, has been managing director of Coin since 1991. He recalls joining a good company that was profitable, but sleepy: 'The first time I sat in on a quality assessment meeting, I found there was no-one there from manufacturing]' Mr Mike Bell, appointed Coin's manufacturing director, has reorganised production on a cell basis, and the 370 employees have responded to the challenge of being directly involved in improving production methods, delivery times and stock control. The company supplies coin-handling and validation equipment to makers of leisure and gaming equipment, vending machines and telecommunication and transport organisations. It also has a manufacturing plant in Chicago and makes 68 per cent of sales outside the UK, supplying both mechanical mechanisms and the latest electronic units, which use micro-chip technology to validate coins. Coin's equipment can be set to accept currencies from all over the world, and the group's library has thousands of specimens from 120 countries. In spite of the strong overseas exposure, Mr Gartland believes there is still considerable scope for expansion, since the group makes no sales to either Japan or Korea, which together account for about 25-30 per cent of the world market. Coin's electronic validation machinery is in demand for potentially high-fraud locations, such as motorway service stations in the UK or close to international borders, where people try to use the wrong currency. 'We love it: the more they try to defraud, the higher the specification becomes', Mr Williams said. The company has sharply cut lead times and takes prides in responding quickly to the market. Customers can prove fickle; one asked it to quieten the pay-out mechanism of pub gaming machines, then quickly sought the change to be reversed after punters reacted badly to not having noisy confirmation of their jackpots. From making operating profits of Pounds 1.78m on turnover of Pounds 15m in 1991, Coin this year expects Pounds 4m on sales of Pounds 19m-Pounds 20m. This means it enjoys profit margins well above the industry average - a feature Mr Gartmore wants to be common to all Quadramatic companies. The chairman hopes that further improvements can be extracted from Combined Optical, which makes hand-held magnifiers for Boots, and other products featuring plastic lenses, visors and windows. Comnbined Optical was making a small loss on sales of Pounds 4.8m when acquired in 1990, but in the year to March made operating profits of nearly Pounds 600,000 on turnover of Pounds 6m. Mr Bob Roote, managing director, said his company's expertise in casting plastic on to steel moulds, without distortion, allowed it to charge premium prices. A competitor's full-face visor costs only Pounds 1.30 but distorts vision. For a distortion-free visor, Combined Optical can charge Pounds 4 - much more, but still a marginal part of the cost of a firefighter's protection outfit. A significant element of Quadramatic's expansion strategy is the excess space at Coin's Oldham factory, one of the many converted cotton mills in the area. After the reorganisation of production, Mr Bell believes the present factory could easily treble level output. Mr Gartland said this spare capacity would make acquisitions extremely attractive, as extra output could be obtained for relatively modest levels of capital expenditure. Quadramatic's pathfinder prospectus should be published in the next two weeks, with the flotation in July. A placing and financial intermediaries offer will raise Pounds 20m of new money, of which Pounds 5m will be open to retail investors, and leave the company ungeared. Mr Gartland will ask the market to fund future acquisitions, which would have to be earnings-enhancing 'within a very short period'. He believes Quadramatic's management could handle a much bigger business and would like to expand at 20 per cent per annum - half organically and half by acquisitions.</p>

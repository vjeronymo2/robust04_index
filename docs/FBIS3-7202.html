According to the Chicago Branch of the Korea Trade Promotion  Corporation (Kotra), Yim Yong-kun, a member of the Oregon State  Senate and chairman of the Korean-American Federation, has taken  the initiative in forming the delegation.    So far, Yim has contacted Korean-American leaders in 30  major  U.S. cities to consult on the date, the size of the delegation  and ways to get in touch with Pyongyang, Kotra officials quoted  its office in Chicago as saying.    Yim hopes to form a delegation of about 20 persons,  including  a number of prominent businessmen, that would discuss not only  political issues but economic cooperation with the North Korean  Government, the officials said.    But if the visit came about, the delegation would likely go  to Pyongyang as a group of American politicians and not at North  Korea's official invitation, they said.    Yim, who was elected to the Oregon State Senate in November  1992, has previously visited North Korea at Pyongyang's  invitation.    Prior to the visit, he invited about 300 ethnic Koreans from  the former Soviet Union and China to Washington in 1989 for a  meeting of Koreans from around the world.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Strong yen forces Sega to shift output to SE Asia Sega Enterprises, the Japanese video game manufacturer and creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, cited continuing strength of the yen as the reason for shifting production of hardware for its next-generation video-game to south-east Asia, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company said it would move the manufacturing base of its 32-bit game machines to Taiwan and other countries in the region next year. The products are currently being manufactured in Japan by a subsidiary of Hitachi, the Japanese electronics concern, on behalf of Sega. Sega officials said it was difficult to make profits at a dollar/yen rate below Y100. The company's foreign-exchange losses for sales in the US totalled Y1.1bn (Dollars 10m)in the first half to September. However, the company said it was seeing strong sales of its new 32-bit game hardware and it was possible that manufacturing in the south-east Asian region would be expanded.</p>

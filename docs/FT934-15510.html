			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Italy rallies to Delors call to close EC ranks THE Italian government has thrown its full weight behind the plans of Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, for a political initiative to renew the impetus for closer European integration. This emerged in Rome yesterday after talks between Mr Delors and Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister. Mr Delors said that without a political initiative or 'at least a politico-economic' initiative the EC risked becoming little more than a free trade area 'without a soul or common purpose'. Mr Ciampi told a joint news conference he was considering proposals to relaunch the EC via a declaration by the six original signatories to the 1958 Treaty of Rome. Spain, he said, would also be invited to participate since the Gonzalez government had given a clear demonstration of its commitment to the European ideal. It was unclear how far Mr Delors supported Mr Ciampi's idea. Mr Ciampi for his part has let it be known Italy is keen to play an active part at the forthcoming EC summit. The proposal to return to the core signatories of the Rome treaty, plus Spain, appears a formula whereby Italy reiterates its belief in the aims of the Maastricht treaty - even if it is unlikely to be able to satisfy the convergence criteria essential for monetary union. This shifts the emphasis away from a two-tier Community based on the ability to comply with convergence criteria and concentrates on those countries, like the UK, whose political support remain ambiguous. Mr Ciampi is a convinced European and yesterday made clear he had no qualms about renouncing national sovereignty in moving closer towards closer European integration. Although the lira continues to float outside the exchange rate mechanism, he endorses monetary union and has frequently said the mistake had been to move too slowly towards this goal. During his brief period in office he has sought to improve relations with Brussels and alter Italy's reputation as a partner that talks loudly of the European ideal yet fails to implement EC regulations. Italy's industry minister, Mr Paolo Savona, has withdrawn his surprise resignation at the weekend which was provoked by a row over privatisation plans for state industries, Reuter reports, quoting national television. Mr Ciampi had earlier urged him to reconsider his decision. The prime minister's spokesman said Mr Savona had expressed satisfaction with the contents of a letter from Mr Ciampi and had decided to change his mind.

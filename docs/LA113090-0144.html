			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RATIONING OF FOOD SENDS CHILL THROUGH LENINGRAD;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: MANY ARE HAUNTED BY THE CITY'S WARTIME DEPRIVATION. WESTERN AID  IS ANTICIPATED.  </P> <P> Shopping for groceries lately, elderly residents here say, recalls the hungry  days of World War II when hundreds of thousands of Leningraders starved to  death as the Nazis blockaded the city.  </P> <P> For the first time since rationing of food was suspended in 1947, Leningraders  will have to produce coupons to buy food at state-subsidized prices starting  Saturday.  </P> <P> "I believe the situation is worse now than after the war," said Dalya V.  Kudryavtsyeva, 65, a retired teacher. "I've lived through rationing twice in my  life -- during World War II and immediately afterward -- and we did not go  hungry.  </P> <P> "But this time, I have no faith that rationing will work."  </P> <P> Across the Soviet Union, consumers have stopped believing that the  state-controlled economy can feed them and now fear they will go hungry because  fledgling private industry is not developed enough to replace it.  </P> <P> In a speech televised this week, First Deputy Prime Minister Lev A. Voronin  blamed the country's food shortages on hoarding and a breakdown in the  distribution system. Food-processing factories and local politicians in  countless areas of the country are simply refusing to meet agreements to supply  food to other areas, but the amount of food produced has not decreased, Voronin  said.  </P> <P> For people like Kudryavtsyeva, that means leaving the local grocery store  empty-handed because the only food for sale may be something as unpalatable as  canned seaweed.  </P> <P> In Kudryavtsyeva's store, the monthly supplies of butter and cheese are sold  out in one day. Sausage, which is delivered to the store on most days, is  always gone within 15 minutes, sales clerk Galina I. Shtatnova, 45, said while  standing idly behind a wall of canned seaweed.  </P> <P> Customers, who seem to have a sixth sense about when the store has received a  shipment, line up outside at 6 a.m., waiting for three hours until the doors  open at 9, for staples such as cheese and sour cream.  </P> <P> "I've worked here for 29 years, and I can easily say our supply has never been  as bad as it is now," Shtatnova said. "Ration coupons aren't worth anything if  they cannot be backed with goods."  </P> <P> Even the Leningrad city councilwoman in charge of the rationing program says  food supplies are declining so rapidly that Leningraders may not even be able  to buy the modest amount allotted each person.  </P> <P> The coupons will provide three pounds of beef, two pounds of sausage, 10 eggs,  a pound of flour, two pounds of cereal, half a pound of oil and a pound of  butter per person each month. Sugar and alcohol are already rationed.  </P> <P> "We guarantee that much will be available the first month," said Marina Y.  Salye, chairwoman of the Leningrad council's Food Commission. "But I'm afraid  there may not be a reason to print the ration cards for the second month,  because we may not have the food to back them up."  </P> <P> Under the program, buying food without coupons will cost two or three times the  price with coupons, according to Leningrad Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak.  </P> <P> Salye said the food shortages are aggravated by a strong "Mafia" that controls  the distribution of food and is backed by conservative politicians who do not  want to give up power. They are allegedly trying to sabotage the food supply to  discredit Mayor Sobchak and the City Council, which is dominated by  progressives and radicals.  </P> <P> "It's in the interest of the conservatives that the situation be bad,  especially in Moscow and Leningrad, to show that the democrats are not capable  of running the cities," charged Salye, a leader in Leningrad's radical  movement.  </P> <P> Food supplies in those two cities, the country's most populous and both of  which have progressive-dominated city councils and non-Communist mayors, have  suffered because other parts of the Soviet Union have reneged on contracts.  Instead of abiding by agreements to ship food at the state price, they seek  buyers willing to pay more or to trade scarce goods in exchange.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Deputy Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich complained this week that he  believes that an attempt is under way to destroy the Moscow city government,  because nine regions of Russia that have supplied milk to the capital decided  simultaneously to stop deliveries.  </P> <P> Moscow's City Council is also considering emergency measures. One would be the  distribution of "Moscow money" to residents to enable them to buy goods at low  prices, Stankevich said. The same goods would also be available at much higher  prices without the special currency.  </P> <P> Reneging on supply agreements is becoming so widespread -- as Soviet republics,  cities and regions all try to exercise their autonomy -- that politicians in  Leningrad and Moscow have decided that the only way to feed their people is to  seek aid abroad.  </P> <P> "We have decided to solve Leningrad's problem by appealing to the West, not to  other areas of the Soviet Union," Mayor Sobchak said. "Because of the battle  for sovereignty going on here, everyone has become too egotistical to meet  their agreements with other parts of the country."  </P> <P> Sobchak said he expects that provisions from United States, Germany, Sweden and  other Western countries will prevent famine in his city. Germany has already  sent a container ship loaded with food to Leningrad.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the first planeload of food from German charities arrived in  Moscow, destined for children's hospitals and orphanages in the capital.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made big pitches for foreign food aid  on recent trips abroad.  </P> <P> Germany has responded overwhelmingly, planning to donate some of the massive  reserves stockpiled during the Cold War in case of a repeat of the 1948-1949  Soviet blockade of West Berlin. Individual Germans are also generously giving  money in a charity drive to avert hunger in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> During a nationwide telethon Wednesday, which reportedly raised $2 million in  40 minutes, German viewers saw footage of long lines and empty stores in  Leningrad, the city Nazi soldiers unsuccessfully tried to starve into  surrendering in a wartime siege that lasted almost 900 days.  </P> <P> Although Leningraders may have to tighten their belts this winter, they will  not starve, Salye maintained, because many people have been hoarding food for  months and supplies are available at much higher, non-subsidized prices at  peasant markets.  </P> <P> "Every other person has stored up enough food at home to survive the winter --  I'm sure of this," she said.  </P> <P> Conversations with dozens of Leningraders backed up Salye's assertion.  </P> <P> "Of course, I have stored away lots of provisions -- macaroni, potatoes, jams,  pickled cabbage, peas, meat -- everything," said Tatyana A. Kluyeva, 42, a  secretary. "My 78-year-old mother predicted this would happen, so I started  stocking up last spring. I'm not worried about going hungry this winter."  </P> <P> But those Leningraders who have no food reserves and cannot afford the prices  at the peasant markets are panicking.  </P> <P> "We're afraid that the amount of food rationed will not be enough to live on,"  Marina S. Ivanova, 21, a finance and economics student, said while standing in  a 90-minute line for cheese.  </P> <P> "People with low incomes, like students and pensioners, will not be able to  afford the higher prices" they will have to pay for food without coupons, added  Ivanova, who lives on a meager monthly stipend of 60 rubles, or about $100 at  the artificially inflated official exchange rate.  </P> <P> But some Leningraders do not worry about feeding their families, and  22-year-old Vasily, who drives a grocery truck, is one of them. "We don't have  any problem getting food," Vasily said proudly as he walked down the street  with his wife, who was pushing a baby carriage.  </P> <P> "I would say more than half the food I carry is gone before it reaches the  grocery counter," added Vasily, who asked that his last name not be printed.  "Sometimes all of it disappears, depending on what it is."  </P> <P> GORBACHEV TELLS GUILT: Leader takes blame, vows to alleviate food crisis. A6  </P></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: In search of some simple common sense - William Packer reviews the work of the four contenders for the Turner Prize Hot on the heels of the inaugural Jerwood Prize, which set itself to work a field which the Turner has long left assiduously uncultivated - current British painting - the Turner Prize itself comes round again. There was nothing wrong with the Jerwood that the simple application of some common sense could not have remedied, or should not get right next time. But that exactly has been the case with the Turner Prize these many years. Is common sense still so rare a commodity? With a representative display of the work of the four artists short-listed for this year's prize now on view at the Tate - the winner will be announced, and the spondulicks, all Pounds 20,000 of them, dished out at the party on November 22 - we have our annual chance to see for ourselves. Has anything changed? The age-limit of 50 remains, which prevents the Turner from ever being an award of truly national standing and consequent international prestige. Yet something of that order was always intended and is still claimed. The test should surely rest on how artists stand with artists of any age. If a young artist then wins, the better for him. As to the range this short-list covers, the now usual four is a narrow number, and the representation no less narrow and predictable within its avant-garde orthodoxy. There are two sculptors, one painter and one video-maker: plus ca change . . . The painter is Peter Doig (35), and a landscape painter at that, but he is no pillar of the Royal Academy. His inclusion is not to be justified simply by what might be done sitting in a field and painting the trees. Rather it must be set out in terms of 'changing perceptions of reality', 'tension between representative or narrative content . . . and purely visual, decorative and abstract qualities', 'banal sources', 'imaginative triggers' or 'fertile interplay'. The paintings themselves, innocuous enough, are conventionally large, their imagery freely reworked upon photographic sources into atmospheric and expressionist evocations of winter lakes and forests and, latterly, Corbusier blocks of flats. Sculptors have dominated the Turner lists for many years, supplying the last six winners out of nine. Here are two more. Antony Gormley (44) shows his now familiar featureless figures, cast in grotesque and repetitive simplicity from his own body and disposed in bizarre postures about the room and ceiling. 'My body', he says, 'is the channel through which all impressions of the world come, and I want to use it to carry feeling back into the world.' The exhibition booklet goes on to tell us, just a shade ponderously, that his work 'meditates on the relationship between our spiritual and physical selves.' Shirazeh Houshiary (39) was born in Persia, and her work has always been 'informed by Sufi poetry and ancient writings from East and West on . . . mathematics, philosophy, religion, art and astronomy.' She has moved away in recent years from the organic reference of her earlier abstracted forms and vessels, and is now showing a work comprised of metal boxes, 'The Enclosure of Sanctity', that variously represents the planets. Each box has a structured and segmented interior, established upon 'grids corresponding to numbers with which each planet is identified.' Some are richly decorated, some are not. 'Through studying these cubes', she says, 'we can realise the multiplicity of the state of existence.' She is also showing a group of minimalist canvases that are inscribed with delicately calligraphic images. Which leaves the radical or conceptual slot to Willie Doherty (35), who works with photography and video and comes from Derry. His work here, 'The Only Good One is a Dead One', consists of two videotapes, one a long static shot of a street corner at night, the other of an endless drive at night through country lanes with only the pool of light visible ahead. It is accompanied by a ironical monologue, as though the driver were both gunman and target reflecting upon the inevitability of violent death. It is a polemical, narrative piece, born of close personal experience of the Troubles, and effective enough within its own terms. Yet is it the form or only the content that gives such work its force? 'In all his work', says the booklet, 'he attempts with moving clarity and honesty to convey the complexities of the situation.' These, then, are the runners in what is more open and equal a race than usual. Gormley must be the clear favourite, Doig in with a good chance and Doherty and Miss Houshiary the outsiders, with Doherty the better each-way bet. For my money? Well, it stays in my pocket.

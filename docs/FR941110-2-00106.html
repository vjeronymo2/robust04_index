Applicants are also seeking exemption from regulation under 49 U.S.C. 10505 for the merged holding company and merged railroad to control The Wichita Union Terminal Railway Company (WUTR) [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1)] and for eleven construction projects related to the primary application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 2 through Sub-No. 12)]. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  We are accepting for consideration the control and merger application filed in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Under 49 CFR 1180.4(c)(2)(vi), all directly related applications, petitions, and notices of exemption must be filed concurrently with the primary control and merger application. We note that there are two pending proceedings that may be related to the proposed merger. The question is whether these proceedings are directly related to the merger within the meaning of 49 CFR 1180.4(c)(2)(vi).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first proceeding is Docket No. AB&hyph;423 (Sub-No. 1X), which involves a petition for exemption to discontinue the lease and operation of a rail yard in Houston filed by the Houston Belt &amp; Terminal Railway Company (HBT). Although HBT is not an applicant carrier in the merger proceeding, BN has a 24% interest and Santa Fe has a 25% interest in HBT.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  the waiver decision in Finance Docket No. 32549, Decision No. 3, served Oct. 4, 1994. The petition in Docket No. AB&hyph;423 (Sub-No. 1X) was filed on July 8, 1994, which was the same day that applicants filed their notice of intent to file the merger application in Finance Docket No. 32549. A separate decision is being issued in Docket No. AB&hyph;423 (Sub-No. 1X) directing petitioner to clarify the relationship, if any, between the subject matter of the petition for exemption and the merger transaction in Finance Docket No. 32549.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second proceeding is Finance Docket No. 32593, which is a notice of a corporate family reorganization filed by Santa Fe under the class exemption procedures at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). The reorganization involves the purchase by Santa Fe of all of the real estate and improvements now owned by four of its subsidiary railroads. According to the notice filed by Santa Fe, the purpose of the reorganization is to concentrate Santa Fe's railroad real estate holdings in a single corporation and to reduce administrative expenses. There is no mention of the proposed merger application which was filed 10 days after the filing of the notice in Finance Docket No. 32593. Notice of the transaction in Finance Docket No. 32593 will be published separately in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . Santa Fe is directed in that proceeding to explain the relationship, if any, between the corporate family reorganization in Finance Docket No. 32593 and the proposed merger in Finance Docket No. 32549. Comments from other parties on Santa Fe's corporate family reorganization (including any comments alleging that the reorganization is directly related to the application in Finance Docket No. 32549) should be addressed in Finance Docket No. 32593.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Platinum closed easier on the London bullion market yesterday. South Africa's Impala said it had to acquire 70,000 ounces of platinum to meet supply commitments in the second half of 1991, but the company refused to be drawn on market talk of more recent offtake. Impala, the world's second biggest producer, experienced a shortfall of 150,000 ounces in the six months to December 31; labour difficulties caused an irrecoverable loss of 100,000 ounces of platinum. The figures were close to analysts estimates. Reaction on Nymex was expected to be muted in late trading by Tokyo's holiday closure today. Tin prices closed on the LME at the highest level since last September as demand for high quality metal increased and Brazilian supplies slowed. High-purity Brazilian brands now command premiums over LME of some Dollars 100 a tonne against Dollars 60 last week. Delays to shipments of Brazilian metal, as well as vessels carrying Malaysian tin have contributed to the tightness. Trade buying and short covering underpinned the market. The constructive close suggests a move towards Dollars 5,800 a tonne, technical traders said. In Chicago soyabeans were higher at midday on optimism over sales to the former Soviet Union.

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Restructuring depresses Esselte ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported a loss of SKr416m (Dollars 70.15m) for 1991 due to large restructuring costs. However, the company, which had a 1990 profit of SKr145m, said it would maintain its dividend of SKr5.25 in the expectation that earnings would improve this year due to lower costs resulting from its rationalisation programme. Esselte said it made a profit after financial items of SKr142m before deducting the one-time operating costs of SKr558m. The company has undertaken the extensive restructuring programme in response to weakening demand. Sales last year fell by 3 per cent to SKr15.6bn. Esselte has sold its media operations, including Filmnet, the pay TV channel, to concentrate on its core business of office equipment. It is also reducing its labour force by 2,950 to around 15,500 workers. Mr Bo Lindquist, president, said yesterday that the company may be divided in two to further improve performance. One unit would consist of the international manufacturing and marketing operations. The other would concentrate on the Nordic region where Esselte conducts more wide-ranging activities, including providing electronic office equipment and information services as well as owning a network of specialist retail outlets. A decision on the possible split of the company will be discussed at the annual meeting in June, when restrictions on foreign shareholdings in the company are also expected to be removed.</p>

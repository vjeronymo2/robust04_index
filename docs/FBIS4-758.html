			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with President Abdou Diouf by </F> Marie-Pierre Subtil; place and date not given: "President Diouf  Wants Imprisoned Opponents To Be Tried `as Soon as Possible'"]    [Text] Senegalese President Abdou Diouf ended his official  visit to Paris on Tuesday, 12 April, by chairing a meeting of  the World Bank on onchocerciasis (river blindness). His  meetings during this week's visit have been dominated by the  consequences of the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial  Community] franc.    The Senegalese president told LE MONDE that, in his meetings  with French officials, he had "above all stressed the problem  faced by companies based in Senegal, both French and Senegalese,  which cannot bear sole responsibility for the economic  recovery." "We also spoke at length about the cost of  medicines, which should remain at predevaluation price levels."    Discussions also focused on the fate of the parliamentarians  imprisoned two days after the 16 February riots. At a Foreign  Ministry dinner on Monday, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated:  "We hope that the trials will be concluded rapidly and that, as  a result, the political climate will again return to normal."  In reply, Mr. Diouf said: "I, too, want this to be the case,  but I am a head of state who respects the Constitution, and this  Constitution has separated the powers. I would therefore not  give orders to the Justice Ministry. However, it would be good  if justice could take its course very rapidly, as rapidly as  possible."    As for the cases of Mody Sy, a deputy of the Senegal  Democratic Party (PDS), and Samuel Sarr, a member of the same  party, who have been in prison for almost a year, the president  said that a decision would be made soon: "I believe that the  Justice Ministry is currently putting the finishing touches to  their cases." Asked whether a trial would be held in the next  few weeks, he replied: "I think so, yes, according to my  sources, but again I refuse to get involved in the business of  the Justice Ministry."    The demonstrations of 16 February which led to eight people  being killed, including six police officers, were mostly put  down to a Muslim youth movement, the Moustarchidines, which was  banned in the aftermath of the riots. Mr. Diouf was asked if  the rise of this movement reflected a rise in religious  fundamentalism: "What occurred on 16 February must force us to  be more careful and extremely vigilant." Has the involvement of  the Moustarchidines movement in the violence of 16 February been  proven? The head of state replied: "I do not have access to  the judicial files, but my sources tell me that this was the  case, and that they assembled people from all over Senegal."    In addition, Mr. Diouf informed us that talks with the  Casamance separatists had not been broken off, despite the  cessation of hostilities: "We are still talking, but not on the  public stage. We remain in contact with all the protagonists."  He admitted that "after the intervention of France, things have  calmed down considerably." (At the request of the separatists,  Paris had arbitrated on the region, the conclusions of which had  been generally favorable to Dakar)    Asked if the Senegalese head of state regarded himself as  the  new leader of the region, as some people had wished after the  death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, he replied: "I have  no leadership ambitions. My only ambition is to govern Senegal  wisely, of course in a framework of African and world  solidarity, without worrying about leadership."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri </F> with domestic and foreign reporters in Tehran on 24 May --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Unidentified REUTER  correspondent] Mr. Nateq, please tell us about the reports,  which were also reflected in our Iranian newspapers, that  high-ranking officials from the U.S. Government contacted Iran  on the possibility of ascertaining common interests between Iran  and the United States and about the importance of Iran's  strategic role for the United States. Please tell us if such a  thing happened or not.    [Nateq-Nuri] No, I have no news of any high-level contacts  between Iran and the United States. Essentially the eminent  leader has closed the door to contacts, negotiations, or  relations with the Americans and he has graciously said that  that path is a dead end. No one can do anything without his  permission and that has not taken place. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified KEYHAN correspondent] In the name of God, the  compassionate, the merciful. Mr. Nateq-Nuri, King Fahd has  called for the handover of the Iranian islands to the United  Arab Emirates [UAE] in a message on the occasion of the 'Id  al-Adha. Although our country's authorities have expressly  stated their view on the issue on numerous occasions we would  like to know your views on this and King Fahd's new statements.  [passage omitted]    [Nateq-Nuri] This is the issue: Regarding the islands -- the  three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tonbs --  there is no problem at all regarding the Greater and Lesser Tonb  Islands. Recently, when the Abu Musa issue was raised, our  neighbors prefer to raise the issue of the three islands  together now. We wonder what incident in recent years has  caused our neighbors to think of that issue. We have an  agreement from 1971 which was accepted by the ruler of  al-Shariqah at that time on al-Shariqah television and confirmed  by him. The agreement, I should say was about Abu Musa. The  issue mainly concerned Abu Musa. Now they say one issue is not  enough and they have added the other two to it as well,  otherwise it would not amount to much. We have an agreement  according to which Iran is there as well as al-Shariqah. There  are some Arabs from al-Shariqah living there. We have acted  according to that agreement up to now and we are still acting on  it. Nothing new has happened. We have always said that an  incident did occur. We saw a spy near there and apprehended him  -- in the past two or three years -- then we enhanced the  security factor there. Someone comes from the other end of the  world in a boat, having put ammunition in hidden compartments in  the boat, and begins sailing around Abu Musa, and when he is  apprehended he says he came here to fish. Now what thinking  person would accept that someone should come fishing with  ammunition in the boat?    Well, we enhanced the security factor and as soon as we did  that our neighbors' sensitivity was increased and they raised  the issues of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tonbs. We have  told them up to now, and truly believe, that the issue must be  between us and the UAE. There is no problem. We have been and  still are ready for negotiation. We sent delegations there.  They should have come but they didn't. I did tell the Kuwaiti  brothers who came here, the Qatari brothers who came here, that  your problem is that when an issue arises in the region you fail  to research it before making a decision on it. Because of the  mere fact that one side is Arab and the other non-Arab, you  convene the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and your Arab  prejudice blossoms. [passage omitted]    [ASAI correspondent, in English, followed by Persian  translation] Mr. Speaker, I am a Japanese news correspondent.  I have one question: relationship between Iran and Egypt.  Foreign Minister Velayati will go soon to Cairo for NAM  [Nonaligned Movement] meeting. Dr. Velayati will meet with  Egyptian counterpart in that time for talking resuming two  countries' relationship. Can we expect two countries will make  good relationship in near future?    [Nateq-Nuri] We pay much attention to the NAM and regard it  as valuable. Because we consider the NAM important we consider  our presence there to be useful and effective. We consider the  strengthening of the NAM to be a principle. The more it becomes  strengthened the more its members will benefit. Therefore we  believe participation in the session -- even though it is in  Egypt -- to be appropriate, as you have pointed out. There is  nothing to prevent the honorable foreign minister from seeking  to talk with his counterparts or others on the sidelines of the  gathering. But as to what the results of those discussions will  be, perforce we must wait until he goes there and has those  talks on the sidelines. He will then bring back his report to  Iran so that we can see what we must do on the basis of that.    [Unidentified foreign correspondent] [passage omitted] There  has been much talk about Iran's foreign debts in recent months.  It has been a very hot topic. I would like to ask the  president...[pauses] the Majles speaker about his views on this  issue. In other words, what are the prospects for this matter,  this debt?    [Nateq-Nuri] [passage omitted] The debt poses no particular  problem for a country that has so many Godgiven resources,  natural capital, power, and equipment. [passage omitted] Let  me add a sentence that I personally believe that of course,  regarding those very debts, if the state economic authorities  had acted more meticulously and gracefully we would have had  fewer problems. That point must be worth considering.    [Moderator] After a visit by a group of U.S. journalists and  editors to Iran a hue and cry was begun about it in some of the  press and that is when the group had meetings with Iranian  authorities, including yourself. Taking into consideration the  fact that on the whole the American people have no animosity  toward us and -- reciprocally -- we have no animosity toward  them, do you agree with the stances that were taken by the press?    [Nateq-Nuri] Everyone is responsible for his own actions,  after all. A paper assumes a particular stance because its  analysis and understanding of an issue is such. I also have  read those stances in those papers. It was unclear to them who  they were, what objectives they were pursuing, where they had  come from, and who had invited them to Iran -- since that is not  clear to us. Apparently the papers had agreed on a meeting with  them somewhere and -- perhaps because of the same problems --  they later cancelled the meeting. Since it was clear to me --  and I was in contact with Mr. Kharrazi, our permanent envoy to  the United Nations -- it was coordinated and what they were  coming for was specified. They had been invited. Mr. Kharrazi  pursued the affair. Consequently I had a session -- or,  properly, an interview -- with them just like the one that I am  having with you. They posed questions. I also believe that  when correspondents come -- wherever they come from -- we will  not lose anything. I myself told them how good it was that they  had come because the U.S. Administration tells many lies about  us. You should come here to see the issues, to hear them and  then go back and tell the truth about things to the American  people. If you are man enough, tell the truth. But do come.  We have things to say, and we do not have any apprehensions  either about their coming here to see Iran at close range. We  have done many things that can be presented. As you noted, we  really have no quarrel with the people of the United States. We  believe their governments to be hegemonist and believe that they  are being unkind even to the people of the United States  themselves. I told the U.S. journalists that we have a friendly  complaint against the people of the United States for allowing  such governments to rule over them. [passage omitted]</p>

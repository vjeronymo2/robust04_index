			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Nice one, George Always thought that George Mathewson, the restless chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was a bit of a rum cove. On the day 3i celebrated its stock market launch, Mathewson's bank dumped (sorry sold) its entire Pounds 115m stake in the venture capital company. Given that Mathewson spent nine years learning his trade at the old ICFC, the forerunner of 3i, it doesn't sound much like a vote of confidence in his old employer. 'I hope nobody thinks that I am saying 3i is a bad company. It is a very good one,' says Mathewson who blames less favourable accountancy rules for his change of heart. Quite so. But it probably would not have happened if the Royal Bank was still run by old-fashioned clearing bankers.</p>

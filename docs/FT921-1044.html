			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart on target to meet flotation forecast BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky company which was floated on the Stock Exchange four months ago, reported relatively static interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m but said it was on target to achieve its full year forecast of Pounds 10.3m. Operating profits for the half year to December 31 were unchanged at Pounds 5.4m on turnover increased from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 19.4m. Earnings per share declined from 6.7p to 6.1p. As previously announced, no interim dividend is being paid. A final distribution of 3.33p will be declared at the June year-end. Since its listing, the company has formed a joint venture with a Russian drinks business and is developing trading relationships both in the UK and overseas. Mr William Thornton, chairman and managing director, said that trading in the second half was expected to benefit from improved margins due to the use of lower cost whisky stocks, and from a reduction of borrowings and interest charges.</p>

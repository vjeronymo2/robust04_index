			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Many changes for small business THE CHANCELLOR yesterday announced the most wide-ranging package of measures in recent memory with the aim of helping small businesses lead the UK economic recovery. He unveiled an ambitious programme of changes intended to simplify the tax system, remove the burden of red tape and increase the effectiveness of a number of small-business programmes. The overall effect of these measures will be to reduce the burden on small businesses by Pounds 1bn. Small-business organisations, accountants and the banks welcomed the measures in what several described as 'a clever Budget'. The Forum of Private Business said it had obtained five of the top six measures demanded by its 20,000 members, while the Federation of Small Businesses, with 58,000 members, described it as 'clever and fair in difficult circumstances'. The breadth of the measures announced could be assessed from the fact that some business groups complained that the self-employed and very small businesses had done particularly well while another lobby group said that medium-sized companies had reaped the most benefit. The main measures were: A simplification of income tax returns intended to allow 8m people, many self-employed, retired or living on investment income, to make their own assessment of their tax liability; An easing of the tough penalty regime which applies to business owners who make mistakes in filing their VAT returns. The serious misdeclaration penalty, the most draconian of sanctions, is only to apply to the larger cases and to persistent offenders; The cost of the government loan guarantee scheme is to be reduced and its scope will be broadened. The premium charged to small businesses will be cut from 2 1/2 per cent to  1/2 per cent for fixed-term loans and cover extended from 70 to 85 per cent of the loan; Capital gains tax rollover relief will be made available to entrepreneurs who sell one business and invest the proceeds in another; Increases in the Uniform Business Rate will be kept to the rate of inflation for another year, effectively freezing rates in real terms; Export credit cover will be extended and insurance premiums will be reduced to help small companies increase exports. Small-business organisations greeted the measures with enthusiasm but fear that increases in petrol duty will push up business costs while the self-employed will be among those affected by increases in National Insurance contributions. They were also concerned that improvements to the loan guarantee scheme did not constitute an effective replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme, which is due to expire at the end of this year.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Australia budgets for privatisation pay-off Australia's treasurer Mr Ralph Willis yesterday delivered a budget for the 1994-95 financial year which drew heavily on Australia's recent surge in economic growth and expected about ADollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.15bn)-worth of asset sale proceeds. Financial markets were watching to see what economic assumptions the government used to underpin its forecasts. In the event, Mr Willis took a fairly generous, by no means outlandish tack, suggesting GDP would grow 4.5 per cent in 1994-95, against 4 per cent in the current financial year. Employment, he suggested, would increase about 3 per cent, roughly in line with market expectations, while unemployment should drop to about 9.5 per cent by June 1995, against 10.3 per cent at present. Inflation should average 2.25 per cent in 1994-95. The budget predicted the government deficit for the current financial year would be ADollars 13.6bn, ADollars 2.4bn less than originally forecast; next year's deficit should roll out at ADollars 11.7bn (2.5 per cent of GDP). The government believes it is still on course to have the deficit down to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97: Mr Willis said the figure should now come in at 0.9 per cent, with Australia moving into surplus shortly after that. He also predicted business investment, which has lagged in the current recovery, would grow 14.5 per cent next year. Such an upsurge could affect imports, but the current account deficit should increase 'only slightly'. The government's main new spending programme (the ADollars 6.5bn jobs package) was outlined in a White Paper last week. Among the few new other expenditure items was the ADollars 1.5bn 'land fund' for Aborigines who do not benefit directly from the new Native Title legislation, although the contributions will be spread over 10 years. Mr Willis also unveiled some significant increases in health spending. On the income side, the government plans to raise more than ADollars 2.4bn from asset sales, notably the disposal of its remaining 75 per cent in Qantas, the Australian airline. But in general, it hopes the higher tax revenues stemming from the economic recovery, and a tightening of tax recoveries, will fund expenditure measures and keep the deficit reduction strategy on track. Earlier fears that there would be either a jobs levy or an increase in the Medicare levy were not borne out. Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the Australian Democrats (one of the minor parties holding balance of power in the Senate) describing the budget as a 'tread water' one drafted with a view to the next election.</p>

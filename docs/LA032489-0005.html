			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> RAINFALL ELATES CENTRAL VALLEY  </P> <P> Substantial rainfall in Northern and Central California during the last few  weeks will enable the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to increase water deliveries  to Central Valley farmers to 80% of normal and fully meet its contracts with  most municipal customers, federal officials said. "Thank God for the rain,"  said Jason Peltier, head of the Central Valley Water Assn. "We're out of what  was really a crisis situation. . . ." However, the officials said some areas --  including San Francisco, the Santa Clara Valley and the eastern side of the San  Joaquin Valley -- still aren't guaranteed full deliveries because the rains  skipped portions of the Sierra watershed that supply them.  </P></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rome faces pressure to settle ENI finance deal THE Italian government is expected to come under strong pressure to allow ENI, the state oil group, to retain the proceeds of its privatisation following the announcement of a L1,081bn (Dollars 708m) loss in 1992 and a sharp rise in borrowings. When ENI was turned into a joint stock company last August, the Amato government said the oil conglomerate would have to hand over funds raised through privatisation to the Treasury. In contrast, IRI, the state holding company, was permitted to retain the proceeds of privatisation because it was in poor financial shape. Last year's loss - ENI's first for eight years - compared with profits of L815bn in 1991 and L2,072bn in 1990. At the same time, net debt rose to L28,439bn from L23,298bn. Unofficial estimates of ENI's net worth centre on L18,000bn. ENI is in the throes of a reorganisation of management and a slimming of activities to concentrate on core business under Mr Franco Bernabe. He has been in control since March, when Mr Gabriele Cagliari, chairman, was arrested along with the chief executives of ENI's four main subsidiaries, on charges of corruption and illicit financing of political parties and falsifying accounts. The full impact of the corruption scandals on ENI is likely to be reflected in the 1993 accounts. But the group announced that the cost of extraordinary items was L1,379bn, believed to be largely paying for cuts in the labour force and covering effects of the corruption scandals. In addition, financial charges and foreign exchange losses as a result of devaluation of the lira were L2,581bn against L2,090bn. ENI is committed to a broad programme of divestiture. But with capital spending last year running at L10,700bn, the group will be squeezed for funds if it is not allowed to benefit from the proceeds of its privatisation. Significantly, the group pointed out this week that its core oil business turned in a profit of L1,252bn. The losses weighing down the group came from its involvement in chemicals, fertilisers, textiles, mining and publishing. Losses from ENI's chemical business totalled L1,790bn.</p>

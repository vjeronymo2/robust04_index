			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amexco improves 34.1% to Dollars 416m EARNINGS at American Express, the US travel and financial services group, rose sharply in the second quarter. The group was lifted by a cut of one-third in its provisions for credit losses and strong revenues generated by its Lehman Brothers securities arm. Post-tax profits rose 34.1 per cent to Dollars 416m, or 83 cents a share, up from Dollars 310m, or 63 cents a year ago. For the first-half, net income rose to Dollars 659m from Dollars 584m. Travel-related services saw a rise in net income to Dollars 234m, from Dollars 124m, as provisions for losses and claims fell to Dollars 394m, from Dollars 600m. The company said this decline, which was attributable mainly to its lending rather than its charge card operations, was due to improved credit management and portfolio restructuring. Revenues from travel-related services fell, due to discount rate reductions and a fall in the number of cards in use, though this was partially offset by an increase in the volume of business billed to each cardholder. At the end of the second quarter there were 34m cards in issue down, from 35.6m a year ago. Business billed to these cards amounted to Dollars 31m during the quarter, up from Dollars 29m, with a rise in US business offsetting a slight decline elsewhere. Lehman Brothers, which American Express will continue to own after the expected completion of the sale this weekend of the Shearson retail broking business, returned after-tax earnings of Dollars 95m, after a loss of Dollars 24m in the same period in 1992. Commission and market-making income were up, while investment banking revenues fell to Dollars 208m from Dollars 245m. Shearson made net profits of Dollars Dollars 26.5m in the quarter, down from Dollars 28m a year before. Earnings rose in the group's IDS Financial Services division, where net income climbed to Dollars 90m from Dollars 73m while American Express Bank rose Dollars 1m to Dollars 20m.</p>

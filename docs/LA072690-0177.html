It's time to hit the malls.  </P> <P> Hanna-Barbera Productions, the storied animation house that gave the world the  Flintstones and the Jetsons, said Wednesday that it will open a store at the  Westside Pavilion in West Los Angeles Aug. 1.  </P> <P> Another shop is scheduled to open at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance on  Sept. 1.  </P> <P> The stores will carry clothing, stuffed dolls, toys, games, jewelry and  collectibles. Hanna-Barbera's first retail outlet began business last month at  the new Universal Studios Florida tour in Orlando.  </P> <P> Sharp-eyed shoppers will notice that the firm isn't the first show-biz legend  to go into retailing.

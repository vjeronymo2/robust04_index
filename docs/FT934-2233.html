			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Private funding helps move museum A private-sector consortium yesterday put up Pounds 6m of equity to help fund the transfer of the Royal Armouries national museum from the Tower of London to Leeds. The deal is said to be the first to use risk capital to back a museum project. The backing, led by 3i, the venture capital group, triggers Pounds 28.5m of public funding the government made conditional on private-sector support. The Royal Armouries will retain curatorial and artistic control, but the new museum will be run by a specially created private company, Royal Armouries International, financed by venture capital and Pounds 8m of loans from the Bank of Scotland. 3i's contribution to the equity syndicate is Pounds 2.25m, with Pounds 2m from Electra Investment Trust, Pounds 1m from Yorkshire Electricity and Pounds 750,000 from Gardner Merchant, the leisure group, which will also provide management and catering services. The chairman will be Sir James Glover, a BP director and commander of British land forces between 1985 and 1987. The chief executive will be Mr Christopher O'Boyle, a former director of Prudential's property division. Both have taken equity stakes. Of the public funding, Pounds 20m is from the Department of National Heritage. Leeds Development Corporation, a government agency, is contributing Pounds 5m and Leeds City Council Pounds 3.5m. The museum opens in 1996.</p>

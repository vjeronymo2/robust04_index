			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine stays closed after explosions The 11 people missing following major explosions at the large Porgera gold mine, in Papua New Guinea's remote Enga province, were yesterday presumed dead. All were employees of Dyno Wesfarmers, which operates the explosives facility close to the mine site, where the blasts occurred on Tuesday morning. Five were Australian and the remainder were PNG nationals. The Porgera mine remained closed and all its milling operations suspended yesterday while damage assessment continued. No date has yet been given for its reopening. The four joint venture partners in the mine - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields, Highlands Gold, and the PNG government - said there had been 'surface damage to sheeting and building claddings of support infrastructure. They added that some accommodation and messing facilities were also damaged. More information on when operations might restart may be released this morning. Porgera is one of the world's largest gold mines, with annual production of over 1m ounces. It is also a major source of the revenue for the Papua New Guinea government: 'All I want to say as a government is that we are concerned because it's a major project that is of a lot of benefit to PNG,' commented Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, yesterday. News of the explosion and the mine's closure affected share prices of all three corporate partners. Renison's dropped by 15 cents in early trading to ADollars 4.45 while Highlands' were down 5 cents, to ADollars 1.45. Those of Placer Pacific, which manages the mine, suffered worst with a 20 cents drop to ADollars 3.20.</p>

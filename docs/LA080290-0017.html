			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEAT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS RESULT IN INCREASED AWARENESS OF SOCCER  </P> <P> I have followed the Heat for two years and over the past year, have seen  tremendous changes take place.  </P> <P> I have seen the crowds more than double in size, have seen a family atmosphere  develop as well as an increase in enthusiasm for the team.  </P> <P> I think these developments can be attributed to General Manager Jill Fracisco  and her staff. A lack of dedication certainly would not result in such a  positive change.  </P> <P> Militello pointed out some valid methods of how to increase attendance and  interest in the club, but the negative manner in which he expressed his ideas  does anything but spark interest in the club or the sport of soccer.  </P> <P> ANGELA M.

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPLYING TO FEIFFER  </P> <P> Cartoonist Jules Feiffer's May 14 degradation of African-Americans was a misuse  of his access to media, and it emphasized media's power to propagandize.  </P> <P> First, African-Americans have little media ownership. Second, the community  ills portrayed in the media are created and controlled by people outside the  community. And, third, the "genocide against African-Americans" that Feiffer  refers to is real.  </P> <P> The problems described in the cartoon are created by white Americans. For  example, "children in front of crack houses": Only white Americans at the top  have the power and money to bring cocaine into this country. And where else are  the children to play?  </P> <P> Teen-age pregnancy: White girls have more pregnancies than other races. Also,  more of them are on welfare than all other groups.  </P> <P> The crimes of young white males are not highlighted in the media to the same  extent as those of others. Surely no one thinks that many members of the  virtually media-proof and justice-proof white race are not sadistic and  criminal. Ever hear of Satanism? Manson? Hangings?  </P> <P> The fear in "liberal white friends" (to quote Feiffer) is because they know  that downtrodden and maligned people will not forever stay underfoot.  </P> <P> The power of media is such that it could stop racism in one week if it wanted  to, or, as typified by Feiffer, propel it to new heights.  </P> <P> BERLETER HALL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Aho met Kohl in the ski  resort of Davos in Switzerland, where they are taking part in  the World Economic Forum, an informal meeting of world leaders.  Aho explained the negotiating situation from Finland's point of  view and emphasized the two central demands: Getting a permanent  subsidy for northern agriculture and financing this subsidy from  EU funds, not from Finland's state funds.    Kohl did not comment in detail on Finland's goals but gave  the assurance that Germany is very much aware of them. Earlier  today Kohl said that it is important that Finland, Norway,  Sweden and Austria join the EU from the beginning of next year.    Aho will remain in Davos until Sunday [30 January] and will  meet several European leaders, among others Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>

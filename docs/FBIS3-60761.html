There were  no injuries.    Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts  of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa  Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time  police were investigating a possible link between the blast and  the explosives seized. The caller said the sabotage was part of  Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all Azanians.  "The struggle will continue until we are all free."    There was no way of independently confirming the caller was  from Azanla, armed wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of  Azania, which has rejected the constitutional deal reached in  negotiations at Kempton Park.</p>

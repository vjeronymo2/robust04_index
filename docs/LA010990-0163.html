			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HIS NIBS AND HIS ROYAL NIBBLES  </P> <P> A royal breakfast of Weetabix? No joke.  </P> <P> Prince Charles this year became an official consumer of Weetabix breakfast  cereal, joining a couple of other famous Weetabix munchers, Queen Elizabeth II  and the queen mother.  </P> <P> The cereal, known in the United States as one of the less crunchy brands, was  given a royal warrant by the prince of Wales for the new year, one of 18 new  warrants granted by the heir to the British crown.  </P> <P> Other healthy items on Charles' list include a bakery that makes organic bread,  a firm described as "purveyors of dried fruits" and a pharmacy listed as  "suppliers of homeopathic medicine."  </P> <P> But just how much Weetabix does Charles eat? At what time of day? With or  without sugar or some of that dried fruit on top?  </P> <P> Nobody's talking.  </P> <P> "All we can say is that we supply the royal household with a range of our  products," Weetabix Ltd. spokesman Peter Davidson said Monday. Asked if he  could discuss details of Charles' Weetabix fix, he said: "Absolutely not."  </P></p>

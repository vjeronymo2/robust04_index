			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: The politics of creating a neutral power - Cricket FIRST the problems of reconciling national and international government; then the national government's problems in forming national policies. Fate having thus prepared current affairs for cricket, on Tuesday the International Cricket Council announced National Grid Company's sponsorship of 'third country', 'neutral' or 'independent' Test umpires in Zimbabwe and South Africa this winter. Independence is a prerequisite of good umpiring. English counties used to take their own umpires to matches. There was so much trouble and strife that in 1883 they opted instead for a pool of 'neutral' umpires, two from each county, to stand only in games where their own county was not playing. It was an immediate success. The ICC, organisers of the new 'neutral' umpire scheme, consider the latest plan no more than, as Chairman Sir Colin Cowdrey put it, 'an experiment . . . a pilot scheme.' It cannot be more because it is voluntary. The ICC has no power to enforce it. Three neutral umpires, 'Dickie' Bird and David Shepherd (England) and Steve Bucknor (West Indies) will be on the tour of southern Africa. Tomorrow Bird will become the first sponsored, neutral umpire in Test match history. Previous neutrals, notably Jack Hampshire and John Holder in Pakistan 1989-90, were paid by their host country, not by commercial sponsors. But then Bird is a natural for firsts and records. Tomorrow's Test match between Zimbabwe and India will be Zimbabwe's first with full Test status. Just for good measure, it will bring the number of Tests Bird has umpired up to Frank Chester's record of 48. Bird will advise local umpires in Harare and Bulawayo, where he will also stand in Zimbabwe's two Tests against New Zealand. Shepherd and Bucknor will umpire South Africa's four Tests against India. What happens next is up to each country to decide for itself. India will decide whether they want neutral umpires for England's tour of their country after seeing how neutrals handle their tour of southern Africa. Australia dislike the scheme and say they will not imply a lack of confidence in their own umpires by using it. I asked Cowdrey whether he thought the neutral scheme could be seen as a capitulation to Pakistan's repeated demands for neutral umpires and their complaints this summer about English umpires, as giving way to trouble making, as weakness under pressure. 'I think we all have to look at it and see how it goes. I can't say any more than that really.' Presumably his hope is that the scheme will gather strength and win respect, so that soon Test countries will only want to play where there are neutral umpires. The fear is that it will lose, not gain, authority for umpires by making their nationality more important than their ability. Also by making them more dependent on match referees, who now seem, alas, to be seen as an integral part of game control at international level. Soon some-one will start calling them match managers, as they sit watching their videos and making judgments on umpires' judgments. The presence of such a reserve force, albeit one with pitifully weak weapons, as we saw at Headingley in July, undermines umpires' authority and lowers their confidence. If neutral umpires are worth trying, their control should be complete. Cricket is the last important sport without neutral umpires (or their equivalent) for international games. The ICC accepted the principle of neutral umpiring two years ago, but had been unable to find sponsors to make it a reality. Only England has professional, full-time umpires. Everywhere else the best umpires can spare little time for the job. Sir Donald Bradman is alarmed that neutral umpires would discourage each country's up-and-coming umpires. National Grid's initial, and Quixotic, investment in neutral umpires is Pounds 75,000, but neither they nor any other sponsor is likely to spend a fortune training young umpires round the world. Not even if the umpires discreetly advertise on their clothing the patronage they have received. So discreet was what National Grid describe as the 'distinctive National Grid 'pylon' logo', on the breast pocket of Bird's white coat, that I didn't even notice it, still less recognise it. Bird is a fine umpire. He takes a simple line, unabashed by the problems of organisation and finance. He is relying on fine umpiring to win the project attention, approval and support. As Cowdrey said: We'll just have to wait and see.</p>

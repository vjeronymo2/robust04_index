			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Fed criticised over fine-tuning of US economy INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund (IMF) board members have criticised the US Federal Reserve for 'fine-tuning' the US economy by repeated cuts in interest rates, George Graham reports from Washington. Some members of the IMF's executive board said the Fed was justified in lowering its federal funds rate, 'given the hesitancy of the economic recovery and the slow growth of the broadly-defined money supply', but others saw risks in the cuts because inflation still seemed to be running at a rate no lower than 4 per cent even at the trough of the economic cycle. Most directors agreed that the Fed should be ready to raise interest rates again as the recovery took hold. The IMF's principal worry about US economic policy, expressed during consultations designed to draw attention to the international implications of policies and developments in the economies of member countries, remains the federal budget deficit. Board members 'saw a clear need to strengthen the credibility of fiscal policy,' calling for spending cuts but also additional revenue measures. Many directors suggested eliminating a number of tax breaks that distort private savings, but also proposed higher excise taxes on energy use, especially on petrol. In their scrutiny of economic policy, published in the IMF annual report yesterday, directors also issued their recommendations for other major industrial countries: Japan should continue efforts to reform its trade practices. They said there was scope for greater fiscal stimulus - a desire subsequently met by Japan's recent economic package - but urged caution in guiding interest rates below their already low levels. Germany needed to discourage unsustainable wage increases, which had contributed to the country's worsening inflation performance and justified progressive increases in interest rates. A clearer medium-term budget strategy was needed, however, with the elimination of unproductive subsidies to coal mining and agriculture. France was not showing 'sufficient determination' in reforming its tax structure, its labour market practices and its protectionist tendencies. The UK must keep as its main economic goal a rapid convergence of its inflation to that of its low-inflation partners in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The European Community did not fulfil the criteria for an optimal currency union. Some directors saw little prospect for developing a true European budget policy because of political constraints.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (7): Pair of pumps take recession in their stride - Weir and Sulzer / Two differing companies in the same sector have both had to restructure and reorganise to survive FOR MOST of British manufacturing industry, 1981 will be remembered as the low point of the last recession. But the year has a special significance for two of the UK's largest pump makers. It was the year when the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering concern which is the parent of Weir Pumps, nearly went under - only to be rescued by its bankers. A couple of hundred miles further south at Leeds, Swiss-owned Sulzer was moving into its new Pounds 15m pump factory. The two pump factories, Weir Pumps at Cathcart and Sulzer (UK) Pumps at Leeds, belong to two very different companies, but share some things in common. Both make big, heavily engineered pumps in small batches rather than mass producing standard items - which can be done virtually anywhere in the world. And both have had to pump pretty hard themselves over the past 12 years to stay competitive and profitable. Now, after considerable upheaval at both factories, there is a much greater sense of confidence about the long-term future of the factories. 'We're quite happy to take on the Germans, French and Japanese,' says Mr John Frew, Weir Pumps' production director. 'We can match them blow-for-blow on what we are doing on the shopfloor.' At Leeds, Mr Martyn Thomas, managing director of Sulzer (UK) Pumps and a regional director for the Swiss company's European pumps business, runs through an impressive list of changes at the factory and its business strategy, underpinned by the UK's status as 'a tremendous base' for Sulzer's brand of highly-skilled specialist manufacturing. The current improved outlook comes after 12 years which have not been without periods of crisis for both companies. At Weir, the near-collapse in 1981 was a watershed for the company, says Mr Frew, as years of having grown 'fat and happy' gave way to an efficiency and productivity drive. As a group, Weir has become one of the City's favourite engineering companies and Mr Ron Garrick, its no-nonsense chief executive, is admired as the archetypal hands-on boss. The basic philosophy combines, on the one hand, strong control from the top and a global strategic view which drives Weir Pumps' policies for investment, cost reduction and operating performance; and on the other hand, an exact attention to detail. Every Monday, says Mr Frew, a meeting is held to review progress of each contract worth more than Pounds 50,000. And the costs involved in every job are looked at once a month. As a group, Weir is known as one of the more acquisitive UK engineering companies, having spent Pounds 123m on 24 takeovers in the last six years. In pumps, however, the big deal came in 1987 with the takeover of the Manchester-based Mather and Platt Machinery. In spite of the takeover, employment at Weir Pumps has fallen from about 4,669 in 1980 to 2,169. This includes a dramatic reduction from 3,131 to 1,225 employees at Cathcart, and very heavy cuts at Weir Pumps' Alloa foundry. Sales and profits are not given, but it is estimated in the City that Weir Pumps' turnover has risen from Pounds 70m in 1989 to about Pounds 150m last year, on which profits would have been about Pounds 12m. At Sulzer, which has had a presence in Leeds for 55 years, the 12 years in its new factory fall into two halves. In the first half of the decade, the company performed reasonably while sticking steadfastly to its two main pump markets, power generation and water supply, and maintaining some of the more traditional customs of its old plant - three levels of dining room and lovingly tended flower beds. Mr Thomas joined in late 1986 with a remit to grow the business - sales in real terms had stuck at about Pounds 15m for several years. Because of changes in the UK market the company became 'export-led by design and necessity,' he says, and also launched a major onslaught on the offshore oil market that it had previously ignored. Now, the oil industry accounts for 35-40 per cent of the factory's new pumps business, compared with about 10 per cent in 1986. Total sales have trebled from Pounds 15m in 1986 to around Pounds 45-46m this year, while employment at Leeds has fallen from 470 to 420 over the same period (although overall employment in the UK has risen to 502, which includes 80 people in Sulzer's new pump service companies.) There is one dining room and horticulture has been heavily pruned. The crisis for the Leeds factory came in 1990. That year, the Leeds-based business plunged to a Pounds 1.38m loss when it failed to keep the right balance between profits and sales, becoming cash negative when interest rates were high and thus becoming unable to support its growth. It has since bounced back into profit - Pounds 43,000 in 1991 and Pounds 1.96m last year - as the benefits of a number of internal and external initiatives moves finally paid off. While the stories of the factories at Cathcart and Leeds have been very different, there is considerable common ground in the changes on the shopfloor to improve productivity and quality, as would be expected for companies that compete head-to-head on products. In a nutshell, both have recognised that producing large, specialist pumps requires a careful combination of manpower and machinery. Worker skills and flexibility are as important as new machine tools and production equipment - each depends on the other for success. At Weir, a Pounds 2.5m German machining centre introduced last year has exceeded expectations, says Mr Frew. Designed to machine the biggest pump components, it is reducing machining costs by 60-70 per cent, compared with the 40 per cent envisaged, and is being used for a wider range of components. Now Mr Frew is considering buying another one. But over the last year the machine shop has also been reorganised with the aim of having one operator controlling two machines simultaneously. 'If we can achieve that, we've halved the costs again,' says Mr Frew. Sulzer, meanwhile, has invested more than Pounds 4m in machine tools and information systems over the past four years with the aim of increasing its flexibility, but Mr Thomas lays particular stress on training and organisation issues. The company structure has been modified, ending the old worker/staff split and creating a single status site by 1991, a year earlier than planned. 'I have no doubt there have been benefits in terms of the stability of the workforce and our ability to take people on,' says Mr Thomas. Training has also been stepped up. 'Year-on-year, we have increased our training budget, and training is now much more widespread,' says Mr Thomas. A company-wide continuous improvement programme has been introduced. Mr Bob Jukes, operations director at Leeds, says: 'We've optimised our returns on the effective use of manpower and in treating manpower properly.' For Sulzer and Weir, producing large or specialised pumps in batches as small as one means that the flow of work through the factory is never even. Flexibility is the key. Both companies used to have a real problem in this area, and with overall attitudes on the shopfloor. But now, with multi-skilled workers, machinists can switch to fitting if the machine shop is quiet, or fitters can do some painting. 'The change on the shopfloor has been phenomenal,' says Mr Frew at Weir. 'Flexibility is unlimited and if a guy is capable of doing the job, he will do it.' Interestingly, both companies have to some extent swum against the tide by increasing the amount of components that are made in-house. The Weir Group sold its big foundry at Catton in Leeds in the mid-1980s but the Mather &amp; Platt acquisition two years later brought with it a foundry at Manchester to add to the existing Alloa foundry. These are separate profit centres, but are now key suppliers under Weir Pumps' control, which enables lead times to be reduced, says Mr Frew. Mather &amp; Platt also made the electric motors to power the pumps, which Weir now uses, although not exclusively. Again, overall lead times are reduced, says Mr Frew, which can be crucial to winning large orders at short notice. At Sulzer, Mr Jukes is buying in a little less as part of a programme of adding further value to the manufacturing process, thus improving the response to the marketplace. Up to a point, he says, this makes sense for highly-engineered products. Sulzer now makes more larger fabrications at Leeds and recently introduced a CNC (computer-numerically controlled) machine tool to make sophisticated fastenings, gaining control over supply. Handled properly, the decision to make rather than buy can be more profitable for specialist engineering companies, but is also important as a contribution to reducing lead times, where both companies have made important advances over recent years. With all the changes made in the manufacturing process, Weir Pumps has halved its lead times over the past 10 years, says Mr Frew. At Sulzer, lead times on a typical pump for the oil industry, which works on tighter schedules than other, more infrastructure-related pump markets, have been reduced by around a third over the past four years. Overall, the changes at Weir and Sulzer have helped to put a traditional UK manufacturing industry on a much more competitive footing, but neither company is prepared to rest on its laurels. For example, both rely heavily on the traditional skills of pattern-making for their castings and both are looking carefully at the possible benefits from rapid prototyping to speed up the product development process.</p>

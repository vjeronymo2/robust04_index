			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Castleward rises above the Troubles NORMA MAJOR has not often featured in the annals of Northern Irish opera. But when, on her suggestion, the prime minister's party swept into Castleward opera last week - on the evening when Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, made his politically embarrassing joke about a Belfast bomb explosion that injured 30 people - it marked an unexpected boost to the little-known world of Irish opera. Dubbed by Sir Patrick as a 'Glyndebourne without the pomp', Castle Down has been quietly seeking to make its mark on the operatic map since the mid 1980s. Like other would-be Glyndebourne's that have grown up across England, the venue thrives by serving up a popular mixture of pleasant opera and black-tie social graces, staged in the stately home of Castleward, which guests can admire during the dinner interval. Unlike more pretentious venues, the event has not yet lost its home-made edge - nor the politics that pervade even the arts world in Northern Ireland. The operas are performed in a former barn, where on most nights hefty security men lurk at the stage door, guarding civil servants in the audience. A high profile party like the Majors means that the ornamental gardens are thick with combat troops. In spite of these more unusual touches, Seamus McGrenera's production of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor this year is an enjoyable performance. When Castleward first started, nine seasons ago, it used a semi-professional cast to stage three performance of Cosi fan tutte on a budget of Pounds 7000. This year, 17 performances are on offer, using a budget of Pounds 140,000 drawn almost entirely from local business sponsorship - a sum which the organisers say allows them to either pick middle-ranking established singers for their principles, or aim for up-and-coming singers. Wisely, perhaps, they have chosen to focus on the up-and coming elements, albeit with slightly uneven results. Lucia di Lammermoor is an opera in which much depends on the power of the soprano, and the Irish-born Nicola Sharkey coped with the part of Lucia commendably. Baritone Gordon Sandison and bass Andrew Hammond also put in two solid performances, as Enrico and Raimondo respectively, providing a solid anchor to the opera and counterbalancing a slight weakness in the tenors, who had been undermined by illness. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge for the opera remains the staging: the barn-cum-hall where the operas are produced seats no more than 200. Director Seamus McGrenera and designer Adam O'Neill sought to overcome the limitations by using the levels and depths of the stage to the full, but although the set design was impressive, it did not always entirely overcome the problems of overcrowding or the slightly static feel to the production. How Castleward will develop in the future is uncertain. To make its mark on the international opera scene, critics agree that it will not only need a new stage, but also a more specific opera niche - perhaps a focus on the little-known repertoire of Irish opera, instead of the selection of popular classics that the venue now serves. However, organisers fear that taking this direction could alienate the local audience, as well as the business sponsorship which it has carefully cultivated over the years. 'People are not falling over themselves to go to opera in Northern Ireland. It's basically a very conservative audience,' says director Seamus McGrenera. As the venue has grown on the back of local business sponsorship - a considerable feat, given the financial climate - finding the funds for redevelopment seems unlikely. Meanwhile, for Castleward's fans it is the very intimacy and enthusiasm that gives the performance its charm. 'This is like Glyndebourne in the 1930s or Wexford in the 1950s. With careful nurturing it could grow into something of significance,' says Ian Fox, a leading Dublin critic who has been trumpeting Castle Ward's cause south of the border. Tickets for this year's productions rapidly sold out. And courtesy of Norma Major, Sir Patrick Mayhew and the ensuing publicity, it seems that competition to get tickets for next year's productions will be even more fierce.</p>

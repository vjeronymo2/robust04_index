Welcome to "Up to  Date's" interview segment. As we announced on our newscast this  morning, we have with us today Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential  candidate for the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front], CD [Democratic Convergence], MNR [National Revolutionary  Movement] coalition. Welcome, Doctor.    [Zamora] Good morning, Mauricio, and good morning to  everyone  watching and listening to us this morning.    [Funes] This is the first interview I have given following  Sunday's elections, and it is the first comprehensive interview  with one of the two candidates who will definitely compete in a  runoff election, judging by the results which, although they  have not been declared final by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  [TSE], show a trend that will be difficult to change because  they reflect over 75 percent of the votes counted nationwide.    As of last night, the TSE's figures gave 49.20 percent of  the  vote to ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance]; 25.73 percent  to the coalition; and 15.95 percent to the Christian Democratic  Party. In your opinion, Doctor, what do these results mean?    [Zamora] The first implication, Mauricio, is that the  strategy we established a year and a half ago when we initiated  this process is working. We said at the outset that a coalition  of progressive democratic forces had to be formed that would  allow us to move ahead and win first or second place, then move  on to a runoff election. We have accomplished those things and  we will now implement the second part of our strategy, which is  to broaden this coalition of forces so we will win the  presidency in the runoff. [passage omitted]    [Funes] It came to our attention yesterday that the Chamber  of Commerce president said it is unfortunate that El Salvador  must hold another election for just a few points. If ARENA had  won a simple majority of the vote, it would unquestionably have  won the elections in the first round. Do you agree with that  party's view that it is an unnecessary effort and expense to  hold a runoff election?    [Zamora] I do not think so. Perhaps the Chamber of Commerce  president did not use the right words about a runoff election. I  believe just the opposite is true. Elections are a democratic  exercise by the people. They are an opportunity for the  Salvadoran people. We should welcome every opportunity the  people have to express their will and choose a government. That  is the essence of democracy. The very thought that elections are  somehow unfortunate could be very dangerous and end democracy in  the country. I would say that we must hold the runoff elections  with the attitude that they are an opportunity to broaden our  political knowledge and the information given to the people and  to truly try to involve more Salvadorans in the decision.    You must remember that 49 percent is percentage data, but  half of the population has not voted. In other words, 49 percent  in terms of the voting population is less than one-fourth of the  Salvadoran electorate, and it might not be a good idea to  believe that an election should be decided by less than  one-fourth of the people who should be making the decision. It  is to our advantage to have another opportunity to correct all  the serious deficiencies of the first election so we can broaden  the spectrum and allow more Salvadorans to decide their future.    [Funes] The distribution of support demonstrated in the  presidential elections was practically predicted by the public  opinion polls. All polls indicated that ARENA was the top force,  followed by the leftist coalition and the Christian Democratic  Party [PDC] in third place, approximately six months ago. They  did not, however, predict the percentages and the way they would  change. For example, the UCA's [Central American University]  Public Opinion Institute gave the coalition a certain percentage  that was way below the ARENA figure. Do you think the 49.20  percent is a solid ARENA vote?    [Zamora] It is not a solid ARENA vote because I think the  polls were showing something different. I think a lot can be  attributed to the occasional vote, due in part to the fear  instilled in voters by a campaign carried out toward the end. In  fact, it was a campaign held on a day when campaigning was no  longer allowed. Certain media, like EL DIARIO DE HOY, continued  a harsh campaign against us. I believe it was outside the  boundaries permitted by law or that it bent the law over  backwards. All of this had some impact, and that is one of the  things that we want changed in the runoff elections. In other  words, we do not want the kind of campaign where a party  officially shows one face but then pays a front organization to  do the dirty work, the derogatory campaigning against another  party.    I think all these elements had some influence, but I also  insist that there was a large number of new voters who we feel  supported us but who could not find their names on the list,  their numbers did not match, their names were misspelled, that  another person had already voted there, or people whose names  simply did not appear on the lists.    [Funes] Dr. Zamora, no one can deny that the left has won a  political victory by the fact that there was no clear winner in  the first round of elections, thus forcing ARENA to go to a  second round. What will be the practical impact, from the  standpoint of political pragmatism, of going to a second round  when, if you add up the percentages, regardless of the efforts  made by the leftist coalition, the percentages received by the  PDC and other political parties would still not come close to  the 49.20 percent received by ARENA in the first round.    [Zamora] We must keep something in mind: The results of one  election will not necessarily be the results of the next  election. We are witnessing that throughout Latin America.  Second, our strategy is not only to add other parties -- we will  obviously try to do that -- but to guarantee that the large  number of voters who were unable to vote in the first round will  be able to do so in the second round. The runoff election will  be an opportunity to see that our electoral system is not so  exclusive. It will become an open electoral system that will  allow people to vote instead of a system to prevent people from  voting. Our hopes and efforts lie in the affluence of new voters  as they are the ones who will create a new scene next month.  [passage omitted]    [Funes] I want to analyze some of the irregularities  observed yesterday. I heard Onusal [UN Observers for El  Salvador] Chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo say that, generally  speaking, the elections were acceptable. Despite the fact that  there were some irregularities, when the elections are  considered acceptable, when missions from different countries  and international organizations finally reach the opinion that  the elections were acceptable, any irregularity they may have  detected simply becomes a logistical problem, some of which are  considered normal and others simply the product of an  organization that is still new. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal  was created in the wake of the peace agreements. I would like to  discuss the possible impact of the irregularities that prompted  the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to hold a news  conference on the same day of the elections but which at the  same time led Onusal to state that the elections were generally  acceptable.    [Zamora] I believe that is where part of the problem lies.  If  the option is between acceptable elections and fraudulent  elections, obviously the elections were not fraudulent. No one  has characterized them as such. We would not term an election  fraudulent in which we have become the country's second  political force with people participating for the first time in  the country's history. This must be given due consideration.  The problem is not whether the elections were fraudulent or  acceptable. The problem is, as the United Nations pointed out --  and I think it is the correct term and share it -- that the  elections were held in adequate conditions of liberty,  competition, and security despite the serious organizational and  purity deficiencies noted beforehand. In other words, what these  organizations had the first time around were serious  deficiencies; not simple, but serious. Such deficiencies can be  corrected. That is the important thing, Mauricio.    I think we must face the problem with a positive attitude.  These are things that can be corrected, so let us correct them  for the good of the Salvadoran people. We have a great  opportunity to do it now; so let us do it. I think everything is  directed at that goal. We must recognize one thing: There were  no complaints of general fraud in the '91 elections. There were  complaints of local fraud. Now the problem is centered on the  serious deficiencies of our electoral process. Such deficiencies  can be corrected.    In essence, the deficiencies impeded people from  participating. Let us look, for instance, at the 200,000 people  who could have legally participated. Our count here in El  Salvador shows that 10 percent of the people did not participate  because they did not appear on the register because of problems  such as a lack of a voter registration card and so forth. Okay,  200,000 people can totally change the percentages. In fact, they  could have changed the percentages in the primary and could  still change them in the runoff elections. It could have been  the case. I think, however, their participation would have  reduced ARENA's percentage and increased ours. That is my  observation. Right now we cannot say, but we can say that those  problems must be corrected quickly. [passage omitted]    [Funes] One objection that persisted and which surfaced  publicly during the campaign by the Liberty and Democracy  Institute [ILYD] was the FMLN's past. Do you think that if this  is not handled properly, no matter how civilly the FMLN conducts  itself these days, if it is continuously brought up, it will  make a large sector of the population afraid?    [Zamora] Yes. In fact, that is something we must look at in  the runoff election. I do not think it is right for ARENA to  promote this type of propaganda, through the ILYD, which is paid  by ARENA. It has its station announcers, and we know that the  ILYD and ARENA make their advertisements at the same place. They  are sort of name borrowers. We have seen them campaigning  wearing an ILYD sweatshirt, and when they get into the truck,  they are wearing an ARENA sweatshirt underneath. In that sense,  they are ARENA supporters. I do not think it is right for them  to do that. If ARENA wants to campaign that way, they should do  it and we will respond appropriately. If ARENA wants us to  debate the impact of the war, what it meant, what each person  did for the war to take place, we can discuss it in the runoff  elections. We have told Dr. Calderon Sol time and again that we  are interested in a lofty debate, an in-depth debate on the  country's problems.    One of these problems is our past, which we must discuss  face  to face with the people. The ARENA gentlemen, however, totally  reject a debate. They do not want to show their faces. They hide  behind an institute that continued to do what they were doing  despite a warning from the TSE to stop. We do want the TSE to  adopt a clearer and more energetic attitude against the low,  dirty, and illegal campaigning by this so-called institute  before the runoff elections.    [Funes] Aside from the legality or illegality of this type  of campaigning, I am talking about what is being said.  Organizations that support the FMLN or organizations that could  be on the left always drag out reports on the past war or  resurrect the death squad activities. The death squad topic was  somehow in the political debate when the secret documents were  declassified. The position, then, should be that either both  forces should forget about discussing the past and stop delving  into it, or if one drags out reports on death squad activities,  then the other drags out the report on the war, or vice versa.    [Zamora] That is exactly what we have tried to avoid. It  would not have cost us anything to get copies or facsimiles or  whatever of the documents released by the State Department, the  Pentagon, and the CIA, but we wanted to avoid that. We did not  think it conducive to focus on for our people. It would have  turned the past into a battlefield instead of a field of  experience. Mauricio, we want to move on. We must look back, but  we should do it without slinging mud at one another. We must  take a serious look at the past. That is what we want. I am  personally opposed to engaging in that type of propaganda which  is so common in our country. One is either a terrorist or a  death squad member. That sort of thing does not educate our  people. It causes us to regress. I am convinced that, rather  than winning or losing an election, the important thing is to  move forward. Democracy in our country can only be cemented on  firm foundations. I do not think it is a firm foundation to  insult one another. On the contrary, that would be the worst  basis upon which to try to develop democracy. I insist that we  must ask ourselves whether what we are doing for the country is  good or bad. Another way is to have an in-depth discussion of  the war in a serious manner, with arguments. I am ready to  engage in such a discussion at any moment with Dr. Armando  Calderon Sol so we can clear things up.    [Funes] I think fears about a lack of guarantees are  fundamental. No matter how much one appeals for an electoral  process in which the voters vote for certain projects, one often  wonders whether the candidate he chooses is in a position to  resolve the country's problems? I think that in this case it is  asking for more than voters are able to give, considering  traditions and past elections when people were afraid so they  asked for guarantees. I understand there are fundamental sectors  of the country, such as the private sector, that ask for  guarantees. The armed institution asks for guarantees. The  social sectors and the labor sectors also have certain fears,  and certain candidates ask for guarantees. This is something  that might be relevant in the runoff election.    In that sense, there is the case of the Armed Forces. I  spoke  with the defense minister the other day and asked him what the  victory of one party or another could mean for the Armed Forces,  but basically what a leftist party would mean. He insisted that  there is some fear in view of the past. It is a reasonable fear  because the parties are asked to consider the armed institution  as something permanent, as a key organization in the country's  development. How would you face such fears in light of what the  Armed Forces' role might be?    [Zamora] I think that the only way to handle fear,  personally, socially, or collectively, is face to face. In other  words, we have to recognize that the Armed Forces and its  officers are concerned about the triumph of a coalition that is  formed in part by a component that the Armed Forces faced  militarily for several years. I think we must confront our fears  by making things clear. My view of what the next five years  should entail for the Armed Forces is to complete what has been  called the demilitarization process. The first two years have  been what we might call the negative part of the process:  purging, downsizing, separating policemen and Armed Forces  members, redistributing the constitutional role assigned to the  Armed Forces, and so on. Now comes what I would call the  positive part. In my opinion, it must be based on two  fundamental pillars, the first being recognition that the Armed  Forces is a legitimate institution in this country. Its  existence and function are provided for in the Constitution. It  is the government's job, in this case the president's job, to  make sure that the people accept the institution's legitimacy.    That is the fundamental pillar upon which relations will be  rebuilt. Equally fundamental is recognition that the armed  institution's policy must be subordinate to the decisions of the  power elected by the people, in this case the civilian power.  The armed institution must be totally isolated from party  politics. Based on those two premises, we must rebuild the  relationship between civilians and military personnel to make it  a modern relationship in which civilian-military relations will  no longer be a problem. It should be a nonissue like relations  between lawyers and nonlawyers. No one worries about that  situation. We must reach that point when society accepts a  military career as a valid profession with a valid role in  society.    [Funes] Have the two parties that faced each other and led  the war matured? For instance, I have heard officers say they  are afraid that a majority in the Legislative Assembly could  vote for a constitutional amendment to eliminate the armed  institution. Such a proposal was on the agenda some years ago.    [Zamora] Regardless of whether the parties have matured, I  look at it this way. We are on the path to building maturity. I  do not think we not achieved it yet. If we had, the problem  would have been resolved. We are in the process of resolving it.  It will be a difficult process, but I think we are clear about  what we are aiming for and what must be resolved. As for  eliminating the Armed Forces by a constitutional amendment, I  think that is totally senseless. A constitutional amendment in  this period has to be made by consensus. It is not a question of  majority. It would be the most serious mistake if a majority,  because it is a majority, were to introduce a constitutional  amendment that is opposed by another important part of the  country. Why? Because it would destroy what we have achieved in  this country, which was to change the Constitution by consensus  among everyone. This heightens the awareness of the need for  consensus in our society. We must not abandon this. There can be  constitutional amendments here so long as they are approved by  consensus. Even if we had a majority to pass it, if a sector of  society or a part of the Legislative Assembly opposes it, I  think we have to forget about the majority because that is the  new style of government that we propose. [passage omitted]    [Funes] I want to close with this question. Yesterday a CNN  reporter asked you -- the interview was broadcast yesterday --  if there was any difficulty going from the right to the left.  That is a topic I have tried to explore in the past few days  prior to the elections in terms of governability. Will the  coalition you represent be able to create the conditions for  governability?    [Zamora] That is precisely the point. If we talk about of  moving from right to left, we are going it about it the wrong  way because the country is not moving from right to left. There  is a fundamental historical fact: The right and the left sat  down and signed peace agreements. This puts the center of the  dispute in our country not between right and left but between  those who want to progress toward the new things that will  emerge from the peace agreements and those who would like to  return to the past. I think that is where the problem of the  primary elections lies. The electoral struggle dealt with the  path from the left to the right. I disagree with that approach  because it leads to a false polarization in the country. If  there is going to be a polarization in the country, it must be a  polarization in the new terms. The interest is not in whether  there is going to be a government of the right or of the left  because there will not be a leftist government in El Salvador.  It will be a government of the past or the future. ARENA  represents a government of the past that says: I am in command  and you will obey. We represent a government of the future born  from the spirit of the agreements. We are all going to work  together and seek a national consensus to take the country  forward without exclusions. This, for me, is the real and  central point that we must explain clearly during the runoff  elections, because I think it will help clarify the country's  real situation.    [Funes] We thank you for your visit this morning, Dr.  Zamora.</p>

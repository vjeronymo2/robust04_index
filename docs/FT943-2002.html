			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australis pins high subscription hopes to satellite - A look at an energetic venture racing to provide a pay-TV service by the beginning of 1995 Anyone trying to locate the Sydney headquarters of Australis Media should look out for the limos. Australia's would-be pay-TV company recently moved to a central docklands area, and the big, smart cars parked outside look startlingly incongruous alongside terraced houses and building sites. But few, if any, belong to Australis. Rather they are testament to a stream of American-based programming executives passing through the company's doors as it tries to get Australia's first significant pay-TV service up and running by the beginning of 1995. There is no mistaking the energy which surrounds this effort. Employees debate technical questions in the lift. Mr Neil Gamble, chief executive, exudes confidence. The meetings seem incessant. 'It's a day and night job at present,' says Mr Gamble. 'The time zones start in the morning with America and end in the evening with London.' But the big question is whether a new company can amass the technical, financial and marketing skills necessary to produce a saleable package in such a short time - and, simultaneously, play the complex political game which surrounds the media business in Australia. There are, after all, some formidable entrenched competitors, in the shape of Mr Kerry Packer, owner of Australia's biggest commercial TV network, and Mr Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation has TV and newspaper interests across three continents. Two years ago, Australis was no more than an idea. The company began as the brainchild of Mr Stephen Cosser, a former chief executive of the Channel 10 network, and was officially incorporated in April 1993 to hold multipoint distribution systems (MDS) licences for the Sydney and Melbourne markets. An MDS provides local distribution of a service from a central satellite receiving point to individual customers. Interests now included within the Australis group launched Newsvision, a 24-hour news service put together for the hotel market, in June 1992. Teleitalia, an Italian language service, followed in 1993. More recently, Chinese and Arabic services have been added as more generally available programming. The subscription base for all four, however, is small. Australis, having recruited some prominent members of Australia's business community to its board, floated on the stock market a year ago. But its profile changed dramatically in November, when it acquired one of the two commercially-available satellite licences. These allow delivery of broadcast subscription services to most of Australia via an Optus satellite - a much bigger proposition. The licences had been auctioned off by the federal government earlier in 1993, and the big existing media operators had been outbid. Australis then strengthened its pay-TV delivery position by scooping up more MDS licences in another federal auction, held this year. Initially at least, it plans to use this mixture of satellite and MDS to get programmes into people's homes, thus obviating the need for satellite dishes at receiving premises. But time pressures on Australis are now mounting. Australia's small population base, of about 18m people, means that the country is unlikely to sustain many pay-TV operators. Within two or three years, alternative delivery mechanisms - notably cable - will probably be widely available. Publicly, Mr Gamble is ambivalent about the threat. He claims, with some justification, that Australia's geography gives satellite an inherent advantage. But he adds: 'Nevertheless, cable will be here, and cable is a long-term technology and we're not running it down. We think it is an important technology and we're going to use it - but we think that the window which (satellite) provides for us in the next couple of years is so substantial that we can have a major foothold by 1997.' Assuming, that is, Australis can get an attractive programming package into the marketplace. Setting up all the programming agreements, service facilities, financial and legal structures, is a Herculean task. The target is a 'bundled' 10-channel package, covering films, sport, news and general entertainment. 'There's going to be some form of gold, silver and bronze packaging, priced accordingly. The most expensive will be the sports and first release movie channels,' says Mr Gamble. But, to date, Australis' main programming announcement has concerned sport only. A joint venture has been set up with Liberty Sports/Prime, which in turn is part of the giant TCI cable group in the US. This has acquired rights to next February's Australia/West Indies Test cricket series, the Rugby League World Cup in England later in 1995, and a solid spread of other events. Elsewhere, by contrast, programming details remain scant - although TCI, which has an investment in Australis and a senior executive on the Australian company's board, has also entered a joint venture to develop a movie channel. Meantime, the 10-channel bundling arrangement requires agreement between all three licence-holders - Australis (with four channels), Continental Century (four), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (two) - and formal approval by Australia's Trade Practices Commission. On other fronts, there are similar signs that Australis is edging towards its goal, but still has a considerable distance to cover. A customer service centre site has been selected in Adelaide, for example, bringing financial assistance from the South Australian authorities, but staff have yet to be recruited and trained. Agreement has also been reached for the supply of reception equipment, and 200,000 units ordered. There is the question of money. Australis - whose institutional shareholders include the Australian Mutual Provident, Bankers Trust, J. P. Morgan, and Cigna, the US insurer - raised ADollars 35m (USDollars 25.7m) when it came to the stock market. It secured another ADollars 175.5m by a share and debenture placing. But the sport venture cost has been put at up to ADollars 50m (split 50-50 with Liberty/Prime), and the MDS licences cost ADollars 66m. The operating loss for the 12 months to end-June was more than ADollars 19m. Mr Gamble's aim is to attract 1m subscribers in the first three years. 'I have yet to find anyone who, once they understand what it's all about, doesn't say 'Where do I sign?'' he says. 'So we think a million is reasonable. Remember, we're 10 years behind the US schedule, we're four or five years behind the UK, we're four years behind New Zealand, and we're eight years behind South Africa.' If that target is attained, Australis' chief executive predicts that the company could be profitable by 'the back of the third year'. 'We don't clean out all the losses, but the curve changes in year three,' he says.</p>

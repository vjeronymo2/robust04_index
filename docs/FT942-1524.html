			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Patten to issue apology in court Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is expected to agree in court today to pay damages and to apologise unreservedly to Birmingham's chief education officer whom he called 'a nutter'. A solicitor for Mr Patten is expected to admit that his remarks about Professor Tim Brighouse were untrue and without justification. Mr Patten's comments were made while he was speaking to a fringe meeting at last October's Tory party conference. He said Birmingham education authority was useless and had apointed 'this nutter' as director. He accused Prof Brighouse, chief education officer in Oxfordshire between 1978 and 1989, of 'blathering away about education dreams and visions' and getting the county's service into a 'dreadful muddle' before he was made professor of education at Keele University 'as a reward'.

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS COUNTY ASSESSOR;  </P> <P> 3 EMPLOYEES CHALLENGING BOSS AGAIN  </P> <P> Ever since Bradley L. Jacobs became Orange County assessor 15 years ago, his  only political challenges have come from his own employees.  </P> <P> The June 5 election is no different. Three employees are running against the  boss.  </P> <P> "There aren't any issues in this election. I am carrying out the laws and the  state Constitution equally and fairly for everyone," said the 58-year-old  Jacobs.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you why my employees run against me," he said. "It is not unique  to Orange County. It happens in assessor's offices all over the state."  </P> <P> "It is tough to run against your boss," admitted David J. Holbert, 45, an  18-year appraiser in Jacobs' office. "If I don't win this election or the next  one, I could be in trouble."  </P> <P> It was Holbert who staged one of the most significant challenges against Jacobs  in 1986, winning 33% of the vote. But those votes did not come cheaply. Holbert  spent $225,000 of his own money inherited from his mother's estate.  </P> <P> "What I need to do is pick up another 18% of the vote," Holbert said, adding  that if he were elected to the $80,000-a-year job he would protect the interest  of home owners, assess property fairly and be accountable to the taxpayers of  Orange County. Holbert said he has spent about $42,000 of his own money so far  in the election.  </P> <P> The other candidates, Larry L. Bales and Victor J. Fulladosa, have spent  considerably less on their campaigns, but both said they think they have a good  shot at winning the election.  </P> <P> Bales, 48, a longtime employee in the assessor's office, called on the County  Board of Supervisors to appoint a special assessment appeals board to handle  the current controversy over cable television operators' property tax  assessments, which rose from $2.5 million to $13.5 million over the past year.  </P> <P> "The appointment of a special appeals board would remove the political stigma  surrounding the issues. . . ," Bales said.  </P> <P> "Morale in the assessor's office is terrible," said Fulladosa, 59, an auditor  in the office for a dozen years. "There has been a 25% turnover. . . . Managers  don't talk to the employees, and the employees get ticked off, and when they  get a chance, they leave."  </P> <P> Fulladosa said that, if elected, he would "restore efficiency and effectiveness  in the assessor's office, bring competency back into top-level management and  zealously protect Proposition 13 legislation."  </P> <P> Jacobs pointed out that he was appointed assessor in 1975 in the wake of a  political corruption scandal that forced his predecessor, Jack Vallerga, to  resign after convictions for grand theft and misuse of public funds.  </P> <P> "I have paid attention to honesty and integrity," Jacobs said. "I have also  brought new technology and management techniques to the assessor's office. This  is a 50- to 80-hour job a week."  </P> <P> But Bales charged that large corporations are getting special treatment.  </P> <P> "Brad Jacobs has neglected to assess large corporations their fair share," he  said. "Although mandated by state law, hundreds of audits have not been  completed . . . due to a lack of action -- some as long as eight years or more.  Many special-interest taxpayers have avoided paying taxes even after being  audited."  </P> <P> Fulladosa said Jacobs has never been an appraiser or auditor and does not  understand the issues.  </P> <P> "It is like electing a sheriff that has never been a policeman," Fulladosa  said.  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY ASSESSOR  </P> <P> Bradley L. Jacobs  </P> <P> Home: Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Age: 58  </P> <P> Occupation: Incumbent  </P> <P> Background: Has been county assessor since 1975, when he was appointed to fill  the unexpired term of Jack Vallerga, who was removed from office after being  convicted of grand theft and misuse of public funds. His election challenges  over the last 15 years have come from his own employees.  </P> <P> Issues: Jacobs has vowed not to back down or grant special treatment to  companies or individuals because they have a lot of money or a lot of  influence.  </P> <P> David J. Holbert  </P> <P> Home: Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Age: 45  </P> <P> Occupation: An appraiser in the assessor's office for 18 years.  </P> <P> Background: He ran against Jacobs four years ago and spent $225,000 on the  campaign, receiving 33% of the vote. He has spent $42,000 so far in this  election.  </P> <P> Issues: He says the county assessor should be an advocate for all the people in  Orange County. He claims that the current philosophy in the county assessor's  office is to maximize tax revenue regardless of the fairness of the decisions.  </P> <P> Larry L. Bales  </P> <P> Home: Tustin  </P> <P> Age: 48  </P> <P> Occupation: An auditor in the assessor's office for 21 years.  </P> <P> Issues: He says he is running against Jacobs because he believes special  interests are not paying their fair share in taxes. If elected, he says, he  would strive for fair taxation for all and make sure all the activities within  the county assessor's office comply with the Revenue and Taxation codes and the  state Constitution.  </P> <P> Victor J. Fulladosa  </P> <P> Home: Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Age: 59  </P> <P> Occupation: Has been an auditor in the assessor's office for 12 years.  </P> <P> Background: He spent 20 years as a Marine Corps aviator and received a Bronze  Star in Vietnam. He has also worked as a licensed real estate broker and a  federal and state income tax consultant.  </P> <P> Issues: He promises to restore efficient and effective service to the public  and eliminate deliberate understaffing. If elected, he says, he would run for  only two terms.  </P></p>

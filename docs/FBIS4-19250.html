			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers Lashes Out Strongly at </F> Labor Party"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Lubbers said  that the Social Democrats want to make too few savings, which  means that unemployment will not drop sufficiently. "It is a  shame that the Labor Party (PvdA) wants too few savings, because  by acting in such a way, it is setting back employment in  advance," he said. The prime minister also believes that the  PvdA is hindering the necessary reform of social security. "All  political parties see the need to tackle the Pensions Act and  Health Law. Moreover, it is mentioned in the conclusions of the  parliamentary committee of inquiry that looked into the question  of social security. Only the PvdA is refusing to go along with  this." Yesterday evening, Lubbers said he was extremely  concerned about the developments in the PvdA: "We must avoid  abandoning the steady course steered in recent years and taking  a turn to the left. Doing so would mean wiping out the good  results of all our achievements over the past few years."    Yesterday, the PvdA did not respond to Lubbers' criticism.    The prime minister was noticeably friendly toward D66  [Democrats 66]. He believes that the CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal] has "most in common" with that party in the area of  socioeconomic policy. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] could also count on glowing words from Lubbers. The  VVD election platform contains "many good elements," he said,  even if making a 10 percent reduction in social benefits is  taking things too far in his opinion.    It is also notable that one of Lubbers's party colleagues,  Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik Kooijmans, is much more positive  about the PvdA and its leading candidate Wim Kok. This week in  VRIJ NEDERLAND, Kooijmans says that the CDA must recognize that  after the elections the PvdA will be the largest party, with Kok  becoming prime minister. The minister believes that his party  should not hesitate to join a cabinet that is under the  leadership of a PvdA prime minister.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 June, the Chinese Communist Party delegation  laid a wreath at the monument to the Chinese who fought in  Cuba's wars of independence a century ago. In the square at Vina  and L street in Havana, there is a modest monument to our Asian  brothers who during the great struggle for freedom did not  defect or betray the cause.</p>

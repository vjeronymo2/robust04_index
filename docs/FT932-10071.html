			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Trainees press case for loans - Legal briefs THE Trainee Solicitors Group has approached UK clearing banks and building societies in its search for an institution prepared to operate a centralised loan scheme for prospective trainees. Graduates hoping to qualify as solicitors in England and Wales must take the new legal practice course. Fees for the nine-month course total Pounds 5,000, almost double the cost of the old Law Society finals course. Students also need about Pounds 3,500 for living expenses. Grants for the course are discretionary and presently only 38 per cent of local authorities provide some form of assistance. The burden of funding has thus shifted to the prospective trainee. This has raised fears that, unless a loan scheme can be secured, the profession will only be open to those with private means. Trainees will demand mandatory grants for the course and the introduction of soft loans at a mass lobby of parliament next Monday.</p>

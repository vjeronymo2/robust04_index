			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 11 (CTK) -- In a statement given to  CTK today, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac said that as  attempts made so far prove that an agreement between the leaders  of the parliamentary parties and movements was unfeasible, he  agreed with a pragmatic proposal by the newly emerged  Alternative of Political Realism.    The alternative, established on Thursday [10 February]  within  the government coalition major partner, Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), proposes to form a government of a  broader coalition without top politicians and with the  participation of independent experts which would operate until  early elections.    Roman Kovac has joined the alternative, along with ten HZDS  deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, also an HZDS  member.    Kovac said he expected the broad coalition government to  draw  inspiration from the political programs of the individual  parties and to try to stabilize the economy and other vitally  important spheres of society. He called cruel and unjust the  statement made by Prime Minister and HZDS leader Vladimir Meciar  that the new coalition's common denominator would be only  "plundering."    Although he is attracted by the ideas embedded in the HZDS  statutes, he has the right to his own opinion and to defend it,  Kovac said. He underlined he saw that realization of the appeal  of the alternative was an acceptable way of deblocking the  operation of the parliament. He does not find it either  undemocratic or immoral, he added.    "On the contrary, everybody bound to shoulder social and  political responsibility, should fulfill it according to his  (her) best conscience," Kovac says in the statement.</p>

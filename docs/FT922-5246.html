			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: The great top-down fallacy Is your company trying to become leaner, faster and more competitive by 'empowering' its employees? If so, and the company is British, there is a strong chance that it is going about the process in the wrong way. First, too many UK companies start the change process from grand abstractions such as 'culture' or 'better communications', rather than from challenges which people in the front line can understand, such as specific aspects of better customer service. Second, companies fall for the 'top-down' fallacy: the idea that all the necessary changes (new structures, reward mechanisms and so on) should be decided at the top of the company, and then 'cascaded' down the organisation. Instead, a 'top-bottom-middle' approach is far more effective, in which the initiative for changing all sorts of smaller-scale company practices is handed directly to local teams in the places where the issues manifest themselves.

Third, too many companies attempt to spread the learning created through these local initiatives by trying to draw it up to the top and push it down again. Instead, they should promote learning across the organisation. Fourth, changes in the company's infrastructure - its formal organisation, pay mechanisms, budgeting systems and so on - should be left until after the other steps.

Though primarily a promotional tool, the booklet is of wider value for the challenges it throws at UK management. Contrary to sceptics' claims, it insists that empowerment is possible in Britain. But it has a sting in its tail: 'The question for British chief executives is whether they have the conviction, the will and the ability to lead their companies in this way.'</p>

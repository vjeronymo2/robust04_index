			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> REGULAR USE OF MALATHION SURPRISES ENVIRONMENTALISTS;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: GROUPS IN THE COUNTY ASSAIL THE SPRAYING OF FARMLAND WITH THE  PESTICIDE, WHICH IS USED ELSEWHERE TO FIGHT MEDFLIES. GROWERS SAY THE CRITICS  ARE OVERREACTING.  </P> <P> After gearing up for a possible fight against aerial spraying of malathion if  fertile Medflies are discovered in Ventura County, some environmentalists  expressed surprise Thursday after learning that county fields have been doused  with malathion for years.  </P> <P> Moorpark Councilwoman Eloise Brown raised the issue earlier this week in a  public complaint that a helicopter pilot hired by Boskovich Farms had sprayed  malathion on an 18-acre onion field near homes in Moorpark on Sunday to  eradicate a bug called the thrip.  </P> <P> Although the pilot was not required to inform city officials beforehand, Brown  demanded that the city be notified whenever aerial spraying occurs. The  farmland is owned by the city and leased to Boskovich Farms.  </P> <P> Environmentalists elsewhere in the county said Thursday that they are disturbed  that malathion is being sprayed on crops growing near homes, not only by  Boskovich Farms, but also by other county growers.  </P> <P> "I've been waiting to know when Ventura County is going to spray malathion, and  now I know it's already going on," said Paul Herzog, an environmentalist and  member of the Conejo Valley Greens. "We've seen reports coming from L.A. County  that people are getting sick from this kind of thing."  </P> <P> Herzog, who also works with the Ventura County Food Safety Group, a coalition  of growers, environmentalists and agriculture officials, said Boskovich Farms  may not have broken any law, but the incident heightens the distrust homeowners  have about pesticides.  </P> <P> "It's a response to people feeling they're being bombarded from the sky,"  Herzog said.  </P> <P> Margaret Kirnig, a member of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition who  lives in the Moorpark area, said she also was surprised that the Moorpark field  was sprayed with malathion, a practice that could kill off beneficial insects.  </P> <P> "I don't think people knew," Kirnig said.  </P> <P> In eradication programs to wipe out the Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles  County neighborhoods, the effects of malathion spraying have raised a storm of  protest. The Medfly is not yet a problem in Ventura County, but agricultural  officials are worried that it will become one and have vowed to spray if  fertile flies are found.  </P> <P> In the Medfly program, the pesticide is mixed with a sticky bait intended to  attract fertile insects and generally sprayed over wide areas that often  include residential neighborhoods. As used in Ventura County against other  pests, the water-based spray is more concentrated but is intended to be sprayed  only on farmland.  </P> <P> Malathion is one of 183 chemical pesticides used in Ventura County to protect  crops from pest damage, according to county agricultural reports on pesticide  use.  </P> <P> About 1,558 pounds of the pesticide were sprayed in the county in 1988, a small  percentage of the 2.8 million pounds of chemicals sprayed by local farmers that  year, the most recent year for which figures are available. In 1988, malathion  was used 76 times.  </P> <P> Malathion is among the safest chemical pesticides, Deputy Agricultural  Commissioner Dave Buettner said.  </P> <P> Buettner said Ventura County growers have applied chemicals considered more  toxic than malathion to their crops, including at least 18 other chemicals  linked to birth defects or suspected of causing cancer. Those chemicals were  listed in a Ventura County Grand Jury report on pesticides released earlier  this month.  </P> <P> "I think, safety wise, they're using a material that is as safe as they can  use," Buettner said, referring to malathion.  </P> <P> The relative safety of the chemical when contrasted with known carcinogenic  chemicals, however, failed to appease malathion opponents.  </P> <P> Stan Greene, a member of the environmentalist group Citizens to Preserve the  Ojai, said he had heard previous reports of malathion spraying in the rural  Ojai Valley. Despite assurances about the pesticide's safety, neighbors are  concerned about exposure to malathion, he said.  </P> <P> "They ought to give the people who live there notice so that they can protect  themselves," Greene said. "If there are any residents near where this is going  on, they've got a right to know about it."  </P> <P> One farm industry representative portrayed the response from environmentalists  as an overreaction, given the number of other chemicals used to eradicate  insects.  </P> <P> "It's probably one of the most innocuous, but unfortunately because of all the  publicity that's been received because of the Medfly infestations, malathion  has received a bad rap," said Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura  County Farm Bureau.  </P> <P> At least one other environmentalist agreed that malathion has generated more  public opposition than it deserves.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency has studied 50 cancer-causing pesticides  used on produce, said Frances Scharli, president and founder of Mothers and  Others for Safe Food, a consumer group based in Ventura.  </P> <P> Scharli said she does not oppose aerial spraying of malathion. Homeowners who  live near agricultural areas should view agricultural treatment of malathion  differently than mass spraying of suburban neighborhoods, she said.  </P> <P> "I'm not endorsing malathion. But if we're going to start targeting something,  we need to start targeting known carcinogens," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Morgan Crucible Morgan Crucible will find the brave new accounting world a hostile place. Yesterday's Pounds 61.3m pre-tax profit was struck after Pounds 18.6m fair value provisions against acquisitions. If the Accounting Standards Board gets its way, such costs will in future be charged against profits. Having already restated 1991 profits downwards in accordance with FRS3, Morgan may have to break out the red ink once again. Yet its predilection for acquisition accounting comes as no surprise. Yesterday's 11 per cent fall in the shares reflects deeper concerns. The expiry of its self-imposed moratorium on rights issues prompts the question of how Morgan will fund itself. The Pounds 55m cash outflow last year suggests internal resources will provide, at best, a partial solution. Even allowing for the effect of exchange rates on the company's dollar debt, 67 per cent gearing leaves little leeway for borrowing. The sale of Holt Lloyd and other businesses might yield Pounds 60m this year. The suspicion remains that the market will be asked to put up additional capital before long. That will be difficult to justify while operating margins are being squeezed. Exposure to continental Europe and the automotive industries suggest a tough 1993, even though sterling's devaluation and Morgan's position as a low-cost producer will help offset these pressures. But without any organic earnings growth beneath the accounting mulch, shareholders should feel under no obligation to dig deep on the company's behalf.</p>

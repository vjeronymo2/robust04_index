			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Confidence 'declining' in northern England CONFIDENCE is declining in the north, says the sixth survey in two years of about 800 companies by Latham, Crossley and Davis, the Manchester, Wigan and Chorley accountancy firm. The firm says the recovery in northern England is in danger of stagnating because too few companies are looking for new markets, developing new products or finding alternatives to the banks for financing growth. The research, completed two weeks ago, asked companies to rate their confidence on a scale of one to 10. The average rating in the latest survey was 5.3 compared with 5.5 in the middle of last year, 6.5 last November and 6.25 in April this year. 'The drop in confidence reflects the patchy nature of the recovery,' Mr Keith Seeley, the firm's managing partner, said yesterday. 'Leasing businesses and automotive services companies expressed continued high confidence, but engineering companies scored their optimism much lower.' Nearly two thirds of companies in the survey expected any increase in orders to come from established customers buying existing products. Only 26 per cent were developing new products or seeking new markets while only 10 per cent foresaw exports as their main sales boost. Nearly half expected to use a bank overdraft or loans to finance growth, while 39 per cent were trying to use cash retained in the business.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCCANEERS WIN UNDER NEW COACH, 26-13;  </P> <P> NFC: TESTAVERDE RUNS FOR 105 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN TO LEAD TAMPA BAY OVER  VIKINGS, WHO BENCH GANNON.  </P> <P> The Tampa Bay Buccaneers didn't spend a lot of time moping around when Ray  Perkins was fired as coach. They got ready for the Minnesota Vikings.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of an extra week of preparation and the relaxed atmosphere  created by interim coach Richard Williamson, the Buccaneers stunned the  Vikings, 26-13, Sunday and stayed alive in the playoff picture with their first  sweep of a season series with an NFC Central Division rival.  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde, criticized at times for his reluctance to run out of the  pocket, scrambled for 105 yards and one touchdown in seven carries before a  crowd of 47,272 that watched Williamson's debut end with a Gatorade drenching  led by the Buccaneers' quarterback.  </P> <P> "He prepared us well," Testaverde said. "He gave us a positive attitude and  positive outlook on everything. One of the things he told us was go out and  have a lot of fun.  </P> <P> "It's been as loose and relaxed as I've ever seen it since I've been here," the  fourth-year quarterback said. "I think that's a big part in why we won."  </P> <P> Testaverde scored on a 48-yard run in the first quarter and threw a 25-yard  touchdown pass to Mark Carrier for a 23-0 halftime lead. He also set up three  of Steve Christie's four field goals as the Buccaneers (6-8) took advantage of  eight Minnesota turnovers.  </P> <P> The victory was the second in a row for Tampa Bay (6-8), which stopped a  six-game losing streak two weeks ago but couldn't save Perkins' job. Williamson  replaced him on Dec. 3 and had extra time to prepare for Minnesota because of  Tampa Bay's open date last week.  </P> <P> The Vikings (6-8) lost for the ninth consecutive time outdoors and face an  uphill battle to claim the wild-card playoff spot that a five-game winning  streak left them in a position to chase.  </P> <P> Among the Vikings' eight turnovers were two fumbles that stopped scoring  threats. And an interception by the Buccaneers' Rodney Rice set up a first-half  field goal.  </P> <P> Viking quarterback Rich Gannon was benched after completing only two of seven  passes for eight yards in the first half.  </P> <P> Wade Wilson, playing for the first time since suffering a thumb injury in Week  3, then threw for 374 yards, including 75 on a scoring pass play to Hassan  Jones.  </P></p>

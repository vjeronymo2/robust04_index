			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Bovespa index surges further 11.6% Sao Paulo saw an influx of foreign money into Brazilian stocks boost the Bovespa index by 8,630, or 11.6 per cent, to a new high of 82,686 by the close, after soaring 8 per cent in local currency terms on Monday. Turnover totalled Cr196.6bn (USDollars 420.6m), the heaviest since December 20. Investors bought on hopes of rapid congressional approval for a key element of the government's economic plan. Congress is expected to vote later this week on the proposal by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister, calling for a social welfare fund. Analysts added that stronger demand, stemming from some newly created emerging market equity funds, has also prompted foreign investors to rush into the market. Mexican equities also touched a new record high in early trading to pass the 2,800 level on positive expectations for Telmex earnings due soon, before turning back on profit-taking to leave the IPC index a net 5.95 up at 2,787.32. This topped Monday's record close of 2,781.37. The index was as high as 2,810.5 in early trade. In Venezuela, investors reacted fairly positively to the announcement of a new cabinet by President-elect Caldera which counter-balanced news of a slowdown in electricity prices that is likely to have an effect on the earnings of Electricidad de Caracas. The shares slipped to 284 bolivars before regaining some lost ground to close at 300 bolivars, down 73 bolivars. The Bursatil index advanced 1.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] says in a  report that central Zululand will be the most difficult area in  which to conduct free and fair elections, but that voting in  kwaZulu-Natal will not be postponed. Speaking to journalists  after a brief visit to the region, two IEC commissioners, Mr.  Dikgang Moseneke and Miss Gay McDougall, said they had detected  a strong wish among the inhabitants to take part in the  election. Mr. Moseneke said that if necessary the IEC would  transfer polling stations from trouble spots. Security would be  stepped up and routes to the polling stations protected by the  SADF [South African Defense Force].</p>

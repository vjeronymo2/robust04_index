			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Belgium reduces rates Helped by the continued strength of its currency against the D-Mark, Belgium yesterday joined the Netherlands and Denmark in the latest round of European interest rate reductions, writes Conner Middelmann. The Belgian central bank shaved 10 basis points off its key central rate to 7.40 per cent and lowered its overnight lending rate by 10 basis points to 9.10 per cent. On Tuesday, the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 5.70 per cent and the Danes lowered their discount rate by 25 basis points. Following Tuesday's discount rate cut, the Danish central bank yesterday lowered its key rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent. All three currencies remained buoyant against the D-Mark on widespread hopes that the rate cuts would spur economic recovery. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the Belgian and French francs are now back in their former 2.25 per cent trading bands against the D-Mark, while the Danish krone is hovering just below the floor. The Belgian franc firmed to BFr20.73 per D-Mark, from Tuesday's close of BFr20.76. The Danish krone continued to gain ground against the D-Mark and finished at DKr3.904, compared with DKr3.910 the previous day. The Dutch guilder moved up to Fl 111.97 per DM100 from Fl 112.0 on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar had a bumpy ride, dropping sharply on rumours that Bank of Canada governor John Crow was about to resign and then jumping on the news that Mr Gordon Thiessen, currently the bank's senior deputy governor, would become central bank governor in January when Mr Crow's seven-year appointment ends. Mr Crow is widely respected for his tough anti-inflation stance, and his rumoured departure sparked fears that the new government might soften its commitment to low inflation in favour of inflating the economy. However, Mr Thiessen's appointment calmed market fears of a more lax policy. 'Thiessen will follow the same policies as his predecessor,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency analyst at UBS, noting that Mr Thiessen has been with the bank for 30 years and is the joint architect of the disinflation policy that has brought Canadian inflation to historical lows. In the morning the Canadian dollar slumped as low as CDollars 1.3482 to the US dollar, at which point traders reported intervention by the Bank of Canada to smoothe the currency. After Mr Thiessen's appointment was announced, the currency rallied to CDollars 1.3370. Late in London it was trading around CDollars 1.335. Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, said the government remained committed to a low inflation policy aiming at a 1 to 3 per cent inflation range from 1995 to 1998. Meanwhile, the US dollar retraced some of its recent gain against the Japanese yen, closing at Y110.55, down from Y111.05 on Tuesday. It finished in New York at Y110.34. Although most market observers think the dollar will continue to appreciate against the yen in the coming months, many expect it to range-trade between Y110.50 and Y112 in the near term. The dollar's decline was attributed mainly to profit-taking in anaemic trading conditions. 'The market is very, very thin and it does not take much to move prices,' said a London currency dealer. Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) also put a slight dampener on the US currency, with the Fed seen sticking to its neutral policy stance for now. 'Their open-market oper-ations (following the meeting) highlighted that they are not moving to a tighter policy stance just yet,' said UBS's Mr Cunningham. Against the D-Mark, the dollar fell as low as DM1.6978 before recouping some of its loss to finish at DM1.7020, down from DM1.7080 on Tuesday. In New York it ended at DM1.7015. The Swiss franc continued to strengthen against the D-Mark, breaching technical resistance at SFr0.8470 and firming to SFr0.8433. It ended at SFr0.845, up from SFr0.849 at Tuesday's close. Traders said the move was made possible by thin volumes in quiet pre-Christmas trading. According to one London trader, the Swiss franc is unlikely to strengthen above SFr0.840 against the D-Mark, and looking to next year he expects it to weaken back to around SFr0.86/87 in the first quarter as the Swiss central bank continues its cautious easing policy. The US dollar's weakness enabled sterling to break through resistance at Dollars 1.490 to end at Dollars 1.4950. It closed little changed against the D-Mark at DM2.5450, up from DM2.5425. In the money market, the March short sterling futures contract rose by 0.04 point to 94.78. The contract looked cheap after Tuesday's sell-off, a money dealer said. The Bank of England initially announced a Pounds 1.7bn shortage, which was later revised downwards to Pounds 1.25bn. In early operations the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 341m, followed by further morning operations where it bought Pounds 492m of bills. In the afternoon it purchased another Pounds 27m of bills, and finally provided late assist-ance of around Pounds 415m.</p>

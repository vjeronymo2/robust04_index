			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: NFC surges to Pounds 116m and plans restructure NFC, the transport group, yesterday announced a restructuring to focus on two core businesses which will lead to a management shake-up. It also reported that pre-tax profits had jumped to Pounds 116.3m (Pounds 59.3m) for the 40 weeks to July 10 on the back of the sale of Waste Management and property disposals. The restructuring package is part of a strategic review due to be completed by the year end. The news was welcome in the City and the shares rose 3p to 270p on a day the market fell. The UK BRS transport operations and Exel Logistics, the distribution and storage business, are to be merged. While on the international side, relocations and removals are to be expanded. Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'The transport businesses were becoming more similar making it sensible to integrate them. The move will give rise to significant cost savings.' Before exceptionals profits edged up to Pounds 62.3m (Pounds 61.5m). Operating profit rose 14 per cent to Pounds 79.2m as sales increased 11 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn. The full-year profit is projected at Pounds 95m, the lower end of previously indicated 'best view' range. In the future it will not issue best view ranges after taking legal advice. Mr Watson said trading remained difficult in mainland Europe, particularly in Germany and Spain, while UK recovery was proving patchy. Provisions will cover the rationalisation which will be taken as an exceptional charge at the year end. However, Mr Watson declined to say how much it will cost or what benefits the change will bring in cost savings. The group would continue to keep its other businesses, such as truck rental and car leasing, and had stemmed the losses at Links, the parcels business. Mr Watson hopes the refocusing will enable the group to expand its international relocations and removals network. 'We are the biggest player with above 5 per cent of a market worth up to Pounds 7bn.' Mr Robbie Burns, managing director of Logistics is to take charge of the expanded transport business; Mr Graham Roberts moves from transport to become managing director of European operations and Mr Denis Olliver moves from Home Services to become managing director of International projects. Earnings per share rose to 17.5p (8.3p), although they were unchanged at 8.5p before exceptionals. The third interim dividend is raised to 1.6p (1.55p).</p>

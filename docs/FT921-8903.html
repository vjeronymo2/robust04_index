			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / No respite in wave of redundancies: The recession in manufacturing IS BRITAIN'S manufacturing industry undergoing a second wave of job cuts after the retrenchment of last year? Are companies which have fought to hang on to skilled labour now reluctantly biting the bullet again? Yesterday's unemployment figures, and the spate of redundancies which have yet to be reflected in official statistics, suggest that the answer to questions which are becoming increasingly sensitive as the election approaches is an unequivocal 'Yes.' In fact, the answer is a qualified 'No.' As the Engineering Employers' Federation put it yesterday: 'There isn't a second wave, but the first wave is continuing as we have always forecast.' Last December the federation predicted a further fall of 70,000 jobs in the year from the fourth quarter of last year, reducing the total to 1.82m. Recent events in industries as diverse as aerospace and machine tools suggest that could be a conservative estimate. On one hand, some companies are planning no further job cuts even though they see no immediate prospect of an improvement in business conditions. Vickers, the defence, medical equipment and luxury car group, has cut 1,300 jobs at its Rolls-Royce car plant in Crewe, but says 'the pain was last year'. In contrast, a second wave of job cuts is visible in chemicals. The Chemical Industries Association said: 'Companies are having to bring forward redundancies they were hoping to put off.' Individual companies were reluctant to concede they had miscalculated the length of the recession. Laporte, the specialist chemicals maker, said it was in the middle of a three-year job reduction programme. Bulk chemicals supplier Albright &amp; Wilson, part of Tenneco, the US conglomerate, said it 'started to wield the axe in June 1991. We are now turning our focus to other areas of cost savings.' ICI shed 7,000 workers last year, but said the losses were spread evenly through the year. It is in petrochemicals, the heaviest end of the industry, where a new round of jobs cuts is most apparent. Only yesterday BP Chemicals announced the loss of 180 jobs at two sites. Late last year BP Chemicals told each manufacturing site to look for ways of reducing costs. Only three sites have so far revealed job cuts but the exercise is continuing. The construction equipment industry is suffering a 'second wavelet' with a number of small redundancies in the past few weeks after heavy cuts last year. Mr David Barrell, director-general of the Federation of Manufacturers of Construction Equipment and Cranes, said many companies were 'holding their breath and hoping they do not have to make any more cuts. All it does is weaken the industry'. In aerospace, the recent job cuts at British Aerospace are part of a longer process, but are contributing to lay-offs in subcontractor companies which had until now avoided retrenchment. Ricardo International, the Bristol-based design engineer group, came through the year to June with no cuts in its aerospace side, but is now temporarily laying off 20 to 30 employees. In other sectors, the current round of job cuts is the 'first wave' of this recession. The machine-tool industry fought off heavy redundancies last year in the hope that conditions would improve this year. Over the past few weeks, however, some 600 job cuts have been announced in machine-tool factories from Brighton to Bridlington, threatening the permanent loss of highly skilled engineers from the workforce. The textile industry has played only a small role in recent rises in unemployment. 'There is no new wave of job cuts in textiles', said Mr Colin Purvis of the British Textile Federation. Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, confirms this view. 'We did the maximum up-front on pessimistic assumptions.' The long-term decline of the industry in the UK remains a fact of life, however. 'Redundancies are continuing at 4,000 to 5,000 a quarter out of a workforce of 420,000,' said Mr Purvis. 'This is related to companies' own performances. Most people are fairly sceptical about economic forecasts.'</p>

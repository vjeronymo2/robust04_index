			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Music from the soul - Concert Even in the early evening, when the traffic is still chasing round Parliament Square, the interior of Westminster Abbey is a surprisingly peaceful haven. It was a wise decision to hold the opening night of the BBC's Tavener festival there, as the composer's deeply religious music needs the hallowed air within its walls, the space afforded by its lofty majesty, if it is to breathe. The weekend festival was one of the annual series which the BBC devotes to portraits of 20th-century composers. With the exception of Janacek, featured last year, all have been living composers at a stage in their careers where a full-scale retrospective is due. John Tavener, who is 50 this week, has reached that point and it is a useful coincidence that he has also been caught at the height of new-found popularity. The success of The Protecting Veil has prompted a widespread interest in all of Tavener's music. As his style has become increasingly spare, he has been conveniently grouped with minimalists like Part and Glass, Gorecki and Nyman, who have simultaneously shot to popular recognition. The irony is that no composer is more of an individual than Tavener, treading the solitary path of spiritual self-discovery. His music may be repetitive like theirs, but it has arrived at this destination from a different place and for different reasons. At Westminster Abbey we heard the Akathist of Thanksgiving, completed in 1988 and a central example of what the mature Tavener is writing. Over a deep, bass drone a chorus invokes the glory of God. The music edges forward reluctantly, as if time is no object. Its chant-like melodies are unfolded by unaccompanied voices, sometimes overlaid by tolling bells, sometimes wafted aloft by a numinous halo of strings. By the end of its 90 minutes' duration, the work has achieved exultation, but without any struggle or dialectic. Tavener has simply stated his material and, with minor variations, re-affirmed it with increasing glorification. Received into the Russian Orthodox Church, echoing its diatonic chants, breathing its rarefied air, he has sought to adopt as much as possible of its language into all aspects of his music. How well does the music communicate? In the calm of the Abbey it seemed to me that the simplicity and beauty of the Akathist of Thanksgiving overcame most of the potential drawbacks, despite a structure which brings the same material round 11 times over. The blending of the counter-tenor soloists, James Bowman and Timothy Wilson, was suitably other-worldly. The trebles of the Westminster Abbey Choir floated in thirds like angels. Martin Neary directed the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra. At the Barbican, the festival's main venue, successes and failures were evenly balanced. Some of the miniatures - the settings of William Blake's 'The Lamb' and 'The Tiger', the Sixteen Haiku of Seferis - showed how effective Tavener's kind of simplicity can be, a single harmony or oriental texture being striking enough to catch the imagination. Other, longer works outstayed their welcome. Mandelion, an organ piece, wandered aimlessly; Palintropos, in effect a piano concerto, amused itself with atmospheric twiddlings which add up to nothing in particular. Perhaps Tavener is more in tune with popular movements than his ascetic image might suggest. As a young composer in the 1960s, he came to notice with pieces like The Whale and Celtic Requiem, both recorded on the Beatles' Apple label. The Requiem, a popularist theatre-piece with children, was performed on Saturday by the City of London Sinfonia under Martyn Brabbins and brought to life a slice of the 1960s. This was the decade of rock musicals, jazz cantatas and oriental mysticism. Soon after Tavener set out on his own spiritual journey. In the 1990s his popularity has surged again, this time buoyed on the wave of enthusiasm for his cello-and-orchestra work, The Protecting Veil. Steven Isserlis was the soloist on Sunday with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Gennady Rozhdestvensky, playing the music with the same unhurried lyricism that he brought to the best-selling recording. From the esteem accorded to Gorecki, Nyman and others, it seems that the public is hungry for music which is approachable like this, easy to absorb, gently uplifting. Whether they appreciate anything of the long religious quest that has led Tavener to write it is another matter.</p>

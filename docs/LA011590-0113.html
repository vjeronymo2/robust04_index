			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE GIVEN LAST RITES AS CANCER TAKES ITS TOLL  </P> <P> Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte was given last rites today in  the gravest crisis of his 18-month battle against terminal cancer, relatives  and his physician said.  </P> <P> "It's a really difficult situation," Dr. Jose Luis Saca said.  </P> <P> "He's dying."  </P> <P> Saca said Duarte's stomach and liver cancer, first diagnosed in June, 1988, had  spread throughout the abdominal cavity. He said the 64-year-old former  president was in a "stupor," only waking when stimulated by doctors.  </P> <P> Family members said a Roman Catholic priest had given Duarte the last rites, a  sacrament administered shortly before death.  </P> <P> The former president was given the last rites during a severe relapse in  September, but he later recovered. At that time Saca said Duarte appeared to  have "more lives than a cat."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG-MONEY FIGHTERS DON'T HAVE HUNGER TO ENTERTAIN  </P> <P> On the evening of Aug. 14, nearly $3 million was paid to two big-name  middleweight fighters who didn't fight.  </P> <P> Michael Nunn isn't "second to none," he's a bum who runs and doesn't look cute  doing it.  </P> <P> Iran Barkley punched as if he was underwater, when he bothered to throw a  punch.  </P> <P> These big-money bouts have nearly ruined the sport of boxing. Luckily, there is  a plethora of hungry boxers fighting on cable television every week to keep  real boxing fans entertained.  </P> <P> I salute the club fighters of American and hope Michael Nunn sleeps well at  night, knowing that he'll never get clocked by a real punch no matter how long  he's paid to dance around the ring and twitch his shoulders.  </P> <P> JEROLD KRESS  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris move from weakness to strength The outstanding feature yesterday was the move from weakness to strength in both Frankfurt and Paris, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT dug itself out of Friday's depression, but not before the Dax index had fallen nearly 40 points to a morning low of 2,035.76. Worries about possibly negative M3 and inflation indicators weighed it down, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. However, sentiment was rescued by January inflation figures from North Rhine Westphalia which, at 3.3 per cent per annum, were slower than expected. The Dax moved to an official close of 2,080.01, up a token 4.40, and carried on climbing in the post bourse to end at an Ibis-indicated 2,107.29, 3.5 per cent above its nadir. Turnover fell from DM13.7bn to DM10.5bn. At the official close there were more significant losses than gains among blue chips, but the rising dollar brought strength to the big three chemical stocks, where Bayer led with a gain of DM8.50 to DM351.50. Elsewhere, Siemens rose DM9.60 to DM715 with its weak profits news apparently digested and the pharmaceuticals group, Schering, put on DM42, or 4 per cent to DM1,065 on its BetaSeron prospects, and after a fall from a 1993/94 high of DM1,188.50. All this compensated for weakness in banks, depressed by their rights issues, and in automotive stocks. After hours, the March Dax future closed 39.5 higher at 2,129, and US buying took Bayer and Siemens further ahead, to DM358 and DM721 respectively. PARIS closed the account on a high note on lingering hopes that the Bank of France might make a small cut in interest rates this morning. Support for companies which have recently reported 1993 results also contributed to the improved sentiment which lifted the CAC-40 index by 30.52, or 1.4 per cent to 2,274.49. Turnover was firm at FFr5.4bn. Among the day's most actives UAP rose FFr43 or 7 per cent to FFr650 after the insurer made a favourable estimate for 1993 and said that it was seeking to expand into the UK in an effort to increase its market share. St Gobain continued to firm following last week's good earnings news, the shares adding another FFr22 or 3.3 per cent to FFr686, while Bouygues firmed FFr18 to FFr733 ahead of today's results. Both Euro Disney and Eurotunnel performed well, the former gaining FFr1.45 to FFr37.35 and the latter FFr2.05 to FFr51.95, lifted by news that the UK government had confirmed the route of the fast rail link from London to the Channel ports. AMSTERDAM built on Friday's advance and the AEX index pushed briefly through the 430 level during the session before settling back to close 1.23 higher at 429.75. Good gains continued to be achieved by the heavily weighted stocks, such as Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.60 at Fl 213.60. However, there was also strong activity elsewhere as investors digested positive news. Polygram, for instance, rose during the session to an all-time high on reports that it was involved in discussions to establish a new music-video television channel. The shares finally closed up Fl 1.90 at Fl 80.10. Fokker also went higher on reports that it had secured a Fl 250m contract to supply aircraft to a French airline, with the shares ending up Fl 1.50 to Fl 23.50. MILAN recouped Friday's losses on strength in the industrial sector. The Comit index improved 4.30 to 617.90. Montedison led the rise, gaining 1.9 per cent to L1,015 as hopes resurfaced for a recovery in this sector. Olivetti also benefited from renewed hopes that it would win the second cellular telecom licence to be awarded later this year, the shares putting on L79 to L2,358. Fiat was another of the day's gainers with suggestions that it might sell one of its divisions - Snia being mentioned. The carmaker added L66 to L4,510, and Snia L43 to L1,605. ZURICH recovered from early weakness to close steady, but in very limited trading, the SMI index closing 2.5 higher at 3,041.8. MADRID eased across the board after hitting a succession of all-time highs last week, the general index falling 2.29 to 339.01 in turnover of Pta33.9bn. In banks, BCH lost Pta80, or 2.5 per cent to Pta3,085 in volume of over 900,000 shares. DUBLIN was pulled back by a bout of profit-taking following the market's strong forward movement since the beginning of the year, said Mr Adrian O'Carroll at Dillon Read. The ISEQ index closed down 17.98 at 2,049.48. ATHENS continued its recovery after last week's corrections, the general index closing 27.46 higher at 1,176.83; but brokers were not sure of its next move, saying that there was support at 1,150, and resistance at 1,200. ISTANBUL tumbled by nearly 7 per cent as the central bank continued to raise short-term borrowing rates to defend the lira against the dollar. The composite index ended at a provisional 24,260.75, down 1,812.17.

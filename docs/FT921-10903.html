			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Bonds: SA bank plans D-Mark issue THE DEVELOPMENT Bank of South Africa is preparing a debut issue of D-Mark bonds in the international capital markets. The Republic of South Africa returned to the international arena to raise D-Mark funds last September, and followed up with an Ecu250m deal last month. However, a Dollars 200m Eurobond for the Independent Development Trust, a government-funded health, education and housing trust, had to be pulled last November when the African National Congress refused to back the deal. The ANC opposes new international borrowings by the present government and has said it may not honour any new loans. The Republic of South Africa owns 84 per cent of the Development Bank of South Africa, with the remaining 16 per cent in the hands of regional governments in South Africa. Bayerische Landesbank has won the mandate to arrange the DM100m medium-term bond issue, but officials there declined to give further details of the transaction. Yesterday, supply in the Ecu sector continued as Daiwa Europe brought a Ecu100m five-year deal for Kommuninvest, a Swedish local authority finance institution. Though considered fairly priced, the deal was reported to be faring badly as bankers struggled to find a market for a relatively unknown name in the international markets. The deal had strong parallels with last an Ecu issue last autumn for Municipality Finance, a Finnish institution: both are AA1 rated institutions, both are financing arms for the local government sector, and both carried guarantees, in the latest case from the county council of Orebro and 10 other municipalities. However, with little advance preparation for the deal, bankers reported that it was proving difficult to raise interest in the issuer, which had only borrowed internationally before in Swiss francs. This was despite a yield pick-up of around 30 basis points over British Gas's five-year Ecu issue, for an offered yield of 8.779 per cent.</p>

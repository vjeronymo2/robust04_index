			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C.'S KOLL CO. SELLS INDUSTRIAL PLANTS TO JAPANESE  </P> <P> In one of the largest sales of Orange County real estate this year, the Koll  Co. sold 24 industrial buildings -- half of them in the county -- for $138  million to Fujita Corp. USA, a Japanese developer with U.S. headquarters in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Scher-Voit Commercial Brokerage in Irvine, the broker on the deal, said it was  one of the largest purchases of industrial buildings in California this year.  </P> <P> The deal also included warehouse, light industrial, and research and  development buildings in San Diego, Los Angeles and the San Francisco area. In  all, the deal included 1.8 million square feet of space.  </P> <P> Among the larger properties sold by Koll in Orange County were a Garden Grove  business park at Garden Grove Boulevard and Western Avenue and the Toshiba  building in Irvine with 118,000 square feet of space.  </P> <P> Koll is a huge real estate developer based here that occasionally sells  buildings from its $4 billion in West Coast real estate holdings.  </P> <P> Fujita USA, though it has operated in the United States since 1972, is only a  small player in the California real estate market. The company specializes in  industrial buildings -- preferring to stay away from what it says is an  overbuilt office market -- and until now had owned only 13 buildings in the  state.  </P> <P> Fujita is a larger player in the Japanese real estate market, where it owns and  develops property as well as doing engineering and construction.  </P> <P> Industrial buildings are often a good investment in California's urban areas  because land is so expensive that few new factories or research and development  buildings are being constructed. That means landlords have less competition for  tenants in some areas.  </P> <P> Fujita USA said several other buyers had been interested in the Koll buildings  since they went on the block about three months ago but declined to identify  them.  </P> <P> Koll executives were said to be unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> No specific breakdown was available for how much the Orange County properties  accounted for the $138-million price tag. But with half the properties in the  county, the deal is sizable and likely ranks among the biggest real estate  transactions of the year here.  </P> <P> The other major deals this year also involved foreign buyers. Those were the  $104-million purchase of the Dana Point Resort by a Japanese kimono  manufacturer, Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp., and the $245-million sale of  two parcels to Australia's Qintex for construction of another resort hotel.  Qintex's deal for one of the parcels later fell through, however.  </P></p>

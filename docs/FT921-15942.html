			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: Pioneer Soloist of the Year - Queen Elizabeth Hall The competition that Pioneer Hi-Fi sponsor for the London Philharmonic Orchestra has just completed its sixth successive year of existence. It is a small competition, and its value is therefore that of real practical use to a young musician - a prize of Pounds 2,500, awarded by a panel of judges made up of musicians (including the LPO leader, David Nolan, and the conductor of the evening, Jan Latham-Koenig) and other professionals, and a concerto date with the LPO on the South Bank. It is exactly this sort of boost, modest but exactly judged, that genuinely serves a talented young performer at a crucial career stage - not the grossly over-inflated, over-publicised antics of the BBC Cardiff Singer of the Year and Young Musician of the Year shindigs. The finals of the latest Pioneer Competition at the QEH on Sunday, were to have shown us three young violinists each in a complete concerto performance with the LPO. Unfortunately, one suffered a back injury and had to withdraw; even so, there was plenty of interest in the remaining two. Surely no-one who heard the 18-year-old English girl, Lucy Jeal, could be in doubt that hers is a talent of a rare and precious kind, and that her winning of the prize was other than totally deserved. She undertook the Tchaikovsky concerto not as an exhaustively drilled competition warhorse but as a musical experience that she made blossom with fragrant freshness before our delighted ears. Everything about this lovely young player told of artistic personality already distinct and fully formed  -tone with its own definable character (not big and steely but warmly ductile), a gentle, sometimes quietly musing way with the phrases that was wholly personal, and utterly captivating. Miss Jeal's command of the virtuoso flourishes was bold but not always absolutely spot-on; in the highest reaches there was an occasional hint of walking-on-thin-ice. No doubt she will firm up on these technical matters before her Festival Hall concerto date; in any case, the wholeness of her musical grasp put them into proper perspective. The second player, the young Romanian Vesko Eschkenazy, gave us the Beethoven concerto. He plays with shining ease and freedom from top to bottom - no flutters, no shakiness, and (on this evidence) not much sensitivity to the unfolding of a musical argument. In all those moments of melodic or rhythmic definition where a performer can show his or her peculiar Beethovenian grasp, this performance remained resolutely neutral, bland, superficial. As tends to happen on such occasions, his particular strengths and weaknesses made themselves felt in unfair contrast to those of his predecessor.</p>

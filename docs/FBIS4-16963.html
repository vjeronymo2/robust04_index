			<p>BFN     [Text] At the request of journalists, Deputy Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk commented on the article:  Probable Plans of Improbable Enemy, published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA on 19 April. The article deals with the allegedly worked  out plans of landing Ukrainian troops in Kuban and the Don  [river]. Other so-called instances of the production of various  kinds of weapons here [in Ukraine] are provided in the article.    Tarasyuk referred to this article as an outright provocative  lie by the Moscow-based newspaper. According to him, this  refers, in particular, to information about the production of  tactical missiles at PivdenMash [southern machine-building plant  in Dnepropetrovsk] and work on manufacturing binary, chemical,  and bacteriological weapons allegedly under way here in Ukraine.    The deputy foreign minister reminded in this connection that  our state is a signatory of the convention banning the above  weapons and it strictly abides by its provisions. In Tarasyuk's  opinion, such publications prove that KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  probably takes an active part in fanning up anti-Ukrainian  sentiments in Russian society and tries to undermine the process  of normalizing relations between the two neighboring states.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Provisions behind fall at Gibbs Mew TAXABLE profits at Gibbs Mew, the 59 per cent family-owned brewer and commercial property company, fell 25 per cent from Pounds 503,000 to Pounds 377,000 even though trading profits edged ahead by Pounds 22,000 to Pounds 1.52. Behind the pre-tax decline was an exceptional charge of Pounds 262,000 which related to 'provisions against sums due from customers for loan and trading debts and guarantees arising under the customer support loan scheme secured by property and other assets'. Group sales advanced to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 9.75m). The rise in free trade volumes helped trading profits of the brewery division grow to Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.03m) on sales of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 8.58m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 129,000 relating to Gibbs' bid defence. Earnings contracted to 5.79p (7.03p) per share and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p.</p>

The average yield was 8.14%, down  from 9.11% at the last auction on May 11. It was the lowest rate since 30-year  bonds averaged 7.54% on Nov. 6, 1986. The bonds will carry a coupon interest  rate of 8.125%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,983.30. A total  of $9.75 billion in bonds was sold out of bids totaling $20.1 billion. In  addition, the Treasury auctioned special short-term debt instruments totaling  $15 billion, which included the first $5 billion raised to pay for the savings  and loan bailout.  </P></p>

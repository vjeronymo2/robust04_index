			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (2): Investment keeps the economy bubbling - Diversity of business sectors has helped Atlanta weather financial setbacks - Atlanta is pinning many of its economic hopes on what the 1996 Olympics will render The economic outlook for Atlanta is as cloudless as its best summer day. The 1996 Olympics have only strengthened what already was a strong positive trend. 'The Atlanta economy continues to expand at boom conditions with no evidence of serious slowing,' comments Mr Don Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta. Atlanta suffered only the mildest of downturns during the 1990-1991 US recession. Although the collapse of Eastern Airlines helped produce a net job loss of 20,500 in 1991, that has been the only negative figure for jobs in the entire decade between 1984 and 1993, see table below. In the ten years between 1984 and 1993, 487,600 net new jobs were created in Atlanta, including 83,500 in 1993. (And, through the first six months of this year, Mr Ratajczak says that job growth was 89,300 above the previous year). The diversity of Atlanta's economy, encompassing transportation, automotive manufacturing, wholesale distribution, ample retail, conventions and tourism, biotechnology, and telecommunications, has helped it weather the setbacks of any particular segment. Furthermore, its attractive local business conditions have proven a magnet for investment. In the period from 1984 to 1993, 1,506 companies, including 361 foreign businesses, have relocated to Atlanta and brought Dollars 80bn in investment. Between January and June this year, 83 more new companies, including 13 foreign businesses, expanded or relocated in Atlanta. According to the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, they represent a real estate investment alone of nearly Dollars 60m. Compared with the rest of the state of Georgia, metro Atlanta has been the overwhelmingly preferred site for relocation of foreign companies, which have more than Dollars 10bn invested in Georgia, according to a recent survey by KPMG Peat Marwick. The survey of 741 foreign-owned companies in Georgia found that the top three investors were the UK with Dollars 2.3bn, Japan with Dollars 2.2bn and the Netherlands with Dollars 1.5bn. A Lou Harris poll last year found that Atlanta was the first choice for locating a new facility by executives from the International Fortune 1,000. The city's relatively low operating costs, excellent transport facilities, reasonably priced housing and many amenities have helped it consistently rank among the top choices for relocation by US companies. Atlanta and Georgia also offer a number of tax and other incentives that make the choice more attractive. While investment has kept Atlanta's economy steadily bubbling, the Olympics has helped it become positively effervescent. More than Dollars 600m in Olympic construction is helping to drive a construction boom that was already under way in housing. Another Dollars 150m in city infrastructure improvements approved in July will push construction even higher. Home building has risen not only with the drop in interest rates, but because Atlanta is drawing more people to it from other regions than any other city in America. More than 86,000 new people arrived in Atlanta in 1993, leading Mr Ratajzcak to predict that nearly 40,000 new households will be built this year and next. Some analysts have even suggested that speculative commercial building, which flooded downtown Atlanta with office space during the 1980s, could start again as early as next year. Vacancy rates are headed down and real estate investment is looking up. In a survey of large institutional investors, the Real Estate Research Corporation recently rated Atlanta the top investment market. 'The Olympics co-incided with what was going to turn around, anyway,' observes Mr Andy Krikelas, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. Atlanta's key transportation industry is showing strong gains despite continued lay-offs by Delta, the third largest US airline which has its headquarters in the city. However, innovative airlines such as Kiwi and ValuJet are helping mitigate the effects. The important business of trade shows and conventions - Atlanta ranks as the fourth largest convention centre in the US - has improved this year. And, according to Mr Krikelas, there may even be potential for more retail development now that 'consumers are coming back.' He believes Atlanta's economy is 'pretty strong right now - and we expect it to remain strong through the Olympics.' Although healthy growth seems assured through the 1996 Olympics, there are questions about what will happen afterwards. Measuring by the usual business cycle, it would be time for a recession. But some expect that Atlanta's economic fizz will not stop. The city's mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, says that many infrastructure projects will extend past 1996 and will help keep some bouyancy in the local economy. Mr Ratajzcak also believes that construction will have a post-Olympic 'soft landing' because commercial real estate will once again just be picking up. Yet, Atlanta is pinning many of its economic hopes on what the Olympics will render. Various campaigns to market Atlanta using the Olympics are underway and are largely dedicated to winning international investment. 'If Atlanta pulls off the Olympics and does well, we'll get a lot of free advertising,' says Mr Krikelas. But if the event comes off badly, he warned that the city could be headed for a painful hang-over after the party.

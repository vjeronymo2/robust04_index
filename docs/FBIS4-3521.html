			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon [13 April], Jia Qinglin,  secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, with  Huang Wenlin, Standing Committee member and secretary general of  the provincial party committee, attended the discussion sessions  of the Nanping and Longyan delegations in order to solicit the  deputies' opinions and suggestions on the government work report.    The Nanping Prefecture deputies made many constructive  suggestions on such issues as solving the price scissors between  manufactured goods and farm produce, the high prices of  agricultural means of productions, the further lightening of  peasants' burdens, and the development of undertakings in grain  production and greening.    After listening to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang  Wenlin fully affirmed the achievements the prefect had scored,  saying: The agriculture problem is an old one, but we must have  a new approach to it. The party Central Committee and the State  Council now have elevated to a new height the problem of  agriculture and grain. Among reform, development, and stability,  stability is of overriding importance. To maintain social  stability, it is important to solve the price problem. The key  to stabilizing prices is to vigorously develop agriculture,  grain production, and the Shopping Basket Project. While  guiding agricultural production in accordance with the laws  governing the socialist market economy, we should continue to  support agriculture, and to encourage villages, collectives, and  peasants to invest more in agriculture. Jia Qinglin stressed:  As for grain-producing areas, they should be encouraged even  more to develop a diversified economy, town and township  enterprises, and agricultural processing industries so as to  boost peasants' income, and to promote their grain production by  using industrial profits and the profits gained from developing  economic undertakings to support the further development of  agriculture. Nanping is the province's pilot city for  establishing modern enterprise systems. He hoped that Nanping  Prefecture would do a good job in this experiment and would  create experience in changing the way state- owned enterprises  operate and in enabling them to gradually become modern  enterprises. He pointed out: Forestry, which is also a strong  point of the prefecture, should be fully developed. On the  basis of what was achieved last year, greater efforts should  made in this regard this year.    The Longyan Prefecture deputies aired their views on further  supporting the construction of old revolutionary base areas,  especially the construction of infrastructure. After listening  to their opinions, Jia Qinglin and Huang Wenlin fully affirmed  the gratifying successes achieved by the old revolutionary base  areas in western Fujian, which had a poor foundation for  economic development and were beset with difficulties. They  said: To the prefecture, development is the last word. We  should increase total quantity, augment strength, continue to  implement the preferential policy of opening and developing  mountain areas. At the same time, we should concentrate the use  of limited funds on construction of selected projects, do a  solid job in work to help the poor, and -- given the existence  of poverty-stricken areas -- carry out the help-the-poor policy  from generation to generation. Jia Qinglin hoped Longyan  Prefecture would continue to carry on the old revolutionary base  areas' glorious revolutionary tradition and would work hard so  that the people of the old revolutionary base areas in western  Fujian would shake off poverty and gain prosperity as soon as  possible.</p>

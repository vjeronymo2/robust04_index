			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Georgi Asyov commentary: "Again Traitor"] </F>   [Text] Zhan Videnov has again accused Zhelev of all kinds  of sins, including high treason. Indeed, this is not a very  original claim, since after all it was the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP] and its satellites in the Fatherland Labor Party who  announced that Zhelev was traitor of the year in 1992. Even  this was not very original. Similar accusations against Zhelev  had been leveled even before the Vulkanov-Vodenicharov  presidential election campaign. Zhelev had already been declared  a traitor in the summer of 1989, so it could be said that the  BSP is fully utilizing the experience of Mr. Zhivkov himself.    There is nothing surprising in the accusations of the BSP  leader. After all, the Presidency is the only institution in  Bulgaria that functions to a certain extent, and its  destabilization remains a strategic goal of the party, which  still has members who participated in the 1963 and 1973 plenums,  which wanted to turn us into the 16th USSR republic.    Videnov, and not only he, should abandon once and for all  these efforts to silence the president. The right to express  his opinions on various matters is not only a part of his  presidential prerogative, it simply is a human right that every  citizen of a democratic state has. If Zhelev is denied this  right, the turn of Videnov and all the rest will come soon.    Indeed the BSP should finally understand that the existence  of an anticommunist president has its good sides. It was the  Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that proved that Zhelev was  responsible for all the evils in this world -- from the "Sliver"  Plan [infiltrating the SDS with former communist agents] to  increasing the price of electricity, and from the ozone hole  above the Atlantic to the lack of fish in the rivers. If Zhelev  did not exist, how could the BSP and all the rest account for  their own blunders?</p>

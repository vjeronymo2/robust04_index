			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian and Belarusian defense ministers hint  that they expect their dialogue to be held on a regular basis  from now on. A delegation from the Belarusian Defense Ministry,  headed by Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski, arrived in Vilnius  today to meet with Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius.    The sides agreed that the 720 km border between Lithuania  and  Belarus is a solid enough reason for bilateral consultations.  Lithuania links its security with integration into NATO.  Meanwhile, Belarus is an integral part of the CIS collective  security system. In spite of the fact that the two countries  belong to different security structures their defense ministers  do not regard it as an obstacle on the road to mutual  cooperation.    Speaking at today's news conference, Lithuania's defense  minister, Linas Linkevicius, said the two countries will  establish closer contacts if Belarus joins NATO's Partnership  for Peace program. In respone to this the Belarusian defense  minister, Pavel Kazlowski, said the NATO program is [words  indistinct] Belarus. The Belarusian authorities are currently  discussing the possible participation of their country in the  Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Kazlowski also expressed  interest in Lithuania's experience in this field.</p>

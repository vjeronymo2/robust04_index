			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Mexican party funding limited MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has agreed to accept a limit of 1m new pesos (Dollars 320,000) on individual contributions to the party. The decision follows a public outcry over disclosures that the PRI had solicited donations of hundreds of millions of dollars from wealthy businessmen. The reversal came after opposition parties and the public had denounced a dinner at which 30 select businessmen had been asked to give some Dollars 25m each to the party's trust fund. The Mexican independent press and the opposition argued that the huge donations would make it impossible for the latter to compete on equal terms in the next presidential election. PRI members also complained that the businessmen's contributions would give them excessive influence over the party, which has long enjoyed the support of labour and peasant organisations. President Carlos Salinas explained the reversal: 'Among the militants in the parties, and among public opinion, there has been expressed, with reason, concern that the donations are excessive and concentrated, and that they represent an undue influence.' The limitation of 1m new pesos will only apply to contributions to the party's trust fund. However, a presidential spokesman said that Congress would soon debate legislation aimed to limit contributions to electoral campaigns. The PRI also said that it would only accept money from individuals and social organisations, not from incorporated businesses. The PRI will go ahead with other fund-raising, such as its national lottery and credit cards for 500,000 sympathisers. It will still be much better endowed than other opposition parties, thanks in large part to its continuous presence in power for the past 64 years.</p>

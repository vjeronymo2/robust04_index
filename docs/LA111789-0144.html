			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDER ARRESTS RISING RAPIDLY, INS OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> After 2 1/2 years of steady decline following passage of the sweeping 1986  immigration reform package, arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border have begun to  surge, signaling a possible renewed wave of illegal entries, according to  officials.  </P> <P> Between May and September, U.S. border guards from San Diego to Brownsville,  Tex., apprehended more than 435,000 suspected illegal immigrants, an increase  of almost 25% over the same period of 1988.  </P> <P> "The numbers are going up, and we're concerned," said Duke Austin, spokesman in  Washington for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> But the warning of increased illegal crossings is based upon statistics --  arrests along the border -- that, while widely repeated, are also widely  questioned. The apprehension numbers, critics argue, are on the rise because of  a range of factors -- among them INS staffing and priorities, seasonal shifts  in migration and changes in policy and law. Using arrest figures alone to claim  that illegal immigrants are once again streaming into the United States, these  critics say, can be misleading.  </P> <P> "I think the figures' value has always been very problematic," said Wayne A.  Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego and  a leading researcher of immigration issues.  </P> <P> Yet the border arrest statistics have long been trumpeted by INS officials as  the single most effective indicator of illegal immigration. For decades, the  numbers have played a key role in U.S. immigration strategy. In the 1950s,  immigration authorities cited higher arrests to justify widespread sweeps of  suspected illegal migrants. In the early 1980s, rising arrests led to calls for  new controls, culminating in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  </P> <P> That law, analysts say, has further eroded the reliability of arrest statistics  as an indicator of illegal immigration. Several provisions of the statute have  clearly had an impact on the border arrest totals, which at first declined  precipitously.  </P> <P> A major reason is the newly legalized status for more than 3 million amnesty  recipients -- almost 75% of them Mexican citizens and more than half residents  of California. That has meant that far fewer people have to cross the border  illegally; they can now go back and forth freely. Not surprisingly, the number  of legal crossings has risen considerably since 1986, and contributed to the  decline of illegal crossers.  </P> <P> In addition, the law gave new responsibilities to U.S. immigration authorities,  drawing some resources away from border enforcement, and leaving some agents in  the undermanned San Diego border force openly skeptical of claims that the law  was deterring illegal entry.  </P> <P> "They (policy-makers) have to prove that the law they wanted is doing the job,"  said Steven Garcia, president of Local 1613 of the National Border Patrol  Council, the officers' union. "If we had more agents, we'd definitely have more  arrests."  </P> <P> INS officials, especially former commissioner Alan C. Nelson, were quick to  seize upon the post-1986 drop in arrests as evidence of the deterrent effect of  new penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens. The so-called employer  sanctions -- a centerpiece of the 1986 law -- were meant to dry up the illegal  migrant job market.  </P> <P> But skeptical researchers, aware of the lack of success of similar sanctions in  various U.S. states (including California) and in Europe, question the link.  Illegal aliens have easily managed to circumvent the new requirements through  use of false documents and other means, according to several studies.  </P> <P> Some critics, notably Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern  Border, a Tijuana-based research institution, have argued that the INS has  manipulated staffing in a deliberate effort to inflate or deflate the arrest  numbers to achieve its policy goals.  </P> <P> "There's a manipulation from the top," said Bustamante, who also writes a  popular column for El Excelsior, the Mexico City daily. "The agency has been  lying to the American people."  </P> <P> U.S. officials deny any attempt to deceive. "I think they (the numbers) are the  best barometer there is" of illegal immigration, said Austin, the INS  spokesman.  </P> <P> One weakness, as INS officials concede, is that the apprehension numbers are  inflated. The statistics measure only arrests, so anyone arrested several  times, as frequently happens along the border, is counted with each arrest.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the volume of arrests along the border is staggering, particularly  in the San Diego area, the single busiest crossing point along the border. On  Nov. 5, U.S. Border Patrol agents based here recorded 1,219 arrests of  migrants, or an average of about 50 per hour. More than 90% were Mexican  nationals. Among the 102 non-Mexicans apprehended were 41 Guatemalans, 36 El  Salvadorans, 11 Nicaraguans, four Hondurans, two Egyptians, two Colombians, two  Chinese and one citizen each from Bolivia, Belize, India and the Dominican  Republic.  </P> <P> Historically, authorities have used the arrest numbers as barometers of  unauthorized immigration from Mexico. After World War II, apprehensions of  illegal aliens began to double and triple annually, peaking at more than 1  million arrests in 1954.  </P> <P> Authorities took action, instituting the infamous "Operation Wetback,"  arresting thousands. Caught in the net were many legal U.S. residents -- and  even U.S. citizens -- residing in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Some immigrants,  even though in the country legally, fled back to Mexico.  </P> <P> The ferocity of that operation has not been forgotten in Mexico, where the 1986  immigration law revisions sparked fears of similar actions.  </P> <P> In the years after "Operation Wetback," the border arrest numbers gradually  declined, reaching a low of about 29,000 apprehensions in 1960. A sharp upward  trend began in the 1980s, as the Mexican economy worsened, and reached its apex  in 1986, when authorities recorded 1.6 million arrests of immigrants along the  border, a record. Again, as in the mid-1950s, there were calls for drastic  steps to stem the "invasion." The response this time was passage in October,  1986, of the immigration reform package.  </P></p>

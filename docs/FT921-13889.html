			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Couture in a cold climate - Lucia van der Post on the task facing Marc Bohan as he tries to lift the House of Hartnell on his elegant shoulders IT IS exactly a year since Marc Bohan, hired by Manny Silverman to breathe new life and commercial health into the House of Hartnell, launched his first collection for Hartnell. The timing could hardly have been worse. The Gulf war was about to start, the recession was well under way. Americans stayed at home in their droves and nobody was in a mood to shop at all, let alone to spend thousands at couture houses. Marc Bohan, in his lugubrious French way, is straightforwardly honest about it all. 'It was a perfectly dreadful start,' he admits. 'Couture needs big social occasions, parties, weddings. Nobody dresses up just to sit by themselves. When we took the collection to New York in March it was just at the end of the war and nobody was in an optimistic mood. There was no dressing-up, no jewels. But,' he says, brightening, 'we have survived all that. Now I have an excellent team in place who understand how to work my way. That has been a struggle because the way I worked in Paris was very different from how people work here. We just have to go up.' However, Manny Silverman, the man who rescued the house from the brink of bankruptcy, sounds surprisingly buoyant. 'It has been one of the worst season's for women's retailing that any of us can remember and yet we have still done a potful of business. We have seen new people in here that we would never have seen before. Marc has also taken us on a steep learning curve - it has been almost vertical - building up the salon more or less from scratch. But now we have a team that Marc approves of in place we are much more efficient and that should make us more competitive. If we can maintain the progress that we are currently making then I am confident that in about 18 months we shall start to see a positive return on our investments.' The plans are the same ones he spelled out to me when he first rescued Hartnell from the brink of receivership. 'We did not go into this business just in order to be couturiers,' he told me then. 'We went into it in order to establish a brand which we then hope to licence around the world, but in order to do that we need to be very, very good at couture.' He feels that with Bohan at the design helm he has somebody who is good enough at couture to establish a brand big enough to begin to expand. Next week Bohan's latest couture numbers go down the catwalk before press and customers. Waiting in the wings, ready to go into some 60 top stores, will be the first of Bohan's ready-to-wear lines for Hartnell. Anybody who falls for one of Bohan's couture numbers can expect the price to run to thousands but now, for a fraction of the price, they will be able to buy the same handwriting, the same Bohan look, for Pounds 500 to Pounds 600 for the suits and from Pounds 200 for the dresses. What they will not get, of course, is the personal service, the hours of handwork, the fittings, the luxurious fabrics, the total exclusivity. The designs stem from the same source, but the end product is made in a different way. There are those to whom Pounds 500 for a suit, Pounds 200 for a dress may still seem a lot to pay but bear in mind that this is no more than many designers without a couture house and a huge international following behind them command and considerably less than Chanel, Valentino, Karl Lagerfeld and the like expect to get. The first ready-to-wear spring/summer collection (three designs from which are sketched exclusively for us here by Marc Bohan) features some 40 different garments - everything from day suits, pantsuits, jackets, coats and dresses through to After Six and evening dresses. Deliveries will start next week and by the end of January they should be in a whole range of the best stores, including Harvey Nichols, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Selfridges, Beale &amp; Inman, Jenners of Edinburgh and others. The look is short and sassy, with long jackets worn over full or pleated skirts. Fabrics are very light, very floaty with lots of organdie and chiffon and Bohan uses a lot of blue, every shade from navy through to palest aquamarine. Silverman, quite rightly, attaches enormous importance to this collection: 'In terms of brand-building and of everything we hope eventually to do, ready-to-wear is absolutely vital.' Amanda Verdan, fashion director at Harvey Nichols, is excited about the new range. 'It is lovely. It is also important to us because it is an established brand-name which under Marc Bohan now has a fresher, more updated style. I can see it appealing to our fashion-minded customers, who need special occasion clothes to take them through the spring and summer events.' But there is no stopping Manny. A de luxe range of ready-to-wear at intermediate prices - Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,750 - and including everything from day-dresses to glamorous evening will be on sale by the end of January exclusively (for the moment) at 26 Bruton Street, London W1. In the pipeline, already designed and just waiting for the autumn, is a range of cashmere and lambwool knitwear, all designed and coloured by Bohan and all of which work with the ready-to-wear collection. Wedding dresses have traditionally been important to the House of Hartnell - through this last difficult year it is the British habit of making an effort for events such as polo, Ascot and weddings that has seen couture houses through - and a line of 12 to 15 ready-to-wear wedding-gowns is on the drawing-board. Vogue Patterns has bought the rights to three of Bohan's last year's spring collection. Discussions about a men's shirt agreement are under way, a range of designer ties being pondered. Menswear, which Bohan did so successfully for Christian Dior, is possibly next in line and after that, who knows? Perfumes, scarves, the possibilities are endless. In short, 'if,' to quote Silverman again, 'we can maintain progress,' it should not be long before we have a complete couture house, French-style, here in London. Everything is set to go - all that remains to be seen is whether this time round, with a deep recession still to cope with but at least no Gulf war and more Americans in town, women have enough 'dressing-up' to do to need the clothes that Hartnell makes. A lot is resting on Marc Bohan's shoulders next week. Sketched above by Marc Bohan are three designs from the new Hartnell ready-to-wear collection to be launched next week. Left to right: chiffon dress and jacket in navy or black, sizes 8-18, Pounds 395. Navy and jade (or black and fucshia) silk and viscose suit, sizes 8-18, Pounds 450. Peach (or stone) short sleeved dress in wool gaberdine, Pounds 249. All from Hartnell, 26 Bruton Street, London W1, Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1, Selfridges, Oxford Street, London W1, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly, London W1, Jane of Newmarket, Cambridgeshire, Ideal Clothes of Stratford-upon-Avon and Jane Young of Newark, Nottinghamshire</p>

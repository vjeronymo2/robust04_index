			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LARRY GALES MAKES THE CONNECTION AT MARLA'S  </P> <P> Bassist Larry Gales, a hard-working mainstream player for more than 30 of his  53 years, presented his seven-man East-West Music Connection at Marla's Memory  Lane on Saturday.  </P> <P> The New York-born Gales, whose work has been featured with such musicians as  J.C. Heard, Herbie Mann and Thelonious Monk, has been a mainstay of the local  jazz scene since moving to Los Angeles in 1969. During the last 20 years, he  has worked with such players as Errol Garner, Harold Land, Bill Berry and Benny  Carter.  </P> <P> All that diverse experience was on display during his opening set Saturday  evening as he showed himself a capable player, at home with a ballad as he is  with the tune from the demanding Monk repertoire.  </P> <P> "Bye Bye Blues," a familiar old song whose three-note melodic theme uses up  four bars, was instilled with a rhythmic excitement by Gales and drummer Paul  Humphries. A three-man front line of trumpeter Oscar Brashear,  tenor-saxophonist Herman Riley and trombonist Thurman Green, stated the melody  in harmonized whole notes before each launched into bright solo moments.  </P> <P> That basic format was used throughout the set, with the exception of Miles  Davis' "So What," worked splendidly by the trio of Gales, Humphries and pianist  Lanny Hartley, and "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life," a ballad  showcased for the richly toned trombone of Green.  </P> <P> Though Gales soloed admirably on several occasions, and sang from the heart on  his own composition, "Peach Melba," he was throughout the set what a good  bassist should be: a rock-steady accompanist who propels the music and provides  the basis of harmonic structure. Nowhere in the set was he better in that role  than on Monk's "Straight, No Chaser," a tune that also provided the best  vehicle for Brashear's soaring trumpet and Riley's pensive work on the soprano  saxophone.A.

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Public sector pay rises a missed opportunity to hold down inflation Sir, In 'Pay rises above inflation for 1.5m public employees' (February 11) you contrast the government's decision to implement in full the Pay Review Body recommendations for nurses, teachers, armed forces and doctors, with the Confederation of British Industry evidence that pay settlements of 4.1 per cent in manufacturing are at their lowest level since 1980. However, the full implications could perhaps be spelt out more fully. There is first the public sector externality effect for 1992 of this week's announcement. The review body pay awards set the parameters for the rest of the public service. More than half of the National Health Service staff had their pay increases announced this week, and the remainder - although they may not do so well - see these settlements as the benchmark for their own negotiations. Similarly, the teachers' pay settlement is closely watched by other local authority employees. But on this occasion there may also be a private sector effect and follow-through public sector effect into 1993. The review body groups' settlements this year were partly based on comparability with private sector earnings increases in the year up until autumn 1991. The current steep fall in private sector settlements, while welcome, is fragile. The slightest sign that the government is not serious about the consequences of not keeping pay rates down, now that we are in the ERM, could lead to a weakening of this private sector resolve. And if private sector pay in 1992 is higher than it would otherwise have been, then next year's Pay Review Body settlements will be higher, too. Ahead of the election, the government could have given an unambiguous signal to help ratchet down pay increases to the new permanent lower levels of inflation. This one chance window of opportunity has now been missed. Chris Trinder, research director, Public Finance Foundation, 3 Robert Street, London WC2N 6BH</p>

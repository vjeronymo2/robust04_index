According to information,  Fu Xuezhang, deputy director of the Department of Asian Affairs  under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the chief Chinese  negotiator, is accompanied by a number of military  representatives. The mass media here used the headlines such as  "two giants in Asia to cut troops along border and further  improve ties to ensure peace," when reporting on the talks.    Last September in Beijing, the Chinese and Indian premiers  signed the "agreement on maintaining peace and tranquility in  the areas actually controlled by China and India along the  border," and both sides agreed to cut troops along the border.    A border dispute existed between China and India for 30  years, and a brief but fierce large-scale war broke out in 1962.  It is generally believed that India currently deploys 60,000  troops on the front.    Cheng Ruisheng, Chinese ambassador to India, stressed  recently that "the conflict between China and India and the  tense situation caused by it are now history." Both sides "are  working hard to regain lost time, and relations are improving  step by step." He said that "we should continue to maintain  this pace."    Cheng Ruisheng also disclosed that Indian Vice President  Narayanan will visit China this May.</p>

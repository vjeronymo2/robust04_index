			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley Steetley's latest defence document is too backward-looking to pack a really powerful punch. There is, to be sure, plenty to snipe at in Redland's recent record - the disastrous excursion into plasterboard, an indifferent UK brick operation and a fondness for issuing new paper. But by knocking the highly successful German roof tile business, Braas, and Redland's proven financial engineering skills, Steetley is in danger of taking the insults too far. Moreover, as Redland underlined in a pre-emptive strike on Wednesday, Steetley's recent performance is nothing to be proud of either. The real difference at this stage is that Steetley has little to say about the future. Redland certainly requires the bid to succeed, but this is not to say that its target would be better off on its own. The game is up unless Steetley, effectively denied its joint venture with Tarmac, can quickly conjure up an independent vision for the 1990s.</p>

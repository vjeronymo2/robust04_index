			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roman Latkovic: "Dumb Gambler Playing </F> Roulette"]    [Text] If a miracle happens and NATO really gets going, on  the expiration of the 10th day of the ultimatum for the Serbs --  who have been killing both Sarajevo and its inhabitants (and  thousands of other innocent victims who are not "fortunate"  enough to be in front of television cameras) for almost two  years, not fearing that they will be punished -- those couple of  hours necessary for Western state-of-the-art airplanes to  destroy "possible 200 to 300 targets," will finally show that  "the big world" has been participating in the crimes that Serbia  has committed in this unfortunate land of ours. For the  potentates of this world have been silent, silent in deed, while  Vukovar was dying, Dubrovnik bleeding, and no one did anything  to save Nustar and Dalj, Skrabrnja and Bjeljina, Mostar and  Zadar, Karlovac and Gospic. Belgrade fascists -- who call upon  us on the occasion of "normalization" of relations, while their  mines and chetniks still kill our people -- have done so much  evil and aroused so much hatred, soaked our land with so much  blood and suffering. They had a free hand to "calm" former  Yugoslavia and tailor-make it for values of the outdated world  system, whether a "new" one or suddenly an "old" one, and since  they cannot stop, as with every other fascism, for their evil is  their sustenance, their evil that lives on other people's  happiness and lives, perhaps, only perhaps, the time has come to  stop them. [sentence as published]    And that is why this "ultimatum" to the Serbs, in spite of  all the diplomatic negotiations, games, and child's play of the  poor world politics that never had an ounce of morality, is an  attempt to stop the horror that brings unease through television  to happier homes all over the world. And since it is clear to  everybody that we cannot even dream of procedures like putting  Great Britain on trial for assisting the genocide  (Bosnia-Herzegovina accused Britain on those grounds), and we  can therefore not expect to see potentates "of the big world"  put on trial, those who only brought shame upon themselves and  their countries by talking much without saying anything, while  hundreds of thousands of innocent people were injured or killed  throughout former Yugoslavia (except in Serbia, of course), but  ONE MUST insist on putting on trial, in a new Nuremberg or  Tokyo, those who are directly responsible for the war and the  horror they arranged.  <H5>  The Mud of Common Destruction </H5>   If this world wants a future in which, for example,  Zhirinovskiy will not be a threat, in contrast to a future that,  for the time being, seems to be controlled by people like  Milosevic, Husayn, Karadzic, al-Qadhdhafi... then we must do  everything to radically change the relations that rule the world  today. The victims of the new fascism in the middle of Europe,  and Croatia was the first, must provide the nucleus from which a  new understanding of the future will originate. We will never  be able to arbitrate like a Bill Clinton or a Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and really influence global relations. But small  as we are, we have an enormous strength as a VICTIM (never mind  the fact that, due to Tudjman's politics, we have almost been  put in the same basket with the aggressor and gambled away our  victim status like a dumb gambler playing roulette) and the  strength of justice that is on our side. Fascists like Slobodan  Milosevic, madmen like Radovan Karadzic, or mass murderers like  Ratko Mladic must not be put in a position where other people  will listen to what they have to say. Except in the dock during  a fair trial -- that incredible advantage that not a single  inhabitant of Vukovar, Sarajevo, or any other miserable person  from Josip Jovic onward, did not have. The future of the world,  with its interdependence that gives us the chance to snicker at  the black U.S. soldier who "took a spill" when disembarking in  Somalia and a chance for the French political public to again  "shudder with indignation" at the latest massacre in Sarajevo,  is not a future that can guarantee peace and progress if  fascists go unpunished. The appearance of Zhirinovskiy, the  voracity of Belgrade's greater Serbian madness, the possible  blood-lust of "mother Russia" for Belarus and other parts of the  former Soviet Union (even the "democratic" favorite of the West,  Boris Yeltsin, used tanks to destroy his parliament in the name  of that very same "democracy"), the starvation in Africa, the  silence of China, and the latent Latin-American timebomb -- are  a part of the same evil potential that can crush us down into  the mud of common destruction.   <H5>    Serbia -- Infectious Patient </H5>   Croatia must be changed (both its political map and the  people who created it, with a shame that should not be shared)  and the time has come when it is perhaps discernible that the  brutal killing and exile of people who have no way to protect  themselves will not be tolerated indefinitely; Croatia must be  the part of the "crisis" on the territory of former Yugoslavia  that, as an active factor, will stand on firm foundations  defending human dignity! Human rights, freedom, the  immutability of borders, not permitting the legalization of  "ethnic cleansing" (the most horrible conceivable genocide in  which the euphemism "cleansing" is no less horrible, as if it  were "Dash" or "Ariel" [laundry detergents] and not slaughter  and destruction), and punishing the guilty are principles one  MUST insist on if we want to break a deadlock that permits the  killing of civilians. The road is clear.    Serbia must be further and fully isolated, as every  infectious patient is. NATO or some other force should be  deployed along its borders (even the token contingent of 300  U.S. soldiers have been an effective protection for Macedonia;  the Seseljs and Arkans of the Serbian madness can enjoy  themselves destroying defenseless towns and civilians, just as  every other coward does, but it is unlikely that they would dare  to attack the representatives of the world's only real military  force), its military potential must be destroyed, its exports  and weapons production must be banned for at least another  century, a protectorate over Serbia must be introduced,  Milosevic (and Cosic, and the members of SANU [Serbian Academy  of Sciences and Arts], and Karadzic, and Arkan, and their ilk --  there are masses of them...) must be put on trial, and only  then, by opening up the media and "normalizing" its inner life,  making space for a germ of democracy, we can help that country.  It must first repent and pay for its sins and then be given the  opportunity to change. And to become democratic. To sober up  from its Serbian-ness, from our sea, from Zadar, Plitivice,  Vukovar, from all those "Serbian republics" and to start living  a dignified life.  <H5>  Resembling Its Enemy </H5>   Until then, there will be no happiness. The present Serbia,  the fascist monster made of crime, the chetnik movement, and the  plunderers, will do everything to survive, and in that -- in  addition to some ambiguous statements, to say the least, of some  minor Russian personalities -- it is helped by this kind of  Croatian politics. THERE IS NO "normalization" of relations  with fascism, and THERE SHOULD BE NO "normalization" when the  rope around the neck of that fascism is tightening still. For,  no matter what the "big world" is doing and regardless of the  extent of vested interests at stake, interests that tacitly  support Serbian crimes, those crimes will not stop. Too much  blood has spilt across the borders of Europe and the world, and  there is too much blood on the hands of all those Milosevics to  be able to tighten the rope without getting blood on our hands  too -- whether we "normalize" relations or not.    While Serbia is breaking down in misery and moral decay, and  while its only strength is the strength of its weapons (which it  keeps using against us, taking the whole world for a ride, the  world that swore "Never again!" when it was punishing fascists),  while there are sanctions and while, for the first time, it is  being seriously threatened, Serbia does not deserve anything  else but for us to work for its final defeat.    That country lost this war long time ago. On human, moral,  ethical, military grounds, if you will. And all it has  "conquered" are charred remnants of bloodshed and houses and  they mirror its chetnik fascism perfectly. Croatia, as its  first victim, and therefore historically responsible for the  outcome of our "crisis," must not look in that mirror and see  that it resembles its enemy. Croatia must regain its allies, be  it the Bosnians, the Albanians, the Germans, it does not matter,  by re-establishing just relations on which future good  neighborly relations with Serbia will be founded. There will be  no justice and happiness if we contribute to Milosevic's  "conference-making" in Geneva, etc., instead of in Nuremberg,  and, to save the best for last, round off the journey Milosevic,  the high representative of the occupier, began a long time ago  in Split, on the island of Brijuni talking to Mr. Tudjman, with  a possible visit to Zagreb, on the same road of "normalization"  Zeljko Simic, FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] deputy prime  minister, paved on our wounded land, as a guest of the Republic  of Croatia.</p>

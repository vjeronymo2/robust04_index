			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with St. Petersburg's Vice Mayor Vyacheslav </F> Shcherbakov, by Vadim Tyagniryadno; place and date not given:  "The Quarrelsome Mayor"]    [Text] There is a new scandal in the upper echelons  of the city authorities. Anatoliy Sobchak issued a directive to  relieve Vyacheslav Shcherbakov from his duties as the vice mayor.    Directive No. 375, dated 20 April says: "In keeping  with Minister of Defense Order No. 0831 to place...Rear Admiral  Vyacheslav Shcherbakov under the command of the Navy commander  in chief, having relieved him of his duties as the vice mayor."    Judging by what Vyacheslav Shcherbakov himself is  saying, however, the out-of-favor vice mayor has no intention of  parting with his office in Smolnyy just like that.    "I am amazed at the groundlessness of this document from a  legal standpoint, especially considering that its author is a  doctor of juridical science," he said. "Leaving aside the fact  that the number of the minister of defense's order is incorrect,  the mayor distorts in principle the contents of the order. I  have been placed under the command of the Navy commander in  chief since 28 December. And only he may decide what I am to do.  At this point he is convinced that I should continue working in  the organs of executive authority because, among other things,  it is for the benefit of the Navy.    "All of this is even more groundless because on 14 April,  with the consent of the commander in chief, I requested to be  discharged from the Navy, since I had decided to devote myself  to work in the City Assembly."    [Tyagniryadno] What will you do next?    [Shcherbakov] I will have to challenge the mayor's  directive.  I was elected vice mayor by the city's population, and I cannot  submit to the decision of one person. I will attach my  explanations and forward these documents to the procurator. I am  sure that the law is on my side.    Vyacheslav Shcherbakov still is permitted to come to  Smolnyy--yesterday morning he was in his office.    This is not the mayor's first attempt to get rid of his  recalcitrant deputy: As is known, the former confederates have  long had serious disagreements both on the issues of city  management and in their political leanings. For a long time the  vice mayor was practically in disgrace. During the events of  September-October of last year, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov's staff  was disbanded and he himself suspended from duties for a while.  Nor was he included in the new city government. So far, however,  despite all the mayor's efforts, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov  unfailingly has been able to keep the vice mayor's suite.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Manuel Yan, chief government </F> negotiator with the Moro National Liberation Front and  concurrent presidential adviser on the peace process, by Frank  Longid and Manny Mogato under the rubric "Face to Face"; place  and date not given: "The Peace Process Is Moving Forward"]    [Text] How do you assess the current state of the  peace process?    I believe the peace process is moving forward. Not  spectacularly, but moving forward steadily, and we have to  continue the efforts of he OPAPP (Office of the Presidential  Adviser on the Peace Process) and try to see if we can still  further accelerate the pace of the peace process. But it is  doing quite satisfactorily, and it is a factor in the  improvement of the peace and order situation. That's why the  president is really keen on seeing to it the peace talks of all  the three panels will be further enhanced. On our part, on the  part of the panel dealing with the MNLF (Moro National  Liberation Front), we will have our second mixed committee  meeting in Zamboanga after holy week and then in the middle of  the month of April we go to Jakarta for the second round of  formal talks.    Exactly how will do you propose to accelerate the pace  of the peace process?    On the part of the holding of the peace talks, we will  depend  on the chairmen of the other two panels also to try to dispose  of the obstacles in the way of the holding of exploratory talks  or resuming the ongoing negotiations insofar as the military  rebels are concerned.    When you say the peace process is moving forward, this  statement seems to apply only to the talks with the MNLF.    That is why as I said the president has appealed to the  other  chairmen to try to ride over the existing obstacles there are in  the way of having formal negotiations or resuming the  negotiations if they have been stalled. And that's the reason  why he said we should not rely so much on legal technicalities.  We have to do everything in order to move the talks.    There are now reportedly three communist rebel  groups.    So far the panel of Ambassador (Howard) Dee is dealing with  the main group headed by Joma (Jose Maria) Sison and Mr. (Luis)  Jalandoni. Because Jalandoni has been recognized as their chief  negotiator and spokesman. So that's why Ambassador Dee is doing  his best.    Are there any concrete plans to start dealing with any  of the rebel factions?    Maybe later on. Just like our panel: we are now having  talks with the MNLF, but we are also committed to later on  negotiate with the MILF. Because these are all elements of our  society so we have to try to do our best to have talks with them  and to have an agreement with them and come to terms with them.  That's the only way we can have peace, really, because these  are all elements of Philippine society, the Philippine community.    How long do you think the peace process will take?  Oh... Another six years?    I don't know. We cannot really give a time cap on these  negotiations. In our case, you know that the Tripoli Agreement  was signed in 1976. So we are now still in the process of  elucidating and clarifying the issues that remain to be  discussed, for further or later discussion.    How will you deal with the apparent impatience of some  groups, such as the RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa;  Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] which has repeatedly rated  the pace of the peace process as too slow.    All we can say is we would like to conclude these  negotiations as soon as possible. But as I said it's very  difficult to put an exact date.    On what does the success of the peace process depend  on?    It will hinge first of all on the sincerity and  determination  of both panels in each of these areas to really move the talks  forward. Secondly, it will depend also on the support given to  the holding of these talks by all agencies of government, the  bureaucracy.    And then in the final analysis, it will depend on all the  support given to it by the people themselves -- by the NGOs  [nongovernmental organizations], and the people in the different  communities.    And that's why on our part, for instance, in the panel  dealing with the MNLF, we want to have different meetings, in  different places in Mindanao. That has the beneficial effect of  acquainting the people in each of these areas with the ongoing  peace process.    How can the people interact?    For instance, in making preparations for the holding of the  talks in certain communities, we first contact the local  officials, and then inform them of the site where the talks will  be held. Later on, when the talks are going on, both panels,  will have the opportunity to meet with people's organizations,  the NGOs. For instance before, Congresswoman Lobregat in  Zamboanga City had objected to our holding talks there. Now  they have offered to host, and Congresswoman Lobregat is even  offering her own place for the second meeting.    How will your new job as acting chief of the OPAPP  affect the talks with the MNLF?    It will certainly help because first of all it enhances my  own status in the eyes of the MNLF and also in the eyes of the  Indonesian government.    We have already established a close rapport with Nur Misuari  and I'm sure he will welcome this development and he will be  happy to deal with us better.    What extra powers or authority come with the  office?    The extra authority is, I have the authority now to  supervise  and coordinate the talks of the other panels.    Will it give you more power to offer concessions to the  MNLF?    No. Whatever concessions I will offer will still have to  depend on the president. Because he was the one who made that  commitment that we are going to elevate the talks to a higher  level in order to show his commitment to the peace process as a  whole and to the success of our negotiations with the MNLF.    What is the ideal role of the presidential adviser on  the peace process?    The ideal role? The role of the presidential adviser on the  peace process covers a very wide scope, so it is difficult to  put the pin on just one area. But in general we have to see to  it that there will be a satisfactory progress in the area of  negotiations with the three groups.    Secondly, we also have to look after the welfare and  rehabilitation of those who will decide to surrender and come  within the fold of the law. In our case, one of our primary  objectives in the talks with the MNLF is to attain the objective  of their return to Philippine society as members of the  community.    Will there be any major policy changes with regard to  the peace process?    I don't think there will be any major changes in policy. We  will have to follow the same guidelines and policies that have  been prescribed by the president to the defunct NUC (National  Unification Commission) and the OPAPP since it was set up last  year.    The negotiation panels have their own respective  instructions  from the president and I intend to sit down with the other two  chairmen in order to get a more detailed briefing of the  progress of their negotiations and how they come up to the  compliance with instructions to the president.    On our part we have our own manual of instructions which  have  been approved by the president.    What innovations, new ideas will you introduce at  OPAPP.    I still have to go to my of office. After I take my oath of  office I'll go there and get a feeling of the set up there.    What is important is first of all to motivate the people in  the OPAPP to discharge their duties not only properly but with  the proper spirit. And the same goes for all the personnel  involved in the peace process.    Later on I'll contact also the other agencies in the process  like the convenors in the provinces and the representatives of  the different sectors.    Won't your duties at OPAPP take up too much of your  time which would in turn adversely affect the talks with the  MNLF?    I don't think so because there is an existing office  organization there, a secretariat, and as a matter of fact they  have been working in that line of activity since a few years  ago, since the time of Cory [President Corazon Aquino], that  group was there. Then they were converted to NUC when President  Ramos came in and now the OPAPP. But more or less the key  people are there.    What are the remaining obstacles to the peace  process?    Well they're not really obstacles. Maybe we really have to  find out whether there are adequate funds and resources for the  further advancement of the peace process. Now when I say  further advancement we want the acceleration of the peace  process because we want the peace process to be able to  contribute meaningfully towards our economic takeoff especially  in Mindanao. Mindanao is part of the East Asean Growth Polygon  that President Ramos wants. So if we want the Growth Polygon to  really become a working concept then we have to do our part in  achieving that comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Mindanao.    And the other two elements, the other two negotiating  panels,  the same: whatever will enhance the peace and order and  security situation in the Philippines will certainly help in  further improving our economic image.    What will the additional funds be used for.    We need funds for the conduct of the talks, and funds for  the  rehabilitation of those who will apply for amnesty, funds for  the conduct of consultations with the communities all over the  country.    Is the budget for the peace process inadequate?    Well in our experience, the budget that we have requested is  adequate but we would like to request for more prompt and speedy  release of funds.    Rebel personalities often accuse government of  insincerity. Exactly how will government convince them of its  sincerity?    That is also a two-way proposition. As they say it takes two  to tango. If one side perceives insincerity then of course the  other side will have to make extra effort to prove that they are  sincere in holding these talks. That is the key, precisely, to  the success of the negotiations: the sincerity and  determination of both sides to proceed with the talks in order  to attain success. Because success will redound to the interest  of both sides.    Does government have any new ideas on how convince, for  example, Luis Jalandoni and Jose Maria Sison?    What I am sure of is Ambassador Dee and members of his panel  are really very sincere and determined and keen on meeting with  the NDF/CPP/NPA [National Democratic Front/Communist Party of  the Philippines/New People's Army] panel. Only that there have  been some extraneous issues introduced into the picture. For  instance, they are supposed to have these exploratory talks. I  see no reason why we cannot have that, it's just exploratory.  But right now they are involved in discussion of issues, like  the Constitution.    What about the RAM?    The RAM now is willing to go back to the negotiating table.  They had been holding formal negotiations already but they are  suspended because of some demands on the part of the RAM. But  now I think they have become aware of their commitment also to  participate in these peace talks, to move it forward.    How will government prevent them from withdrawing  again?    Mayroon silang mga hiningi [They have], certain demands, so  the panel is now studying how to meet some of these demands  without sacrificing our integrity and our sovereignty and  provided they are done within the framework of our laws. If it  is within the scope of the law, I see no reason why the  Philippine panel will not agree to it.    Can government continue to bend over backwards just to  entice rebel groups to participate in peace negotiations?    On our side we are going on with our discussions, whatever  agreements have been reached were all within the framework of  our laws. So that's our principal guidance.    I know they are now studying the requests of the RAM to see  how far they can meet the requests -- still within the framework.    What can we expect from the peace process. Will there  be any concrete developments within the year?    Within the coming year we would expect a little more, some  more developments.    Do you foresee formal talks with the NDF occurring  within the next six months?    Well, formal talks in the case of the panels which are  already in it and in the case of other panels, exploratory talks.    Will exploratory talks with the NDF begin within the  next six months?    Yes, I think it's very probable that can be brought about.</p>

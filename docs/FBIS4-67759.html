			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- In the struggle against arms  exports, the Cologne Customs Office of Criminal Investigations  has prevented 11 major cases of violations by German suppliers  since October 1992. On the occasion of the current parliamentary  discussions on the renewed amendment to the Foreign Economy Law,  FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) noted in a position paper, which became known on  Wednesday [13 April]: "The greatest success consists in catching  the main German supplier for the nuclear program of a foreign  country and uncovering his acquisition organization in Germany  and Western Europe." According to industrial circles, the  country could be Pakistan.    In four of the 11 cases involved intentional violations of  the Military Materiel Control Law and one case involved the  planned delivery of military goods to Iraq. In the other cases  there was "the suspicion of planned subcontractor deliveries for  nuclear and missile programs of various sensitive countries."  With these explanations Rexrodt wanted to justify his stricter  legal stipulations in the field of telecommunications secrecy  and fines. The Bundestag Economics Committee, however, postponed  its deliberations on this matter at short notice. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 24 May TASS -- The separate fleet basing  issue provoked heated debates at today's Russian-Ukrainian  negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet.    The naval base in the Balaklava Bay is included in the  Sevastopol megapolis. Russia opposed the use of the "Sevastopol  city" notion as regards the Ukrainian naval base in Balaklava in  the joint document. On mutual agreement Sevastopol will remain  the major base of the Russian fleet.    The document provides for another base of the Ukrainian Navy  in Donuzlava, the Crimea, to house the Ukrainian part of the  Black Sea Fleet.    In the opinion of the Russian side, the use of the  "Sevastopol" name as regards the Balaklava base runs counter to  the principle of separate fleet basing envisaged by the  agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet. The  latter was signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on  April 15, 1994. Thus, the name of the final document has not  been coordinated.    The quantity division of the Black Sea Fleet ships is almost  not debated. Ukraine will have 164 ships (18 per cent), and the  Russian Federation -- 669. At the same time, lists of the ships  are still to be made.    The Russian side has suggested to begin the first stage of  the fleet division after the document signing on condition that  Sevastopol is considered the chief base of the Russian Black Sea  Fleet.</p>

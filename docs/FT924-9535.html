			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Planning delays 'cost Pounds 600m a year' DELAYS IN the planning system are costing British business Pounds 600m a year, much of which could be saved by better procedures, according to a study published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The study, drafted with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, calls for streamlining of the planning system, with better business input and for publication of a national policy paper each year. That would be sponsored jointly by government departments responsible for the environment, transport, industry and agriculture, and would draw together a national framework for land use and infrastructure planning for a five-year period. It would identify priorities and have a guaranteed core funding commitment from the Treasury. The CBI task force that prepared the report, headed by Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of Bass, urges government action to give a clearer lead in strategic guidance; by business, which should take more responsibility for outlining its needs; and by planning authorities, which should enhance their quality of service through charters. The report will be discussed at the CBI conference in Harrogate next Monday, when Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is expected to give the government's response. It is calculated that the cost of planning delays for infrastructure projects is Pounds 1.47bn for each year of delay, and the cost to business imposed by the public planning process averages close to 2 per cent of project costs. That gives the annual total of Pounds 600m. The task force was established early this year because of mounting concern among business leaders about the way some big planning decisions become bogged down with appeals and inquiries. The Stansted airport development took 25 years to complete all planning processes and the M40 extension took 17 years. Mr Prosser said it was understandable that planning was an emotive subject, and the task force found there were good reasons for many of the checks and balances in the system. It worked well generally, particularly with smaller planning applications. He said: 'The problem is more deep-seated. It results from the absence of a national consensus between government, business and the public on key priorities which must be pursued in shaping the nation for the 21st century.' In the absence of a national lead, many significant applications were in danger of being left for local decision in a partial policy vacuum, when they should be set in the context of clear national policy. 'We put the cart before the horse, using inquiries and appeals to make decisions in a climate of frustration, contention and uncertainty,' he said. He regarded the national annual policy paper as the central recommendation, as it would produce a national framework for a five-year period with immediate priorities. 'This would help to create a climate of greater certainty for the nation as a whole, he said. 'This is the crux of our report.' Shaping the Nation: Report of the Planning Task Force.

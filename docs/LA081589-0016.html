			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: SCHULER RESIGNS AS ABBOTT PRESIDENT; CLASH REPORTED  </P> <P> Jack W. Schuler has resigned as president of Abbott Laboratories, the nation's  largest infant formula maker, after apparent personal differences with company  Chairman Robert A. Schoellhorn.  </P> <P> Schuler, who was named president of the North Chicago-based company in 1987, is  the third Abbott president in five years to resign after running afoul of  Schoellhorn. Schoellhorn has assumed Schuler's responsibilities as president.  </P> <P> The announcement came as a surprise to industry analysts. Schuler is credited  with the development of Abbott's fast-growing medical diagnostics business.  Most of Schuler's 16-year tenure at Abbott has been spent in the company's  diagnostic arm.  </P> <P> "He's a capable, competent gentleman who just didn't get along with the  chairman," said industry analyst David J. Lothson at Paine Webber Inc.  </P> <P> Schuler's resignation comes as Abbott is facing serious competition in its  infant formula business, which has accounted for up to 40% of the company's  operating income. Abbott claims 54% of the nation's infant formula sales and  the nation's best-selling brand, Similac.  </P> <P> But heavy price competition has taken a toll on profits, say analysts. Also,  new products introduced by Los Angeles-based Carnation Co. and a joint venture  by Gerber Products and Bristol-Myers have also intensified competition.  </P> <P> "Their market share has not declined, but profitability has," said industry  analyst Jerry E. Fuller at Duff &amp; Phelps. JESUS SANCHEZ  </P></p>

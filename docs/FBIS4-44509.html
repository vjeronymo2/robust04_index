			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zheng Bufa (6774 2975 3127), Yang Deqing (2799 </F> 1795 3237), and Shao Jingan (6730 6855 3227): "Characteristics  of Fraud Cases and Countermeasures Against Such"]    [Excerpts] Looking at all the cases of fraud adjudicated  since 1991 at the people's court of Jianhu County in Jiangsu  Province, we see that they have the following characteristics,  which appear different from those of the past:    1) A large increase in the number of cases. In 1991, the  said  court adjudicated six fraud cases, in 1992 the cases had  doubled to 12, and in 1993 is was a multiple of the 1992 figure  again; these cases are increasing in a geometric progression. 2)  Increasing magnitude of the objects involved. Few fraud cases  were for less than 1,000 yuan, they were generally for several  thousand yuan, and frequently even cases involving over ten  thousand and several hundred thousand yuan. Cases involving  more than 10,000 yuan accounted for 36 percent of the total  cases. The defrauded sums of the cases adjudicated during the  first quarter of 1993 amounted to 244,800 yuan, which is already  1.4 times the amount of involved in all case of 1991. 3) The  scope of such cases has widened. Criminal elements from abroad    have entered this country and are committing fraud on the  mainland. Their activities have occurred in many different  provinces and cities. 4) Losses due to these fraudulent  activities have become serious. Objects of these frauds have  been public and private property. Once accomplished, the  victims will suffer losses to different degrees, and in some  cases the consequences are very serious indeed. 5) In most cases  of fraud village and township enterprises and individual  contractors had been victimized. Among 25 fraud cases, 15 of the  victims have been of the mentioned categories, accounting for 60  percent.    The following are the methods used in the commission of  fraud  in these cases:    Use of false documents to commit fraud. This is the main  method used by defrauding criminals. The false documents are in  the majority of cases false letters of introduction, false  contracts, false testimonials, false resident's identification  papers, and false seals of office. The use of false documents is  always the easiest way for defrauders to succeed.    Exploiting psychologically the strong desire of factories or  owners of commodities to sell their goods, using sweet and  enticing words to hoodwink the sellers. This kind of criminals  will often exploit psychologically the great eagerness of owners  of commodities to market their goods, and they will thus worm  themselves into the confidence of the owners of commodities in  order to achieve their intended objective which is fraud.    Utilizing the opportunity presented by the great need of  some  enterprises to import technologies, criminal elements will  commit fraud by first pretending to be able to provide or  transfer such technologies. This kind of fraudulent criminals  will often outwardly appear as honest gentlemen, who will  pretend to be willing to help backward regions and willing to  support the development of village and township enterprises.  They will act ostentatiously, looking for a chance to swindle  people, boasting of their own capabilities, and thus entice  people by guile or flattery to fall victims to their fraudulent  machinations.    Exploiting psychologically the eagerness of some people to  acquire certain commodities, criminal elements will deliberately  make deceptive statements as to the commodities they offer, and  thus accomplish their fraud.    On the pretext of helping in the management of affairs, they  will wantonly defraud people of money and possessions.  Defrauders will often brag and boast about themselves as having  certain backing and relations that would enable them to help in  problems concerning registration of domicile, employment as  cadres or workers, and will in this way swindle some people who  have had every good intention.    Swindling people of money and valuables by banking on the  greed of some people. A criminal will purposely discard  something on the street that looks valuable but is a fake. When  a passerby picks it up, a group of accomplices will suddenly  appear on the scene and demand a share of the find. As the value  is shared among everybody involved, the fake item remains in the  hands of the passerby, who will have had to pay out cash to the  swindlers as their "share."    Swindling people of money and possessions by means of  superstitions. Cases of this nature occur mostly in the  countryside and among people of a low level of general  education; such cases tend to become more frequent almost daily.</p>

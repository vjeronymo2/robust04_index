			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Akayev on Tuesday [28 June] held a full  government meeting to discuss what could be done to straighten  out the country's fuel and energy complex and prepare the  economy for next autumn and winter season. Heads of ministries  and departments and regional administrators were also involved.    Akayev described as hard the situation emerging in the fuel  and energy complex saying that nothing was being done to start  preparations for the coming winter. He said the country "will  find itself in a position worse than last year" unless drastic  measures were taken soon.    Akayev called to step up coal production and work out a  strategy for the development of the sector including marketing  opportunities at home and in Central Asia. He backed up a  proposal to allocate DM 10 million for a coal briquetting  project expressing confidence about the development prospects of  the coal industry.    However, many speakers called for a 40 million soms worth of  fuel subsidies arguing that most of the ordinary consumers would  not be able to buy fuel because of high coal prices and  transport costs. The president instructed the government to  allocate 14 million soms to this end, with the remainder to be  raised by local administrators. IF Note: Kyrgyzstan is  expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes of coal this year, one  million tonnes less than it needs. Kazakhstan has now agreed to  deliver the required amount and agreement was reached on imports  of one billion cu meters of gas from neighboring Uzbekistan.    As a matter of urgency, Akayev called for the national  economy to be transferred to electricity proposing that the  government raise 27 million soms to complete two large  hydro-electric stations at Shamaldy-Sai and Tash-Kumyr. The  cabinet was also instructed to raise funds for imports of large  capacity transformer equipment. Akayev approved a recent deal  with Switzerland which will provide a $10 million credit to put  up three high capacity transformer substations in the country. (  Kyrgyzstan whose annual electricity needs run at 10 billion kWh  produces 12 billion kWh. Talks are in progress to export extra  electricity to Kazakhstan -- IF).    Akayev said everything must be done to implement the  energy-saving program which can help the republic save up to one  third of the total electricity produced. He also called for a  review of the country's energy development concept taking into  account the energy situation in neighboring states.    Akayev proposed that an integrated research must be  conducted  into the sources of power generation with costly fossil fuels to  be replaced by unconventional sources for electricity generation.    He warned that each official would be held responsible for  the preparation of the country's economy for the coming winter.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Warning on Cuban refugees Cuban refugees in the Cayman Islands may be repatriated unless there is a speedy conclusion to their efforts to enter the US, writes Canute James. Mr Lemuel Hurlston, administrative secretary of the British colony, said some of the 51 refugees had been in the Cayman Islands for at least nine months, and the budget for feeding and housing them had been exhausted. The Cayman Islands, located 175 miles south of Cuba, is increasingly favoured by cubans seeking refuge in the US. More than 100 cubans have arrived there since 1989; up to march of last year all had been allowed into the US.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: European privatisation It is a virtually foregone conclusion that the international reach of large US securities houses will bring them a prominent role in European privatisation. The question is whether this will also mean the introduction to Europe of a US-style fee structure for new equity issues. US equity offerings typically carry fees of 5 per cent or more compared with around 3 per cent currently for European privatisations. Moreover, the oligopoly enjoyed by US lead managers allows them to take the lion's share of the total. Fair though US share allocation rules appear on paper, the lead manager has undisputed power over the allocation process. Institutions that want to be sure of receiving shares may thus direct orders towards the lead manager; co-lead managers receive a guaranteed but small share of the spoils to encourage them to acquiesce. But the system also limits their incentive to work on behalf of the vendor. The UK sought to avoid this sort of result in the latest BT3 issue. Share allocations were supposedly determined by an impartial formula. Even so, there was a tendency for buyers to designate SG Warburg as the recipient of their fees. Warburg thus walked off with around a third of the total. The lesson for would-be vendors is clear; they must watch the allocation process carefully to ensure the syndicate is giving them value for money. As for Warburg, it has discovered how successfully it can sell shares in the US. Perhaps it should strike out on its own there and undercut the bloated domestic houses.</p>

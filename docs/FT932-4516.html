			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Sharp rise in higher education intake STUDENT numbers in English higher education have risen by 46 per cent in the past four years, says the first annual report of the Higher Education Funding Council. The council said this expansion, which exceeded the government's own forecasts, had been achieved 'while maintaining quality and strengthening research activities'. Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive, said the increase was equivalent to the creation of 20 large civic universities. The report shows that the composition of the student body is changing, with far more mature students. Those over 21 now take up the majority of higher education places, accounting for 55 per cent of all students, while 38 per cent of all students are 35 or older. Ethnic minorities are well represented relative to their share of the population, accounting for 13 per cent of UK-based students. Only 8 per cent of the population aged between 18 and 29 came from ethnic minorities in 1991, says the report. Promoting Quality and Opportunity.

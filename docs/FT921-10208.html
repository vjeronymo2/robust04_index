			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Disgruntled masters of all they survey Surveying may have escaped Bernard Shaw's famous tirade against the iniquity of the professions, but, at its worst, it is as much a conspiracy against the laity as medicine, accountancy or law. All too often, surveyors attempt to create a mystique around property. Agents frequently portray their profession in a light that baffles the outsider. They often make much of 'knowing the market'. Yet 'knowing the market' - potentially the key to success - is an all-encompassing catch-phrase that can be a poor substitute for analysis. A client's ignorance of the surveying business is often matched by the surveyor's ignorance of its client's business. The poor use of property assets in many businesses does little credit to the breadth and relevance of surveyors' advice. For example, investment surveyors - a specialist branch of the profession dealing with the purchase and disposal of buildings - deplore the way that property has been sidelined in many institutional portfolios, but their lack of understanding of other financial instruments, such as futures, frequently undermines their argument. Surveyors are also criticised for the quality of their advice and the depth of their research. Some disgruntled clients - largely those who bought at the peak of the market - are turning to the law for redress. Though many of these legal suits will come to nothing, the fact that dissatisfied customers are turning to the law does reflect an increasing readiness to challenge the profession's advice. For all that, much of the profession does a good job for which it has rightly earned the approval of the general public Surveyors certainly rank nowhere near as high in British demonology as their cousins, the estate agents and property developers. Indeed, the profession's problem is less obloquy than oblivion. Surveyors feel misunderstood and underrated. 'We are struggling for an identity . . . We should be seen as the equivalent of the solicitor, the accountant, the doctor or the architect, but we are not,' wrote Professor Malcolm Hollis, a building surveyor, in the magazine Chartered Surveyor Weekly. 'It is clear that the general public does not know what a chartered surveyor is, or does . . . ' said another contributor. 'Joe Public thinks of a chartered surveyor as one who works through a theodolite and prepares maps,' grumbled another. The problem is partly a matter of presentation. The name 'chartered surveyor' says little about the profession. And attempts to describe or promote it lead into the dense thicket of specialisations: general practice, quantity surveyors, building surveyors, rural practice, planning and development, land surveyors and minerals. Perhaps, some speculate, the name should be changed. To describe chartered surveying as 'the property profession', for example, would be more informative to the general public, particularly in the continental Europe. Many surveyors critical of their profession would go further. They would like to simplify the structure of the profession, probably along the lines of the three main sectors: land, commercial and residential property and construction. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the industry's professional body, has acknowledged the pressure for change. Last year, it set up a committee, headed by Mr Richard Lay, chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property advisers, to consider how the profession should meet the needs of the market. The result was a provocative report, suggesting that the RICS should consider changing its name, streamlining its divisions, improving the promotion of the profession, broadening the education of surveyors, and merging with a rival professional organisation, the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioners (ISVA). RICS welcomed the report in principle. In practice, however, RICS seems unlikely to do anything about it. In all probability the report seems destined to join a similar report on the structure of the profession published four years ago, which was left on the shelf gathering dust. But RICS is in a delicate position. The politics of a professional institution are formidable. Many of those who devote time and effort to sit on its council and committees are natural conservatives, who are keen to preserve their own positions and the status quo. Radical change is far from their thoughts. Moreover, RICS's leader cannot count on the support of the members, as was demonstrated in 1989 when they voted against a merger between RICS and ISVA, against the recommendation of the leadership. There are also fierce rivalries between the various sectors which are all too frequently preoccupied with promoting their own identity. Many members outside London also resent some of the Lay report's proposed changes on the grounds that they would merely benefit large London firms. The risk of internecine strife within the profession is probably enough to stymie any decisive action by the RICS. This was indicated this week when RICS issued a masterfully vague statement about a council meeting on Monday to discuss the Lay report. The statement paid lip service to a need to 'change emphasis from a supply-driven approach to a demand-led stance.' But it side-stepped the real issues. For instance, it shrugged off the possibility of streamlining the divisions by stressing 'that the report had not recommended replacing seven divisions by three . . . ' In fact, the Lay report had drawn exactly that conclusion, in barely coded language. The RICS reluctance to take any bold steps will disappoint those who believe it should give a clear leadership. Such critics suspect that the organisation's plan to set up committees to examine some of the more prominent issues may simply be a way to take the heat out of the clamour for reform. Instead of overhauling its constitution, RICS will probably try and gradually change its priorities. It would like to devote less time and money towards supporting an unwieldy, inefficient branch structure. Instead, RISC wants to direct more resources to addressing those issues gathering a head of steam within the industry, such as the impact of EC legislation environmental questions and the proposed changes to lease structures in the UK. By putting aside issues such as constitutional reform, RICS may indeed be in a better position to carve out a more attractive profile for the profession and property issues in general. (RICS has long been plugging away behind the scenes at the government's neglect of property matters in general.) In the meantime, while internal and European issues concentrate the collective mind of RICS, the onus is very much on individual member firms to make what headway they can in recessionary times. For many the burden is heavy. Firms are working at a time of unprecedented cuts in investment and rent review work. In any event, surveyors are well aware of the need to broaden their business, address European markets and sharpen their competitive stance in the face of increasing rivalry from independent consultants, investment banks and accountants, which are moving into property work. The enthusiastic flurry of recent mergers, office openings and associations in continental Europe at least show that surveying firms are not idle. It might be an exaggeration to claim surveyors are facing a crisis. But undoubtedly two characteristics of a crisis - danger and opportunity - confront the profession today.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RENTAL GROWTH (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail      Office    Industrial   All Properties  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to Dec 91      -0.7         -9.1       -0.5           -4.0 Quarter to Dec 91   -0.1         -3.2       -0.9           -1.5 Month of Dec 91      0.2         -1.6       -0.3           -0.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

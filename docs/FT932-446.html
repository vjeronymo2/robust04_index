			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Action considered over problem rifle THE government is considering taking steps against the suppliers of the Army's SA80 rifle, recently condemned by MPs on the cross-party defence committee as 'verging on the shoddy', Viscount Cranborne, a junior defence minister, said yesterday. 'The question of liability is still under discussion,' he said, adding that action against the company was a possibil-ity. The rifle, of which some 332,000 have been supplied or ordered, is made by Royal Ordnance, which was sold to British Aerospace in 1987. The defence committee's report listed 32 problems with the SA80, which came into service in 1985. These included: poor performance in desert conditions; most left-handed soldiers could not fire it; trigger mechanisms tended to stick; firing pins broke; bayonets snapped off; and the cleaning kit was 'inadequate'. Lord Cranborne told peers: 'There were defects in the rifle as originally supplied - a greater number of defects than we would like to accept.' But he insisted that, in spite of these, 'by the time it was in service in the Gulf, properly cleaned, it was clear that its performance was at least equal to other rifles in use'.</p>

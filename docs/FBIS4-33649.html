			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Government and opposition  deputies agreed today to ask the Defense Ministry to explain how  it financed the trip being made by Army Commander General  Augusto Pinochet to the Czech Republic and other European  countries.    The initiative was approved by 50 votes in favor, 12 votes  against by the ultra-conservative Independent Democratic Union  (UDI), and six abstentions.    Pinochet, who governed Chile from 1973 to 1990, currently is  in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he arrived on 4 June from Prague  after a five-day visit to the Czech Republic, a country he  entered by car from The Netherlands.    Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo said: "It is an obligation to  know how Pinochet's trip to Eastern Europe is being financed."  But UDI Congressman Francisco Bertolucci said the idea is to  make the Army commander "uncomfortable."    Asked about the request, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma  said that "so far we have not received the request," and that  Pinochet "was given the treatment in Prague he deserves as an  individual and as Army commander. Everything was normal."    Perez added that the visit to the Czech Republic was  "official and institutional." He added that there was "never" a  plan for him to visit Russia, and that he does not know when  Pinochet will return to Chile.    After leaving the government on 11 March 1990, Pinochet made  several trips through Latin America, Europe, and South Africa.  These types of trips were practically prohibited to him when he  headed the military regime due to the accusations of continuous  human right violations and the negative votes in this regard in  all international meetings.</p>

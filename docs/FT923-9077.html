			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Simon Engineering to refocus SIMON Engineering, touted since 1990 as an environmental play, has decided to sell most of its environmental division and will concentrate on other core businesses. Simon is in discussions with two overseas companies about the sale of its waste water treatment and environmental consultancy businesses, which had turnover of about Pounds 90m last year. Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive, said the businesses had been disappointing, despite their longer-term prospects. 'We've seen a slowdown in environmental legislation and people have deferred expenditure,' he said. Since 1990, when it had a rights issue, Simon has spent about Pounds 25m building up the division. The company hopes to raise at least Pounds 40m from the sale, Mr Kemp said. Simon announced yesterday that interim profits had fallen sharply because of the continued recession and a higher interest charge following last year's Pounds 52m purchase of Robertson Group, the geological consultant. Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 6.05m in the six months to June 30, and Mr Kemp said he was 'cautious' about the full year. Turnover increased to Pounds 235.4m (Pounds 218.1m) helped by acquisitions. Pre-tax profits from access equipment fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 4m) but improved from last year's very weak second half. Orders in the US have shown a slight improvement, Mr Kemp said. Industrial services, which includes Robertson, slipped to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 6.3m) because of a poor first quarter from US chemicals. Interest charges increased to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 2m) and gearing rose to 40 per cent, with net borrowings of Pounds 51m, compared with 29 per cent at the year end. Earnings dropped to 3.8p (8.2p). But the dividend is unchanged, and uncovered, at 5p. Simon's shares, which fell sharply last month, recovered 4p to 185p. COMMENT Shareholders who stumped up for the rights issue, partly designed to build up the environmental division, may feel a bit perplexed by yesterday's news. Even if they are prepared to overlook the change in strategy, they will be less happy with the share price, which has underperformed its sector by 40 per cent in the past two years. Most of the damage has been done by profit downgradings and uncertainty over the dividend, which is almost certain to remain uncovered this year. Simon is financially more sound than some, and proceeds from disposals could repay most borrowings. But as economic recovery appears ever more elusive, Simon's reliance on late cycle sectors such as construction makes its own recovery ever distant, possibly not until 1994. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 17m, compared with Pounds 18.3m last time, put the shares on about 15 times. The 11 per cent yield gives the shares a useful safety net, but the upside appears limited.</p>

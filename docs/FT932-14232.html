			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: Democracy, Pakistan-style IT DOES NOT say much for the development of democracy in Pakistan that all three civilian governments since the lifting of martial law in 1985 have been sacked by a president acting with the consent, though on this occasion apparently not the active co-operation, of the military. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan has tarred the dismissed prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, once his protege and now his victim, with the same brush as Ms Benazir Bhutto, whose government he removed in 1990. Then, as now, the charge was corruption. But this time the president's motive is clearly to preserve his ultimate sanction over governments. Mr Sharif, like Ms Bhutto, can be accused of a degree of political ineptitude. He failed to build on the power base which he had as the president's man and as the former chief minister of Punjab province. His policies concentrated on economic reforms in the hope that success would bring political popularity. Though seemingly secure in office - he easily saw off a challenge from Ms Bhutto last year - he took on the president by seeking reversal of a constitutional amendment which empowers him to remove governments and appoint chiefs of the armed forces. But Mr Sharif lacked the clout to force the measure to a successful vote in the National Assembly, where he would have needed a two-thirds majority. With evidence of alleged corruption not yet produced, the record of Mr Sharif's government is generally good. He has overseen a programme to open the economy, reducing tariffs, seeking foreign investment and privatising state industries - though he has not succeeded in beating the country's most chronic economic problem, the budget deficit. Mr Sharif strove for peace in Afghanistan and sponsored an agreement which is yet to be fully tested. On the eastern front, however, Pakistan and India - both at least potentially nuclear powers - remain at loggerheads despite meetings between Mr Sharif and the Indian prime minister. The climate has been worsened by allegations of Pakistani involvement in the Bombay bombings. An odd result of the president's move is to foster the political resurgence of Ms Bhutto, one of whose aides is a minister in the interim government. Ms Bhutto, on the pretext of backing fresh elections, finds herself colluding with the president's effort to keep the powers which he used to remove her in what she had called a constitutional coup. It is perhaps too much to expect Pakistan's elected politicans to develop stature when their powers are so constrained. Those foreign companies which have been cautious about Pakistan despite its encouraging reforms may thus have been proved wise and aid donors, who meet this week in Paris, will have to consider whether Pakistan can fulfil economic promises given the country's evident political fragility.</p>

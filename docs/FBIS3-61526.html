Finogenova, Zoology Institute at Russia's Academy  of Sciences, St. Petersburg; UDC 574.5(282.247.21)]    [Abstract] Concerns that the 22.2 km dam and flood  protection barriers along the St. Petersburg sea front will  aggravate the already strained environmental conditions in the  Neva bay and eastern end of the Gulf of Finland necessitated a  comprehensive evaluation of the bay's hydrobiological  characteristics. To this end, staff of the Fresh Water and  Experimental Hydrobiology Laboratory of the Zoology Institute at  Russia's Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg carried out  hydrobiological research aimed at clarifying the bay ecosystem  functioning. In so doing, the phytoplankton and chlorophyll  concentrations are studied on the basis of the 1984-1989 and  1992 data; the phytoplankton sedimentation samples are processed  using conventional hydrobiological procedures, and the  chlorophyll concentration is measured in acetone extracts with  the help of a spectrophotometer. The sampling procedure is  outlined. The findings reveal that the Neva river estuary is  characterized by a twin-peak seasonal phytoplankton dynamics  curve with the aquatic plant biomass maximum of up to 15 mg/l in  the spring. The blue-green, green, and diatom algae are dominant  during the summer and fall period. The average zooplankton  population and biomass in the Neva river bay in June of 1984 and  1991, Shannon's diversity index in the oligochete colonies in  various sections of the Neva bay, and the oligochete biomass in  the Neva bay are summarized. The study of the hydrobiont colony  structure and functioning reveals that the significant changes  which occurred during the 1984-1991 period reflect the  continuing water contamination and changes in the hydrological  conditions which are attributed to seawall construction. The  need for further long-term systematic observations and a special  estuary ecosystem monitoring program is stressed. A negative  trend whereby research budgets are being cut is noted. The  prerequisites for stabilizing the environmental conditions in  the Ladoga, Neva, Neva bay, and Gulf of Finland system are  formulated. Figures 5; tables 3; references 17.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORAL MAJORITY -- AN EPITAPH  </P> <P> An organization that once struck fear into the hearts of liberals and inspired  bumper stickers ("The Moral Majority Is Neither") has been laid to rest.  </P> <P> The Moral Majority came in like a lion and went out like a lamb. The Rev. Jerry  Falwell, who proclaimed the creation of the organization on a mountaintop in  Lynchburg, Va., in 1979, announced its demise in Las Vegas, a city that some  believe represents every sin he tried to fight.  </P> <P> The Moral Majority, where I was a vice president between 1980 and '85, never  lived up to its supporters' highest expectations or its detractors' worst  fears. It did not achieve its agenda, which included a reversal of abortion on  demand, voluntary school prayer, a reduction of drug use and restrictions on  pornography. Though government officials consulted it on nominees for high  office, the Moral Majority's opinion was not decisive.  </P> <P> What it did was transform the political landscape by re-enfranchising a large  bloc of people who had withdrawn from politics because they had been taught,  often by ministers like Falwell, that politics was dirty and secondary to  Christianity's primary goal of equipping people for heaven.  </P> <P> Articulate and bright, Jerry Falwell spoke for millions of Americans who felt  leaderless. Without him, the Moral Majority would never have left the launching  pad. Other conservative leaders, including Paul Weyerich and Howard Phillips,  were instrumental in its creation, but Falwell provided the charismatic match  that ignited the political firestorm. He took on the left's biggest stars on  their own turf, from the Donahue show to Harvard, where he was booed as a Nazi  by people who claimed to be tolerant and pluralistic.  </P> <P> Even liberals, who denounced his brand of conservatism, came to like Falwell as  a person. His sense of humor and genuine acts of kindness diffused much of the  electricity that often surrounded his political views.  </P> <P> I once took Falwell on a tour of inner-city Washington, and we ended up at a  black church, where he listened to poor people talk about their problems. A  young black boy wanted to ride with Falwell to the airport after the meeting  and Falwell asked him if he planned to finish school. The boy said he did.  Falwell got a piece of paper and wrote down his unlisted home number. "When you  graduate from high school, call me and you will have a full scholarship to  Liberty University," he said. (Falwell's school in Lynchburg).  </P> <P> Falwell could be exasperating, including those times when he made outrageous  claims in fund-raising letters, but his genuine love of people covered a  multitude of sins and few left his presence with bitter feelings.  </P> <P> If one measures political success in terms of a viable machine that can elect  or defeat whom it wishes, then the Moral Majority was clearly not a successful  movement. But if the yardstick is setting the agenda for political debate by  both parties on the significance of traditional values, a strong national  defense, pro-life and other conservative issues, then its influence will be  felt for a long time.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Philharmonia - Royal Festival Hall Suddenly Poulenc is box-office. In the past few years, the posthumous Poulenc wave has become a considerable groundswell. Public persons keep emerging from the closet to confess to adoring his music. The excellent house for Charles Dutoit's concert with the Philharmonia on Wednesday (sponsored by NCR) was surely enhanced by the promise of Poulenc's piano concerto; Dutoit and the pianist Pascal Roge are greatly admired musicians, but not automatic sell-outs - and the rest of the programme was only Jacques Ibert's once-popular Escales, post-Impressionist postcards, and Berlioz's evergreen Symphonie fantastique. Just why Poulenc's music - shamelessly appealing, innocent of theoretical pretensions, more and more backward-looking as he went on (though almost always from an ironic distance) - should strike such a chord with us now is a topic for musical party-chat. He mined only a few special, expressive veins, though intensively. Much of his inspired best is in his songs, for which you need literate French to appreciate them at full value. (An odd fact is that he was the nearest thing ever to a natural FT composer, being a pampered scion of the 'Rhone-Poulenc' Poulencs.) The 1949 piano concerto is not among his best works, no more than the Sinfonietta that the BBC commissioned from him a bit earlier. The ageing composer had become self-conscious about his uncertain grip on 'pure' musical forms, when he hadn't a text or a scenario to set his course; the Concerto and the Sinfonietta are studded with characteristic ideas, arranged in hopefully 'symphonic' patterns. Roge rightly went for character. He is a Poulenc-player with a fine, unsentimental command of the idiom - brisk, sparkily extrovert, lucid - and Dutoit matched him. When the surface is so well polished, the composed, wistful feeling speaks for itself. In Dutoit's hands Ibert's fetching Escales went into Technicolor, with a determined thrust that sacrificed some of their throwaway charm. (How simple they sound now] - and yet there were hundreds of other composers who exploited the same post-Impressionist manner to utterly negligible effect.) With the Berlioz, one began to wonder whether Dutoit's famous adherence to strict style hasn't been compromised by his newly international career. Most of the symphony was loudly dramatic, even hectoring. Suspenseful pianissimos, an essential Berlioz recourse, were all too rare. As always, Dutoit set every salient musical idea in high relief (and the first movement alone is chock-a-block with bolder ideas than any other music of its time, though we've grown accustomed to them now). Yet the soulful, extra-musical intimations that Berlioz meant them to capture remained stubbornly inaudible: we heard nothing much beyond the notes flung at us ' which for a Symphonie fantastique amounts to being short-changed.</p>

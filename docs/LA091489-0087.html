			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush sent Congress legislation to provide tax breaks to parents who  adopt children who are difficult to place for reasons such as physical or  mental handicaps or age. Bush, who has an adopted grandchild of his own, said  there are 30,000 "special-needs" children available for adoption. Bush's plan  would provide a $3,000 tax deduction to families for costs incurred in adopting  a special-needs child. A separate bill would provide additional benefits for  federal employees who adopt such children. In a four-year program, the  employees would be eligible for reimbursement of up to $2,000.  </P></p>

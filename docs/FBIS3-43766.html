			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN  secretary general, said a few moments ago that he does not know  why the government has practically stopped confining its troops.  This issue will be discussed during a meeting of the  Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] early next week.    Ajello said the only information he possesses is that  government forces say they have not received orders to go to  confinement centers. Only 19.6 percent of troops from the  government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] have  been confined so far. Only 14,557 weapons from both forces have  been collected so far.    Meanwhile, militia and irregular forces are now being  disarmed throughout the country. The process began in Maputo  where 345 weapons have already been collected.    Regarding the confinement process, Aldo Ajello feels the  main  problem is a lack of discipline on the part of the soldiers who  do not want to obey local officials and can only receive orders  from the central organs. As a result, salary problems are not  resolved and there are logistical problems in confinement  centers.    On the training of the new armed forces, Ajello said Italy  has given the $500,000 necessary to repair training centers.  The 540 military instructors, recently trained in Zimbabwe,  returned to the country yesterday. They are presently at the  Dondo Military Training Center which has already been repaired.    It is expected that before the end of January, 2,500 men  from  the government and an equal number from Renamo will be selected  to form the first infantry battalions of the new Mozambican  army. The two sides are studying the possibility of soldiers  choosing to join the new army to go directly to training centers  from their barracks and bases, without passing through  confinement centers.    Ajello also revealed that a project is under study to  increase from six months to 18 or 24 months the granting of  salaries to the soldiers that are going to be demobilized. This  project will only be possible with the assistance of the  international community.</p>

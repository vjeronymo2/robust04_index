			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith might offer deal on block vote MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday took his campaign for one-member-one-vote and an end to the union block vote in the election of the party's parliamentary candidates to the MSF general technical union. There are signs that Mr Smith will have to compromise with the unions to avoid a split over the issue at this autumn's party conference. He told delegates to the MSF's conference in Blackpool he wanted to offer trade unionists who pay the political levy a special lower party membership rate to encourage them to become 'full participating members' in Labour constituency parties. But Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union said last night that although this was 'a first step in the right direction', it 'did not address the problem of what to do about political levy payers in the unions'. He said they should be entitled to a direct say in the selection of Labour candidates. At present the larger unions including the TGWU transport workers' union and the GMB want to retain a link through their political levy payers in candidate selection. Their view looks likely to prevail among the unions that will account for 70 per cent of the vote at party conference. The MSF will debate the issue tomorrow. In the past few weeks the Usdaw shopworkers' union conference voted narrowly against the idea and the NCU communication workers' union also looks likely to reject it.</p>

Before the  meeting closed, Governor Bai Qingcai made an important speech  focusing on six issues.    First, we should take the overall situation into account in  everything we do. In considering their work, all fronts and  departments should have the concept of proceeding from the  overall situation and should effectively integrate centrally  assigned tasks with their actual conditions. If they only  consider their own interests in disregard of the overall  situation, they will deviate from the general orientation.  Because reform will cause an adjustment in powers and  interests, we should proceed from the overall situation in this  year's work. [passage omitted]    Second, we should change our concepts as soon as possible.  Some of our concepts which have existed for many years are  outdated. Without changing our concepts, we cannot seize the  opportunity. The basic purpose of the party Central Committee  in stressing the need to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping is to arm ourselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to  improve our understanding, to emancipate our minds, and to  change our concepts.    Third, we must have a down-to-earth work style. Now the  tasks have been set and the objective is clear. The fulfillment  of these tasks and objectives requires the unity and efforts of  the entire people and the devotion of party members and cadres.  It will not do for leaders not to have a down-to-earth work  style. Leading cadres must set a good example for others to  follow.    Fourth, discipline must be strengthened. To ensure the  fulfillment of all reform objectives, to ensure uniformity in  action, to ensure high efficiency in government work, to ensure  uniformity and smoothness in government orders, and to ensure  government authority in its administration, discipline must be  further strengthened. Without strict discipline or uniformity  in action, how can we exercise leadership over the great cause  of socialist modernization?    Fifth, we should step up the formation of clean  administration. We should be confident that the majority of our  cadres are good, but we should not overlook the seriousness of  corruption. We made certain achievements in combating  corruption in the previous period, and this helped stop the  spread of corruption, but we should not overestimate these  achievements. We should soberly understand that the combat  against corruption will remain protracted.    Sixth, we should really care for the masses' lives and  deepen  reform. Fundamentally speaking, this will benefit the masses.  But benefits will differ in some aspects and some periods.  When acknowledging the fact that most of the masses' lives are  improving, leaders should not forget a small number of people  who still have difficulties. Government institutions at all  levels should do their best to help resolve their difficulties  and show more concern for them. This is our unshirkable duty.    Vice Governors Xu Shanlin, Wang Shuangxi, Liu Chunmao, and  Jiang Xinzhen attended the meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

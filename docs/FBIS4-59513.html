			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni News Agency correspondent in the al-Dali'  district has reported the return of normal life to the city of  al-Dali' and neighboring areas after the forces of  constitutional legitimacy purged them of the forces misled by  the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party. The  correspondent said citizens resumed work and shops opened  normally.    In another development, the [Yemeni Television] First  Channel  team shot pictures of the 'Abbud Camp area and other areas which  were brought under the control of the constitutional legitimacy  forces, including arms depots, tanks, and vehicles left behind  by the fleeing forces misled by the elements of apostasy,  rebellion, and secession. The news team interviewed citizens  and fighters who joined the legitimacy forces. They expressed  their pleasure that the forces of unity and legitimacy had  managed to rid the area and its citizens of the hegemony of the  forces of apostasy, rebellion, and secession and their divisive  practices.    The brother citizens in the city of al-Dali' and neighboring  areas appreciated the good treatment extended to them by the  forces of legitimacy and unity, contrary to the falsehoods  propagated by the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party.  This good treatment proved that words are coupled by deeds by  the legitimate leadership under brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and  supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who instructed the Armed  Forces to extend all possible assistance to the citizens in the  region and protect their property in confirmation of the  responsibility shouldered by the state of unity under his  leadership for the sake of protecting the citizens throughout  Yemen.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (1): The Old Lady has stepped into the limelight The Old Lady has come out of the shadows for her 300th birthday. Over the past two years, the Bank of England has achieved a position of rare prominence in the affairs of the United Kingdom. Although still subordinate to the government when determining monetary policy, the Bank has acquired a position which makes it virtually impossible for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to change interest rates for political rather than economic reasons. Its present governor, Mr Eddie George, a lifelong Bank man who moved up to the top slot a year ago from the position of deputy, has become a public figure in a way that few of his predecessors have done. Nor is the Bank likely to drop out of the headlines. Bubbling in the background is the debate over whether it should be given greater independence. It has become almost de rigueur for resigning chancellors to reveal that they favoured freeing the Bank to run monetary policy independent of the Treasury, although there is no sign that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present occupier of Number 11 Downing Street, has been persuaded to support the idea. In the past 12 months, a plethora of reports - from leading City figures, the influential House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee and Mr Stanley Fischer, the distinguished US economist who is soon to become a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, among others - have urged that the Bank should have greater autonomy over monetary policy while being made more accountable to parliament. In the middle distance, there is the possibility of European economic and monetary union (Emu). This will require that the European Union's central banks be independent before handing over responsibility for monetary policy and a future single European currency to an independent European Central Bank. Although Britain can opt out of Emu, continuing pressure from Britain's EU partners to move ahead with the project by the end of the century will help keep the independence debate alive. European developments have always had a profound impact on the Bank. It was, after all, set up in 1694 to finance a war against France that was being prosecuted by the Dutch-born King William III. Its first governor, John Houblon, was a second generation Huguenot protestant, and therefore an exile from France. The Bank's recent emergence as a more significant participant in UK monetary policy was the direct result of a European policy failure: the collapse of British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When sterling was forced out of the ERM in September 1992, the then chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, moved swiftly to establish a new policy framework for monetary policy. His aim was to restore credibility in what was then the government's overriding economic policy goal of bringing down inflation. The policy's planks were greater openness and an enhanced role for the Bank. The Lamont changes set a specific inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent for retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, with the aim of having inflation in the lower half of the band by the end of this parliament. The dates of the chancellor's monthly meetings with the governor to discuss monetary policy were made public and marked by the publication by the Treasury of a monthly monetary report setting out the information on which policy judgments were based. The Bank was given responsibility for publishing a quarterly inflation report to monitor progress towards achieving the inflation target, giving it the opportunity to warn the government when it believes policies are wrongly set to deliver price stability. This opportunity was turned into a specific mandate when Mr George was named as successor to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown) as governor in January 1993. Mr Lamont 'made clear to the new governor that his central responsibility should be to support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. The Bank's powers and responsibilities have increased further since Mr Clarke became chancellor in May last year. Treasury vetting of the inflation report was stopped in November 1993. About that time, Mr Clarke gave the Bank the right to determine the precise timing of interest rate changes, while retaining the decision over their direction and scale. In April this year, the chancellor decided to publish the minutes of his monthly monetary meetings with Mr George after a six-week delay, bringing an unprecedented degree of openness to UK monetary policy. In a short period, therefore, the bank has moved from being an instinctively secretive institution to one that must expect to account for its actions and advice to government. The first batch of minutes to be released showed that chancellor and governor could disagree over interest rates, although so far not to the point of having a serious rift in a good working relationship. Mr George has described publication of the minutes as 'a terrific step'. It is hard to imagine any chancellor, present or future, being able to change monetary policy for political reasons, at least as long as the incumbent governor holds office. The Treasury has already had to get used to the Bank governor staking out policy positions in public in an unusually forthright manner. At last month's Mansion House speech to the merchants and bankers of the City of London, Mr George almost upstaged the chancellor when he warned that the next move in UK interest rates would be upwards. Although the Bank's role of combating inflation through monetary policy has hogged the headlines over the past two years, it is only part of its activities. A controversial management restructuring that took effect at the beginning of this month has emphasised that the Bank is as responsible for securing financial stability and efficient and competitive financial markets as it is for price stability. The Bank's supervisory activities have been bolstered as part of its internal reorganisation into two broad wings - one responsible for financial stability and the other for monetary stability. In particular, the shutting down of the international division - a measure that has caused considerable anguish inside the Bank - has allowed the redeployment of staff with foreign expertise in the financial stability wing. The retention and strengthening of the Bank's supervisory functions over the banking sector are signs that the Old Lady has been able to absorb and survive the criticism it incurred after the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991. As evidence of the trust placed in the Bank's expertise in financial markets, the Treasury earlier this year gave the Bank greater freedom to operate in the government bond market. The Treasury now sets the guidelines on debt management and funding policy but leaves the Bank free to choose the timing and nature of issues of gilt-edged stock. Although the enhanced focus on monetary and financial stability makes the Bank look less like a conglomerate than it did, it is intimately bound up in the future of its surrounding financial centre in a way that other central banks are not. One of its four executive directors, Mr Pen Kent, has been given responsibility for the UK's financial infrastructure, including the development of Crest, the Bank's successor to the ill-fated Taurus project for a paperless settlement system that was developed and abandoned by the stock exchange. This broad base of activities gives the Bank some cause to think of an institutional future stretching beyond its first 300 years. Other European central banks, such as the Bundesbank with its more narrowly defined objective of pursuing price stability, can be less confident of having a significant role to play if Emu ever comes.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROTHENBERG CASE  </P> <P> While I sympathize with David Rothenberg, I am concerned that the conditions of  his father's parole represent an injustice to all of the victims of violent  crimes. What warrants such exceptional safeguards while numerous less  newsworthy victims share his same fears? Above all, his father is a threat to  only one person while there are many paroled rapists and robbers who are  threats to all of society.  </P> <P> STEVE HOWARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen Republic does not intend to hold  consultations with Russia, if political forces in opposition to  the republic's president take part, Interfax was told by  President Djokhar Dudayev, who added that today any  Russian-Chechen negotiations and consultations are possible  either at the summit level or between foreign ministers. "All  the rest is indecent gambling. We have a large reserve of  tolerance but it has its limits," he said.    The Russian president's chief of staff, Sergey Filatov, told  Interfax earlier that Russian-Chechen consultations involving  representatives of the various political forces in the Chechen  Republic would take place in Moscow.    "Those called the Chechen opposition are criminals which  settled in Moscow and are stirring up trouble to suit the  interests of political profiteers. If Russia wants to negotiate  with criminals, it is its own business," said Dudayev.    At present there is no political force in Russia which would  fully control the situation and bear responsibility for the  decision-making, said Dudayev. As to Boris Yeltsin, who is,  indeed, the last and the only stronghold of legality in Russia,  he, regrettably, is virtually barred from effecting control over  the development of the Russian-Chechen relationships, said  Dudayev.    That is why, he said, the Chechen government raises the  question on the temporary moratorium for negotiations with  Russia.</p>

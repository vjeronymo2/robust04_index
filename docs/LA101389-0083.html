			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTEL CONSTRUCTION BID IS REJECTED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles city zoning administrator has denied a controversial request to  build a 21-unit motel on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington, saying the owners  of the property have not properly maintained their existing motel on the same  site.  </P> <P> "The physical condition of this place is absolutely deplorable," said Associate  Zoning Administrator James Crisp in an interview Thursday, shortly after he  turned down the application submitted by Chao-Ching Lee and his wife, Su-Yun.  </P> <P> In addition, Crisp said evidence showed that the 13-unit Crest Motel at 1104 W.  Pacific Coast Highway was cited by police, who conducted an undercover  operation in which they rented a room there after telling the motel clerk it  would be used for prostitution. Knowing that, Crisp said, he could not in good  conscience grant a conditional-use permit to Lee for redevelopment of the  Crest.  </P> <P> Area residents had also complained about the way Lee managed the motel. "Nobody  had any faith or trust in him to keep this motel so that it would not become an  eyesore in the community," said Wilmington community activist JoAnn Wysocki.  </P> <P> The Lees, who may appeal the decision to the city Zoning Board of Appeals,  could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

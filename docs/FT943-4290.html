			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Charges mask improved performance at Cookson Exceptional charges totalling Pounds 49.4m, including goodwill write-offs of Pounds 36.5m, masked strong underlying sales growth and a sharply improved first-half profit performance at Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group. Pre-tax profits after the exceptional items, which mainly related to the sale of 25 engineering subsidiaries to a management buy-out team in March, fell to Pounds 3.6m. The restated figure of Pounds 42.4m for the year-ago period included a Pounds 5.5m net profit on disposals. Excluding the exceptional items, pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 jumped by 46 per cent to Pounds 53.8m (Pounds 36.9m), on turnover up 8 per cent to 769.1m (Pounds 710.1m). On a like-for-like basis, after adjusting for exchange rate movements and acquisitions and disposals, turnover grew by 12 per cent. Net interest costs fell from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 9.7m. On an non-adjusted basis the group posted a 2.4p loss per share (5.6p earnings). However, the interim dividend is raised to 3.2p (3p). The figures, particularly the sales growth, were ahead of market expectations and the shares closed up 7p at 259p. Operating profits increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 49.8m), or by 31 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said despite pressure on group margins the return on sales rose from 7 per cent to 8.3 per cent - edging closer to the target of more than 10 per cent. Mr Oster said trading in the electronic materials and plastics businesses was particularly strong. Most of the businesses in the ceramics and engineered products divisions also contributed to the 'substantially improved half-year results.' Net borrowings at June 30 stood at Pounds 163m, representing gearing of 27 per cent. COMMENT Cookson is continuing to make progress towards its strategic goals. The sale of the engineering businesses concluded the short-term divestiture programme of non-core businesses, margins are increasing and all of the 23 loss-makers of two years ago have been turned around. The underlying sales growth now being achieved is impressive, prompting some analysts to raise their forecast yesterday. Pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, of at least Pounds 115m now look possible this year. Cookson is more than just a recovery play and deserves its premium prospective p/e rating of 18.6.</p>

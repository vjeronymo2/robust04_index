			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Cultural imperialism THE IDEA of Catherine Deneuve engaging in hand-to-hand combat with The Terminator on the world's cinema screens may seem far-fetched, even by Hollywood's standards. However, it is a fitting metaphor for a source of conflict which is increasingly exercising US and European Community negotiators as they seek to clear the remaining obstacles to a world trade agreement. At issue are plans to liberalise international trade in audio-visual services, chiefly films and television programmes. Though promoted largely by the US, such an agreement is also favoured by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, who wants the Uruguay Round to cover as many services as possible. However, negotiations have hit a stumbling block in the form of French demands - which have won support in some other parts of the EC - that audio-visual services be exempted from the round. Protesting that liberalisation would sweep away Europe's last defences against a flood tide of American mass-market entertainment, France argues that culture is too important to be abandoned to the free market. It would be absurd if the dispute were allowed seriously to threaten a world trade deal. Not only are the economic gains and losses at stake relatively minor; the central issues in the debate have been obscured by the exaggerated rhetoric and claims of the protagonists. As a consequence, economic and cultural principles have become unnecessarily confused. Cultural identity France's case deserves sympathy, up to a point. It is not the only country concerned with maintaining its national cultural identity in the face of an international mass-media barrage. It also has an understandable interest in seeking to keep alive the only sizeable film production industry left in Europe. That this has only been possible thanks to special levies and subsidies should not be a matter of great concern. After all, other performing arts, such as music and theatre, are subsidised everywhere in the world. It may be objected that films are different because they are traded internationally. However, it is hard to argue that state support seriously distorts competition in a business where financial viability is determined far more by audience size than by production costs. In pressing for an agreement to curb subsidies, the US is tilting at windmills. A far greater obstacle to free trade is the EC's four-year-old restriction on the proportion of programming from outside the Community which may be broadcast on national television networks. Though technically non-binding, these are widely observed. France has gone further, legislating even stiffer restrictions on domestic broadcasters. That is the target on which the US should focus its attack. Defeatist argument Defenders of European quotas say they are needed to prevent the market being swamped with cheap US programmes, the costs of which have already been covered by sales to their large home market. That is a defeatist argument which ignores the fact that US programme makers owe much of their success to effective marketing and distribution in the EC, which local rivals have failed to match. The principle of applying a local content test to films and television programmes is, in any case, a logical nonsense. What is it supposed to measure in an industry where capital, talent and production resources flow freely across frontiers and are drawn from an increasingly wide range of international sources? Should the output of the MCA studios, located in Hollywood but owned by Matsushita, count as American or Japanese? But the strongest argument against quotas is that they are a form of censorship. That is not only objectionable in itself. It amounts to self-delusion by governments at a time when public service broadcasting channels face growing competition from newer media such as cable, satellite and video systems. How these media should best be regulated is a legitimate policy concern, which lies outside the scope of the Uruguay Round. For the moment, the priority for the US and the EC should be to sweep away unnecessary and economically damaging impediments to audio-visual trade.</p>

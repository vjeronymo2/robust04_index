Speaking before journalists  at the United Nations, Dr. Bukoshi said: "We call upon the  United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and  Russia to comprehensively include Kosova in the peace process,  because without the solution of Kosova issue there will be no  peace in Balkans."    Prime Minister Bukoshi, who is conducting a three-day visit  to the United States, the United Nations, and Washington  respectfully [as published] once again called high and  decision-making officials not to ignore the explosive situation  in Kosova and take preventive steps before it gets too late. He  also said that: "During this month, army movements have  intensified, and the number of Serbian soldiers to Kosova has  increased. The situation has deteriorated especially since the  Serbian paramilitary kill Albanian civilians in cold blood,"  said Dr. Bukoshi, and illustrated it with the latest killings in  Hani i Ezit and Fusche Kosova.    Dr. Bukoshi warned that the peaceful policy of the Kosova  Government could lose credibility among the Albanian population,  and said that "this peaceful stand could be used by Belgrade's  authorities to intensify their repression. Whereas, peaceful  movement of Albanians could be the reason for neglecting the  Kosova situation by the international community."    "These alarming trends threaten to stop all the progress  toward peace in Kosova," said Bukoshi, and added that while  Serbs in Knin and Bosnia are on the verge of achieving their  territorial aspirations through violence and aggression,  Albanians in Kosova and Macedonia are facing mounting misery  only because of their peaceful determination.    "Our main purpose is to prevent war in Kosova, and as far as  our political project is concerned, we had declared our will  through the referendum. Kosova fulfills all the conditions to  be an independent state, similar to other republics of former  Yugoslavia. Kosova is a rich region and has a sufficient human  potential. We are not asking to unite with Albania and this is  the biggest compromise we are offering. We are not asking for  the change of borders through the use of force," answered Dr.  Bukoshi to the question whether they considered the unification  with Albania.    Asked whether he was requestion a deployment of  peace-keeping  troops to Kosova, similar to those in Macedonia, Prime Minister  Bukoshi said: "The best example of preventive measures by the  international community is The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM]. A civilian-military government under the  auspices of the United Nations for a certain interim period  until normalization of life would be the best possible solution.  Within this framework, demilitarization of Kosova should take  place, and removal of all paramilitary forces, establishment of  democratic institutions, such as parliament, government and  public life."</p>

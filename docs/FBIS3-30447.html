[passage omitted]    At his meetings today, the Iranian foreign minister was  assured of Bulgaria's willingness to widen its economic  relations with Iran. Iran used to be Bulgaria's principal  trading partner in the Third World. Bulgaria hopes to regain  these positions. "We expect Bulgaria to reestablish its  traditional position in the Iranian market with a number of  goods: Cigarettes, cheese, meat, chemical fertilizers, machine  tools and materials handling equipment," the Bulgarian  president's foreign policy adviser told journalists after the  meeting. A bilateral trade agreement is expected to be signed  tomorrow. A banking agreement and an agreement on payments are  also being prepared. The Bulgarian-Iranian Commission on  Economic Cooperation will meet in April. [passage omitted]    The problem of the Bulgarian debt to Iran was raised at the  meeting with Prof. Berov. This country has already repaid $6  million of the $20 million owed. The remaining $14 million will  be gradually repaid in the future. Prof. Berov expressed the  hope Bulgaria would become a regular consumer of Iranian gas.  Dr. Velayati said there was no problem bartering goods other  than petroleum products. So far, however, Iran has preferred to  trade petroleum for hard currency rather than on a clearing  basis. Dr. Velayati sees prospects in promoting transport  cooperation not only on roads across Turkey, but also across the  Caucasus. According to a government Press Office source, the  Bulgarian prime minister is also warming to the idea of a  trans-Caucasian route. Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati suggested the  promotion of free trade areas. According to him, Bulgaria and  Iran should pursue their relations not only on a bilateral, but  also on a multilateral basis. One possible area for this are  the Central Asian Republics. The prospects for cooperation  between the private sectors were also a discussed at the Berov-  Velayati talks.    In the words of the president's adviser, issues concerning  the Islamic Conference Organization and Bulgarian Muslims were  high on the agenda. "The Islamic Conference countries must  reconsider the issue, acknowledging the recognition and respect  for their (the Bulgarian Muslims') rights," the president's  adviser said, adding that ample evidence could be produced to  corroborate this fact.    Conferring with Dr. Velayati, National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov pointed out that the moment is ripe for the  Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of Bulgarian  Muslims off its agenda. According to Mr. Yordanov, the Iranian  foreign minister has agreed to that. Bulgaria has set forth the  same position before representatives of other Islamic countries,  such as Egypt and Kuwait. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry and  Parliament will shortly submit all necessary laws and the  Constitution to prove, as the head of parliament put it, that  the rights of Bulgarian Muslims are genuinely protected by  Bulgarian legislation.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Szpilewicz: "The Coal Companies"] </F>   [Text] A year is about to elapse since the formation of the  coal companies. Much indicates that the effects of this measure  have been positive so far. The companies group mine clusters by  the criterion of contiguity of mining land according to land  registers. (In accordance with that criterion, the so-far  single-mine autonomous Bogdanka joint-stock company has been  established.)    A stronger export standing: It was possible, more so than in  the preceding years, to mesh the structural and seasonal slump  in domestic sales of coal with a commensurate increase in export  shipments, as illustrated by the tabulation below of sales (in  millions of metric tons) in the years 1989, 1992, and 1993.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1Coal Sales in Millions of Metric Tons                               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1989              |1992              |1993              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To power plants   |57.2              |39.0              |37.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To coking plants  |21.7              |14.4              |13.0              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To other domestic |98.7              |54.1              |57.2              |  |customers         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exports           |28.9              |18.7              |23.8[.sup]1[/]  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |[.sup]1[/]plus 1.4 million metric tons from the stocks of Weglokoks      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Receiving credit for their coal exports enabled the mines to  meet their most urgent obligations and especially to disburse  wages. The nightmare of spreading coal dumps vanished. At year's  end, the coal-storage areas were empty.    The following coal companies rank foremost among coal  exporters (tonnage exported and proportion of exports to total  sales in parentheses): Jastrzebie (7.1 million metric tons, 47  percent), Rybnik (4.9 million metric tons, 33 percent), Katowice  (4.4 million metric tons, 19 percent), Gliwice (3.9 million  metric tons, 22 percent), Ruda (1.5 million metric tons, 11  percent), Bytom (1.4 million metric tons, 10 percent), and  Nadwislanska (0.8 million metric tons, 3 percent).    Concentration of mining operations. These  operations became less extensive, reflecting a more selective  concentration of extraction at mine levels and galleries and  assuring a more efficient utilization of machinery and  personnel. The overall length of extraction walls dropped to 79  km (compared with 112.4 km in 1989), and the number of active  extraction walls dropped to 440 (compared with 640 in 1989).  While the volume of extraction was the same as in 1992,  employment in mining companies declined by 19,000, and  productivity, as measured by the number of metric tons of coal  extracted annually per employee, increased by 6 percent and  reached 415 metric tons.    The maximum productivity--greater by a factor of 1.5 than  the  average--was attained by the Lublin Coal Company.    Decline in the real extraction cost of coal. This  is due to lower operating expenses (other than wages), which in  dollar terms decreased by $2.6 per metric ton, to $14.10 from  $16.70--i.e., by 18 percent--compared with the preceding year.  Of these expenses (in dollars per metric ton):     -  The cost of materials and energy decreased by 10 percent,  to $6.20 from $6.80.    -  The cost of outside services decreased by  three-fifths, to $2.70 from $4.60.    -  Depreciation, owing to, among  other things, greater sales, decreased by 10 percent, to $1.70  from $1.90.     The expenditures on wages and salaries, on the other hand,  increased by $0.30 per metric ton, to $16.2 from $15.9, of which  direct wages increased to $11.50 from $11.40 and the cost of  fringe benefits to $4.70 from $4.50.    During the year, the value of the dollar rose, and the zloty  [Z] was devalued by a factor of 1.3 times. The mean annual  currency exchange rate amounted to Z18,300 per dollar, compared  with Z13,600 in the preceding year.    Altogether, the real production cost of coal dropped to  $31.20 [per metric ton] from $32.60--i.e., by 4 percent.    What problems were encountered by the coal companies during  the period in question?    First, there was the price "Rubicon." It was quite explicit,  as shown by a comparison of domestic and export prices of coal.  In domestic sales, coal prices increased in real terms (by 8  percent after a year) to $29.90 from $27.60 per metric ton, of  which, for lump coal, by 13 percent, to $52.50 from $46.40; for  coal breeze used by power plants, by 13 percent, to $22.40 from  $19.80; and for coking coal, by 18 percent, to $41.20 from  $34.80.    As for the export prices, there was a big slump in export  sales owing to the decline in the prices of crude petroleum. As  a result, in real terms, export prices plummeted by 18 percent,  to $30.30 from $36.0 per metric ton, of which the decreases  were: for lump coal, by 9 percent, to $58.20 from $62.90; for  coal breeze used by power plants, by 27 percent, to $21.6 from  $29.60; and for coking coal, by 11 percent, to $33.00 from  $37.20.    Viewed in this light, reflections on the so-called import  parity have to be qualified. To domestic customers, only lump  coal is cheaper (almost $6 per metric ton) than to foreign ones,  whereas they have to pay more (almost $1 more per metric ton)  for coal breeze and coking coal ($8 more per metric ton) than  foreign customers. Thus, on the whole, the average price  optained for exported coal has become only slightly higher  ($0.40 per metric ton) than the domestic price, while the  differences in quality remain considerable. In the preceding  year, the situation was much better because then the average  price obtained for exported coal was $8.40 per metric ton higher.    These proportions were averaged over the year and do not  quite reflect the actual variations. Price movements in the  first three quarters of last year were moderate, so most of the  increases in domestic prices of coal occurred during the last  quarter. That was needed to balance income with expenditures,  but it adversely affected the costs of fuel (lump coal, coke),  electricity, and heat--hence the increases.    arket capacity. The domestic market for [black]  coal is shrinking and will continue to shrink owing to  competition by the cheaper brown coal (used by power plants) and  the more convenient natural gas used in the households not  connected to the heating mains. Each year the gas industry is  gaining 200,000 new customers, of which 100,000 are for gas  heating of homes.    An export offensive on the West European market might afford  us an opportunity. Another, more long-term opportunity is  presented by Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic countries. As for  overseas markets, freight cost is too high to make exports to  them profitable. Last year, imports by the West European  countries were about 130 million metric tons, of which 90  million tons were of power coal and 40 million tons of coking  coal. That was 17 million tons less than in 1992. Owing to the  recession, purchases by power plants declined by about 10  million tons, and by coking plants by about 7 million tons. In  that situation, exporters, including Poland, benefited from the  withdrawal of Russian coal (12 million tons in 1992) from the  market owing to the government-ordered soaring increases in the  cost of Russian rail freight. Among coal exporters to the West  European market, Poland ranked fourth, with about 18 million  metric tons, after South Africa (about 34 million tons),  Australia (about 30 million tons), and the United States (about  2 million tons [as published]).    It would be vain to expect a resurgence of coal demand in  West Europe, despite the continuing decline in extraction in  Great Britain, Germany, and France. It remains for us to  continue an obdurate struggle to retain our beachheads in  competition with such low-cost "tigers" as, chiefly, South  Africa and Australia, not to mention a turnaround toward the  "East," considering that, under the barter system, coal and  coke, for example, are swappable for Krivoi Rog ore and iron  nodules.    Financial performance of the coal companies. The  closing balance sheet for last year was somewhat negative (sales  declined by $1.60 per metric ton compared with a decline of $5  per ton in 1992), although by December it turned positive (sales  increased by $4.80 per ton). Table 2 illustrates the performance  of individual coal companies for 1993 as a whole and for  December 1993 alone.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2Financial Performance of Coal Companies in 1993(in dollars)           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |December 1993            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bytom Coal Company       |- 2.7                    |+ 2.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ruda Coal Company        |- 3.1                    |+ 4.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gliwice Coal Company     |+ 1.5                    |- 1.3                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Katowice Mines           |+ 0.1                    |+ 4.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nadwislanska Coal Company|- 1.2                    |+ 3.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rybnik Coal Company      |- 2.2                    |+ 2.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jastrzebie Coal Company  |- 1.6                    |+ 6.8                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bogdanka, Inc.           |0                        |+ 7.6                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The principal wish for the future is that the coal companies  improve their performance on their own rather than at the  expense of the consumer and the currency devaluation. Miners'  jobs depend on this.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US 'flouting the rules' in steel dispute THE European Commission said yesterday it was 'shocked' at Monday's imposition by the US of provisional countervailing duties on flat-rolled steel from six EC countries, accusing Washington of flouting international trade rules to protect its steel market. But Brussels strenuously avoided suggesting any link between this new round in the transatlantic steel contest and the Uruguay Round world trade reform process, rekindled by last month's EC-US settlement of a long-running farm trade dispute. 'The Uruguay Round remains an absolute priority for us,' a Commission spokesman said. The punitive US duties follow anti-dumping and subsidy complaints against EC producers by the six big American steelmakers, and the failure to conclude a multilateral steel agreement (MSA) after the voluntary export restraint accord the EC had with the US expired in March after 10 years. But whereas in April Brussels threatened to respond vigorously to any US action against EC steel exports, yesterday officials would not be drawn on the possibility of reprisals. 'Naturally we will be looking at the appropriate response,' was as far as a Commission spokesman would go. The duties cover 2m tonnes of EC flat products, worth nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 657m) last year, and range from just over 1 to nearly 60 per cent. They affect Belgium (4.9 per cent countrywide but 30.2 per cent on Cockerill Sambre, the main producer); France (26.5 per cent); Germany (from 0.6 per cent on Thyssen to 17.3 per cent across the country on plate steel); Italy (58.8 per cent); Spain (56.3 per cent); and the UK (19.1 per cent for cut-to-length carbon steel plate). The Commission says the US is responding politically to the domestic difficulties of its steel producers by effectively closing its market to Community steel exporters. But it was not confident enough of its position yesterday to allow the arguments produced by its steel experts to be attributed in any way to the Commission itself or the EC, prompting a press boycott of its briefing on the controversy. Before yesterday, however, these experts had said US anti-dumping action had been the prelude to 'bombing' rival steel producers into accepting voluntary quotas on exports to the US. Some European steelmakers, especially those on long-term contracts, they admit, could 'technically' be dumping in the US market because of weakness in the dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans has expressed  concern at the capture in Bosnia of around 200 UN personnel.  Among them are three Dutch nationals. They have been taken  hostage by Serbs in actions following NATO air strikes against  Serb positions near Gorazde. Mr. Kooijmans emphasized that the  air strikes were in accordance with a UN resolution, and he  called the Serb reaction completely unjustified.</p>

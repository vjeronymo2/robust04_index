			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions deal blow to Smith plans for voting reform PLANS by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to modernise his party's links with trade unions were snubbed yesterday as two of the largest unions voted against them. The GMB general union and Nupe, the public-service union, both voted at their annual conferences against Mr Smith's plans for one-member-one-vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. The NCU telecommunications union, holding its conference in Blackpool, is also expected to vote against the plan which Mr Smith is determined to push through. About 50 per cent of the total votes at the Labour party's annual conference are now already pitted against the reforming plan. Other big unions, holding their congresses in the next few weeks, are expected to take similar stances in what is emerging as a bitter battle between the big unions and the 'modernisers' in the Labour party. Several options for reform have been suggested by the unions and there is likely to be a tense negotiation within the movement for a compromise. Mr John Edmonds, general-secretary of the GMB, told reporters: 'The party faces two very unattractive options. The first is that the issue goes to the conference in the autumn and the way that the votes seem to be going indicates the party leader's proposals will go down. The second is we have an unseemly public row that rattles on for a large number of weeks.' He said the best possibility was that the review group, which examined the relationship between the Labour party and trade unions, be recalled and that it try to make a unanimous recommendation to the party's ruling national executive committee in advance of the party conference. Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of NUPE, meeting in Scarborough, said his union's proposal was not one-member-one-vote and not the block vote  -but a register of Labour party supporters. The GMB's proposal is similar. It recommended yesterday that a reformed electoral college be set up for the next round of elections of parliamentary candidates as a transition towards the use of a register of people who paid the political levy to the Labour party. A vote against one-member-one-vote will mean that there is no procedure for the next round of candidate selections. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, later issued a statement saying that yesterday's vote by the GMB 'exposes the sham of John Smith's Labour party. 'The next few months will show that the Labour party is still a wholly-owned subsidiary of the trade union movement.'</p>

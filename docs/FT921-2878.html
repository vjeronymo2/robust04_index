			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The man who will launch more than 5,500 faces AS Conservative director of communications, Mr Shaun Woodward is responsible for launching what may be the largest poster campaign in British advertising history. The former BBC producer and director now charged with controlling all aspects of the Tories' press and publicity campaign, has covered nearly 5,500 hoardings with party posters. In the advertising business, a 2,000-site campaign is a huge one, and even a high-profile lager brand was content with 800 posters in a recent campaign. Mr Woodward's brief is 'to put together a full communications strategy for John Major's first general election campaign. That covers press, television, public relations, advertising, posters, working out new ways of doing party political and party election broadcasts, opinion polling, direct mail.' 'By and large no-one remembers a single Labour party poster from previous elections,' he said. 'What that shows is not that the Labour party wasn't producing posters; it shows that you can spend money on advertising and not necessarily get results.' Along with that poster campaign will be a drive to keep Conservative politicians in front of the television cameras - a grid plan has been drawn up to ensure that a senior cabinet figure appears in each of the main television regions on each campaigning day. Newspaper advertising is likely to get short shrift. 'I have a feeling that double-page spreads don't work in newspapers and Chris Patten shares that view. However, if Neil Kinnock delivers a mistake then we might capitalise on that with a press ad the next day.' But in commercial advertising all that can be demonstrated is a correlation between advertising and sales - increased sales seem to coincide with increased advertising, though no causal relationship can be demonstrated. In planning his poster campaign, Mr Woodward is content with the correlation argument - he points to Labour's six-point lead in a Mori poll in January before the Conservative 'Labour's Tax Bombshell' poster hit the streets. By the end of the month, Mori had the Conservatives three points ahead of Labour. 'The political argument was not made by a poster or by advertising but by politicians who had an idea, which was that we must point out very clearly to the electorate what a Labour government would do to the average income tax that most people pay. Advertising was used to put that on the map. If your policies aren't right when you are on the map, you won't win.' Anything less than a public expression of supreme confidence would be shocking, and Mr Woodward does not disappoint: 'Running a good campaign is not just about having money. It's about being disciplined, coherent and organised. 'In the last few months I think most people regard us as having run the better campaign and I think that's by and large a reflection of the relationship between the party chairman and the prime minister - you couldn't get a sheet of tissue paper between them.'</p>

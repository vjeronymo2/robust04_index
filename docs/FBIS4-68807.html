			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva: "They Really Want To Go Back </F> to the Zone: The First Victory Has Been Won by the Inhabitants  of the Region Along the Amur Who Are Demanding the Restoration  of the Border Zones Along the Russian Bank of the Amur River"]    [Text] Nikolay Volkov, administration head of the Jewish  Autonomous Oblast, has signed a decree entitled "Establishing a  Border Zone and Introducing Regulated Limitations in Its  Confines on the Territory of the YeAO [Jewish Autonomous  Oblast]." Now, once again, it will be possible to enter dozens  of major villages on the bank of the Amur, including the rayon  centers of Leninskoye and Amurzet, only on the basis of special  passes.    And yet not four years have passed since, by decision of the  local Soviets of Amur Oblast and Khabarovsk Kray, which at that  time also included the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, there was a  rejection of strict border regulations everywhere in the area  along the Amur. At that time, in 1991, many Far Easterners  greeted literally with a hurrah the abolition of the border  zones and the easing up of border regulations. And that was  really understandable, because that radically changed the life  of the border area: the bans and limitations were reduced to the  minimum, and free access was opened up to the Amur and to its  channels and tributaries in places where the border ran, and  where the barbed-wire fences were removed, so that you could  catch fish, relax, and enjoy the gifts of nature!    However, many of the inhabitants of the Far East and other  regions of the country perceived the liberalization of the  border regulations as permissiveness. A rare day has passed  sincethat time on the border without violations and all kinds of  reported incidents. Criminal elements of all kinds have rushed  into this area: some with the purpose of carrying out smuggling  transactions with their Chinese counterparts, and others were  attracted to the bottomlands of the Amur by untouched areas of  marijuana. In the border rayons, where crimes used to be  extremely rare phenomena, robberies, muggings, and other heinous  crimes have become an everyday occurrence. The border guards now  have many new things to worry about. In addition to their direct  duty -- the protection of the borders -- they have had to catch  and eject from the confines of their areas the narcotics dealers  who have come here.    It is not surprising that the population of the border area,  which became accustomed during their long life behind the  swing-down barrier to moderation and order, and which now is  intimidated by this kind of bacchanalia, began almost  immediately to demand a return to the old standards and rules.  It took a long time for the local authorities to decide to take  such a backwakrd step. But this is the first precedent. Probably  the example of the Jewish Oblast will inspire the inhabitants of  other territories to wage an even more aggressive struggle for a  return to the previous regulations on the border. And the slogan  "We want to go back to the zone!" will become even more popular  in the area along the Amur.</p>

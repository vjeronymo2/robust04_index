			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: The importance of a little style - Theatre Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) knew that in trivial matters, the most important thing is style, and that in serious matters, the most important thing is style. All the more surprising that The Importance of Being Earnest at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, should be so un-stylish. The director, James Maxwell, has set the play in the early 1900s. The designs by Tom Rand use an uncomfortable alliance of Rene Mackintosh chairs and Art Deco in town to contrast with the Arts &amp; Crafts interior in the country. This is right, in that the play is about the Country versus the City. But the sets seem extreme, and changing them means two intervals in a play that should career to a conclusion. The play could run on its own, without the actors: those lines about careless children, handbags and railway stations are carefully set in social aspic for the discerning palate. Add a few cucumber sandwiches and a plate of muffins and the set would be complete. The production has two drawbacks. First, the Royal Exchange, in the round, is disadvantaged with Wilde. His comedy depends on looking at rather than joining in. A round theatre makes you want to reach out for a slice of the tea cake, and it makes the actors restless to speak to every part of the theatre. The second drawback is that the actors have yet to find their range. Wilde is all about uncomfortable social situations, and his brilliance in comedy was to apply a patina of politeness to rank improbabilities. The more serious the lines, the funnier they appear. Two women in love with the same man called Ernest who turns out to be Ernest and two separate men is a plot that needs to be treated with a certain gravitas. Samuel West as Algernon Moncrieff gets it right in the first act, and Neil Dudgeon as Jack Worthing in the third. But there is little else of the play's spirit in between. Lady Bracknell (Avril Elgar) should be a Dreadnought in heavy seas, but here seems more like a cutter in light winds. She wears pink, and has what looks like skate wings high around her collar: this means she cannot be heard, so the lovely lines about courtship ('He is ostentatiously eligible; he has nothing but he looks everything') and marriage ('We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces') are lost. The direction should make the actors less restless, the lighting (Robert Bryan) needs to give the scenes more visual depth, and the action should proceed with greater rigour. If flirting with your spouse is like washing your clean linen in public; flirting with Wilde is another basket of laundry entirely: he will be sure to remind you, even if he has not yet said it, that only the mediocre are always at their best. Sponsored by Ernst &amp; Young. The Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester (061 833 9833) until January 29</p>

Narasimha Rao visits Germany next month  there will be considerable pressure for his support for this  media project which will enhance German influence in India.    However, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Bhaskar  Ghose  said there was no move so far to review the landmark Cabinet  decisions of 1955 and 1956 which forbids publication of  foreign-owned newspapers and the operation of foreign news  agencies in India. The Ministry, he said, had not forwarded any  such proposal to the Cabinet.    The aim of the 1955 regulation is to protect the Indian  newspaper industry from foreign competition.    The 1956 Cabinet noting on the wire services says no news  agency can operate directly from India. Whatever stories they  wish to distribute in India have to be through the Indian news  agencies PTI and UNI after being whetted by them.    Foreign news agencies have been making several attempts to  operate from India.    But in the wake of economic liberalisation certain sections  of the government, including the Finance Ministry, are said to  be eager to open up the media too.    In the last couple of years foreign newspapers and wire  services have been desperate to get a toe-hold in India so that  they have better and faster dispersal of their publications and  services in the region.    Towards the end of 1992 international lending agencies like  IMF, World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank put pressure on  Manmohan Singh and the Reserve Bank to improve the financial  information services and allow operation of financial news  services like Knight Ridder and Telerad (both British). In  violation of the 1956 regulation they were given permission.  However, I&amp;B ministry is believed to have opposed it. After  this  REUTER de-linked its financial news from PTI and has been coming  out as a separate service from India for distribution to special  clients.    At one stage the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, with the  support of the Hindujas, wanted to come out from India. Though  the proposal was supported by Manmohan Singh, it did not go  through.    But in the brief tenure of former Prime Minister Chandra  Shekhar, a FINANCIAL TIMES of London and Modi's tieup was  approved.    The approval was given by the Industry Ministry as an  industrial venture without considering the relevant press laws  or getting the Information and Broadcasting Ministry support.  Subsequently the Modis backed out of the project and Aveek  Sarkar of Ananda Bazar Patrika stepped in as the partner using  the same approval.    TIME magazine too is eager to publish from India and Living  Media Ltd, publishers of INDIA TODAY magazine, has applied for  clearing of the project.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that it is an  irresistible trend for economic and trade cooperation across the  Taiwan Strait to strengthen and for their people-to-people  contacts and exchanges to increase.    Any act or attempted act of secession, no matter in what  form, will be in vain, Qian said.    Qian made the remarks when he joined deputies from Taiwan to  the National People's Congress in a group discussion on Premier  Li Peng's government work report this afternoon.    He expressed the hope that Taiwan authorities will go along  with the trend and make joint efforts with the mainland to  develop relations across the Taiwan Strait and push ahead with  the reunification of China.    In the past couple of years, Qian said, thanks to joint  endeavors of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, economic  and trade cooperation between the two sides has developed  rapidly and people-to-people contacts and exchanges increased  steadily.    However, Qian said, there exist some problems in the  relations between the two sides, of which the outstanding one is  act or attempted act of secession "in varied forms."    It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to  achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. Any act or  attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in  vain, since it runs counter to the fundamental interests of the  Chinese nation, Qian reiterated.    As long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join  hands to develop relations, the peaceful reunification of China  will surely be realized at an early date, Qian added.</p>

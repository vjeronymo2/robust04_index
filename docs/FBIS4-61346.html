			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the Latvian government took over the  new unfinished facility of the Russian radar station in the  village of Skrunda 160 km southwest of Riga.    The act of reception was signed by the Latvian Prime  Minister  Valdis Birkavs. After the signing ceremony he said at a  briefing that the dismantling of the station's new facility may  be started immediately. He said the government intends to  announce a tender among firms for the dismantling of the  facility.    Under the Russian-Latvian agreement signed in Moscow on  Saturday within the framework of a package of agreements on the  withdrawal of troops from Latvia, the Skrunda station will  function for the next four years. Then it is to be fully  dismantled within 1.5 years. The Latvian government received  guarantees that the U.S. government would grant $2 million and  the Swedish government - another $1 million to finance the  dismantling.    The radar station was built in 1967 for missile attack early  warning. The construction of the new facility of the station  started at the end of 1980s.</p>

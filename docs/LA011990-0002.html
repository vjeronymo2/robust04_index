			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PROTEST  </P> <P> So President Bush was distressed by TV's use of the split screen depicting him  speaking with a light heart as the somber coffins arrived from Panama (Part A,  Jan. 6).  </P> <P> It does indeed seem a bit unfair, almost as unfair as Lee Atwater's frequent  use of Willie Horton bracketed with Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election  campaign. You sow, you reap.  </P> <P> KRAMER J. ROHFLEISCH  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

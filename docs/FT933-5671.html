			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / TUC urges Pounds 3bn training cash rise THE GOVERNMENT should spend an extra Pounds 3.2bn on training and job creation measures in its November Budget to cut unemployment, says the Trades Union Congress in its submission to the chancellor published yesterday. In its proposals, under the catch phrase 'investing in all our people', the TUC recommends that the government's training for work scheme should be expanded by 180,000 to 500,000 places at a cost of Pounds 2bn in the next financial year. It also proposes that the government's pilot Workstart job subsidy scheme should be developed with an extra 200,000 places at an added cost of Pounds 1.2bn. At present there are only 1,000 places in what is still an experimental scheme. The TUC believes the proposed job subsidy could be equal in amount to the average cost to the exchequer of an unemployed person in lost taxes and benefit payments. It suggests an average subsidy of Pounds 115 a week. It estimates that the removal of every 250,000 from the unemployment register to full-time work would provide the Treasury with a direct net gain of Pounds 2.2bn. The TUC urges Mr Kenneth Clarke to make no tax increases in his Budget except on the top 1 per cent. It also opposes public spending cuts and reductions in benefit entitlement as 'unfair, unnecessary and counter-productive'. The TUC argues that the large size of the public sector borrowing requirement is not due - as ministers argue - to excessive public spending but to the loss of tax revenues because of the recession. 'A restoration of economic growth rates would have a dramatic impact on tax revenues and hence on the overall PSBR,' it says. The TUC calls for more targeted public investment on infrastructure projects, a review of the financial rules governing public-sector industries to allow in private finance, and a national training strategy.</p>

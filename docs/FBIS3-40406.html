			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed F.F.: "Which Military Technologies Will </F> France Have to Give Up?"]    [Text] The General Commission of the National Plan has just  published a report on the "future of defense-related industries"  anticipating major job cuts in the sector. As a result,  following the trend in the national and export markets, the  French defense industry, which accounted for 330,000 direct and  indirect jobs at the start of 1993, is expected to lose between  58,000 and 130,000 direct and indirect jobs by 1997.    Faced with these new requirements, the report states that  France will not be able to remain self-sufficient in equipment  development and will have to enter into cooperation agreements  with its European partners. In this respect, the report  identifies 24 critical technologies which it divides into three  categories: those that need to be totally independent at French  or European level and whose proliferation would constitute a  risk; those that have intermediate priority; and those  technologies whose specifically dual-purpose nature (civil and  military) makes them less sensitive.  <H5>  Creating a Budget for the Acquisition of Foreign Technologies </H5>   Apart from nuclear technology, the first category includes  "micro- and nanoelectronic components for equipment and  subassemblies, navigation equipment, detection and signal  processing equipment, signature-recognition expertise, and  stealth-related technology, including knowhow in complex  systems." The intermediate priority technologies group includes  "modular electronic architecture, optical and optronic devices,  telecommunications hardware and networks, advanced computer  hardware, artificial intelligence and neural networks, software  engineering, and advanced calculating codes."    Finally, the less sensitive, dual-purpose technologies  include production software and industrial production systems,  and the technologies and hardware implemented in the security of  equipment and weapons systems. The report specifically  recommends that the amount of credits for basic defense research  should be maintained at present levels or even increased, and  suggests the additional creation of a budget earmarked for the  evaluation and acquisition of foreign technologies.</p>

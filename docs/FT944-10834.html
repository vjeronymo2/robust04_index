			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Private cash for transport projects set to reach Pounds 1bn The private sector will have committed Pounds 1bn to transport projects by March next year and Pounds 3.5bn worth of other schemes are being competed for, the government announced yesterday. The initiative was launched two years ago to get private finance into projects traditionally funded by the public sector. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said the scheme was still in its early stages but forecast that in 10 years it would be an integral part of the way the government managed transport programmes and not 'an optional extra'. He said: 'We have some considerable consortia who are saying that the Channel tunnel rail link is a do-able deal. When the private sector can define the risk, it has shown a willingness to invest.' The main private projects under way are the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension to the London Underground, the Pounds 300m Heathrow rail link and a second bridge across the Severn River. Schemes open to competition are the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link, the Pounds 400m plan for new Northern Line rolling stock for the Underground and four road schemes valued at Pounds 340m to be built and operated by the private sector. Attention has focused on larger schemes but there should be opportunities for contributions to projects such as refurbishment of rail stations.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (12): State gets thumbs-down - Businessmen still say West Bengal is not a safe investment bet WITH INDIA pursuing more liberal economic policies, the Marxist government in West Bengal can no longer hold New Delhi responsible for the lack of industrial investment in the state. Nor can it look, as it did in the past, to federal investment to revive its industrial economy. The central government does not have the funds. According to Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal, 'earlier, West Bengal was discriminated against. Businessmen were denied licences if the investment proposed was for West Bengal. But the condition has now changed with the dispensing of the licensing system. We now have to compete with other states to get private investment.' Whatever Mr Basu's view, his colleagues in the government have yet to make a break with the past. In the Economic Review for 1991-92, the state government says: 'Unless the centre invests in new industrial units, the state would be deprived of a major industrial growth impetus.' The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has prepared a package of measures for marketing West Bengal among prospective investors within and outside the country, argues that new private investment began to taper off in the mid-1960s as the state placed increasing faith in government investment. The real value of productive capital in the state has been declining by 0.5 per cent a year since 1968-69. The major part of new investment has been claimed to rehabilitate old factory units. The consensus among businessmen is that West Bengal is still not a safe bet for investors. Mr Basu would admit that the infrastructure needs to be improved. Per capita availability of power in West Bengal is much less than the country's average and industries are subject to unscheduled power cuts. It is understandable that power-intensive industries feel no incentive to relocate in West Bengal. Instead, the Calcutta-based Mittals went to Maharashtra and Orissa, where power supply is assured, to put up three steel plants. Other facilities in West Bengal, such as urban infrastructure, telecommunication and transportation, also compare unfavourably with the more advanced states. Unless these drawbacks are removed quickly, the state does not stand much chance of getting fresh investment. Against this background Mr Basu has reason to fear that under the new economic dispensation, the regional imbalance will grow and new investment will tend to flow to the more developed areas. However, it is more than efficient infrastructure that investors will demand. This year, the state has seen two major strikes - a 72-day stoppage in the jute mill industry and a strike of twice that length at the Bata shoe factory. Such long stoppages and acts of trade union 'hooliganism' put the state in bad light. Mr Basu is now trying to solve the problem by treating trade union abuses as any other law and order problem. He has also instructed the labour department 'to intervene quickly when a strike takes place.' While the state will have to do a lot of promotional work and convincing before new investment starts flowing in, the industrialists will not be keen to take over the ailing units, either. According to Mr Gouri Goenka, chairman of the Duncans group, which will be commissioning a Rs1.4bn acrylic fibre unit at Haldia in September, 'it should not be difficult to run a modern plant in West Bengal, but I will not be interested in taking over a unit for the purpose of turning it around. There is no way one can rationalise labour here.' For West Bengal which abounds in 'sick' industrial units - as many as 124 have been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction  -it is important that the government facilitates their takeover and if there are no takers for them, then their closing down, according to the Bengal Chamber. But West Bengal is still not ready for the shift of labour from sick units to new undertakings and from mature sectors to the emerging ones. Left Front constituents still swear by the public sector, but Mr Basu, who is more a pragmatist than a Marxist, knows that he needs the private sector badly for the state's industrial revival. In spite of the reservations of his party colleagues, he allowed Mr Rama Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, to take over Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, which will now be implementing two power projects of a total capacity of 1,250MW at Budge Budge and Balagarh. The state government, which is facing serious resource constraints, has also decided to ask the private sector to implement the 900MW Sagardighi project. The state must have an additional 210MW capacity a year to cope with the rising demand for power. The resource constraint is also forcing the government to invite the private sector to manage some of its undertakings. For example, the C. K. Birla group is to modernise the coke oven plant of Durgapur Projects and the Gauripur power station, both state units. The Birlas will be using the coke and power at their proposed steel plant in the state. It is only now that the state is giving attention to industry, so preoccupied has it been with the restructuring of the rural economy all these years. Is the Rs32bn Haldia Petrochemicals project, the most ambitious for the state, finally about to take off? According to Mr Tarun Dutt, chairman, 'since foreign exchange is no longer a problem, we hope to be able to complete the project in four years.' The Ambanis, of the Reliance group, had assured the chief minister that they would set up a polyester filament yarn unit at an investment of Rs4bn. However, not many other such projects are in the pipeline. Whether or not investors from outside will come to West Bengal will depend on Mr Basu's ability to make his ministers and bureaucrats responsive to the needs of industry.</p>

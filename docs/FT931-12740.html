			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK base rates cut to 15-year low: One-point reduction lifts shares but leaves sterling sharply lower UK INTEREST rates were cut by a full percentage point to their lowest level for more than 15 years yesterday in an unexpected move to help economic recovery. The cut to 6 per cent, which took senior ministers and the markets by surprise, was swiftly followed by announcements from banks and building societies that they would cut mortgage rates by just over  1/2 a percentage point. Share prices moved sharply higher, but the pound weakened significantly after the announcement. The move was generally welcomed by industry, which expressed the hope that it would bring down borrowing costs for thousands of struggling businesses. But the base rate cut drew a less than euphoric response from Conservative MPs at Westminster. Hopes that it would give a boost to the outlook for recovery were tempered by fears that it reflected an element of panic in Downing Street or the prospect of more bad news on the economy. Cabinet ministers had expected Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to wait until nearer to the Budget on March 16 before lowering borrowing costs. They speculated that Mr John Major had been the active force in bringing the cut forward. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, found himself in the embarrassing position of being unware of the announcement when asked about it some hours afterwards in a television interview. Mr Lamont said Britain now had the lowest interest rates in Europe and that prospects were becoming 'better and better'. Speaking in New Delhi, the prime minister said the cut in interest rates was necessary to boost economic confidence and return Britain to 'a secure pattern of growth'. The London stock market saw the biggest daily rise since September 18, two days after the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, as investors reasoned that lower borrowing costs would at last bring recovery from the longest recession since the 1940s. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 63.8, to close at 2,835.7, within a whisker of the all-time high recorded on January 4 this year. Investor satisfaction at the move spilled over to the gilts market where prices gained up to 1 point. However, the foreign exchange markets took a dim view of the fourth one-point cut in interest rates since Britain left the ERM. After heavy selling of sterling for other currencies, the pound closed in London at DM2.424, down 2 3/4 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar it closed just over 2 cents lower at Dollars 1.538. In New York it closed at DM2.4264 and at Dollars 1.5445. The cut in commercial banks' base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent came shortly after the Bank of England reduced the rate at which it lends to the banking system by the unusual device of announcing a minimum lending rate just before 10am. The Bank's move, which came ahead of today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of medium-dated gilt-edged stock, infuriated many gilt marketmakers. Because of the subsequent rise in gilt prices, they face losses estimated at Pounds 25m in their auction operations. The decision to take short-term UK interest rates more than 3 points below Germany's internationally important Lombard rate came after a string of bleak economic indicators, including a sharp rise in unemployment, a fall in manufacturing output and sluggish broad money growth. In a Treasury statement, Mr Lamont said the cut in rates was 'appropriate' given Britain's economic background. The government believed the move was 'consistent with the necessary restraining influence on inflation'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the cut but said it did not add up to an economic strategy to deal with rising unemployment and falling investment. 'The government will have to do far more in employment and industry measures to ensure sustainable recovery and the reversal of national economic decline,' he said. The Liberal Democrats welcomed the cut but said it was 'foolish' to imagine it would end the recession. Tory backbench MPs meanwhile again warned Mr Lamont against tax increases in the Budget. They said that lower interest rates should not be the precursor to higher taxes.

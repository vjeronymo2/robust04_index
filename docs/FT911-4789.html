			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (2): Confirmation of Swiss superiority - Zurich bankers have been reassured by the Gulf crisis THE GULF crisis has brought Swiss bankers a reassuring confirmation of Switzerland's superiority in attracting offshore capital. A year ago the bankers were worried about a slowdown in the growth of monies seeking management in Switzerland. Among the many reasons cited were the depreciation of the Swiss franc, the impression among foreign clients that Swiss bank secrecy was being eroded and, perhaps most important, tougher competition from other financial centres which had relaxed capital controls. Offshore Switzerland was losing its comparative advantages, it was said. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August funds flooded into Swiss banks from the Middle East. Arab bankers estimate that in a couple of weeks between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn bolted from the Gulf to safer havens, the bulk finding its way into Switzerland. Most went into short-term, money market placements in dollars, not into the managed portfolios of diversified assets which are the classic instruments of Swiss private bankers. But, at a time when Swiss banking is really in a period of transition and is having to change old habits, the knowledge that Switzerland was still the haven to which the wealthy turned in a crisis has been an important psychological stimulant. It was all the more important because Swiss bankers have been stressed over the past two years. Not only have they experienced sharper competition from other financial centres, they have also been obliged to adjust to new legislation against money laundering and have had to face the dismantling of long-standing cartel arrangements, which had previously underpinned their profits. In addition, an element of uncertainty has been injected by the movement towards a single market for financial services within the European Community. EC action postulates the possibility that the Swiss will need to bring their practices, particularly in tax matters, into conformity but, until the 12 EC member-states agree among themselves, the Swiss can only speculate about the direction in which they may be pushed. Nevertheless, in spite of the doubts that had been raised, Swiss primacy in managing the assets of the rich has yet to be seriously challenged. If an offshore centre is defined as a market for non-domestic money, then Switzerland continues to dominate the offshore business. By virtue of the confidentiality of the business no reliable statistics exist. Among more recent estimates one from a real insider, Pictet &amp; Cie, the biggest Swiss private bank, put the total of clients' assets under management in Swiss banks at roughly SFr1,800bn (Dollars 1,250bn). A Citibank study suggested that the Swiss controlled about half the international market for non-domestic money management; more modestly, Mr Jean Bonna, partner in Lombard, Odier, the second largest Swiss private bank, had earlier estimated the Swiss share at 40 per cent. Swiss private banking tradition dates back more than two centuries but the mass of funds under management have accumulated over the past four decades. Switzerland's attraction has been a combination of bank secrecy, political and economic stability, a firm currency, strongly capitalised banks and conservative asset management. Some of these advantages have begun to appear less secure in recent years. Most of the assets under management still belong to rich individuals but the proportion owned by institutions, such as pension funds, has grown fast. Competition for the institutional business has become sharp; it has compelled the banks to invest heavily in computerised systems and has affected attitudes towards the private customers. There has been a burgeoning of bank-managed funds, many of them domiciled outside Switzerland to avoid Swiss withholding tax. Clients whose assets are not large enough to warrant the construction and management of a personal portfolio are advised to use the funds. The limit varies, some banks suggesting that they need at least SFr2m to construct a portfolio, while independent portfolio managers mention SFr1m or even less. But the private bankers insist that the personal relationship with their clients remains their crucial and studiously cultivated advantage. Pictet put the value of clients' assets under management in the private banks at SFr110bn at the end of 1989. By far the larger part of the estimated total, SFr1,800bn, managed in Switzerland is with the three big banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse. At the other end of the scale are several hundred independent investment counsellors or boutiques, advising clients on the placement of monies on deposit with the banks; the counsellors receive a management fee and the banks earn commissions on the transactions. A little insight into the volume of business done by these independent counsellors was given recently when the private bankers started to lift a corner of the secrecy surrounding their operations. Lombard, Odier, for instance, reported that some 6 per cent of the SFr30bn-SFr35bn in assets it controlled were managed by independent professionals. Moreover, Lombard, Odier revealed that a surprising 45 per cent of the assets belonged to institutional investors and that it runs 43 funds designed to cover the widely varying needs of its private clients. Two recent developments have, or are about to, influence the Swiss banks' relationship with their foreign clients. One is the abandoning under pressure from the Cartel Commission and the government of the convention fixing brokerage fees. The other is the announcement expected soon from the Federal Banking Commission banning the so-called formula B. Formula B is the document which authorises Swiss lawyers or fiduciary agents to place clients' monies with Swiss banks without divulging the identities of their clients. The Banking Commission considers this method of preserving the anonymity of customers is incompatible with the new law against money laundering which requires the banks to know the beneficial owner of monies placed with them. The dismantling of the convention setting brokerage commissions has already led some Swiss banks to start emphasising management fees rather than continuing to rely, as in the past, on their brokerage income. Banks' reactions have varied, there has so far been no sign of severe price-cutting by banks seeking to win market shares and it is still not clear to what extent investors can benefit from shopping around to find the bank offering the lowest charges. An important signpost remains hidden over the hump of the EC's internal deliberations about its single market. It indicates the direction the Community will finally take in exchanging information about taxation between member states. If Brussels plumps for a thorough-going system of tax controls, some bankers foresee a flood of money from EC countries moving into Switzerland, which could, in turn, prompt strong pressure from the Community for the Swiss to abandon their long-standing refusal to co-operate in tracking tax evaders.</p>

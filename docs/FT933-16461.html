			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: A decision for the individual Sir, As an employee and union member I was obliged to pay the political levy to the Labour Party until the opt-out clause came into being. Now, as a shareholder, I am forced to support the Tories through donations from shareholder funds. It should be left to individuals to decide to whom and by how much they wish to support any political party. Ralph Stewart, 55E Mill Street, Ayr KA7 1TH</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Dos Santos: "Cuban Parliament: An Unusual </F> Session on Labor Day"]    [Text] Havana -- The Cuban parliament will hold a special  session, which will be historic in more than one sense, to  carefully examine Cuba's domestic finances. The session will be  unique not only because of the decisions that will derive from  analyses made by the country's labor sector but also because the  legislative session will take place, for the first time ever, on  a Sunday, which also happens to be Labor Day.    Cuba's most prominent labor leader, Pedro Ross, told me that  the best homage the National Assembly could pay the Cuban  workers is to further discuss the country's toughest problems  and adopt measures aimed at resolving them.    This will be the first time in the past three decades that  there will be no rally followed by a march to Plaza de la  Revolucion on 1 May. The day will be commemorated on 30 April  with events and marches in provincial and municipal capitals  throughout the country.    The labor leader said there will be massive celebrations in  five municipalities in the city of Havana, something that will  permit a better and more rational utilization of the material  resources this kind of event requires.    It has been estimated that, for the usual mobilizations, it  will be necessary to defray the cost, in the capital alone, of  approximately 50 tons of fuel to transport hundreds of thousands  of sympathizers who gather at the central Plaza Municipality, an  expenditure that is ill-advised in the current economic  situation.    Another factor that apparently was considered in changing  the  traditional celebration is that it is necessary not to lessen  the attention being given to the harvest of products that are  essential to the national economy and the people, such as sugar,  tobacco, potatoes, etc.    President Fidel Castro himself has talked to the National  Committee of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers  Federation [CTC] about the difficult material status the  sugarcane harvest is experiencing and the importance of planting  efforts capable of permitting higher productivity in the years  ahead.    The Cuban leader asked the labor movement not "to lower its  guard in any of the agricultural and industrial activities in  which we are engaged." Ross reiterated this a few days later in  noting that April and May are decisive months for securing  targeted production results.    Commenting to journalists about current efforts and results,  the labor leader said sugar production involves more than  600,000 workers, many of whom have to work with torn shoes and  shirts. He noted, though, that this year, like last year, the  labor force has not deserted.    He said: There is a high spirit of sacrifice, a desire to  overcome adversity and limitations. It is significant that early  in April there are already 15 brigades of sugarcane cutters that  can cut more than 1 million arrobas.    While steps are being taken at all levels to raise economic  efficiency -- the key for pulling out the evil from the root --  it has become evident that measures of a restrictive nature,  which will affect everyone to various degrees, must be adopted,  although an effort will be made to protect the lower-income  groups as much as possible.    The importance of massive participation in the discussion of  and search for solutions has been established. This was done  through a process called the Workers Parliament, which has  prevailed as a mechanism for evaluating very special situations.  Discussions of a vast network of ideas and opinions on how to  resolve problems and debates on opposite points of view have  produced optimistic results. In the midst of the complicated  situation the country is enduring, the economically active  population, which decides the future with its work, has again  demonstrated its position in favor of a more just society.    The general measures that will be adopted to face this  situation will enhance the awareness of efficient producers, an  awareness which is already practical and is evidently winning  ground in the framework of a colossal and unique effort to keep  the Cuban Revolution alive and faithful to its social project,  while making adjustments to the real situation without  abandoning its ideal of transforming the situation.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Court threat on single market EC GOVERNMENTS which fail to implement and enforce single-market legislation risk being taken to the European Court of Justice, the European Commission warned yesterday. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC commissioner responsible for the internal market, told ministers in Brussels he would come down hard on member states which hold up the free movement of goods, services and capital. Legal proceedings have already begun in 320 cases against member states which have not transposed EC legislation into national law. Latest statistics show that Ireland, Germany and Greece have implemented less than 80 per cent of the agreed single market directives, whereas the UK and Denmark have implemented more than 90 per cent. In most areas of EC law-making, barriers to free movement were supposed to come down on January 1 this year, although certain directives do not come into force until later. The Commission is particularly worried that member states are lagging behind with the implementation of directives aimed at opening the lucrative market for public purchasing, said to be worth some 15 per cent of EC gross domestic product. Brussels also says directives which would guarantee recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications across the EC have not been transposed. The first directive in this area was supposed to come into force in January 1991, but only Ireland, Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg have passed the necessary legislation. The Commission is anxious to maintain the momentum of the extensive single-market programme, its clearest achievement of the past five years. It is preparing a 'strategic programme' to improve the effectiveness of the market. Speaking after yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers in Brussels, Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said there was widespread concern about the effect on the single market of recent turmoil on the European currency markets. Ministers finally agreed yesterday on the vexed issue of which food additives should be allowed in the EC. The decision will allow Germany to maintain the purity of its traditional beers, subject to certain conditions, and Britain to continue adding colouring to such delicacies as mushy peas, Red Leicester cheese and sausages.</p>

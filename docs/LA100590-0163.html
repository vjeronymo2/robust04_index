			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS $500,000 FOR COURT FIGHT OVER CITY PARKING GARAGE  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday authorized spending up to $500,000 on  legal fees in its lawsuit against the builder of a city parking garage that was  completed more than a year later than scheduled.  </P> <P> The suit, which seeks more than $1.43 million, accuses Taylor Woodrow  Construction Corp. of New York of fraud and breach of contract in construction  of the $7.1-million multilevel garage at 115 N. Maryland Ave.  </P> <P> The parking garage was completed last November.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow last month filed a countersuit seeking about $4.9 million from  the city, which the contractor blames for delays in the project.  </P> <P> The city in June hired Los Angeles attorney Irwin E. Sandler, a veteran in  construction litigation, to represent it. Sandler said Tuesday that the amount  of damages sought by the city may be increased significantly.  </P> <P> Council members voted 4 to 1 to allocate the legal funds. Councilman Larry  Zarian dissented, saying the sum was too large and the lawsuit too risky.  </P></p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: VSEL improves 11% to Pounds 29m - Increased confidence about the outcome of the Trident programme VSEL, the Cumbrian-based builder of Trident submarines, reported a steady increase in profitability but said it would be several months before it knew whether the current review of UK defence expenditure would require changes to the group's strategic plan. For the six months to September 30 the company's pre-tax profits increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 28.8m, although sales were flat at Pounds 233m (Pounds 234m). Lord Chalfont, chairman, said he expected results in the second half to be at least at the level achieved in the first half and he remained encouraged by the prospects for 1994-95. He said the successful completion of HMS Vanguard, the first Trident submarine which was accepted into service with the Royal Navy in September, had increased confidence in the outcome of the Trident programme as a whole. 'The second boat in the class, HMS Victorious, was launched on September 29. These achievements are reflected in the results for the half year. Work on the two remaining Trident submarines is progressing satisfactorily and in line with programme.' The last Upholder Class submarine to be built at Cammell Laird was handed over to the Navy in July and Birkenhead Yard was closed as planned, ending a long history of shipbuilding on the Mersey. Discussions with a prospective purchaser of the shipbuilding areas of the yard were continuing. Satisfactory progress was being made at Barrow and at Kvaerner Govan on the Clyde on the contract for a helicopter carrier, which VSEL won with a bid of Pounds 139.5m in a competition with Swan Hunter, the Tyneside yard which then called in the receiver. VSEL said it had made appropriate provisions to cover possible design and management risks on this type of contract. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive, said VSEL had offered to take over the management of building three Type 23 Navy frigates at Swan Hunter, although it would be necessary to reach manning agreements with the trade unions. A tender had been submitted, in collaboration with Hunting Engineering, for work on the Common New Generation Frigate project - a joint British, French and Italian programme to develop a new European warship. Further tender submissions are expected to be made, including a bid to be prime contractor of the Batch 2 Trafalgar submarines and for replacement assault ships. Earnings rose to 49.3p (44p) and the interim dividend is being lifted from 9p to 10.5p. COMMENT VSEL's shares have had a good run this year, helped by the group's knocking of its competitor Swan Hunter out of the ring. The group never concealed that its bid for the helicopter carrier was a loss-leader to get it back into building surface ships. Mr Davies believes most of VSEL's products will survive the defence review, although the scale and timing of orders may be affected. Meantime, the group has accumulated Pounds 270m of cash and seems philosophical about the possibility that it may be taken over in the ongoing shrinking of the UK defence industry. The shares trade on a undemanding prospective multiple of about 8. They are underpinned at that level by a premium yield and the strong cash position, but are unlikely to move ahead until the Chancellor makes clear his intentions towards the defence budget.</p>

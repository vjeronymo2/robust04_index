			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse recovery accelerates on IG Metall deal The weekend settlement of the German metalworkers' wage dispute lifted bond and equity markets around Europe in the morning, and healthy gains on Wall Street brought further strength to the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT got an IG Metall wage deal that it would have been happy with some weeks ago. The June bund future reacted, rising by a full percentage point to 97.42 by the evening; equities responded with the Dax index 48.82, or 2.4 per cent higher on the session at 2,108.91, and closing the post bourse at an Ibis-indicated 2,132.12. Turnover rose from DM6.8bn to DM9.4bn. There was speculation about interest rate prospects; Allianz produced a 4 per cent gain during hours and a further DM22 rise to DM2,595 in the afternoon. Carmakers were more striking, their gains led by Volkswagen which rose DM16.50 to DM454.50 on hopes of a modest 1993 dividend, and another DM8 to DM462.50 afterwards. There was interest in chemicals in their results week: Hoechst, tipped by Goldman Sachs ahead of today's figures, put on DM6.60 to DM308.60, and another DM6.40 to DM315 in the post bourse. PARIS, too, majored on a surging bond market and gains in mid-morning trading in New York. The CAC 40 Index ended 41.2, or 1.9 per cent higher at 2,219.89, in turnover of FFr4bn. Among the winners, Club Med rose FFr21.20 to FFr407.20 on news that it would be selling some of its holiday villages to raise cash, rather than making another rights issue; and Eurotunnel's rights issue terms left it FFr2.70 higher at FFr52.10 on the feeling that one uncertainty was now out of the way. The losers included Peugeot, down FFr12 to FFr881 before announcing a convertible issue after the close; Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International reckoned that the shares would rise on relief today. Remy fell FFr13.30 to FFr234 on Hong Kong's tax increases on spirits and champagne. Here, Mr Fordyce conceded that Remy was very strong in the colony, much more so that LVMH, and at the top of the range where the tax imposts would hurt most; but it was not so strong, he said, as to deserve a near 4 per cent drop in share price. MILAN's foreign investors returned and the Comit index rose 8.44, or 1.3 per cent to 660.99. Stet rose L236 or 5 per cent to L4,675 after Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, said that a plan for its privatisation, timetabled from late 1994, should be ready soon. Sip put on L183 or 4.6 per cent to L4,194. Fiat added L128 or 2.7 per cent to L4,899. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano said that while sales were down in Italy, the group's ability to recover strongly over the medium term was strengthened by its recent impressive performance elsewhere in Europe, where it was helped by the combination of the new, successful Punto model and the undervalued lira. Benetton advanced L279 to L25,829 after a high of L26.600: the chairman revealed that the group hoped to pick up around 1 per cent of BCI in the institutional offering of shares. Ciga, the hotel group, added L130 or 15.9 per cent to L950: the shares were readmitted to the exchange last week after a deal was struck for its sale by creditor banks to ITT Sheraton. ZURICH rose 1.9 per cent although trading volume dipped, indicating continuing nerves among investors after the market's recent volatility. The SMI index added 53.5 to 2,918.7. CS Holding rose SFr13 to SFr660 ahead of preliminary figures today and UBS put on SFr19 to SFr1,294. Among firm cyclicals, Holderbank, planning a joint venture to build a plant in Vietnam, put on SFr45 to SFr975 and Sulzer, finding favour with analysts, added SFr35 to SFr955. Brown Boveri, due to report tomorrow, added SFr36 to SFr1,110. AMSTERDAM was in optimistic spirits with many dealers forecasting a move soon into record territory. Most shares closed near their day's high and the AEX index rose 10.51, or 2.5 per cent to 424.76. The Dutch bourse was riding the generally positive mood sweeping European markets, with dealers buoyed by firmer bond markets and hopes of a cut in German interest rates. Financials were a strong feature with an average rise in the sector of 3 per cent. Philips, the electronics company, stirred up investor interest after presentations in the UK following well-received results. It edged up Fl 1 at Fl 52.60 with a strong volume of 3.14m shares traded. Hunter Douglas, the blindmaker and aluminium trader, set a new 12-month high at Fl 93.50 before easing back to close at Fl 90.80, a rise of Fl 1.80 on the day. Grolsch bounced on news of a distribution deal in Germany and put on Fl 1.50 to end at Fl 50.50. KLM traded actively and added Fl 2.60 to reach Fl 50.50. MADRID rose 1.8 per cent as strong bonds and the performance of other European markets encouraged buyers. The general index added 5.94 to 341.10. Telefonica, the most active stock, rose Pta25 to Pta1,975 while Banco Central Hispano put on Pta105 at Pta3,015. Construction stocks continued to forge ahead on government approval of an infrastructure plan: Asland added Pta115 or 4.4 per cent to Pta2,735.

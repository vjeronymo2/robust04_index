			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: RJB reassures investors over pension fund shortfall RJB MINING, the coal-mining group formed in a management buy-out from AF Budge and which is due to be floated next month, yesterday reassured employees and investors over a Pounds 1.1m shortfall in funds owed to its pension fund. The company's flotation document last week revealed that only Pounds 2m had been paid to its pension fund out of Pounds 3.1m which had been agreed for transfer in December from the pension fund of AF Budge, the construction group which collapsed last year. The company said its directors were confident that the pension scheme would receive all outstanding payments and that the delay would not affect its flotation, due on June 7. It said they were confident that assets controlled by the Budge pension fund, including an office block currently under offer in Leeds, would more than cover the shortfall and interest in compensation for the delay. It said it had received more than 15,000 applications for shares. The flotation will raise up to Pounds 50m and the company will be capitalised at Pounds 103m.</p>

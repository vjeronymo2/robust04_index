Answering a question posed by AL-DUSTUR on the official  two-day visit to Jordan today by His Highness Shaykh Hamad  bin-Jasim Al Thani, foreign minister of sisterly Qatar, al-Hasan  said we view bilateral relations with respect and sincere desire  to develop them. [passage omitted]    Al-Hasan said the State of Qatar has informed the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] states of the progress of  Jordanian-Qatari relations, which have begun to positively and  substantially improve, and that the GCC states highly valued  this development.    The minister said the two countries agree that moves should  be made to foster Arab cohesion, and that this can develop  through bilateral or trilateral cooperation and through joint  cooperation. He said this cooperation could be elevated to reach  a comprehensive and full reconciliation. [passage omitted]</p>

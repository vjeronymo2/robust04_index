			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Surge in ADM earnings Archer Daniels Midland, the agribusiness concern based in Decatur, Illinois, said its first-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 154.5m, or 45 cents a share, up from last year's Dollars 69m, or 20 cents, when floods in the Midwest impaired operations. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates. With its commodity-based businesses, ADM does not report sales with its quarterly earnings. However, analysts said that the company's two most important business segments - corn processing and soyabean crushing - were profiting from low raw materials prices and growing international demand for vegetable oils and high fructose corn syrup. Ms Bonnie Wittenburg, an agribusiness analyst for Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis, raised her full-year earnings projection for ADM to Dollars 2.00 a share from Dollars 1.90 on the basis of the first-quarter report, and expects the company to earn Dollars 2.40 a share next year.</p>

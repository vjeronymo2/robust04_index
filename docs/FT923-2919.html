			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (4): Old habits dying fast - Rural villages now grow their own products THIRTY years ago, when the government was encouraging the increase in rice crops, the farmers of Oyama - a small town in northern Oita prefecture - sacrificed their rice paddies for chestnut and plum fields. As a result, and under the strong leadership of the village mayor, Oyama transformed itself from a poor rural village to one of the richest farming communities in the country. Oyama's plum and chestnut campaign was initially received with scepticism, even among the farmers in the town. 'People thought we were crazy, telling people to stop growing rice,' says Mr Kinji Yahata, present mayor of Oyama. But after Mr Yahata's father, then village mayor, explaining to the farmers that Oyama - surrounded by mountains with little flat land - was not a place for raising cattle or for rice farming, those who initially opposed gave in and Oyama started cultivating fruit, which grows easily in mountainous areas and would suit Oyama's climate. The Japanese government's 'double income campaign', encouraging people to work harder to increase their income, also predicted a change in the eating habits of the Japanese. 'If people earn more money, it doesn't mean that they'll eat more rice. Instead they'll try to eat an assortment of foods in small portions,' says Mr Yahata. Thus, a small impoverished village grew into a town producing 130 different fruits and smaller scale produce, such as mushrooms, cress and herbs. Mr Yahata also points out that the government is not aware of the speed at which the eating habits of the Japanese are changing. He says small-lot production of high-quality goods represents Oyama's means of survival, especially when overseas pressure to increase imports of agricultural goods is rising. Oyama's strategy also changed the image of farming and curbed the outflow of the younger generation into cities. Mr Seijiro Yano, a 53-year-old farmer from Oyama who owns plum fields and grows mushrooms, was 23 when the village began its restructuring. 'I wanted to go to university and I was keen on leaving Oyama when I had the chance, but the new campaign to change Oyama gave me an incentive to stay,' he says. Mr Yano says going against the trend of mass production was what led to Oyama's success. 'Just following the government's agricultural policy is not good enough.' Oyama's enthusiasm spread throughout Oita with the 'one village one product' campaign, launched by Mr Morihiko Hiramatsu, the governor of Oita, in 1979. Oyama's effort to establish an identity among its populace and inspire local pride through the production of special products coincided with Mr Hiramatsu's aim to rescue Oita's ailing economy and faltering self-image. Mr Hiramatsu urged local communities to develop at least one original product which they could call their own. 'Only something truly local can be global and I didn't want copies of what people could buy in Tokyo,' he says. His efforts resulted in the Oita shiitake mushroom, which holds 20 per cent of the country's market, and Himeshima prawns, which, at Y6,000 per batch, raise an annual Y1.9bn for the prawn farmers of Himeshima island. Oita mandarin oranges sell at Y300 to Y500 per 100g. This compares favourably to car production, since a 1.5-tonne car, selling at Y3m will mean sales of only Y200 per 100 grams. No subsidies are provided for the production of the local specialities. However, the prefectural government provides aid for research and development of the products, as Mr Hiramatsu believes that truly beneficial products can not emerge through government subsidies. While the success of the 'one village, one product' has prompted other regions in Japan and overseas to follow Oita's example, Mr Hiramatsu admits that the hardest challenge Oita faces is the departure of the younger generation to larger cities. 'It's a problem that any small region in any country in the world faces,' says Mr Hiramatsu. 'For that, Oita needs to be a base for information and culture.' Even Oyama is finding it harder to prevent de-population. Mr Yano of Oyama says that while the town has managed to build a reputation for its high quality agricultural goods, life is still hard and the short sightedness of the government's agricultural policy is discouraging Japan's farmers. Although Mr Yano's son has returned to the farm after graduating from university in Tokyo, 'it's really hard to tell him to work with high hopes for the future', says Mr Yano.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              KEY STATISTICS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Kyushu as                                                               percent of                                    Japan         Kyushu   Japanese total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POPULATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990                            123,612,000    14,518,000       11.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Projected to 2005               134,247.000    15,451,000       11.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT ('000s)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture, fishing &amp; forestry  4,383  (7.9)    815 (13.5)     18.6 Manufacturing, industry         20,516 (37.9)  1,126 (18.6)      5.5 Finance, retail                 30,469 (55.0)  4,107 (67.9)     13.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP (billion yen)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1980/81                            247,511        22,919         9.3 1985/86                            327,445        28,705         8.8 1989/90                            419,422        35,530         8.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT PERCENT RATES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1975       1980        1989          1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan                      2.3        2.3         3.4           3.0 Kyushu                     3.2        3.3         4.2           3.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures in brackets are percent of total Source: Japan local government centre, London  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

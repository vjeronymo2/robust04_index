			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (11): Signs of a turnaround at last / A look at Unisys, a leading but troubled computer supplier UNISYS, once second only to International Business Machines among the world's computer giants, seems to have returned from the dead after three of the worst years in its short history. It lost Dollars 554m in 1989, Dollars 337m in 1990 and a staggering Dollars 1.2bn in 1991 on revenues 14 per cent down at Dollars 8.7bn. In the fourth quarter of 1991, however, it returned a net profit of Dollars 80m and expects again to be profitable in the first quarter of the current year. While its top executives argue the worst is now behind it, Unisys remains among the walking wounded with a burden of debt which is now close to Dollars 3bn and an unacceptably high cost-structure. Its future prospects are tied too closely to the uncertainties of the global economy for the liking of Mr James Unruh, chief executive officer since 1990. 'We need,' he says, 'the economy to improve. We need healthier customers'. Unruh is an accountant by training but he has spent his working life in electronics and computer businesses. He has had a rough ride since taking over from Mr Michael Blumenthal, a former Treasury Secretary, whose vision was the stimulus for the formation of Unisys. 'I am beginning to think this is normal,' Mr Unruh says wryly of the profound measures he has had to take to restructure the company and stem the flood of cash leaking from its balance sheet. Unisys was formed in 1986 from Sperry and Burroughs, two struggling, medium-sized computer manufacturers. The idea was to create a group of a size to challenge the dominance of IBM. There were worries at the time, in retrospect richly justified, that the new company would have difficulties in maintaining two separate mainframe product lines and merging two corporate cultures. It might just have been possible to brush these difficulties under the carpet if the industry had maintained its traditional growth rate of more than 20 per cent a year. Instead, industry growth slowed sharply with the onset of global recession and Unisys was hit by a number of adverse factors simultaneously. Its principal competitors, notably IBM and Digital Equipment, were affected by the same problems, but they did not have the disadvantage of a company merger to contend with at the same time. The principal factors were: improvements in technology which cut the cost of computing hardware, the growth of open systems which damaged sales of proprietary hardware and, as Mr Unruh told security analysts last month, a resistance among customer to further investment in computing - 'growth has slowed because customers are not able to absorb new technology at today's rate of technological change.' Quoting the Harvard Business Review, Mr Unruh argued: 'Computers have become too powerful for the uses to which they are being put.' The measures Mr Unruh and his senior management team put in place include: A commitment to move from proprietary computer designs to open systems. It has, for example, signed an agreement with Intel, the US semiconductor company whose microprocessors are at the heart of most of the world's personal computers. It has also concluded an agreement with Motorola for mainframe computer chips. The company will, of course, continue to supply its customers with the mainframe computers which provide the bulk of its revenues and profits. It is working hard to increase incompatibility between the Burroughs line and the Sperry line and so increase economies of scale and reduce research and development commitments. Mr Unruh believes that the hardware is already about 70 per cent commonality between the two lines. A new emphasis on solving customers' problems through a change from geographically focused marketing to a line of business approach. The company has decided to focus on four strategic markets - financial services, airlines and travel, communications and the government sector. 'These areas already account for more than 70 per cent of our commercial computer business,' Mr Unruh says. 'We have the skills, knowledge, relationships and, in many areas, the solutions.' Unisys computers are used by 140 airlines, the company is number two in wholesale and retail banking and its systems handle half the world's cheques. A large reduction in staff numbers and substantial operational streamlining, costing about Dollars 1.2bn in restructuring charges. Some seven manufacturing plans have been closed in the past 18 months and 20,000 items removed from the product catalogue. Since the middle of last year, headcount has been reduced by 8,600 while expenses in the fourth quarter were 21 per cent lower than the same period the year before. The establishment of 'turnaround teams' to manage the company's assets. The idea was to generate additional cash flow from the balance sheet by selling off assets that were no longer central to the company's operations and managing working capital better. Fourteen turnaround teams were created, involving more than 200 Unisys staff working with an outside specialists. Each team was concerned with a specific area of the company's activities. The result was the delivery of about Dollars 1bn in 1991. Now the company intends to use the same technique to re-seekout cash opportunities in areas ranging from gross profit margin improvement to trimming administrative support - taking unnecessary work out of the company, as Mr George Robson, the company's chief financial officer, puts it. Not all the measures have been successful. Mr Unruh failed in November last year to sell Paramax, a subsidiary specialising in defence electronics. The gain hoped for was Dollars 700m; in the event, the sale was cancelled. 'The marketplace,' Mr Unruh said, 'simply did not put a reasonable value on the business.' He says that outstanding progress was made in 1991. There has been a nearly 40 per cent improvement in net debt. From a peak of Dollars 4bn in 1989, it is now down to about Dollars 2.5bn. Inventories have been reduced to the lowest level since the company was formed and inventory turns are now 4.6 times a year compared with 2.6 times three years ago. The cash position at the end of 1991 was more than Dollars 800m. The measures Unisys' senior management have instituted have clearly improved the company's position greatly, yet its health remains delicate in an unfavourable environment. Debt could be reduced to manageable levels in two to three years if economic conditions do not worsen. However, Mr Unruh says that he sees no sign of the upturn that could accelerate the company's recovery.</p>

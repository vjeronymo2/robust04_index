Our  option is resistance, and we will maintain it and not retreat  one step. He maintained that the method of threats,  exaggerations, destruction of homes, and shelling of peaceful  areas will be useless. Hundreds of operations have taken place.  Hizballah has not been destroyed and the resistance has not  ended. Nasrallah spoke this evening at a ceremony marking the  second anniversary of the martyrdom of former Hizballah  Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi in al-Nabi Shit. After  praising recent operations against Israel, Nasrallah affirmed  that negotiations have achieved no success by the end of 1993.  Referring to the domestic situation, he criticized the  government's policy until now. [passage omitted]</p>

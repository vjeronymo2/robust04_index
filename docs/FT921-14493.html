			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: The cost of saving the spotted owl THE US Fish and Wildlife Service is attempting to strike a balance between environmentalists' demands and the interests of the US timber industry, by reducing the acreage of Pacific Northwest coastal forests that must be protected as the 'critical habitat' of the Northern Spotted Owl. The rare bird, which was designated as a 'threatened species' last year, has become the focus of a highly charged clash between environmentalists, who claim that logging will destroy the owl's habitat of 'old growth' forests, and the timber industry, which fears the loss of thousands of jobs and predicts an escalation of lumber prices. The dispute has also become a symbol of a much broader debate over the economic impact of US state and federal regulations designed to protect the environment by restricting industrial activity. In its latest attempt to resolve the spotted owl dispute, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the US Interior Department, has designated 6.9m acres of federal forest lands as critical habitat for the owl. That is 4.7m acres less than the agency proposed last year. The protected forests would encompass federal lands in the states of Washington, Oregon and California in which logging would be curtailed or severely restricted. By reducing the size of the protected habitat, the federal agency claims that it will save about 1,000 jobs and return 65m board feet to the base of lumber that can be harvested in the region each year. 'We recognise the profound impact of potential job losses and have sought to strike a balance between the interests of people and wildlife,' said Mr John Turner, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency admitted that efforts to save the owl were likely to eliminate about 33,000 jobs but said that many of these jobs might be lost anyway, because of the recession, the slow construction market and a reduction in log exports. The Western Council of Industrial Workers, a labour union representing timber industry workers, said, however, that the government agency was 'grossly under-estimating' the impact of protecting the owl's habitat. The union claims that more than 100,000 jobs will be lost if the plan is implemented. Environmentalists condemned the reduction in protected acreage, however. The decision would lead to a loss of half of the owl population and further destruction of irreplaceable ancient forests, said an official of for the Wilderness Society. Meanwhile, a US cabinet level committee is conducting hearings in Oregon to consider whether to allow logging to continue in that state, regardless of the effect on the owl. The committee is known as the 'God Squad', because it has the power to allow a species to become extinct if it determines the economic impact of protection is too great. Separately, in California, the state legislature is expected to approve bills that would set a limit on the rate at which old-growth lumber can be harvested and require replanting. The compromise proposals, backed by California governor Pete Wilson, are also supported by several lumber companies and environmental groups.</p>

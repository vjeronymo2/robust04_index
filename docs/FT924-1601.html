			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / People: Amber Day picks new chairman Amber Day has found a chairman to succeed the controversial Philip Green, who resigned in September - after a deluge of adverse press coverage - when the discount retailing group reported a sharp slump in profits. He is Stacey Ellis (above) who, until recently, was director of planning and development for Inchcape, the blue-chip business services group which in the past year has substantially changed its senior management. Ellis, 52, was a senior figure in the former regime at Inchcape under Sir George Turnbull, who was forced by ill-health to step down at the end of last year as chairman and chief executive. Charles Mackay took over as chief executive at Inchcape, which has since appointed Sir David Plastow as chairman. Amber Day says it is now seeking to appoint as soon as possible two non-executives and a chief executive, a role which Green shared. In the meantime, David Thompson, finance director, will continue to act as temporary chief executive. Ellis has bought 500,000 Amber Day shares, which yesterday gained 4p to 34p. The group's shares collapsed from a peak of 129p last year after a series of bear raids and newspaper stories about Green's business associates and commercial deals. According to Thompson, Ellis's appointment would enable the group to concentrate on developing the business. Ellis, for his part, says he is impressed both by the prospects for the group's Glasgow-based 'What Everyone Wants' chain, and the commitment and enthusiasm of the Amber Day team. ***** Nicholas Gray has been named finance director of ALLIANCE RESOURCES, the oil and gas company which was put into receivership by unquoted Manx Petroleum in October. Alliance is chaired by Manx's managing director, John O'Brien, who was briefly unseated as chairman following a surprise boardroom coup. He was reinstated in November. ***** Martin Saunderson has been appointed finance director and company secretary of THE HOPKINSONS GROUP. Alan Thompson has resigned and leaves the company. ***** John Bridgeman, md of British Alcan Enterprises, has moved to Montreal as director of planning of ALCAN ALUMINIUM. ***** Rod Alexander, director of purchasing and supply at the POST OFFICE, is promoted to md of Subscription Services. ***** Andrew Huntley is the new chairman of the UK partnership of RICHARD ELLIS. Robin Broadhurst has been elected chairman of JONES LANG WOOTTON INTERNATIONAL. ***** Liam O'Mahony, md of CRH Group companies in Republic of Ireland and the UK, has been appointed an executive director of the group. ***** Alex Williamson, md of Quilty, CUPID's nursery care division, has joined the main board. ***** Jim Gray has been promoted to head the CO-OPERATIVE RETAIL SERVICES food division. ***** Rod Alexander, director of purchasing and supply, has been appointed md of Subscription Services Ltd, a subsidiary of the POST OFFICE, on the retirement of Brian Sproat. ***** Simon Tebbett, formerly a consultant with Price Waterhouse, has been appointed customer service director at THAMES WATER.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and </F> Vladimir Rogachev]    [Text] Moscow April 8 -- Russian non-piloted spacecraft  programs will be cut due to scarce finances, deputy general  director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Milov told ITAR-TASS  here today.    Only three-four projects in each area will be supported from  amongst the current 22 communications satellite projects and ten  proposals on space distant earth probing systems. The Almaz  interesting and costly project is in question, as its financing  would mean termination of other earth probing programs. The  mars program can hardly be financed as well. At the same time,  the space agency does not give up promising research and  development.    As for non-state financing sources, Russian commercial  structures do not want to invest in works to bring benefits in a  few years. Several commercial projects of communications  satellites are all Russia now has.    The world space market is not eager to welcome Russia,  despite the fact it has a unique set of reliable  rocket-boosters, including proton, which are able to put a  satellite on any orbit even the most exotic, said Milov. The  space agency is open to international cooperation. It has three  contracts to launch foreign satellites with Russian  rocket-boosters, Russian satellites are equipped with foreign  machinery, exchange of satellite information is underway,  flights of foreign cosmonauts on board the Mir station are  profitable, same as the lease of satellite channels by foreign  clients.</p>

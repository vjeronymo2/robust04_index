			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: German railway sells bank stake DG-Bank is to buy a majority stake in Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank from Deutsche Bahn, the German railway, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Deutsche Bahn said it had reached a basic agreement on the transaction with DG-Bank but their supervisory boards and the Federal Cartels Office had yet to approve the deal. The railway declined to reveal the purchase price. It owns 65.1 per cent of Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank, and is selling 50.1 per cent to DG Bank and 5 per cent to Sparda, the German savings and loans group. Deutsche Bahn will retain a 10 per cent stake in Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank, the railway said. The Sparda group already owns 10 per cent of Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank. The remaining shares are widely distributed. 'The sale is part of the railway's policy of concentrating on its core business,' a Deutsche Bahn official said. Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank mainly operates foreign exchange booths at railway stations.</p>

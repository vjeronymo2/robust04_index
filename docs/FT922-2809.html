			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Big Lie - Inside Maxwell's Empire: 'Tell the Queen I'm busy' - The key to the fraud commited by Maxwell lies in the personality of the man. A tyrant, he believed he could do anything, and built around himself a medieval court to feed his enormous ego.  'He was a jackdaw with people; he wanted them for himself' A bully when alive, he left his wife and family a terrible legacy THE ROLLS-ROYCE swung out of London's Park Lane into Knightsbridge heading for the Royal Albert Hall, where the Queen was attending a recital of Handel's Messiah. As the car threaded its way through the evening traffic, Robert Maxwell told his French wife, Betty, he couldn't go with her as he had a business meeting. He suggested she get out and catch a taxi. 'What am I going to tell the Queen?' Betty pleaded. 'Tell her I'm a busy man,' came the reply. Maxwell left his wife near the Albert Hall and headed for Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank. He stayed until late that night, drinking vintage champagne with Lord Spens, the corporate financier who was later to become involved in the second Guinness trial. 'I was bored, I felt like having a drink with the boys,' Maxwell told Spens. Maxwell was a bully when alive; when he died, he left his wife and family a terrible legacy. He also robbed 30,000 past and present employees of their pensions. The portrait that emerges from his treatment of both his family and his employees is one of a man enslaved by egotism with delusions of omnipotence. He had some good qualities: many found him an inspiration. Some shared the sentiments of Betty Maxwell, who said the day after he died: 'Looking back on our close-on-50 years together, I can see a kaleidoscope of never-ending adventures, projects, achievements, tragedies, holidays, work and more work. With him life was often tough, but the rewards were great.' At heart, however, Maxwell was a tyrant, and it is that which holds the key to the fraud. He built around himself a medieval court which fed his enormous ego. This allowed him to believe he could do anything and created the culture - fantastic, absurd, domineering, lawless, chaotic and paranoid  -that made the fraud possible. Those who opposed his rules were banished; those who flattered, soothed or entertained him stayed. In the same way that he left others to pick up his dirty towels and clothes, Maxwell used the people who worked for him to run the wheels of his empire. The inner core of his court was his family. From his seven children, Maxwell drew two - Kevin and Ian - into the heart of his empire. They became its crown princes. Maxwell was fiercely proud of his family, but also fiercely critical. He believed their lives belonged to him. This pressure on them began early. George Ireland, a schoolfriend of Kevin, remembers that Maxwell insisted that his son write home from school each week listing his achievements. Kevin complained that 'no-one else in the school had to write in such detail'. At his daughter Ghislaine's 21st birthday party, he asked one of her girlfriends for a dance, then took her into a study to cross-examine her. 'He wanted to know who my father was, how much he was paid, how many servants he had,' says the friend, who found the encounter 'deeply intimidating'. He expected his family to be totally obedient, yet he could find their demands and anxieties intolerable. He could be appallingly rude to his wife when she fretted about being late for appointments. Once, when she was 17, Ghislaine scalded her arm while cooking. Maxwell screamed abuse at her. She fled to a friend's house for sympathy. Maxwell took his obsession with his empire wherever he went. John Pole, Maxwell's head of security from 1986, says: 'He would go home to celebrate Christmas and be bored by Boxing Day. The family would gather for what they thought was going to be a holiday only to find out that they were going to work, but in a different country. He treated them like employees. Gradually they needed to look to other things to maintain sanity and some family life of their own.' All but two of his seven children worked for part of his empire at some point - but, unable to stand the pressure, most built separate lives. Anne became a teacher in north London, and Philip is now a scientist. Twin daughters Christine and Isabel emigrated to the US, although Christine continued to work for a Maxwell company. Betty Maxwell was stoical under the pressures of life with her husband, insulated by her French upbringing and her chateau in south-west France. However, just before Christmas 1990, she confided in Pole how sad it was that her family was not only divided by the Atlantic, but no longer had the reunions she remembered from when the children were younger. Unlike the rest of the family, Kevin and Ian took central roles in their father's business empire. In 1991, Kevin became chief executive of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) and Ian took the same post at Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN). Their offices were in the cockpit of the empire on the ninth floor of Maxwell House, a concrete octagon spliced on to the hulk of the MGN building. The doors of three lifts opened on to a long, narrow hall. The royal blue carpet stretching its length was patterned with Maxwell's symbol, a capital 'M' stamped on a globe. Turning right, another set of double doors stretched nearly to the ceiling. A click signalled that their lock had been released. The heart of the octagon was in near-darkness. In the centre, a huge image of the Maxwell globe was mounted high on a screen, spotlit; underneath it, in the gloom, sat a receptionist behind a huge desk. Anxious people were disgorged by lift or navigated the connecting corridor with the Mirror and the finance department. Peter Jay - the former ambassador to the US and once described as the cleverest young man in Britain - who became Maxwell's 'chief of staff', the organiser of his office, says: 'It was like a medieval court - people milling around in the courtyard with their petitions, or waiting to grab the king's cloak as he rushed by.' Mike Molloy, former editor of the Daily Mirror, says: 'Maxwell was theatre, he was looking for an image.' He loved dressing up. For tycoon Malcolm Forbes' birthday party, he ordered a sultan's silk pyjamas, turban and gold shoes with curled-up toes. He had a Polish captain's uniform made to mark the anniversary of Poland's entry into the Second World War, even though he was not entitled to wear it. His favourite pork pie hat gave way first to a peasant's cap from his Ethiopian mercy mission, and then a fedora. 'He finally settled on baseball caps, and the cloakroom in Maxwell House was full of them,' says Molloy. Maxwell rejected all constraints. To him, 'Have a nice day,' was a presumption; 'I'll have whatever kind of day I like,' he would reply. Jay says: 'He was not just disorderly, he actively abhorred order. The key to the man was that he had the lowest threshold of boredom. He would come in and say: 'What shall I do?' He'd get an idea and start ringing people. They would turn up and wait to be told what to do, by which time he would be on to something else . . . from grotesque schemes for transforming the world to fantastic rows about running newspapers.' This 'whirling chaos' which Maxwell created around him, in Jay's words, obscured the truth and, ultimately, made the fraud possible. In a satirical note to his successor as chief of staff, Jay warned: 'The job is essentially administration, a process of which the chairman is deeply suspicious and profoundly uncomprehending.' Jay says: 'Maxwell never read anything unless it arrived by fax.' The Maxwell House post became unmanageable. Several hundred letters a day, many with cheques enclosed, would pile up unopened. Maxwell hired a bizarre coterie of courtiers. Anyone who took his fancy could be found a role in some corner of the empire. Many stayed, at least for a while. But many others moved away, finding it intolerable. In the frantic last two years of his life, the inner circle dwindled to an ever smaller band. Many of those who had opposed him left. Kevin was the favoured son, chief executive of the larger of the two public companies, with a connecting door from his office to his father's. Below Maxwell's two sons was a sprawling retinue. 'Everyone had to report direct to Maxwell,' says Jay. 'He was a jackdaw with people; he wanted them for himself.' These people included those with a defined role, such as the directors of MCC and MGN. But there was also a small band of financial fixers whose roles were less clearly defined. This group, including Michael Stoney, Robert Bunn and Larry Trachtenberg, operated at the heart of Maxwell's private labyrinth of companies. Another group of long-standing employees had roles straddling the court and the family. Les Williams was Maxwell's driver. Although Maxwell would not admit to wanting a bodyguard, Williams performed that role too. He also helped bug the Maxwell House offices. Bob Cole worked for Maxwell for 31 years. For the last 12 years of Maxwell's life Cole was his press spokesman. But he was also a family confidant who dressed up as Father Christmas for parties at Kevin's children's school. Maxwell particularly liked to collect people with titles, badges or rank. Jay was one of his trophies. So were Lord Donoughue, one-time adviser to former prime minister James Callaghan; and Sir John Morgan, former British ambassador to Mexico. Cole says: 'He used to pick them up at cocktail parties, Labour party conferences. He made a real pest of himself pursuing Angus Ogilvy at a party several years ago.' Once these people had joined Maxwell's staff they had to suffer the same absurd decrees as other members. Pole says: 'It didn't matter whether you were a City banker, a member of his family or a peer of the realm, all got treated equally. Once you took the king's shilling and accepted the salary and the conditions, Maxwell believed he had bought you lock, stock and barrel.' Maxwell would call Jay in the middle of the night to ask the time. He sent one finance director on a 14-hour flight to Hong Kong - and summoned him back on the return flight to ask three trivial questions which the man had already answered in a note. One of his finance assistants had a direct line from Maxwell: 'Sometimes he'd ring just to ask: 'Why haven't you spoken to me recently?'' Like the Queen, Maxwell never carried money. He relied on acolytes scurrying behind him to produce change, in whatever currency was needed, as he stretched out his hands to take sandwiches, mementoes, bottles of beer. One director remembers: 'One day at a football match I had to give him change just so that he could throw handfuls into the crowd.' His sons were often treated as badly as the rest. He shouted at them in the same way he would shout at the chauffeur or gardener, and he repeatedly called Kevin back from holidays with his family. Molloy says: 'There were Thomas Mores in the court as well as fools. Some would not put up with his nonsense and were not pushed. Others were treated despicably. He instinctively, intuitively knew what people would take - he was very feminine in many ways.' As part of that calculation, like a feudal baron, Maxwell would bestow praise and rewards. 'Look at that, that is true service,' he would say, pressing Dollars 200 into Cole's hand. 'Get something for your wife.' But he was generous only in front of an audience, says Cole, and could be astonishingly mean. To compensate Cole for staying late on his wife's birthday, Maxwell said: 'Give the man a bottle of champagne' - but then overruled the receptionist's selection of Dom Perignon in favour of a cheaper bottle of Mumm. Formal job titles counted for nothing; what counted was whether someone was in or out of favour. It made the directors' jobs impossible, stripping them of information and authority. Pole adds: 'Maxwell would put you in a cupboard and open it only when he wanted you to do something for him. Often there would be three or four people doing the same job for him without knowing about the others.' This led to an atmosphere of intrigue, ingratiation and back-stabbing. Jay's memo lists as one of the 10 problems of the job 'the members of the Creeps' Club (ancient toadies and flatterers, whose combined intelligence and courage would shame a rabbit) . . . (who) seek ceaselessly, in a brackish tide of conspiracy, to ingratiate themselves, to excuse their incompetence and to by-pass disciplined procedures by deploying their obsequious machinations behind the scenes, especially at weekends.' Maxwell's refusal to acknowledge any hierarchy also meant that when he encountered opposition, particularly from his directors, he simply froze the dissident out and welcomed someone else into the inner circle, regardless of formal lines of authority. Ernie Burrington, managing director of MGN, says: 'Maxwell bounced us (into taking a new lease on MGN's headquarters). He did this by making Michael Stoney (one of his 'fixers') deputy managing director with special responsibilities for finance . . . jumping over the top of the Mirror finance department.' There was no half-way stage in Maxwell's favours. One of his favourite expressions was: 'Trust is like virginity - you can only lose it once.' One of his financial researchers says: 'You could see him just turn against someone. The obsession that they were against him would grow and grow, no matter what they'd done for him in the past.' Maxwell's intolerance of opposition turned to paranoia. From 1988 on it led to the secret tape-recording of conversations in his office and those of six of his directors and executives. Even his sons were not immune. The bugging was organised by Williams under his title of 'assistant to the chairman', and then Pole, as head of security. In 1988, Maxwell asked Williams to bug his private telephone, his office, his dining room and his sitting room. Williams, a former policeman in London's East End, used the help of a former army intelligence officer with experience of undercover surveillance in Northern Ireland. At first, simple tape recorders were used. But when Pole took over, Maxwell gave approval for Pounds 40,000 to be spent on a sophisticated web of sensors and wires which ran from the Mirror building in Fetter Lane to Pole's office next door. Pole, a former CID detective superintendent who had served with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, was assisted by Mike Ely, another ex-policeman. They transcribed the tapes and read the transcripts to Maxwell. Tapes and transcripts were then destroyed. Many of the targets of Maxwell's suspicion eventually left. The exodus from Maxwell House in the last two years of his empire included, crucially, four of MCC's directors and several of those who opposed Maxwell most vigorously. Pole says: 'In the end, Maxwell became extremely lonely. There was no one he would really talk to. I found him one sunny Sunday afternoon on the roof of Maxwell House. He had spent several hours sitting on the astroturf, drinking tea. He was the architect of his own loneliness.' Maxwell used frenetic activity to conceal what many people believe was a gaping emptiness in his life. Order would have exposed it, as it would have revealed the financial hole in his empire. Why, then, did people work for him? Part of the answer is money. Most of his senior executives and favourite aides received between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year. That was often only part of the package. MCC executives would receive shares in the company, which would typically be worth twice as much as their salaries each year. Directors of 'arms-length' companies in which Maxwell held only part of the shares, such as the London &amp; Bishopsgate investment companies or MTV Europe, the pop music TV channel, had small stakes - typically 5 per cent. There were also generous bonuses. But for many, money was only part of the answer. Maxwell had an eye for people who, like him, had a vacuum in their lives. Burrington says: 'There had been a number of disappointments in my life. He made things happen for me, as he did for others.' Jay says: 'I had Maxwell's problem. I have a low threshold of boredom. I was doing fiddling little jobs. I was in my mid 40s, late 40s. What this job seemed to offer was activity, a proper job.' Those who stayed longer than the typical six months in the court were peculiarly susceptible to the romance and adventure of working for Maxwell. It made them feel anything was possible. Jay says: 'It was like a band of horsemen galloping across the steppes of Russia who occasionally stopped in a huddle and saw what town they wanted to take next, and then moved on.' Maxwell gave these people a role. Several have described how they felt they were competing to be the eighth Maxwell child; indeed, that they had overtaken his older children in his affections. Pole remembers Maxwell telling him 'that while it was good of me to visit my friends, it was unacceptable for me to be unavailable for him. He talked to me like a father.' Sometimes they felt like his parent, tidying up the playpen. The disorder flattered their abilities. Jay prided himself on bringing his efficiency to the chaos of paperwork; treasurers and investment strategists, on bringing their computer models to the chaos of cash. For others, working for Maxwell offered an old-fashioned sort of patronage. Williams says: 'Can you imagine a company like ICI allowing me to progress like I did and paying for my Open University course?' Jay is emphatic that he did not find the experience humiliating. 'It was a free contract. The absurdity simply . . . made me laugh. Of course, if you had had any personal pride involved it would have been intolerable . . . I didn't let myself care about it. I wasn't about to let myself become emotionally touched by it.' But Jay is clear that the job had little real purpose. 'Anything I had any qualification for - he never asked my opinion. He was visibly frightened of asking my view. I was not intellectually engaged working for Maxwell.' When Maxwell destroyed his empire he also destroyed many of the people in it. They had become dependent on the money and the excitement, and have been left with no money, no pension and an employment record that will make it hard for them to find another job. Some have been shattered by the experience. Bunn has been severely affected by the emotional strain. Cole, who describes himself as living on an emotional edge, is a visibly shaken man. He says: 'I feel betrayed and I feel I've betrayed other people. I took time away from my family, I lived day and night for Mr Maxwell for 12 years. I haven't had a holiday for 12 years, and it was all to help this. It just mustn't happen again.' The jigsaw of who signed which documents and why they did so in the theft of Pounds 900m is only now being pieced together. It will take years of legal action to establish the full pattern of knowledge and culpability. Maxwell's bullying and his divide-and-rule policy partly explain how the fraud happened. But it is also clear that the indulgence of some of his courtiers allowed him to believe that he could get away with anything.

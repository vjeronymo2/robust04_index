			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- In contrast to western Germany,  investments in the new laender continue to increase. According  to calculations of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research  (Munich), however, the rate of growth is slowing down: In 1992  investments (including state funds) in the new laender increased  by about one-third to 119 billion German marks [DM] and in 1993  by just under 20 percent to DM142 billion, while economic  researchers predict a 15-percent increase to DM162 billion for  1994. The impetus is now increasingly coming from the services  sector, above all apartment rentals and other services, while  there is a slowdown in the industrial sector, it was stated.    The development of investment, which, compared with western  Germany, is far more expansive in the new laender, resulted in  investments per inhabitant in eastern Germany that for the first  time were higher than in the old laender. According to Ifo  calculations, the difference between approximately DM9,100 per  inhabitant in the east and DM9,000 in the west in 1993 will  probably further increase to the advantage of the new laender  (DM10,350 compared with DM9,300). Divided into sectors, it is  shown that investments in the sectors of transportation,  communications, the state, and industry in particular are  clearly higher than in the west.    According to Ifo calculations, it is safe to assume that  west  German and foreign enterprises alone invested DM50.5 (last year  DM42) billion in the new laender in 1993; DM57 billion are  expected for 1994. In the processing trade the level of the  previous year will probably not be reached for the first time in  1994. A relatively vigorous restriction of west German  investments, which is expected to be partly balanced by the  increase in foreign commitments, is hidden beneath the slight  decrease.</p>

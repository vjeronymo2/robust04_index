			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Appointments: BUPA begins to fill its gap BUPA, Britain's largest private healthcare organisation which is aiming to improve its own fitness, has named Arthur Large as a main board member and managing director of the health insurance division. Three top executives left BUPA last November, the product of changes initiated by chief executive Peter Jenkins who joined earlier in the year determined to inject a more commercial spirit into the operation. In 1990 medical insurance had produced losses of Pounds 63m, and competition forced BUPA's overall market share down to around half from an erstwhile 70 per cent. BUPA is still looking for a finance director but is not expected to appoint another director of community business, the other position vacated last year, following a general reorganisation in the health insurance division. Large, 52, comes from the RAC where he was chief executive of Motoring Services and was credited with greatly improving the RAC's approach to customer service.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: National Home Loans reports losses of Pounds 85.9m NATIONAL Home Loans, the mortgage lender that restructured Pounds 540m of debt with its banks last month, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 85.9m, much higher than expected. The loss included a Pounds 79.4m loss provision, Pounds 52m of which related to National Mortgage Bank, its banking subsidiary which is being run down and is now held in NHL's books at nil value. As expected, no dividend has been declared on ordinary shares and payment of the convertible preference shares has been passed. The shares are priced at 2 1/4 p. Mr Jonathan Perry, the executive chairman who took over in February, said the group was now focused entirely on housing finance. Any chance of recovering value for shareholders remained dependent on an improvement in the housing market and in particular on cutting the number of accounts in arrears. 'If we deal with the arrears problem successfully then we can see the possibility of stemming losses and getting back into profits,' Mr Perry said. Some Pounds 20m of provisions reflected non-payment of current interest on mortgages in arrears to National Home Loans Corporation. Staff are making more than 30,000 telephone calls a month to try to reduce these arrears, apparently with some success. While many home owners were falling further behind in payments, the number of hard-core accounts in arrears for more than three months has fallen by 10 per cent to 7,461 since its peak in February. Another Pounds 28m of provisions covered additional specific and general provisions stemming from continued deterioration in the housing market. There may be a need for another increase in the general provision because of a further deterioration. The group also suffered a sharp fall in net interest income, from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 6.4m.</p>

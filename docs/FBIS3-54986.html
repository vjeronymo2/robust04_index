			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the PRAVDA, ITAR-TASS column: "With No Haste </F> or Fuss"]    [Text] A draft new Azerbaijan Constitution will be  submitted for parliamentary debate this spring.    The working group preparing the draft has almost completed  work on the text. Nonetheless, it still has to be "polished."  The experience of the independent states proclaimed following  the collapse of the Union has shown that the adoption of a  constitution that is new in content is a protracted and  labor-intensive process. It would be inappropriate to rush such  an important job.</p>

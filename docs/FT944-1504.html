			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): BSI seeks views on safety systems - In a nutshell Public comment is being sought by the British Standards Institution on its guide to health and safety management systems. The standard likely to follow consultation will be linked to BS EN ISO 9000, the European equivalent of BS 5750, but is unlikely to become a certifiable standard. BSI says the cost to employers of work accidents and work-related ill-health is estimated to be equivalent to up to 10 per cent of UK company gross trading profits. The organisation says a properly managed health and safety system would save money. The guide has been written to allow the 'typical manager' to design a system that allows them to meet the requirements of the 1992 Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, BSI says. Comments are welcome until February 28 1995. The Guide to Health and Safety Management Systems is available for Pounds 13 from BSI, 0181 996 9000.</p>

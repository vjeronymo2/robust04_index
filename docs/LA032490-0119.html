			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER VISITS SOWETO, VOWS TO URGE END TO 'DISTRESSING' APARTHEID;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: THE SECRETARY OF STATE ALSO MEETS WITH ANC OFFICIAL WALTER  SISULU.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, his consciousness sharpened by a quick  tour of South Africa's largest black township, said Friday that he is  distressed by what he saw and is even more determined to push for an end to  apartheid.  </P> <P> After four days of intense diplomacy in the affluent, swimming-pool-studded  neighborhoods of South Africa and neighboring Namibia, the trip through Soweto  marked Baker's first look at the living conditions of southern Africa's  majority black population.  </P> <P> Although Baker had deplored the apartheid system of racial segregation at every  opportunity, he had not had a chance to look closely at its victims.  </P> <P> "It's quite distressing," Baker said. "I think it is necessary for the system  to be abolished."  </P> <P> Even in Soweto, the sprawling black township of 2.5 million outside  Johannesburg, Baker spent most of his time with the relatively well-to-do.  </P> <P> He breakfasted with anti-apartheid community leaders at a U.S. Information  Service library, conferred for about an hour with African National Congress  official Walter Sisulu at Sisulu's modest stuccoed house, watched preschool  children bounce happily on a trampoline and walked through an education center  financed by the South African business community.  </P> <P> It was only on a brief drive through the Mshenguville squatters camp that Baker  confronted the true poverty of tin-and-tar-paper shacks without electricity,  running water or other facilities.  </P> <P> Baker did not stop, viewing through the windows of his limousine the squalor of  life just 25 miles from the high-rise buildings of Johannesburg and the gold  mines that help support the South African economy. A motorcade of security  personnel and reporters followed in his wake.  </P> <P> Sisulu is a longtime associate of black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela,  and, like Mandela, has spent most of his adult life in South African prisons.  Sisulu urged the United States to withhold its support for South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk until the white-minority-led government keeps  its promise to end apartheid.  </P> <P> "I think that Mr. De Klerk is making an effort," Sisulu said. "We have  appreciated the start he has made. We want to urge Mr. De Klerk to be a bit  speedier about things. The very first stage has not been completed."  </P> <P> Sisulu, recently released after 25 years in prison, talked to reporters after  showing Baker around the tidy kindergarten that is attended by his  grandchildren. The school is across the street from Sisulu's house.  </P> <P> "I told the secretary that we are very grateful to the people of America for  the support they have given us over the years," Sisulu said. "We will expect  more support as days go by."  </P> <P> State Department officials arranged the visit to Soweto to balance Baker's  talks Thursday in Cape Town with De Klerk and other top officials of the  government, which marked the end of Washington's diplomatic isolation of South  Africa.  </P> <P> The visit was planned as a high-visibility "photo opportunity," exploited both  by the State Department and the African National Congress.  </P> <P> While Baker was meeting with Sisulu and his wife, Albertina, children at the  school entertained television crews by shaking their fists and chanting "ANC,  ANC, ANC" as soon as the cameras began to roll.  </P> <P> The visit gave Baker a chance to renew his acquaintance with Albertina Sisulu,  an anti-apartheid leader who became the first ANC representative to meet  President Bush when she visited Washington last year.  </P> <P> Despite De Klerk's liberalizing steps, Sisulu told Baker that conditions for  blacks remain deplorable. Poor schools and inadequate housing, he said, amount  to "dynamite for violence."  </P> <P> Although De Klerk's government is scheduled to open unprecedented talks with  ANC leaders next month, Sisulu said true negotiations over the future of the  nation cannot begin until the government makes more fundamental changes than it  has carried out so far.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Soweto is synonymous with the struggle of South Africa's black majority against  apartheid. The sprawling township outside Johannesburg was the scene of a  famous, tragic protest by black schoolchildren. On June 16, 1976, thousands of  them marched against a decree requiring some classes to be taught in Afrikaans,  the language of the Dutch white minority. When pelted with stones, police  opened fire, felling Hector Peterson, 13. Riots ensued in what became known as  the Soweto uprising. Violence spread, and in the next eight months, hundreds  died in anti-apartheid protests.  </P></p>

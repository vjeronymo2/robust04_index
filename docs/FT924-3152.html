			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Avesco back in the black with Pounds 23,000 Avesco, the radio and electronic goods and television and film services company, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 23,000 for the half year to September 30. This compares with a profit of Pounds 147,000 last time but marked a turnround from losses of Pounds 2.26m for the 1992 year. Mr Richard Murray, chairman, said that profits for the first six months would have been substantially higher but for the increase in research and development expenditure at VideoLogic. Turnover expanded by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 11.2m. Finance costs rose to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 269,000) and after tax of Pounds 8,000 (Pounds 49,000) earnings came out at 0.025p (0.164p).</p>

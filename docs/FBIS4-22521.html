			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Volarovich, professor and honorary </F> mineral prospector, and Aleksandr Kurskiy, candidate of chemical  sciences: "We Have Found Gold Somewhere Here"]    [Text] "We have found gold somewhere here, a lot of  gold--loads of it!" There are few television viewers who have  not seen the advertisement accompanying this cheery jingle. All  the same, does Russia have a lot of gold?    One of the myths disseminated in recent years is the  fabulous  reserve of gold which can come to the aid of Russia's economy  during this period of crisis. But it turns out that the  country's gold reserve, which had been accumulated for a  century, was squandered by the end of "the Gorbachev period." It  amounted to no more than 140 metric tons by August 1991. At the  same time, 8,200 tons of gold were stored in the vaults of Fort  Knox in the United States, and the total gold assets of the  world's banks had reached 35,000 metric tons. Belgium and the  Netherlands alone threw about 1,000 metric tons of gold into the  world market in 1991, which led to a drop in the world price to  $324 per ounce (31.1 grams) from $446 in 1987.    At the turn of this century, when intellectual politicians  such as Sergey Yulyevich Vitte [Witte] and Petr Arkadyevich  Stolypin held the position of minister of finance and prime  minister, gold mining was especially encouraged by the granting  of various state privileges. In 1914, 64 metric tons of gold, or  one-tenth of the world's production of this metal, were  extracted. Russia's gold reserve was more than 1,500 metric tons.    The bolsheviks understood the strategic role of the gold  reserve as well as the tsarist ministers, and after the civil  war they began intensive restoration of the state geological  service and the gold industry. By 1928, the country had  extracted 36 metric tons of gold. In order to speed up  restoration of the state gold reserve, precious metals were  confiscated from private individuals through the system of  Torgsin [All-Union Association for Trade With Foreigners]  stores, brilliantly portrayed by Mikhail Bulgakov in the novel  "The Master and Margarita." By 1953, the gold reserve in the  USSR had reached 2,050 metric tons. If it is taken into account  that 2,100 metric tons were extracted from 1928 to 1953 and that  the United States demanded 1,500 metric tons of gold to pay for  Lend-Lease during World War II, we can see how effective the  state system of precious metal accumulation was over these years.    Khrushchev deprived the gold industry of its previous  privileges and began squandering the gold reserve, and this was  completed under Gorbachev. Nevertheless, the powerful gold  industry in the USSR increased the amount of gold extracted  right up to 1990; it totaled an average 160 metric tons annually  from 1955 to 1965, 250 metric tons per year from 1965 to 1975,  and 273 metric tons per year from 1975 to 1990. Only South  Africa extracted more gold--about 600 metric tons per year. The  expenditures to establish and develop the mineral-raw material  base for all types of minerals, including gold, during this  period accounted for a stable 1.2 to 1.4 percent of national  income, but the economic effectiveness of geological operations  was highest among the primary sectors of the national economy.  Investment programs over the past decades were oriented mainly  toward development of the mineral-raw material base in settled  regions with a more moderate climate on the USSR's southern  perimeter. The huge amount of funds confiscated in Russia were  invested in the construction of mining combines and development  of territories which are sovereign today.    Russia turned out to be in a critical situation with respect  to a number of minerals after the collapse of the USSR. Russian  industry's requirements for manganese, chromium, antimony,  titanium, mercury, and lead are being met almost entirely by  deliveries from former union republics, which costs Russia $2  billion per year. In gold production Russia holds just fifth  place in the world today (158 metric tons in 1993). It extracts  four times less gold per capita than Uzbekistan. Attempts are  being made to increase the state gold reserve. It increased to  308 metric tons in 1993. However, the lack of a consistent state  mineral-raw material policy does not make it possible to count  on even reaching the gold reserve level of 1913 quickly.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gold Production in Russia and the USSR                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                                  |Production, in Metric Tons Per year   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1914 (Russia)                         |64                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1928 (USSR)                           |36                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1955-1965 (USSR)                      |160                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1965-1975 (USSR)                      |250                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1975-1990 (USSR)                      |273                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993 (Russia)                         |158                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gold Reserves in Russia and the USSR                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                                  |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Size of Reserve, in Metric Tons       |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1914 (Russia)                         |1,500                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1953 (USSR)                           |2,050                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991 (USSR)                           |140                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993 (Russia)                         |308                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Let us return to the United States' experience. Since 1929  it  has had a federal mineral-raw material policy aimed at the  country's self-sufficiency in strategic raw material. The "Law  on a national policy and research and development in the field  of materials and mineral raw material" passed by the U.S.  Congress in 1980 states: "...the United States should always  pursue a policy aimed at providing for a sufficient supply of  the materials needed to maintain national security, the public  welfare, and the level of industrial production..." Since 1981,  at the initiative of the United States, Canada, and the FRG, an  international program has been implemented jointly with South  Africa, Australia, and Great Britain to keep a record of the  strategic types of mineral raw material and ensure its  accessibility. The United States' gold reserve has reached its  maximum amount since World War II--25,000 tons. After the war De  Gaulle took decisive steps to increase France's gold reserve.  All countries, especially Canada, Japan, Taiwan, China, India,  abd Saudi Arabia, want to add to their gold reserve. Over the  past 5 years, the United States, Australia, Canada, and China  have doubled their gold production. It is a different situation  in the territory of the former Soviet Union.    Unlike the United States, unified national mineral-raw  material programs were not developed or implemented during the  USSR's existence. Development of the country's mineral-raw  material base was not linked with the task of building up  strategic and mobilization resources.    The 2 years which the Law "On Mineral Resources," adopted by  the VS RF [Russian Federation Supreme Soviet] in February 1992,  has been in effect have shown that the federal mineral-raw  material interests are practically unprotected by this  legislation. The Supreme Soviet adopted and put into effect a  statute on the procedure for paid, licensed use of mineral  deposits long before the federal mineral-raw material priorities  were defined.    The numerous auctions and competitions for the right to  develop mineral deposits have not led to the establishment of  one mining enterprise. The mass issuance of licenses for  geological study of gold-bearing areas has taken vast regions,  where practically no geological exploration work is being  conducted, out of the jurisdiction of state regulation in a  number of parts of the Russian Federation.    The lack of a federal mineral-raw material policy has led to  disorganization of the geological sector. Its financing from the  budget in 1993 amounted to just 17 percent of the 1990 level.  Employment in the sector has declined by half and is continuing  to decline. As a result, not one new deposit of metallic  minerals has been found in Russia since 1992, and the increase  in the gold reserve does not cover its production. This is  leading to depletion of the mineral-raw material base--the  principal source of resources for the Russian economy.    The situation is especially critical because many gold mines  have reserves for just 6 or 7 years. At the same time, a number  of the large gold deposits in Russia that were prospected before  continue to be unused. These deposits include Sukhoy Log in  Irkutsk Oblast, Nezhdaninskoye in Yakutia, Mayskoye in Chukotka,  and Olimpiadskoye in Krasnoyarsk Kray. However, the funds needed  to develop them are so substantial that this is practically  impossible without foreign investments today.    The raw material base of Russian gold, the mining of which  accounts for about 70 percent of Russia's total production, is  in an even worse situation. In most of the leading regions  (Magadan Oblast, Yakutia) which provide most of the placer gold,  there are reserves available for just 3 to 5 years. The  situation is somewhat better in the Amur and Transbaykal regions  and Buryatia, but the average gold content in these regions is  very low--just 0.16 to 0.17 grams per cubic meter, and  production in these areas cannot compensate for the loss in the  northeastern regions.    New regions with gold-bearing potential such as the Polar  Urals, Timan, Karelia, Taymyr, Anabar, and Olenek have not been  studied adequately. The gold content of the sands and gravel  which are being excavated in thousands of quarries in many parts  of the Russian platform has not been studied at all.    So the country's geologists have the urgent task of  searching  for deposits of gold, not to mention the other minerals.  Considerable attention should be devoted to the Federal  Geological Service without delay.    The specific nature of the geological sector and the  objective gap in time between the stages of searching for  deposits and the actual opportunity to begin working the  minerals found have to be given particular emphasis. Any  forecasts about Russia emerging from the depression after 1995  are not worth the paper they are written on unless the extent of  the degradation of the mineral resources base is taken into  account. So that Russia's gold can reinforce the country's  economic might, the policy on mineral resources has to be  changed and made the state's business today.</p>

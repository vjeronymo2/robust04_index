			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Hearing an explosion on the grapevine: The race is on to win a prize from the boom in US mobile communications The contestants are only now beginning to hit full stride in the race to become a dominant player in the booming US mobile communications market. A variety of billion-dollar deals have been negotiated between cellular phone operators and telecoms companies in an intense period of consolidation for the US wireless communications business, which embraces mobile phones, two-way pagers and messagers, portable fax machines and hand-held computers. The holy grail of the cellular business is to achieve national coverage because the potential for growth in what is still a relatively young market is huge. Of the 16m or so subscribers, most are business users who can afford the present high costs. The challenge for cellular companies is to build a nationwide network providing ordinary consumers with a high-quality, low-cost product. Mr Ronald Altman, an analyst at New York securities house Furman Selz, estimates that a decade from now there could be 100m cellular subscribers in the US. Hence the frantic search for partners as companies try to build their competitive muscle. Since early July, two regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, Bell Atlantic and Nynex, have decided to unite their cellular operations, another Baby Bell - US West - has agreed to merge its cellular interests with AirTouch Communications, and Nextel Communications, a mobile radio dispatch company, has spent Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.54bn) acquiring a rival, Dial Page, and the mobile radio assets of Motorola. Several companies have also set out to broaden existing alliances. US West has held talks with Time Warner, the entertainment group, and the Chicago-based Baby Bell, Ameritech, has been talking to AirTouch, US West, Bell Atlantic and Nynex, among others. The rush to form or join cellular consortia comes less than a year after AT&amp;T's move to buy McCaw Cellular Communications for Dollars 12.6bn. The union of the long-distance telephone giant with the country's leading cellular carrier, approved by federal regulators last month, endorses the potential of the cellular communications industry in the US and helped to drive regional phone companies and cellular carriers into each others' arms as they realise that they stand a better chance of competing with AT&amp;T-McCaw if they join forces with one another. The ultimate objective behind the mergers and alliances is to create nationwide cellular networks that will allow subscribers relatively cheap and easy access to a wide range of wireless communications services wherever they are in the country. Since the mid-1980s, when the government broke up AT&amp;T and divided the national cellular market into regions, each with a Baby Bell and an independent carrier, the cellular business has been fragmented. Although special 'roaming' arrangements between carriers allow subscribers to use their phones outside their home region, the costs are passed on in roaming fees. Consequently, the company or consortium which creates a national network will have the chance to provide customers with a much better service. The prize will be a bigger slice of a rapidly growing market. By the end of last year, 16m people were subscribers to cellular phone services in the US, with 14,000 new customers signing up every day. EMCI, the Washington-based communications consultancy, estimates the total will reach 20m by the end of this year. They and other analysts believe that the 25 per cent growth rate could accelerate into 1995 and 1996. Industry consolidation is also being driven by the emergence of a new system of radio telephony called personal communications services, such as advanced paging, messaging, phone, fax and data services. PCS - which relies on digital, as opposed to lower-capacity analogue technology - will offer a better service than is now available on cellular phones, which have been plagued by customer dissatisfaction with quality and cost. The PCS era will begin in earnest this October when the US government auctions licences to broadband PCS networks. If the recent auction of the narrowband PCS licences - for less sophisticated services such as paging and messaging - is anything to go by, demand for the broadband licences will be brisk. The 10 narrowband licences were sold for Dollars 617m. Analysts estimate that the much larger auction of broadband PCS licences could enrich federal coffers by Dollars 10bn, or more. Companies have been rushing to forge alliances ahead of these auctions, so that they know where they need broadband licences to complement their existing coverage. Mr Ronald Altman, an analyst at New York securities house Furman Selz, explains: 'The more existing properties you can put together, the less additional PCS franchises you will have to bid for to be able to provide national coverage. Therefore, you are going to see a mad scramble to get as big a footprint as possible by the existing cellular operators, so that they can focus on bidding for those PCS franchises that will round out national coverage.' This helps explain why, as Mr Altman says: 'The level of discussion activity right now is off the charts.'</p>

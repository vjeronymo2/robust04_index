			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> SMITH, LUNGREN SQUARE OFF ON ABORTION, OIL DRILLING  </P> <P> In a possible presage to the fall campaign for state attorney general,  Republican Dan Lungren and Democrat Arlo Smith sparred on the issues of  abortion rights and offshore oil drilling at their first head-to-head  confrontation.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who will face Smith in next month's  Democratic primary, did not attend the unusual Santa Monica Bar Assn. Law Day  forum Tuesday night, citing a scheduling conflict.  </P> <P> While Reiner and Smith both agreed on such fundamental issues as reproductive  rights and oil drilling, it took Smith little time to spotlight substantial  differences with Lungren -- the man either Reiner or Smith will meet in the  November general election.  </P> <P> Devoting his entire 15-minute opening statement to the question of abortion,  Smith vowed to "personally argue any case whether it be in the Municipal Court  or the U.S. Supreme Court" to protect abortion rights.  </P> <P> "My position is first of all, one of very deep belief. I am a father. And I  will not stand to allow the rights of my daughter to become a political  football kicked around by politicians scrambling for the votes," said Smith,  the San Francisco district attorney who has been endorsed by the state chapter  of the National Organization for Women.  </P> <P> Smith added that privacy provisions in the state Constitution clearly protect a  woman's right of choice. "I will fight any legislation that threatens that  right," Smith said.  </P> <P> Lungren, a longtime foe of abortion, accused abortion rights activists of  seeking to make the issue "a litmus test (for holding) public office," much as  they "criticized the pro-life people for raising it a couple years ago."  </P> <P> As attorney general, Lungren said after the forum, he would go to court to  defend possible state legislation cutting off Medi-Cal funding for abortions.  Smith and Reiner have said that they would refuse to defend such legislation on  constitutional grounds.  </P> <P> Lungren, who is running unopposed for the Republican nomination, did agree with  Smith on one abortion-related issue. He said that the wording of Proposition  115, the sweeping anti-crime initiative on the June ballot, would not  jeopardize abortion rights.  </P> <P> Later in the forum, held at the Riviera Country Club, Smith drew applause from  the 75-member audience when he emphasized his opposition to offshore oil  drilling. "I will be there to fight anyone who wants to start drilling off of  the Pacific Palisades or off the coast of San Francisco or any other place in  this state," he declared.  </P> <P> Lungren, on the other hand, received lighter applause when he countered that  offshore drilling must be considered "on a case-by-case basis, an area-by-area  basis."  </P> <P> "You have to have very stringent environmental standards, very stringent  environmental controls," said Lungren. " . . . (But) as long as there are  energy needs in this country, we have to provide a careful balancing act. . . .  If we're going to say we are going to absolutely restrict energy supplies to  California, we ought to have the guts to then come up and say what our  alternative methods of transportation are going to be and how much they are  going to cost the people."  </P> <P> The subject of oil drilling is particularly sensitive in Pacific Palisades,  where Occidental Petroleum Corp. lost a bitter 1988 referendum.  </P> <P> The debate also focused on street crime and drug abuse, with each candidate  maintaining that he is better qualified to handle the problems. Smith cited his  36 years experience as a district attorney and a deputy attorney general, while  Lungren focused on his decade in Congress, where he sponsored or helped win  passage of several major anti-crime bills.  </P> <P> Inter-party debates are highly out of the ordinary before a primary, but both  candidates said they would look forward to additional encounters and criticized  Reiner for not joining them.  </P> <P> Reiner, long seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has  participated in three forums with Smith, including one at the recent state  Democratic convention in Los Angeles. But Reiner so far has declined Smith's  proposal for a series of four pre-primary debates in major cities across the  state on specific topics ranging from street gang violence to corruption in  government.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Election Appeal of the Republic Committee of the Communist </F> Party to All Communists and Their Supporters and the Electorate  of Our Republic"]    [Text] Esteemed Crimeans!    The political and economic situation in Crimea remains  serious and unpredictable after the presidential elections also.    The results of socioeconomic development of 1993 have borne  out the gloomiest forecasts. They have made it possible to see  that a number of political leaders have for the sake of their  own ambitions reduced the people to indigence and humiliation.  The main political slogan with which the Communists are going  into the elections is labor, the power of the people, and  justice. We call on all to unite around these principles.  <H5>  I. Political Situation in Crimea </H5>   Under the influence of the forces that still really dispose  of power the creation of new political parties and their hurried  registration have been artificially accelerated in the Republic.  The intention of the sponsors of this campaign is to camouflage  the representatives of the "power party" and get them elected to  the Supreme Soviet and pilfer the votes of the electorate from  parties which already have their own political character. To  this end there has been the nomination in all head-to-head  constituencies of numerous so-called "independent" candidates  and also the mass nomination of candidates occupying the most  important positions in the power structures. All this is geared  to a conclusive change of sociopolitical system.    Confirming its statutory and program positions as a party  expressing the interests of the working class, peasantry, and  intelligentsia and all working people and the positions of  internationalism and patriotism, the Republic committee of the  Communist Party of Crimea sees the actions of the organizers of  the "new" parties as a manifest aspiration to split both the  workers movement and all patriotic forces in Crimea, disconnect  our society, counterpose town to country, the agricultural  laborer to the plant worker, and the youth to the elderly, and  to artificially embroil people of different social groups.  <H5>  II. Main Goals of the Communist Party of Crimea </H5>   The main goal set by candidates from the Communist Party is  the restoration and realization of social safeguards. The great  state in which our peoples lived prior to the Belovezha  conspiracy was not, of course, devoid of shortcomings. The  political and economic structure was in need of serious  improvement, but instead of the gradual reform and strengthening  of the system of the organs of the power of the people--the  soviets--and a smooth transition to the new principles of  economic policy, indiscriminate processes which signified the  disarticulation of the Soviet Union and the profound crisis of  the national economy gained the ascendancy. The Communist Party  of Crimea links, therefore, the possibility of the achievement  in full of its main goal--the realization of social  safeguards--with the restoration of a unified state based on  common borders, customs, credit system, and monetary unit and  the creation of the corresponding organs of administration. The  form of state arrangement of this voluntary union of the peoples  (federation, confederation) should be determined at a referendum.  <H5>  III. Place and role of the Republic of Crimea </H5>   History no longer allows of the possibility of tarrying over  the adoption of a decision, this is today a matter of life and  death! The political and economic crisis in Ukraine is  intensifying increasingly, and Crimea must realize its right to  the independent determination of economic priorities. It is  essential primarily to surmount the spiral of hyperinflation,  and this is only possible within the framework of the closest  alliance with Russia and the other republics. For Ukraine this  should be a powerful motivating factor of the closest economic  integration in an alliance with Russia and the other republics.    This would be a first step toward a new, unified state, in  whose restoration the Republic of Crimea is destined to perform  its particular historical role.  <H3>  IV. Stabilization of the Living Standard of Society and  Restoration of Social Safeguards </H3>   In view of the urgent need for a halt to the continued fall  in the living standard of the majority of the population below  the poverty line and the threat of starvation, the Communists  will seek persistently in the Supreme Soviet of Crimea the  adoption of a law on the building of a state system of social  protection of the populace on the principle of the conformity of  pay, pensions, and grants to the actual subsistence minimum.    The Communist deputies will demand of the executive specific  measures geared to the fight against unemployment and the  creation of new jobs, the introduction of government subsidies  for fixing the price of bread and milk, free health care and  education, higher education included, and the accessibility to  each family of children's establishments, and so forth and will  also oppose all attempts to further deprive the people of social  safeguards.  <H3>  V. Ways of Accomplishing the Tasks Set in the Election  Platform of the Communist Party of Crimea </H3>   The economic basis throughout the period of restoration  should be a multistructural economy with the retention of the  leading role of public property and state regulation of  production. State regulation should provide for the extrication  of the national economy from the severe economic crisis, and its  multistructural character is a step toward the achievement of  social harmony, of which we are in such need today, on the basis  of a particular concurrence of the interests of the broadest  strata of society: from the worker and employee through the  national entrepreneur. A fundamental change in tax and credit  policy for the purpose of stimulation of the producer of any  form of ownership (private included) by way of concessionary  taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of the tax  and investment field, the establishment of government subsidies  to agriculture and the elimination of the "price scissors" in  respect to agricultural and industrial products, and furtherance  of the development of both the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and  tenant and private farms are necessary.    We will simultaneously conduct a merciless struggle against  crime, corruption, and parasitic profiteering and oppose the  introduction of the private ownership of land, which is the main  wealth of Crimea and must not become a subject of speculation.  The land and its resources are public property. It may be  transferred, on a long-term and indefinite basis even, with  transfer by inheritance, but without the right to buy and sell.    We will ensure effective state supervision of the activity  of  enterprises of all forms of ownership and restore renewed  people's control.    The Communist Party is prepared to submit such a package of  laws for consideration by the Supreme Soviet of Crimea.    Only the restoration of common statehood and an upturn of  production will enable us to stabilize the economy, restore a  decent living standard of the people, and secure acceptable  starting conditions for the implementation of real reforms.    We have prepared and sent to the president of the Republic a  "100 days" program, which is geared to the accomplishment of the  priority tasks and which does not require big capital outlays.  <H5>  VI. Strengthening the Power of the People </H5>   As a guarantee of the preservation and strengthening of the  state status of Crimea and the exclusion of the establishment of  an authoritarian dictatorship, we see as the main task the  broadening of the sovereignty of the soviets of all levels.    The chairmen of the city and rayon soviets should be elected  directly by the public of the corresponding cities and rayons.    Consulting the people via a referendum should be the  cardinal  path of a solution of all strategic questions of the Republic's  socioeconomic development.    Esteemed fellow citizens!    On 16 and 30 January 1994 you demonstrated high political  maturity and expressed by your vote total lack of confidence in  the power party.    But this political force remains a real obstacle in the way  of the accomplishment of real social transformations in the  interests of a majority of the people inasmuch as it has a  majority in the Supreme Soviet and holds the key positions in  the Council of Ministers of our republic.    For this reason we cannot allow to hold the mandates of  deputies the representatives of that same power party, beneath  whatever flags they have conducted their election campaign and  in whatever "democratic" clothing they have garbed themselves.    Yours must be a deliberate choice!</p>

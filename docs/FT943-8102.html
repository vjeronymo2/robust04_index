			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Mandela vague on policy detail South African President Nelson Mandela yesterday promised co-ordinated programmes to transform society following the apartheid era, but said little to address the concerns of blacks impatient for more rapid change, Patti Waldmeir reports from Cape Town. Mr Mandela's speech to parliament in Cape Town, which was broadcast live nationwide, marked the 100th day of the multi-party government of national unity. It was billed as an attempt to reassure his mass constituency that he would not put the demands of potential investors and nervous whites above the needs of those disadvantaged by apartheid. 'Millions have suffered deprivation for decades and they have the right to seek redress. They fought and voted for change; and change the people of South Africa must have,' he told members of parliament, who gave him a standing ovation when he entered the chamber. While judging the government's first 100 days a success, he stressed that 'at the end of the day, the yardstick that we shall all be judged by is. . . are we, through our endeavours, creating the basis to better the lives of all South Africans?' But the speech gave little detail of proposed socio-economic development projects, and included almost no new initiatives to promote that goal. It was couched in language which would not be readily accessible to a township audience, focusing more on the process of managing change than on the kind of eye-catching programmes demanded by an impatient electorate. He made only a passing reference to the country's desperate need for millions of new homes. Housing is the most politically explosive issue facing the new government, and is a significant focus of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the government's umbrella plan for socio-economic development. A white paper on the programme is expected to go to the cabinet soon.</p>

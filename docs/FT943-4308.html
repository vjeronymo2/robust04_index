			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Personal View: Poland's privatisation in a mess Poland's prime minister, Waldemar Pawlak, has had on his desk for the last two months the implementation order of the mass privatisation programme first introduced in July 1990. The reason he has not signed it so far is the continuing controversy and opposition to this programme among wide sections of the Polish population. While in all other economies in transition mass privatisation programmes have an important function of securing the political support for economic reforms, here it has deepened conflicts and instability. The reasons for the controversy lie in the mistakes made at the beginning of the economic transition in 1990. Polish privatisation law defined two principal strategies: sales to foreign investors and initial public offerings (IPOs) on the newly organised Warsaw stock exchange. However, by July 1994, there were only 24 IPOs and about 60 sales to foreign investors. This strategy is more suitable for a western country where only a few state enterprises are to be privatised than for the Polish economy, dominated by more than 8,000 state enterprises. As an afterthought, a provision was added for 'liquidation' of medium-sized enterprises through employee ownership and leases. This resulted in about 1,000 privatisations, a great success. A question arose, however, about what to do with large enterprises which did not qualify to be floated on the tightly regulated Warsaw stock exchange and where there was no foreign investor interest. The answer was to place them in groups and find foreign turnround managers who would restructure and improve them to a point where they could be floated or where foreign investors could be found for them. But successive governments and consultants developed the idea in such a way as to make the programme politically unacceptable. The objections centre on two fundamental issues. The first relates to the centralised and bureaucratic nature of this programme. The way it works is that ministry officials organise 20 government investment funds, choose foreign managers, and divide up 60 per cent of the shares of 400 companies between them (the remaining shares belong 25 per cent to the state, and 15 per cent to the employees). Each manager is a strategic investor in about 30 of them. Thus, the government is closely identified with the whole scheme, which raises fears of collusion, fraud and conflicts of interest. The second and more important objection is the inadequacy of this programme as mass privatisation. It involves only 400 companies, but attempts to satisfy the claims of citizens whose savings were forcibly appropriated under communist rule. The plan is to give potentially 27m adult Poles a voucher which can be exchanged for one share in each one of 20 investment funds, minus 15 per cent of shares reserved for their managers. However, critics claim such a programme is among the least encompassing in east European countries and does not satisfy popular desires for participation and equity. In Estonian privatisation, the asset transfer per adult averages Dollars 1,000 and participants can use their vouchers to buy housing, land, agricultural implements, shares of state enterprises and a pension annuity. In Czechoslovakia's first wave of privatisation, the asset transfer was about Dollars 1,000 per voucher holder and, in the second wave, about Dollars 800. Czechs can bid for any of more than 2,000 enterprises or deposit vouchers with investment funds. In contrast, Polish citizens have no choice about the use of their vouchers or which investment fund - government or private - to deposit them with. And the amount of asset transfer is minuscule, involving the 27m potential voucher holders, and compensation claims of state employees and retirees. This is ironic considering that Poland was the cradle of ideas about popular participation in the transformation and privatisation of communist economies. In 1981, Solidarity established the principle of autonomous, self-financing enterprises under some social control. The 1988 voucher coupon scheme, eventually successfully applied in Czechoslovakia, was proposed by Polish economists. The 1990 transformation programme went against popular expectations by defining the privatisation strategy in a centralised and excluding manner. Unless the successive Polish governments abandon the attitude of imposing arbitrary programmes from above and meet reasonable demands of citizens for equity and participation in reforms, the privatisation policy in Poland will remain a political battleground where little gets accomplished.

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: LOST DRAMA IN VOTING RIGHTS SUIT  </P> <P> The voice on the telephone was as clear -- and as angry -- as always.  </P> <P> You got it wrong, he said. You were careless. You meant to get it wrong. You've  always had it in for me. I won that election fair and square.  </P> <P> His name is Ernest Debs. From 1958 until 1974, he was a Los Angeles County  supervisor, representing the 3rd District, which extends from East Los Angeles  to Westwood and Bel-Air and over the Santa Monica Mountains into the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> If there is a single person who is central to the Justice Department's Voting  Rights Act lawsuit against the county, it is this ruddy, white-haired,  irascible man who ran his domain in the reward-your-friends,  punish-your-enemies manner of an old political boss.  </P> <P> The trial of that lawsuit is slowly ending. The Justice Department and their  fellow plaintiffs, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American  Legal Defense and Educational Fund, have completed their cases. Now, the county  is presenting its side to Judge David Kenyon. But something has been missing  through the days of tedious testimony -- the coherent unveiling of what  actually is a great political story, a saga of old intrigues and back-room  deals.  </P> <P> It stars Ernie Debs, now in his 80s and retired. Debs dominated the Board of  Supervisors with his cunning, his political fund-raising, his temper and his  raw power. He sputtered in anger when he was confronted with unfriendly  questions. Current Supervisor Pete Schabarum might be fierce in such  situations. Debs was fearsome.  </P> <P> The saga starts with Debs' long-count victory over Ed Roybal for a vacant seat  the 1958 supervisorial election. Before that election was over, there were four  recounts. I wrote a while back about the election, and the allegations of fraud  that accompanied it. And Debs, in our phone conversation, thought I had been  unfair.  </P> <P> In 1958, Roybal, who is now a congressman, was a militantly liberal Los Angeles  city councilman who criticized the downtown business establishment, and The  Times, for promoting projects that wiped out poor Hispanic neighborhoods.  Dodger Stadium, built in Chavez Ravine, and the Bunker Hill redevelopment  project were two of them. Debs was a pro-development Los Angeles city  councilman who exemplified the grow-grow-grow L.A. of the '50s.  </P> <P> After the election, Debs and his four supervisorial colleagues began a series  of boundary changes that radically altered the 3rd District and swung it in his  favor.  </P> <P> An explanatory note: After each census, supervisors, like other elected  representatives, change the boundaries of their districts so that each district  represents about the same number of voters. Each supervisor gets a district  with enough potentially friendly voters to assure victory. This is called  gerrymandering and it is customarily done in private, despite public disclosure  laws.  </P> <P> Debs and his colleagues first moved the western boundary of the 3rd District to  include Westwood, Beverly Hills and Bel-Air. Previously, those neighborhoods  had been in the 4th District, which runs along the coast. The next change moved  the northwestern boundary all the way over the Santa Monica Mountains into  Sherman Oaks, Studio City and other San Fernando Valley communities. Those  sectors also has been in other districts.  </P> <P> With each move, Debs' district became more Anglo, reducing the proportion of  Latinos who had backed Roybal. The 3rd District, which almost elected a Latino  in 1958, had become a constituency where Latinos had dwindled.  </P> <P> Another important supervisorial decision involved the fast-growing Latino  population in the San Gabriel Valley. These voters could gone to the 3rd  District, which would have strengthened its Latino population. But they went to  the neighboring 1st District.  </P> <P> Thus was the Latino population divided.  </P> <P> Those lines were generally followed in the supervisors' 1981 redistricting, the  specific target of the Justice Department's lawsuit.  </P> <P> In the trial, neither side has has called Debs to testify. But government  witnesses claim that his motive, and that of the other supervisors, was to  dilute the Latino vote. In our phone conversation, Debs told me that's not  true. The board, he said, merely reacted to population shifts.  </P> <P> The rich political drama driving the case has been mummified, buried under  highly technical testimony and boxes of fine-printed documents. This reached  its height last week when a political science professor, vainly trying to bring  precision to the imprecise business of politics, actually added up voter  registration figures on his hand calculator.  </P> <P> But no calculator can measure Ernie Debs' motives. Only Judge Kenyon, viewing  it all from the bench, can do that.  </P></p>

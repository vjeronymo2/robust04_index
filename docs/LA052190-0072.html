			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWNPOUR SWAMPS ARKANSAS TOWN; DAM IN TEXAS IS SINKING  </P> <P> Up to 13 inches of rainfall in Arkansas washed out bridges, swept away cars and  forced hundreds of people to flee to higher ground Sunday, while an  overburdened dam in north-central Texas was sinking and feared to be near  collapse.  </P> <P> The downpour dumped more than 12 inches of rain in Hot Springs, Ark., and left  some roads under water 7 feet deep.  </P> <P> In the downtown area, automobiles floated down streets and crashed into  storefronts, authorities said.  </P> <P> About 400 homes in and around Hot Springs, a central Arkansas resort town, were  evacuated early Sunday, but most residents had returned by the afternoon, Ray  Briggler of the state Office of Emergency Services said.  </P> <P> Garland County Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Garner described the businesses in downtown  Hot Springs as "full of water." He said no injuries were known and no one had  been reported missing. A sheriff's dispatcher said that most county roads were  not passable.  </P> <P> "There was very deep water inside the city, up to 7 feet," Garner said. Fire  Marshal Richard West said that more than 100 people were stranded by rising  water and had to be rescued.  </P> <P> The rain caused a rockslide that closed Arkansas 88 in Polk County.  </P> <P> Thunderstorms battered much of Texas on Sunday. Strong winds and heavy rains  knocked down trees and power lines.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lost Creek Reservoir Dam on the Trinity River tributary system  was feared near collapse after a section of the dam about half a mile wide sank  at least 20 feet.  </P></p>

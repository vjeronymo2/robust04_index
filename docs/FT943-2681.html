			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (4): Pick your City chap with care - Private-client stockbrokers / Empathy is vital, writes Anthony Bailey. Avoid any broker who doesn't ask enough questions If you are heir to even a modest fortune, you are likely to inherit a number of accessories that go with it. One part of the package could be the family broker, representing a firm which has been passed down through several generations along with the family silver. This is very convenient for those who do come into money and for whom the City of London is alien territory. If some chap there can carry on as before and provide one with a private income, why disturb the arrangement? Indeed, he may work for the private-client department of a blue-chip broking house or merchant bank. You cannot do better than that, you might think, so long as you have the required Pounds 1m or Pounds 2m minimum portfolio size. Such an understandable attitude would not win the approval of Justin Urquhart-Stewart, the energetic promoter of Barclays Stockbrokers: 'A number of events, including Big Bang, have opened up the stockbroking world. There is now considerable competition. Many high net worth people want to make use of execution-only services, perhaps having only part of their capital managed for them.' The key to finding the most suitable broker is to draw up a shopping list, he adds - advice echoed by Geoffrey Turner, of the stockbrokers' trade body Apcims (*Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers), who points out: 'We represent 95 per cent of private-client brokers, who have some 300 branches between them. Half of the branches are outside London, but they can give as good a service as those based in the City.' Empathy between you and your broker can play an important part in establishing a successful relationship, says Mr Turner. That could mean that you need to interview several brokers. Most will be prepared to have an exploratory face-to-face chat. Establishing what level of service you want, your income and growth needs, particular financial planning requirements and the level of risk that you can live with is essential. Give the cold shoulder to any broker who does not ask enough probing questions. You should also try to get an idea of investment performance, whether you want a full portfolio management service or intend to take your own decisions with advice. Many brokers run their own unit trusts. Their relative performance against the appropriate benchmark indices should give some indication of investment ability, even if you do not intend to make use of them. The quality of advice and portfolio management will depend in part on the depth of research and analysis. Ask a broker how he makes his buy and sell recommendations, and what research he has to back them up. You should also check on how many companies the firm follows. FT-SE stocks will be the bread-and-butter of most firms; but does a broker have any specialist knowledge of small, local firms or investment trusts, for example? Then consider any extra services you may need. Not all brokers deal in, for example, traded options. Yet active and more sophisticated investors will want to make use of this investment route, more so now that account trading has been curtailed by rolling settlement. Another tool to replace account trading is margin trading, where you put up only a portion of a purchase price. The rest of the money is borrowed, and you can close your position without ever putting up the full price. Again, margin trading is still a service offered by only a minority of private client brokers, though more are likely to offer it in the future. Similarly, not all brokers have the facility or expertise to deal in US or European stocks. But an increasing number of investors want access to these markets through direct equity holding rather than managed funds. Cash management facilities and control of stock through nominee accounts are other matters to sort out. Brokers are restructuring their services to cope with the five-day rolling settlement timetable due next year. Find out how any deposit account linked to your broker works, and in particular check that it promises a competitive rate of interest on any balances. When it comes to nominee accounts, you should look at the charges carefully, but find out whether you can continue to hold share certificates if you wish to. Many brokers prefer their clients to use nominees. Some insist on it. Perhaps one of the enticing aspects of becoming a well-loved client is the chance to participate in placings. This is where companies come to the market for the first time and place some of the new shares with, among others, private-client brokers. 'We keep our own list of clients who are interested in this. But placings are only available to genuine clients, and not to people who contact us because they have read we are involved in a particular issue,' says Peter Green, of Henry Cooke Lumsden. Share placings can, in any case, prove to be a mixed blessing. 'We don't do placings. By their nature they are smaller companies and higher-risk. There is always too little stock to go round if they are any good, and nobody wants the bad ones,' says David Chapman, of Capel-Cure Myers. Many new issues have risen rapidly to mouth-watering premiums, and it is an ongoing gripe that private investors have not had a fair look in. Yet many new, unknown companies have come to the market and nose-dived. The existing system is unfair, but it simply makes it more likely that the best new-comers will find their way to institutions. By all means establish whether a broker gets involved in this activity, or whether he can keep you aware of all new issues, but it should not be one of the main items on the shopping list. Finally, whether you are looking for an execution-only service or full discretionary management, get a detailed breakdown of charges. Charges may seem like little more than loose-change to the serious investor. That is precisely why brokers can get away with high fees. But competitive prices can be found without sacrificing quality of service. *Apcims publishes a free brochure, which gives details of all its members and the services they offer.

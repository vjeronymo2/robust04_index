This time the latest explosion boomed out on  Ostuzhev Street -- a homemade explosive device was planted  beneath the apartment window of Dmitriy Tsyn, director of the  "`Alternativa' Trading House" Joint-Stock Company. One man died  and three were injured as a result of the explosion.    A chance passerby died -- Sergey Plamenevskiy, a fitter from  the local Rayon Housing Administration, who was doing the rounds  of Nos. 16 and 17, Ostuzhev Street. He died from his injuries  an hour after the explosion -- at 1000 hours in the  Sklifosovskiy Emergency Hospital. The three other victims --  Dmitriy Tsyn, the presumed target of the explosion, outside  whose window the bomb went off; his bodyguard Yuriy Dukayev; and  driver Mikhail Strukov -- suffered shrapnel wounds. Only the  businessman is now fit for work.    The explosion also blew out the windows in Nos. 16 and 17.    An explosion outside the apartment of a trading house  director can hardly be regarded as commonplace -- the  investigation has not yet ascertained the motive for the crime.  Dmitriy Borisovich claims that in 34 years he has not made any  enemies, no one has threatened him, but what is most offensive  and incomprehensible is that no one had warned him, even  anonymously, about any of his actions, as criminals and  terrorists are wont to do. What is more, Tsyn admits that even  if the bandits had demanded money from him, he would not have  been able to pay up -- in 1993 the "`Alternativa' Trading House"  invested all its money in developing and setting up enterprises:  It set up two insurance companies and several branches from  Estonia to Magnitogorsk, and expects to receive the profit in a  year at the earliest. At the moment all it has is debts.    The investigation into the explosion will take two  directions  at once: A headquarters has been set up, where highly competent  specialists from the City Internal Affairs Administration will  work on several scenarios. They are not ruling out the idea  that the explosion outside the businessman's apartment was a  warning to one of his partners or apartment block neighbors, nor  are they ruling out the idea that the bandits' demands might be  made after the event, which Dmitriy Borisovich himself does not  deny. As well as the official investigation, the case of the  explosion will be tackled by the "`Alternativa' Trading House"  security service, which comprises two retired top-class  specialists -- Colonel Kotov, former head of Moscow Criminal  Investigations Department, and KGB General Ryabov -- as well as  a staff of over 50 people armed with regulation weapons issued  under City Internal Affairs Administration license. Who will be  the first to clear up the crime?</p>

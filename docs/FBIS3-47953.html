			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the </F> prime minister's official residence -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified dean of press corps] Allow me to  first ask general questions. First of all, the political reform  bills were killed today. What do you think of this?  Especially, what do you think of the fact that many members of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] voted against the  bills?    [Hosokawa] First, I regret that the four political  reform-related bills were defeated in the House of Councilors  plenary session. I truly regret it. It is very regrettable  that we could not respond to the expectations of many people.  They had hoped the reform bills would be enacted as early as  possible. But I am determined to make an all-out effort for the  enactment of the bills, since there are about 10 more days  before the end of the current Diet session. I plan to ask the  Diet to decide, in accordance with constitutional procedures,  how the reform bills should be handled from now on.  Fortunately, Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], and other LDP members have clearly stated that they  will seek to realize political reform during the current Diet  session. Thus, I hope negotiations between the LDP and the  ruling coalition will start immediately. Now, you mentioned  that some members of the SDPJ, the largest force within the  ruling coalition, voted against the bills in line with their  convictions. It is very regrettable, but I believe the party  will continue to give full support to the ruling coalition. I  strongly expect the party to do so.    [Dean of press corps] There seem to be big gaps between the  government-proposed reform package and the reform plan put  forward by the LDP. Does the government plan to make great  concessions in negotiations with the LDP? Taking this stand,  will the government negotiate with the LDP in accordance with  constitutional provisions?    [Hosokawa] I am not quite sure how the negotiations will be  promoted. I am not sure whether both sides will negotiate at a  meeting of the conference committee of both houses. At any  rate, this is basically a matter of Diet procedures and the  lower house's choice. The government will have thorough  discussions with the ruling parties.    [Dean of press corps] You said earlier you will ask the  ruling parties to discuss the issue with the LDP in an attempt  to have the bills passed during the current Diet session. I  want to ask again how you will take your responsibility if you  fail to have the bills passed during the current session, and I  also want to ask if you have the possible dissolution of the  House of Representatives or the resignation of the cabinet en  masse in your mind?    [Hosokawa] Let me answer the latter question. I am not  thinking about it. There are some days remaining. My biggest  task now is to do my best to have the bills passed.    [Dean of press corps] Now, other reporters can ask  questions.    [Unidentified reporter] The opposition camp points out that  in a series of Diet deliberations, the ruling coalition's way of  managing the Diet has been high-handed. Mr. Prime Minister, in  your view, do you think the ruling coalition should conduct  self-examination about some aspects of its management of the  Diet?    [Hosokawa] Since the bills have been sent to the House of  Councilors, about 70 days have passed and nearly 70 hours were  spent on discussions. In view of this fact, I naturally think  the Diet has been managed properly in accordance with  parliamentary rules. My view is that the ruling parties'  management of the Diet was not heavy-handed. I feel the ruling  parties have respected the rules of Diet management as much as  possible in managing the Diet.    [Unidentified reporter] You said earlier you will study  possible negotiations with the LDP after seeing through moves  within the ruling parties. In fact, a general view is that it  is impossible to have the bills passed without the cooperation  of the LDP either at the conference committee of both houses or  at the House of Representatives. Basically, when negotiating  with the LDP, do you intend to take a stand of making further  concessions?    [Hosokawa] Well, I have no idea. But since the bills were  rejected, I think the room for compromise has widened more than  before.    [Unidentified reporter] I want to ask questions about this  point. You have said discussions will be held at the conference  committees of both houses, which means talks among  representatives from each party or group. But are you  considering holding a summit meeting with LDP President Kono  immediately -- which, incidentally, I heard has been canceled --  before or after the discussions of the conference committees of  both houses?    [Hosokawa] I have been saying it is a good idea to hold the  meeting if the time is ripe, and my position is unchanged. But  I need to see how discussions between the ruling parties and the  opposition parties will develop. If the situation requires, in  the process of the discussions, I will be willing to hold a  summit meeting.    [Unidentified reporter] There are many remaining  proposals, such as budget compilation and the issue of income  tax reduction, which have to be discussed. Are you going to  change the Diet schedule because the final decision on political  reform will not be made until next week?    [Hosokawa] Well, the government, with the Economic Planning  Agency at the center, is trying to draw up economic measures as  soon as possible. We will start work on the third supplementary  budget as soon as we finish forming the economic measures.  However, we need to incorporate the economic measures in a  budget. Moreover, some days will be needed for printing the  budget. We will try to form the supplementary budget by  shortening these processes as much as we can. We will continue  our process of forming the 1994 budget. My feeling has not  changed at all. I feel that we need to introduce economic  measures as soon as possible in order to avoid creating  apprehension about the current economic situation. There are  many difficult issues, as you have pointed out. However, the  government, regardless of the circumstances, will try to shorten  the process as much as possible. I am sure we can shorten some  clerical work.    [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask you again about  your political responsibility. You explained earlier, in  response to a question regarding the possibility of dissolving  the lower house in case discussions with the Liberal Democratic  Party end up in failure, that you were not thinking about  dissolution. Then, what kind of responsibility are you going to  take should the discussions end in failure?    [Hosokawa] As I have said earlier, my task is to do my best  during the remaining Diet session. We have more than 10 days  left. I know I am repeating what I said earlier, but this is  what I feel now.    [Unidentified reporter] When you became prime minister, you  said you would take political responsibility should political  reform not be realized before the end of the year [1993]. Now,  you are saying you will realize it during the current Diet  session. What are you going to do if you cannot do it before  the end of the current Diet session?    [Hosokawa] We still have more than 10 days left before the  current Diet session ends. I am saying that I will do my best  during this period.    [Unidentified reporter] You have been trying to pass the  four bills all at the same time. But, could you not separate  the bill on prevention of political corruption from the other  bills, and approve it first?    [Hosokawa] I do not think so. It is not a good idea to  separate the bills. The LDP has been saying that too. Measures  regarding prevention of political corruption are incorporated in  the four bills. For example, the issues of transparency  regarding relations between politics and money, and  strengthening penal regulations are included in the bills.  Moreover, I believe these measures will become effective when  the political and electoral system reform bills are approved.  Therefore, I do not think it is a good idea to separate the  bills. This has been my fundamental stance and it has not  changed.    [Unidentified reporter] The bills were not approved because  some members of the Social Democratic Party voted against the  bills. Do you think this will change or have some impacts on the  coalition government?    [Hosokawa] I cannot say anything at this moment. I have to  wait a little while. I hope what you have said will not happen.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Police raid HK group MORE THAN 100 companies connected with the Allied group of Mr Lee Ming-tee, a Malaysian-born entrepreneur, were raided by Hong Kong's Commercial Crimes Bureau yesterday. The affair has become the colony's most significant corporate crime investigation since the Carrian group collapse in 1983, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. A government-appointed inspector recently completed a report on five listed companies connected with Allied, and part of this document is likely to be made public within a week. There has been no explanation, however, for the involvement of the police. Allied said it was 'surprised that this action should be taken after 13 months of investigation during which the group has co-operated fully with the Inspector who, with his team, had an office in Allied's building for 10 months'.</p>

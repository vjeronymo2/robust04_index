			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (9): The results start to show / Profile of Sabic's expansion Seldom can a company have undertaken so ambitious an expansion project into the teeth of so unpromising a market as Sabic, the kingdom's vast industrial holding group. By the end of 1995, according to Mr Ibrahim bin Salamah, Sabic's vice-chairman and managing director, the 70 per cent state-owned group will have raised around Dollars 4bn to finance expansion projects at 12 of its 18 subsidiaries or affiliates, aimed at raising total output to 20m tonnes a year from just over 12m tonnes at the start of the decade. It is an expansion central to Saudi Arabia's industrial planning. The Sabic group's family of companies and joint ventures represents the kingdom's biggest non-oil industrial enterprise, employing 11,000 people. Since its creation in 1976, it has been the predominant force behind the country's development of its gas-based petrochemicals potential. At the same time, however, the world recession has considerably softened world prices of petrochemicals - Sabic's core market - with resulting damage to the group's profits. Earlier this year, the group reported a 14 per cent fall in 1992 earnings to Dollars 523m despite a 20 per cent rise in output to 15.7m tonnes. Profits for 1991 had, in turn, been 24 per cent down on the preceding year. But there are tentative signs that the sheer scale of Sabic's expansion, combined with the tremendous luxury of cheap gas feedstock it enjoys, is turning the results around. Although Mr Salamah says profits for the first nine months of 1993 remain 6 per cent down on the same period last year, earnings in the third quarter were 10 per cent up on the same three months last year. 'You can't say it's an improvement in prices,' he says. 'But we now have more production coming on stream which, combined with our effort to cut costs, is showing some results.' He says the group has kept costs level over 1993 so far through efforts to reduce bottlenecks at plants, cut inventories, improve transport and storage efficiency and trim marketing costs. However, the group's chief cost advantage in a weak world market is the fact that it purchases its feedstock gases from Saudi Aramco, the state oil producer and refiner, at a guaranteed 30 per cent below the price of any competing supplier. But Mr Salamah says that this apparent subsidy is less than it appears, arguing that Sabic buys the gas direct from Aramco's gas-oil separation plants and makes up much of the 30 per cent discount through having to supply all costs of transport and refrigeration. 'The price is basically a netback cost from the separation plants, not really a discount as such,' he says. By the end of this year, he says, total output of Sabic's mix of chemicals, plastics, fertilisers, steel and gases will exceed 17m tonnes - around two-thirds of which will be exported. 'The important thing is to maintain our market share,' he says - which is currently about 6 per cent of the world petrochemical market. Of the 12 expansion projects, five are complete, four are between 80-97 per cent finished and three are just getting under way. By Sabic's own reckoning, just three projects are behind schedule. Among the completed projects, Petrokemya, a wholly-owned affiliate, has completed expansion of a new olefins plant boosting capacity to 1.8m tonnes a year from 830,000 t/y. The new flexible feedstock cracker adds 300,000 t/y of propylene output, 100,000 t/y of butadiene and 70,000 t/y of benzine output, while raising ethylene capacity by 500,000 t/y to 1.15m t/y. Propylene from Petrokemya will in turn feed Ibn Zahr, the country's first polypropylene plant and another Sabic affiliate, which is slightly behind a target of opening production of 200,000 t/y by the year's end, mostly to feed local industries and the Gulf. This will see Sabic producing five basic thermoplastic resins, complementing output of linear low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride. Elsewhere, Hadeed, Sabic's steel subsidiary, has completed expansion to 2.2m t/y capacity from 1.6m t/y, Safco has also finished a new fertiliser complex at Jubail to boost capacity in ammonia and urea, while Sharq has doubled ethylene glycol capacity to 660,000 t/y and has nearly completed work to boost polyethylene output. Gas, Sabic's air separation affiliate, has additionally doubled nitrogen and oxygen output to feed other Sabic industries to 490,000 t/y and 876,000 t/y respectively. Ibn Hayyan, the majority-held plastics group, is in the early stages of building a PVC paste plant which is due to come on stream in the last quarter of next year, while work will begin in two to three months on a new polyester plant for AIFC, the Sabic subsidiary at Yanbu. The main expansion projects will be completed with an ethyl-hexanol plant in the early stages of engineering at Samad, a 50-50 joint venture between Sabic and Taiwan Fertiliser at Jubail. Both are set to begin production by early 1996 at the latest. Sabic is also on the verge of becoming one of the world's biggest producers of methyl tertiary butyl ethers, the petrol additive which cuts carbon pollutants while increasing octane. With the completion of new plants at Ibn Zahr and Ibn Sina, both in the industrial city of Jubail, Mr Salamah estimates Sabic will be producing 2.8m to 3m tonnes of MTBE a year by 1997. In addition to this, Sabic has also recently consolidated its research and development into a single new research centre in Riyadh as part of a concerted effort to rationalise the group's cost base. Mr Salamah estimates Sabic's annual R&amp;D budget at SR400m annually.</p>

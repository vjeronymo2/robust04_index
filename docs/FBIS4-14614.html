			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 31 March (TASS) -- The Iranian C-130 military  cargo plane which crashed over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-  Karabakh was shot down by two missiles, Iranian senior official  said.    Agai Aminiyan, head of the team of Iranian experts  investigating the accident, said at a meeting with Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on Thursday that the plane which  was flying from Moscow to Tehran did not have any serious  technical flaws which could have caused a crash. It remains  unclear so far why the plane diverted from the route.    Because the planes of this type do not have black boxes, the  cause may be identified only after deciphering the tapes with  recordings of the negotiations between the crew and air  controllers. Iranian experts have already been handed over the  tapes by Yerevan and Tbilisi and are now seeking to receive  recordings from Azerbaijan.    The Armenian side has not assumed direct responsibility for  the accident, Aminiyan said. However, it has admitted that its  troops had taken the Iranian plane for an Azerbaijani craft.  This can serve as indirect proof that it could have been shot  down by Armenian troops. Additionally, the Armenian troops do  not deny that they did not try to get in touch with the plane in  order to identify it.    Aliyev confirmed his readiness to provide the Iranian  commission with every possible assistance in carrying out the  investigation.</p>

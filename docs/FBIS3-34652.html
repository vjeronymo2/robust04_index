			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 11 (AFP) --  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, a former chief Palestinian negotiator,  said Friday [11 February] the Israeli-PLO security accord signed  in Cairo did not cover issues essential to achieving a just  peace in the Middle East.    "This is an accord on issues which are unimportant in  relation to the ultimate goal of achieving a just peace," the  former chief Palestinian negotiator at the Washington peace  talks told AFP.    "The key issue to be resolved, which may lead to a just  peace, is that of ending the (Israeli) settlements in Jerusalem  and the rest of the occupied territories," he said.    'Abd-al-Shafi earlier told the Arabic daily Al-Quds:  "Palestine existed before this agreement, and will exist after  it, but the accord will not allow Palestine ever to appear on  the map of the Middle East."    He was commenting on PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's statement  after signing the accord that the name of Palestine had returned  to the map of the Middle East.    Meanwhile Sufyan Abu-Zayda, a representative of 'Arafat's  Fatah movement in the occupied Gaza Strip, told AFP the accord  "only deals with a tiny part of our demands, and will not last  long if the occupation and settlements remain."    The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, which is opposed to  the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal signed in Washington on September  13, said the Cairo security agreement was "worthless," and  "fulfils Israeli conditions."    "The settlements will remain a breeding ground for  provocation and tension, and will allow Israel to justify its  persecution of the Palestinians," said HAMAS official Khalid  al-Hindi.</p>

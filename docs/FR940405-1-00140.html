The comment stated that the Diffey and Robson method has been used as the basis for ``quantifying'' UVA protection expressed as ``stars'' on the package labeling of some sunscreen products sold in Europe (Ref. 16). Without using an action spectrum such as the CIE UV Hazard Spectrum or the erythemal efficacy spectrum for weighting, the ``star'' method considers all UVA wavelengths as having the same erythemal effectiveness. The ``star'' value results from an unweighted ratio of the UVA absorbance to the UVB absorbance of the product. Therefore, the comment maintained that a low SPF product with a flat absorbance spectrum could get four ``stars'' (i.e., the highest rating), while a higher SPF product would get fewer ``stars'' because the higher SPF product would absorb disproportionately higher levels of UVB, similar to the action spectrum for erythema. The comment stated that the ``star'' concept is in direct contrast to the accepted concept of formulating sunscreen drug products to provide the most protection in the most damaging portion of the UV spectrum. The comment contended that the ``star'' method is misleading to consumers and added that the use of the ``star'' method in England has been criticized by dermatologists, who have asked that the system be withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment recommended that the agency adopt the current Standards Association of Australia (SAS) UVA (broad spectrum) test method AS&hyph;2406 as an objective measure of UVA blocking (Ref. 17). This method measures the percent transmission of the test sunscreen drug product between 320 and 360 nm. If an 8-micrometer layer of appropriately dissolved sunscreen product does not transmit more than 10 percent of UV radiation at any wavelength from 320 to 360 nm inclusive, the product may be considered as providing broad spectrum protection. The comment contended that this method has a number of advantages. UV protection claims are most appropriately substantiated by measuring the blocking of UV directly rather than measuring some consequence of UVA exposure. Thin film spectrophotometric evaluation of sunscreen drug products has reached a level of technical proficiency to permit instrumental evaluation of UVA blocking potential. Adopting an already accepted standard protocol will enhance the ability of the United States sunscreen industry to compete equally in foreign markets. This test will substantially reduce testing costs. No human subjects are used. The comment added that this method provides a strict criterion that serves to identify only the most effective UVA blockers. The comment submitted several UVA scans to demonstrate that the SAS method differentiates between the ``poorly effective'' oxybenzone-containing sunscreens and an assortment of products containing ``excellent'' UVA blockers, e.g., titanium dioxide and avobenzone (Parsol 1789) (Ref. 17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments contended that there are several deficiencies in the SAS method. The results are not correlated to a clinical SPF test. Numerous studies have shown that solution and thin-film spectra are not relevant to actual product performance on skin. The performance of the sunscreen is evaluated only in the limited range of 320 to 360 nm, rather than throughout the entire UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments recommended that the agency not adopt in vitro methods that rely on measuring the transmission of UVA radiation through either epidermis or a UV-transparent skin cast (Refs. 18 and 19). The comments contended that these methods are inappropriate because they use nonsolar UVA radiation sources and limited range UVA detectors or detectors without an appropriately weighted response. The comments stated that these limitations would cause the results to be nonrelevant to the actual responses of normal skin to full-spectrum natural sunlight. The comments mentioned that one method (Ref. 19) contains a small but significant contamination by UVB energy below 320 nm that would adversely affect the resulting efficacy values and lead to erroneous measures of UVA efficacy. The comments stated that the other method (Ref. 18) skews results toward the longer UVA wavelengths because of the lamp's deficiencies in the shorter, energy-rich UVA. The comments added that this skewing causes an overestimation of the protection of some products, making those with ingredients that are long wavelength absorbers (such as avobenzone) look unrealistically effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment concluded that a rigorous and foolproof in vitro test method has not been established or validated. The comment submitted two scientific publications that discuss some of the difficulties associated with in vitro sunscreen testing techniques (Refs. 15 and 20). The comment argued that none of the current in vitro methods adequately evaluate the photostability of sunscreens. It further stated that a validated in vivo human UVA test method must first be established. Then, future in vitro test methods can be tested and validated against this standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

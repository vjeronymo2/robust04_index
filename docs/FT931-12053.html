			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: US economy It is hard to escape the conclusion that the US economy is on the mend. Even allowing that durable goods orders are among the most volatile economic indicators, yesterday's unusually strong data looks like the genuine article. The recovery in orders was well spread throughout the economy. That was enough to propel the dollar higher. The worry is that recent labour market indicators have been ominously weak. If the behaviour of money-market interest rates is anything to go by, the market no longer seriously believes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress this week contained clear overtures to the Clinton administration. Higher interest rates would put that budding relationship at risk. Equally, the recent spate of strong economic figures makes another cut less likely to the markets. Such a move would, incidentally, undermine the main argument for buying the dollar: that the interest rate differential between the US and Germany is set to narrow. Yesterday's dollar rally owed much to relief that the bull case remains dominant. An economic recovery without higher employment, though, would be a pyrrhic victory for President Clinton. A weak labour market might undermine the improvement in consumer confidence required to sustain recovery. The market may be getting ahead of itself in ruling out another cut in US rates. The Fed could still make such a gesture in return for a deal on the budget deficit and next week's employment figures could weigh heavily on the dollar.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Botha set to offer new policy package MR Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, is expected to set out a package of measures designed to curb political violence and break the stalemate in constitutional talks when he addresses an emergency session of the United Nations security council tonight. He will be among leading South African politicians, including Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha Freedom party, to address the session, which opens today. Mr Botha is expected to elaborate on President F W de Klerk's recent suggestion that international observers might have a role to play in efforts to curb the violence that led to last month's ANC withdrawal from constitutional talks. The government is not expected to oppose Mr Mandela's call for a UN representative to make a fact-finding visit to South Africa. But it is likely to resist his suggestion that such a visit should be followed by despatch of a UN mission to monitor violence, drawing a distinction between a small group of observers and a large, more active UN force. On the eve of the UN meeting, Mr de Klerk announced steps to meet some of the ANC demands for resuming democracy talks. He promised to disband controversial security force units which the ANC accuses of fomenting violence. Both sides have stressed the significance of the UN occasion, but from different perspectives. Government officials pointed out that what was once inconceivable has been made possible overnight: leaders of homelands and black minority parties have been given a platform at the UN. Their presence will be used to underline Pretoria's argument that a post-apartheid constitution must reflect the concerns and interests of black as well as white voters concerned about minority rights. For its part the ANC sees today's proceedings as an important step towards direct international involvement in the South African crisis. Meanwhile, efforts to avert industrial disruption continued as the South African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour (Saccola), a body representing big employers, distanced itself from reports claiming it had lent its weight to key ANC demands, including the need for early moves towards an interim government and elections for a constitution-making body. The reports come amid efforts by Saccola and Cosatu, the trade union grouping, to reach an agreement to head off next month's general strike. Mr Bokkie Botha, Saccola chairman, said speculation about talks had created 'dangerously wrong impressions'. Editorial comment, Page 24</p>

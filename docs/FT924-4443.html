			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Allied-Lyons increases profits by 2.5% to Pounds 283m in first half ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, weathered depressed trading conditions worldwide to raise first-half pre-tax profits 2.5 per cent to Pounds 283m. The result - broadly in line with market expectations - was achieved while the group was refocusing on its core businesses. Capital investment and marketing expenditure were increased to Pounds 326m 'to ensure long-term competitive strength', said Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman. Earnings per share declined from 19.1p to 18.5p, mainly because of an increase in profits attributable to minority interests. The interim dividend is up 4.5 per cent to 6.95p (6.65p). Group trading profit during the six months to September 19 fell from Pounds 379m to Pounds 372m on turnover reduced 2.9 per cent to Pounds 2.57bn (Pounds 2.65bn). Translation of foreign currency trading profits had an adverse impact of Pounds 7m; but the second half is expected to show compensating gains. Hiram Walker, the spirits and wine division, was the group's mainstay, raising trading profits 1.7 per cent to Pounds 175m. Overall volume was ahead and the five leading brands - Ballantine's, Courvoisier, Beefeater, Canadian Club and Kahlua - which contribute nearly half of profits, gained share in many markets. Overheads were cut, particularly in the US and UK, and staff employed in continuing operations was reduced by more than 600. Profit per employee is now 9 per cent higher than a year ago. Retailing profits were unchanged at Pounds 118m in spite of the disposal of 500 pubs. Victoria Wine increased turnover 7 per cent; Dunkin Donuts sales rose 11 per cent with 300 additional outlets in the US and rapid growth in South America. Baskins-Robbins' US performance was affected by the weather but expansion continued in Thailand, Chile, Venezuela, Greece and Sweden. Brewing and wholesaling profits were 6.3 per cent lower at Pounds 45m because of a Pounds 4m increase in bad debt provisions. Beer volumes and market share improved 1 per cent against a similar overall industry decline. Major brands performed well: Tetley bitter volumes increased 8 per cent, and Castlemaine and Skol gained 4 per cent. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 42</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Interest rates may fall, Madrid suggests THE Spanish government has hinted that official interest rates in the country may fall in the next few days following the reduction in German interest rates last week. Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said at the weekend that while it was up to the Bank of Spain to decide whether to trim its official intervention rate from 13.25 per cent this week, sharp falls in Spanish interbank rates after the German cuts meant the market was already discounting a Spanish cut. The government, under pressure in this election year to stimulate an economic recovery, would welcome any help from the Bank of Spain. Mr Solchaga announced at the weekend that the economy had grown just 1.2 per cent last year. The minister believes that, at best, gross domestic product will grow 1 per cent in 1993. He said unemployment had risen from 16.3 per cent to 18.2 per cent last year, badly missing the target in Spain's plan to converge its economy with leading countries of the European Community. The plan had aimed at GDP growth of 3 per cent for 1992. Despite sniping from political critics, however, the government believes it has a real chance of ending this year with a recovery under way.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Fears for links with Paris THE French government yesterday condemned the assassination amid concern that Mr Boudiaf's death could herald another period of uncertainty in France's traditionally troubled relationship with its former colony. Mr Pierre Mazeaud, acting speaker, interrupted a session of the National Assembly to announce the news. Politicians from left and right voiced concern. Algeria's political stability is crucial for France, not only because of close trading and financial links but also because of the implications of Algerian events for the 1.5m north African immigrants in France. This issue is sensitive given the strength of the right-wing National Front under Mr Jean Marie Le Pen.</p>

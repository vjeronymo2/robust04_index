			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY ISRAEL NEEDS THOSE MISSILES  </P> <P> A paradox: An economically ailing Soviet Union moves to drastically cut its aid  to clients around the world. Syria, a major recipient of that bounty and a  fierce proponent of the Arab hard line, is shaken by word from Moscow that it  had better forget about trying to achieve strategic parity with Israel. All  this seems to indicate an easing of the military threat Israel faces. Suddenly,  though, the Pentagon reveals that it plans to transfer an advanced anti-missile  system to Israel on an emergency basis. Why? Because even as the Cold War  withers away, a significant new threat to the Middle East's fragile military  balance has emerged.  </P> <P> The portents came late in the Iran-Iraq war, when the two belligerents launched  deadly ballistic missile attacks against each other's civilian populations. The  vulnerability of cities was brutally demonstrated. Since then, both countries  have pushed missile acquisition, with Iraq bragging that it has developed its  own 1,250-mile-range weapon. Syria, Iraq's bitter ideological foe, has  stockpiled Soviet-supplied missiles and is getting help from China and North  Korea to improve their range and accuracy. Egypt and Libya have  ground-to-ground missiles; so does Saudi Arabia. Israel has test-fired its own  930-mile-range weapon.  </P> <P> The result is that the Middle East is suddenly bristling with weapons able to  carry high-explosive, chemical or even nuclear warheads. Because so many  countries are now involved in the transfer of ballistic missile technology --  France, West Germany, Brazil and Argentina are among them -- the superpowers  have only limited ability to restrain further proliferation.  </P> <P> The justifiable U.S. decision to supply Israel with the anti-missile Patriot  system and related early-warning satellite information on an urgent basis  indicates how seriously the threat to an ally is being assessed. The strategic  threat, though, isn't limited to Israel alone. It now hovers over the entire  region, fueling tensions and raising the risks of fresh conflict.  </P></p>

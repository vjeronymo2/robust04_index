			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LEWIS-JOHNSON REMATCH POSSIBLE  </P> <P> Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson may face each other in a $1-million, 100-meter race  after Johnson's ban for steroid use expires in September of 1990, Lewis'  manager today.  </P> <P> Joe Douglas said there were many sponsors and television companies ready to put  up the money, but declined to name them.  </P> <P> "Carl is ready to race if the (money) package is right," Douglas said in West  Berlin, where Lewis was competing in a Mobil Grand Prix track and field meet  today.  </P> <P> He said Lewis wanted $1 million to compete, while Johnson probably would get  less. Another condition, Douglas said, was that Johnson submit to doping tests  every week of the final three months of his suspension, which expires Sept. 27,  1990.  </P> <P> Johnson was banned for two years after testing positive for steroids at the  1988 Olympics. He was stripped of his gold medal and the world record of 9.79  seconds.  </P></p>

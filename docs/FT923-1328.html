			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / BAe to retain corporate jet division BRITISH Aerospace yesterday announced it would retain its corporate jet business, reversing an earlier decision to sell a majority stake in this profitable sector. The move came on the eve of the company's announcement of its interim results. The company apparently failed to secure a sufficiently attractive offer for this business. The City expects the company will report a trading loss of between Pounds 20m to Pounds 40m. In addition, it could write-off as much as Pounds 750m on various problem areas, mainly its regional aircraft operations. Investors are also braced for a possible dividend cut. The company is also expected to sign a preliminary agreement with Taiwan Aerospace on a joint venture on the future of its loss-making regional aircraft business. Mr John Cahill, BAe's new chairman, is also due to unveil a radical restructuring as part of the company's recovery strategy. BAe's announcement that it would maintain control of corporate jet activities was timed to coincided with the start of the Dallas business aircraft trade show. BAe said last May it was transferring its corporate jet business into a new company called Corporate Jets with a view to selling a majority stake in this activity. However, it said yesterday that, after reviewing several proposals, it had decided it was in the best interests of shareholders, customers and employees to retain the business. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said yesterday he was pleased uncertainty surrounding this activity had been lifted and 'we can now concentrate . . on further improving our leading position in the market place'. BAe manufactures the 125-800 medium-sized twin-engined corporate jet and a longer-range BAe 1000 at Chester with sales, design and engineering support at Hatfield. City analysts estimated the corporate jet business to be worth around Pounds 200m. Beech Aircraft, the business aircraft subsidiary of Raytheon of the US, was understood to have been interested in acquiring BAe's corporate business. Dassault of France and Bombardier of Canada indicated this month they were not interested. Although the business continues to make money, BAe originally decided to sell a controlling stake because of the substantial costs and risks of developing future products.</p>

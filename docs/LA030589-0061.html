			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOARD APPROVES STORM DRAIN WORK TO PREVENT ANOTHER SLIDE IN MALIBU  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which in January agreed to a  $35-million payment to Big Rock Mesa homeowners, has tentatively approved an  elaborate storm drain project designed to prevent a repeat of the landslide  that damaged or destroyed 250 homes in the Malibu neighborhood in 1983.  </P> <P> But the board's approval of an environmental study for the project prompted an  angry reaction from some of the homeowners in the area, who complained that the  county has provided no estimate of the cost of the drainage work. The residents  will have to pay for the project.  </P> <P> "This is as if you go to a store and buy something, and after you buy it, the  storekeeper tells you how much it costs. It's looney," said screenwriter Kurt  Villadsen, a longtime Mesa homeowner.  </P> <P> "We don't know if it will cost $1,000 per home or $50,000," said Ken Chiate, an  attorney who lives in the Big Rock Mesa area and who represented the homeowners  in the recently settled lawsuit against the county and state. "It's a  reflection of ineptness of the highest magnitude for them to be this far along  and not know the cost."  </P> <P> County officials say they have no reliable cost figures because the area's  shifting geology could dramatically alter the price tag between now and the end  of the year, when the Department of Public Works expects to present a financing  plan to the supervisors.  </P> <P> "We don't have a cost figure. It's a developing proposal," said Roger Burger, a  deputy director of public works. He said that when a good estimate is  calculated, probably in three or four months, property owners will be notified.  "We absolutely expect to keep them fully informed."  </P> <P> Burger also noted that the county is not yet certain which property owners will  benefit from the project and be billed for it. Even some of the 30 homes  condemned after the 1983 slide could be assessed.  </P> <P> "That's one of the things we have under study. . . . If the landslide is  stabilized then that becomes a buildable lot," Burger said.  </P> <P> Newsletters about Big Rock landslide problems have been sent to 550 Mesa-area  addresses, he said.  </P> <P> Supervisors approved the environmental report last week so the county could  apply to state agencies such as Caltrans and the Coastal Commission for permits  required for construction, Burger said.  </P> <P> The public works department created a furor last fall when its early estimate  of per-home costs for a Malibu sewer system more than doubled in two months.  Big Rock Mesa is in the new sewer district, and homeowners already have been  assessed $9,999 for that project.  </P> <P> Chiate said it is outrageous that the county would tentatively approve the  storm drain project without an estimate of its cost.  </P> <P> Since homeowners filed their lawsuit against the county in 1984, claiming that  it had allowed construction that caused the landslide, "the county has refused  to tell us what they're doing. Now we don't have any idea what they're doing.  There has to be somebody who responds to homeowner inquiries."  </P> <P> Burger said the county has kept property owners informed through a series of  newsletters about the landslide. One sent in October mentioned the current  project, reporting that: "Plans for permanent surface drainage improvements are  close to being finalized." The newsletter estimated that construction would  begin this summer.  </P> <P> County officials have already begun negotiations with property owners for  easements where storm drains will be built, offering $2,000 per easement,  Chiate said.  </P> <P> The new project consists of 10 catch basins and 7,000 feet of polyethylene pipe  that would run across the mesa and in ravines and other natural runoff channels  to Pacific Coast Highway, where a collection system will be installed. It may  include new equipment to monitor landslides.  </P> <P> The project also will place into underground vaults 18 wells that pump water  from the water table.  </P> <P> Those wells have been installed by the county under the aegis of a community  improvement district, which homeowners helped form in 1983, after the slide.  Since then, the county has spent nearly $4 million to pump millions of gallons  of water from the ground and to monitor the continuing slippage of the mesa.  </P> <P> That amount eventually will have to be repaid by homeowners in the improvement  district.  </P> <P> Chiate said homeowners, although hoping to gain local control over the  improvement district, plan to cooperate with the county on the storm drain  project.  </P> <P> "If the county does what is reasonable and prudent, the homeowners are not  going to object," he said. "It's their homes that are being saved."  </P></p>

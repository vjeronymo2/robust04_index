			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (j) The maximum filter penetration for each of the 30 filters shall be determined and recorded. The mean maximum penetration, m, and the standard deviation, s, shall be calculated. The particulate respirator filter shall be considered as meeting the requirement of this Subpart if the test static U meets the following condition: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> U=m+2.22s&gt;0.0003 type A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U=m+2.22s&gt;0.01 type B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U=m+2.22s&gt;0.05 type C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.185  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Powered, particulate respirator flow requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Powered, air-purifying respirators shall be classified as tight-fitting or loose-fitting depending on their design. Tight-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirators shall be designed to seal to the wearer's face and shall provide protection as a non-powered respirator in the event of a blower failure. Loose-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirators shall be designed to function without reliance on a tight-fitting faceseal. The minimum airflow requirements for each class is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Tight-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirators shall maintain an airflow rate of at least 115 liters (4.06 cubic feet) per minute for a period of at least 4 hours unless otherwise specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Loose-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirators shall maintain an airflow rate of at least 170 liters (6.0 cubic feet) per minute for a period of at least 4 hours unless otherwise specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Powered, air-purifying respirators shall be provided with an acceptable mechanism and appropriate instructions whereby the user can routinely and simply determine that the minimum airflow is maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.186  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Exhalation valve leakage test; minimum requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Dry exhalation valves and valve seats will be subjected to a suction of 25 mm. water-column height while in a normal operating position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Leakage between the valve and valve seat shall not exceed 30 milliliters per minute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart L_Chemical Cartridge Respirators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.190  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Chemical cartridge respirators: description. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Chemical cartridge respirators including all completely assembled respirators which are designed for use as respiratory protection during entry into or escape from atmospheres not immediately dangerous to life and health, are described according to the specific gases or vapors against which they are designed to provide respiratory protection, as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

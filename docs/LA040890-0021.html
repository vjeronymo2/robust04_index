			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITALISTIC BEHAVIOR: IS IT AN EXERCISE IN GREED OR BRILLIANCE?  </P> <P> Re Russell Dvonch's March 18 letter: Dvonch's hymn to capitalism would have  been touching if it hadn't been so stupid. So "wealth . . . is not taken, by  anybody from anybody.  </P> <P> It is created. . . ." Perhaps he should explain that to the victims of the  Lincoln S&amp;L scandal who lost their life savings while Charles H. Keating  Jr. paid himself and family members $34 million. And the people who lost their  jobs when their companies were taken over by leveraged-buyout raiders. Or the  shareholders of those companies whose dividends now go toward servicing massive  debts. Or, for that matter, to the middle class being taxed to death so that  the rich can pay less.  </P> <P> Get real, Mr. Dvonch! For a start, read the daily Times instead of just the  Sunday Calendar. It'll show you a whole new world.  </P> <P> CAROL SIMOES  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

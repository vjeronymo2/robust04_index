			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / EC ministers near breakthrough on budget deadlock THERE WERE signs yesterday that the deadlock over the European Community budget could be broken as most EC governments appeared ready to accept a compromise to spread revenue increases over a longer period than envisaged by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Mr Delors' original plan - unveiled in February and criticised by some for demanding too much at a time of fiscal restraint - was to raise Community revenue progressively from next year from its current ceiling of 1.2 per cent of Community gross national product to 1.37 per cent by 1997. 'I am not changing the Commission proposal,' Mr Delors said. But he told foreign ministers at their meeting in Luxembourg that, for the next two years at least, his plan to raise spending by a third over the period up to 1997 could be accommodated within the current 1.2 per cent ceiling because forecast expenditure is below the ceiling. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, forecast that next week's Lisbon summit would not produce 'conclusions, but rather guidelines' that would allow Britain - which assumes the EC presidency on July 1 - to get a budgetary deal by the end of the year. Ministers from France and Belgium, among others, seized on Mr Delors' apparent flexibility as a good compromise, arguing it could satisfy those like the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, which want to avoid paying more into Community coffers at a time of fiscal constraint at home. They felt it could also placate members such as Spain and Ireland which want more aid from Brussels. The question of financial support from Brussels is expected to play a part in the referendum vote in Ireland on Thursday. Mr David Andrews, Ireland's foreign minister, said his partners had all shown themselves aware of Ireland's delicate position on the eve of its referendum on the political and monetary union treaty. His French counterpart, Mr Roland Dumas, said Ireland could expect 'a significant contribution' from the new special cohesion fund. However, Spain and the UK, at opposite ends of the spectrum, yesterday maintained their tough positions, with Madrid warning against watering down the original Delors plan. Mr Hurd, while not addressing the question of revenue, nevertheless said the Commission plan for a 5 per cent real annual increase in spending was unacceptable in view of budgetary contraints facing governments at home. 'The kind of financial rigour, which used to be associated with Britain alone, has now spread,' he said. The Portuguese presidency has suggested rejigging the original budget plan on the spending side. It would pay for a doubling of cohesion aid to the EC's four poorest members by trimming the rate of increased spending elsewhere. The most concrete decision likely to come out of the Lisbon summit later this month will be the renomination of Mr Delors to a further two-year term as Commission president. Only Britain, where Mr Delors is under fire within the governing Conservative party, appears still to be reserving its position on Mr Delors. Mr Hurd said yesterday that 'no assurances have been given, nor decisions taken'. In London, Mr John Major made clear that he saw little option but to accept the re-appointment for two years of Mr Delors - a move likely to infuriate the party's Euro-sceptics. Mr Major, meanwhile, began to reassert his authority over the Conservative party by warning potential rebels against the Maastricht Treaty that Britain's influence would be undermined if it sought to wreck the accord. Speaking at an informal lunch in Downing Street, the prime minister told about 30 Tory MPs that he was dismayed by the divisions which have opened in the party since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht accord. After talks with his senior ministers, he confirmed that British legislation to ratify the accords on political and economic union will be delayed until Denmark has made its position clearer.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Kanemaru likely to resign from LDP JAPAN'S most powerful politician, Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), last night said he would resign from the party and the parliament in response to public outrage over his violation of political funding laws. But the suggestion of resignation was characteristically Kanemaru. Even Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was puzzled by the intentions of the 'godfather' and the Japanese public wondered whether the resignation would be permanent or merely one more strategic turn by a master strategist. Mr Kanemaru, 78, was said by colleagues to be planning a formal announcement today, but senior members of his faction, the largest in the LDP, were already brawling over their share of his power, which is considerable. The faction has the final say on most important matters of policy and personnel. From early yesterday, Mr Kanemaru received officials from his faction, some of whom said he had decided to retire, while others suggested he had yet to make a final decision. Mr Miyazawa, who owes his position to the machinations of Mr Kanemaru, appeared confused by the day's events, and heard second-hand of his intentions. The controversy began in late August, when Mr Kanemaru announced that he had received Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Even though the amount clearly exceeded the Y1.5m limit on funds a politician can receive from one company, Mr Kanemaru apparently believed he would not be pursued by prosecutors. Having created a controversy, Mr Kanemaru retired to his Tokyo house for more than a month, negotiating indirectly with prosecutors, who allowed him to draft his confession at home and merely sent him a notice that he should pay a Y200,000 fine. The lenient treatment outraged ordinary Japanese, and petitions were circulated demanding that he quit. Mr Kanemaru presumed the pressure would soon fade, but the calls for his resignation have grown in recent days, with a government minister suggesting on Monday that he must leave. The minister said the violation was unacceptable, as were Mr Kanemaru's dealings with gangsters, whose good offices he apparently used to silence protests against the LDP by extreme right groups. The same groups were cruising Tokyo streets in their sound vans last night warning that Mr Kanemaru's departure would allow a former prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, to regain control of the faction and eventually to become prime minister again. Mr Takeshita was forced to resign three years ago after having been implicated in a stocks-for-favours scandal. However, the faction is in danger of splitting. Opponents of Mr Kanemaru's chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, are attempting to muster enough support to force him to share power with them. Policy-making will become even more tortured than usual, as the most influential politicians struggle to secure their positions.</p>

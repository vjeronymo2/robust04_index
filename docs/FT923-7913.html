			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens slightly on option trading AFTER fluctuating on index-related selling, share prices finally closed down with marginal declines as the Nikkei index shed initial gains just before the close, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell 5.62 to 14,768.17, falling for the sixth consecutive day to a new low for the year. The index moved between a high of 15,018.07 and a low of 14,717.38, with its best time in early afternoon on buying by investment trusts and dealers. Volume fell to 200m shares from 248m. Gainers led losers by 469 to 433 with 126 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.48 to 1,117.50 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.66 to 933.00. Stock option related trading dominated the market as dealers tried to manipulate stock prices ahead of today's settlements of August stock-index option contracts, which expired yesterday. Dealers were also seen short-covering on issues which were heavily sold during past trading days. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone regained strength on buying by short sellers. The issue advanced Y2,000 to Y460,000 after falling for six consecutive trading days. Speculative theme stocks rose on active dealer trading. Okamoto Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y850 and Meiji Milk Products advanced Y9 to Y749. Brokers were also firm. Nomura Securities gained Y30 to Y1,230 and Daiwa Securities advanced Y10 to Y690. Nippon Housing Loan, the financially troubled home-loan company, fell Y46 to Y102, after dipping below Y100. No share has been priced below Y100 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since June 1986, but Nippon Housing Loan faces mounting bad property-linked loans due to the plunge in real estate prices, and is requesting financial assistance from its main creditors. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.39 to 15,673.09 in volume of 37.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y310 to Y9,200 on bargain hunting. The issue was previously sold by investors to raise cash for margin calls. Roundup EMULATING Tokyo, the region tended towards gentle movement yesterday, with a slight bias towards the downside. Manila, once again, provided the significant exception. AUSTRALIA almost engineered a recovery after the government announced, late in the morning, that Australia's gross domestic product expanded by 0.6 per cent in the April-June quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly expansion. However, the All-Ordinaries index closed down 2.4 at 1,568.4 in turnover which was also little changed at ADollars 204m against ADollars 205m on Wednesday. The Australian dollar recovered to USDollars 0.7200 for part of the day, which also helped sentiment on the equities market. Resource stocks were hit by concerns about recession in Japan, and by falls on base metals and bullion in overseas markets. HONG KONG was held back by the government investigation into a string of companies controlled by Lee Ming Tee, and by recent chaos in China shares. The Hang Seng index fell 22.08 to 5857.11, turnover easing from HKDollars 2.49bn to HKDollars 1.93bn. Many participants stayed on the sidelines, awaiting Hang Seng Bank earnings announced after the market closed. A 22 per cent rise in earnings and a 159 per cent jump in dividend, however, did not please some of the speculators, who have driven Hang Seng shares up by 45 per cent this year. SEOUL blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), its potential effect on South Korean exports, and pessimism over today's Hyundai results as the composite index fell another 4.41 to 488.25. Issues connected with major exports to the North American region, such as cars, electronics and steel, led the downturn as they are expected to be worse hit by NAFTA; Hyundai group shares, also involved in the Nafta argument, were particularly vulnerable with Hyundai Motor losing Won700 to Won16,400. NEW ZEALAND saw yet another drop in Fletcher Challenge, down 12 cents to NZDollars 2.52, as the NZSE-40 index fell 2.40 to 1,494.16; KUALA LUMPUR worried about crumbling Japanese stock prices as the KLSE composite dropped 2.39 to 592.18. Among the winners, SINGAPORE produced a weak technical rebound as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 8.53 better at 1,374.76; BANGKOK's SET index rose 1.42 to 756.26 in trading described as nervous, ahead of the September 13 general election. MANILA reflected the government's lifting of foreign exchange controls and, once again, a strong performance from Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York. The composite index rose 20.21 to 1,491.46.</p>

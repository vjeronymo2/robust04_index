			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Safety in numbers, the family logic: Those who want to halt population growth do not understand human nature Nine months ago my sister, Thomasina, died. She was 32. My immediate emotions were of simple grief, partly at my own loss, partly at her much greater one. But the passage of time has brought with it other, more complex and surprising emotions. In particular I have begun to feel, in some strange way, outnumbered: that the balance of Lawsons versus the rest of the world has been altered to my family's disadvantage. I felt this most strongly, I am ashamed to say, at a gathering with my best friend and her four brothers. Much as I liked them all, I was overcome by envy of their superior force. It is not as though I am without allies, however. I have two remaining sisters, and come to that, a further two half-siblings. But the feeling of being outnumbered remains. However, being neither an unreasonable nor a vindictive man, I do not propose to demand a cull of my friends' families in order to restore the local balance of power. I am not even tempted to demand reprisals among the many more numerous families in the great world outside, in order to ensure that the Lawsons are not defeated in their aspirations by the madding and ever-competitive crowd. That however, does seem to be the motive of those developed world delegates in Cairo for this week's United Nation's International Conference on Population and Development. They are deeply worried that the earth's environment will not be able to support the growing industrialisation of the developing world's billions. Or, not to beat around the bush, western delegates are concerned that they themselves might be facing much stiffer competition for the resources which in the past - first through colonialism and later through superior economic power - they have found it so easy to acquire. Naturally the western delegates in teeming Cairo do not quite express things in this way. They prefer to say that it is in the developing world's own best interests to limit their populations. This argument persists, even though there is no proven connection between high densities of population and poverty - think of Singapore and Taiwan versus Mongolia and Chad - and even though there is clear evidence of declining birth rates in the developing world without any intervention from western busybodies such as Lady Chalker. One country in which coercive, imposed birth control has been tried is the People's Republic of China, which aspired to become the-not-so-many-people's republic of China. The result has been the widespread slaughter of female infants, and the creation of a class of fat, spoiled only-sons. Meanwhile, in the province of Canton, booming through the recent introduction of local capitalism, there is an acute labour shortage. Here, indeed, lies the solution, if one is needed. Capitalism has consistently showed itself capable of refuting Malthus's ancient prediction that food production could not keep up with population. Indeed, the problem has recently proved quite the reverse: there has been a global overproduction of food, creating such economic absurdities as the Common Agricultural Policy. Meanwhile the African starvation which we witness so distressingly on our television screen is directly the result, not of unchecked fornication, as the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn argues, but of the imposition of feudal or socialist economic policies. And, much as Lady Chalker and Sir Nicholas might dislike the thought, the rational response to a high mortality rate is to produce more children. It would be irresponsible for the heads of any family to behave otherwise, unless it craves extinc-tion. For this reason, what I would most have wanted, in the nine months since my sister's death, is to have fathered another child. And, in the absence of that, the continued rude health of my 20-month-old daughter is the greatest consolation; that, together with the arrival of my first niece, born a week after my sister's death, and named Cosima Thomasina.

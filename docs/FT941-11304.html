			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Amcor in asset swap with Bonar Amcor, the Australian paper group, yesterday announced an asset swap deal between its Montreal-based Twinpak subsidiary and Ontario-based Bonar. Twinpak will shed its North American paper sack and industrial plastic bags manufacturing business, but take on the bulk of Bonar's coating and laminating business in eastern Canada. Amcor declined to disclose sales of the businesses involved. The Australian company also announced that it had agreed to acquire a small plastic bottle manufacturing plant in New York State, its first move into the US. Amcor has been steadily building an international operation recently.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Belfast-New York air link THE UK has authorised a scheduled air service between Belfast and New York, the first for almost a decade. London wants the granting of the licence to be seen by Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, as a positive sign ahead of talks between the two countries over replacing their bilateral aviation agreement. Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, said: 'This is a special exception given outside the terms of the UK/US aviation agreement.' The new service - by American Trans Air, a US charter specialist based in Indianapolis - starts in June with three flights a week. The UK and the US have given themselves a year to negotiate a new agreement.</p>

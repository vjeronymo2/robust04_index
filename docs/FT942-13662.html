			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Bonn bullish on German economy: Rexrodt believes growth may outstrip government's expectations German economic growth may outstrip the government's earlier expectations of a maximum 1.5 per cent this year, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, claimed yesterday. Results from the first quarter alone ensured gross domestic product would certainly expand by 1 per cent for the year as a whole, Mr Rexrodt told a press conference. Several industrial sectors reported better-than-expected sales, and export orders rose a real 12 per cent over the past three months. But he cautioned that growth would not automatically mean more jobs, and the average number of unemployed would remain about 3.9m, close to the post-war high reached in January. His outlook was markedly more optimistic than the latest forecasts from a number of economic institutes and other organisations. The Federation of German Industry said this week that the chances of a strong recovery remained limited. The minister's forecasts for unemployment also conflicted with economists' estimates that the jobless total would climb to 4.5m by the end of the year and continue rising. But the minister, apparently intent on painting a bright picture ahead of next month's state and local elections, shrugged off their figures. 'Our growth forecasts were greeted with considerable scepticism by the opposition and others at the beginning of the year,' Mr Rexrodt said. 'In the meantime it is becoming ever more obvious that our expectations were well founded.' The chemical and automotive industries had reported the best results, he claimed. Construction, steel and engineering industry also showed signs of growth while prospects for the textile and electrical industries showed little improvement. The minister's bullish mood was partly supported by trade figures published yesterday which showed visible exports rose 6 per cent in February, while imports increased more than 7 per cent. According to Mr Rexrodt, economic growth in east Germany was still being driven by construction, which he expected would raise output by 15 per cent this year. Judy Dempsey adds from Berlin: The governing Christian Democratic Union is clawing back ground in the latest opinion poll carried out by Ipos, the Mannheim-based social research institute. But the Free Democrats, its coalition partner, may not reach the 5 per cent required to enter parliament in October's federal elections. The CDU increased its share of the vote by 7 percentage points to 39 per cent in western Germany, and by two 2 percentage points to 24 per cent in the east, compared with an Ipos poll taken last December. The FDP dipped by one 1 percentage point to 4 per cent in the west, and by 3 percentage points to 3 per cent in the east. Support for the opposition Social Democratic party slipped in both the east and the west.</p>

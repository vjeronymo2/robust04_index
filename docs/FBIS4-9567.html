			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, April 26 (TANJUG) -- UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] chief of staff in the sector south, Joseph Ngare, said  on Tuesday that the two sides in conflict, the republic of Serb  Krajina and Croatia, are observing the ceasefire and showing a  readiness to continue to implement the agreement on the  cessation of hostilities and the separation of forces signed in  Zagreb at the end of March.    At a regular press conference, representatives of U.N.  peace-keeping forces announced that UNPROFOR civilian police,  4,200 of them, together with the peace-keepers of the republic  of Serb Krajina started on Tuesday to patrol and enforce peace  and order in settlements along the line of separation.    The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in parts of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia settled by Serbs as  their response to the forceable secession of the Zagreb regime  from the former federation and is under U.N. Protection (UNPA)  since March 1992.    U.N. observers in sector south warned this time once again  about the great danger of mines placed during the withdrawal of  the forces in conflict or left behind earlier, but the  representative of the sector for information, Alan Roberst, was  not able to say which side had done that.    The mines removing operations are progressing slowly since  the Croatian side, unlike the Serb, has not yet made available  the exact data, maps and plans about the mine fields.    Two Krajina Serb army troops lost their lives, while four  were wounded by mine explosions last weekend when they were  visiting their village. Last week, two Canadian battalion  members within UNPROFOR were also wounded.    These are the main reasons why the return of local  inhabitants to settlements where military opoerations have been  going on until recently is still banned.    The headquarters of the Serb Krajina army announced that the  Croatian Army violated on Monday the ceasefire agreement and  opened fire from small arms towards the zone of responsibility  of the Lika corps in the wider Kapela area.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FRANK DENIES BROTHEL CLAIM  </P> <P> Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) today described as "complete lies" a claim by a  prostitute that he knew a brothel was being operated from his Capitol Hill  apartment.  </P> <P> The woman told Cable News Network on Wednesday night that she worked for the  prostitution ring operated by Stephen Gobie, a male prostitute and former  acquaintance of Frank.  </P> <P> The woman was not identified by CNN.  </P> <P> Frank's relationship with Gobie is the subject of an investigation by the House  ethics committee, which is trying to decide how to handle charges that the  congressman associated with the male prostitute from 1985 to 1987.  </P> <P> Frank, in a statement, said, "Reports by a female prostitute -- who first  surfaced as part of Mr. Gobie's deal with Penthouse magazine -- are complete  lies, fabricated stories about events which did not happen."  </P></p>

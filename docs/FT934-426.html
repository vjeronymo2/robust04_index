			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Now you can tune into a Penguin - Spoken Word 'Hello children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin . . .' Anyone old enough to recall Daphne Oxenford's words at the start of each episode of the radio programme Listen with Mother will have no trouble in immediately placing Margaret Thatcher's reading of her book The Downing Street Years (four cassettes, six hours, Pounds 14.99 HarperCollins Audiobooks). The odd thing is that Thatcher's patronising 'I know what's good for you' tone quickly becomes tiresome in the absence of those manically staring eyes, inevitably absent on an audio tape. Despite that, her recording could be the best-selling audio tape in the run-up to Christmas; it has sold 17,500 copies since its October launch. But that is a one-off. Of much greater importance in spoken word publishing has been Penguin's launch into this highly competitive market in November, backed by a Pounds 50,000 marketing budget. Penguin will not say how well sales are going, but its decision to enter the audio book field is logical: the UK spoken word market, currently estimated to be worth as much as Pounds 46m, is growing at some 10 per cent annually; book sales are shrinking for all but the most commercially successful best-sellers; and Penguin has an impressive backlist which converts naturally into a powerful spoken word collection. It has published 15 titles so far, including Derek Jacobi reading The Iliad; Dirk Bogarde reading his own book A Short Walk From Harrods; versions of Dracula, Madame Bovary, and Of Mice and Men; Hotel Pastis read by its author Peter Mayle; and some Beatrix Potter tales. The version of The Iliad (Pounds 19.99, nine hours on six cassettes, abridged extracts) is everything Margaret Thatcher's reading is not. Jacobi has become almost synonymous with Greek and Roman classical literature ever since his television depiction of the Roman emperor Claudius. His reading here is marvellous, evocatively distinguishing between characters, deploying a wide tonal and rhythmic range for different events and moods. The only quibble is that the abridged extracts are linked with a 'connecting narrative' by Maria Tucci, whose slack American vowels sit most uncomfortably with the crisp, clear authority of Jacobi. The largest market for audio books is the US, and Tucci's superfluous presence can only be seen as Penguin genuflecting towards that audience. Claire Bloom reads Madame Bovary (Pounds 7.99, abridged, three hours), another well-matched voice and subject, with Bloom's voice extending across the full spread of Flaubert's shades of irony and cynicism. On the other hand Richard E. Grant, who reads Dracula (Pounds 7.99, abridged, 3 hours), cannot make up his mind whether the count should be rendered as a menacing Transylvanian or a lisping Japanese sounding rather like Riuchi Sakamoto, known for his central role in the movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. But Penguin's version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (Pounds 7.99, three hours, unabridged), read by Gary Sinise, is superb. Sinise's gravelly, nasally, occasionally snarling reading is a model of what can be achieved on an audio book. He has a perfect grasp of the slightest change of pace in the text; he can credibly and instantly switch character and alter his voice to give what is almost a dramatic performance rather than a monologue. Penguin's presence in the market is going to seriously dent the prospects of some competitors. The Complete Listener, which specialises in unabridged classics, has just brought out The Vicar of Wakefield (Pounds 18.00, five hours, seven cassettes) but it sounds as though it was recorded in someone's garden shed. It is going to be impossible to get away with that kind of poor sound quality if Penguin and the other major publishers really push hard. For besides superb recording quality, Penguin also has a very neat but quite simple marketing idea; telephone sales. Each cassette contains a central London number which can be called to order other tapes; that facility is bound to be popular with the house-bound. But other publishers are going to give Penguin a good fight. Cover To Cover has just brought out a handsomely boxed set of Thomas Hardy's The Woodlanders (Pounds 29.99, 10 cassettes, unabridged, 15 hours 25 minutes), beautifully read by John Rowe. Others in the same series are Jane Austen's Emma (read by Prunella Scales) and Northanger Abbey (read by Anna Massey) and Far From the Madding Crowd (read by Stephen Thorne). Penguin has chosen to abridge most of its audio books, unlike Cover to Cover and some other publishers. The debate about full or edited versions will no doubt rage forever, but the example set by The Woodlanders shows how important a full version is. Hardy's descriptive passages could so easily be cut to save time; but just as no-one would wish to read a slashed Hardy novel, it is difficult to see why anyone would want to listen to a heavily condensed version. With a reader who is up to the task, and a text that is rich in subtle movements, abridgement is butchery, as is to some extent established by Penguin's chopped version of Madame Bovary, where character motivation is often rather inexplicable, due to the condensing which has been made to get it to fit into three hours. It's also a strange translation in places; why render 'diploma' as 'school degree' unless it is to lead supposedly ignorant US listeners by the nose? The same can be seen even more strikingly by comparing two competing and newly released versions of the same novel, The Choir by Joanna Trollope. The HarperCollins version (Pounds 7.99, two cassettes, three hours, read by Patricia Hodge) is almost incomprehensible at times, such are the elisions made in the pressing need to cut text to fit a preconceived length. Moreover, Hodge's enervated reading suggests a palpable disinterest in the text. By comparison the Isis Audio Books unabridged version (Pounds 19.99, six cassettes, eight hours 30 minutes) not only does an infinitely better job of situating character and building tensions, it is also read by Carole Boyd (Linda Snell of the BBC radio serial The Archers) with real vigour and verve. A 'star' reader is not always a good bet; as Listen for Pleasure's (EMI) abridged version of the Colin Dexter Inspector Morse novel The Way Through The Woods (Pounds 6.99, two cassettes, three hours), read by Kevin Whatley, demonstrates. It must have seemed a clever idea. Get Whatley, who gave excellent value as Morse's sidekick Sergeant Lewis in the TV Morse series, to make an audio book of a Morse novel. But it completely backfires. Whatley has no modulation of voice, no sense of rhythm, and all characters and incidents blur into one stream of porridge. Tring Audio Books runs into precisely the same problems by getting George Kennedy - an excellent Hollywood character actor - to read a butchered version of Moby Dick (Pounds 4.99, two cassettes, three hours). Kennedy cannot read to save his life; just because he has a rich American voice does not mean he is the best person to read a rich American novel. The pro-abridgement camp - of which Penguin seems to be a member so far - argues that listening to a book is not the same as reading it, so cutting is not just legitimate but proper. A subsidiary argument is that people either do not have or are not prepared to devote the time necessary for a complete reading. Neither argument holds water. Being read to is a much greater pleasure with the full density of a good author's prose. As for considerations of time, a good performance grips and entices; and nothing can save a bad one from being quickly switched off. A case in point is another Isis publication, Spike Milligan's Where Have All The Bullets Gone? (Pounds 19.99, six hours 30 minutes), read by Spike himself. To have cut this bravura comic performance would have been absurd; and it is actually greater fun to have Spike deliver the text than to read it flat on the page. The same is true with the Chivers Word For Word unabridged version of Tom Sharpe's novel Porterhouse Blue, read by Griff Rhys Jones (Pounds 16.99, six cassettes). But for sparkling audio comedy the BBC, which thanks to its massive audio output has about 50 per cent of the audio cassette market in the UK, still leads the pack. The BBC has just released a mini-collection called Canned Laughter, including single cassettes of the radio comedy Radio Active - featuring a peculiarly hirsute Angus Deayton on the cover - Knowing Me, Knowing You, and The Nick Revell Show, all Pounds 5.99. But who on earth will buy An Evening With Johnners (Listen for Pleasure, two cassettes, two hours, Pounds 6.99)? Brian Johnston, cricket commentator and after-dinner speaker, goes in for terrible puns and low jokes. A sample: 'I once went into an Indian restaurant where they served up Boycott curry; you still got the runs but more slowly.' Now an abridged version of that would be a happy release.</p>

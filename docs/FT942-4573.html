			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / C &amp; G takeover in 'virgin territory' The making of cash payments by Lloyds Bank to all members of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, regardless of the length of their membership, would be illegal, a senior High Court judge ruled yesterday. Giving judgment Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled against the proposals for the takeover of the C&amp;G that involved making cash payments to all members of the building society including those who had been members for less than two years. However, he ruled in favour of C&amp;G on two other points: the proposed payments to holders of deposit accounts and other non-members including employees; and the ability of C&amp;G directors to vote on the proposed transfer agreement even though they are shareholding members. Sir Donald said the disagreements between C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission raised questions of fundamental importance about the meaning of the statutory provisions of the Building Societies Act 1986. 'This is virgin territory because no building society has yet transferred its business to an already existing institution.' Parliament had been concerned that the transfer procedures under the act which enable takeovers of building societies should not be operated for the wrong reasons. 'The procedures were intended to facilitate natural organic development. They were not intended to provide a means whereby an outside institution might take over a building society business by tempting members with the offer of a substantial cash bonus. 'There was an obvious risk that members might snap up such an offer regardless of the best long-term interest of their society.' The act contained safeguards against this perceived mischief, including the provision which prevented the distribution of funds by the successor company to members of less than two years' standing. 'If the proposed transfer agreement had been simply an agreement between C&amp;G and the proposed successor, with the cash payments coming from the proposed successor, the agreement would clearly have been unlawful,' he said. However, the transfer agreement proposed in this case was different, he said. The cash payments would come not from the proposed successor company itself, Chambers &amp; Remington, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, intended to be renamed Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester plc. Instead, the money would come from the successor company's parent - Lloyds Bank. Sir Donald told the court: 'Does this make any difference? It would be surprising if it did.' It would 'emasculate' section 100(9) of the act, he said. He went on: 'All an existing institution would have to do would be to undertake a simple capital reconstruction and pass assets up to a newly created parent. Then the parent company could do what the existing institution cannot. The parent company could use its newly acquired assets for the purpose of the takeover. 'The parent company could offer a cash bonus to all members of the building society which its subsidiary is seeking to take over. The cash bonus could be offered to newly joined members as well as two-year members.' The C&amp;G had argued that, if this was a loophole, it was one that parliament had made no provision for, he said. However, rejecting the C&amp;G argument, Sir Donald said section 100(9) of the act was plainly directed at restricting the cash payments a successor company may make to members of the society. Section 100(1) of the act had to be treated as a 'compendious and exhaustive' statement of the provision for the payment of cash. 'Otherwise, although the successor is prohibited from applying its funds to newly joined members in contravention of section 100(9), other companies in the group of which a successor company is part may be able to do so. Parliament cannot have intended that to be the position,' he said. On the second issue, Sir Donald said it would be lawful for payments to be made to non-members. 'They have no votes. They have no say in whether the transfer agreement will be approved. In principle, therefore, if the members are prepared to approve terms whereby part of the cash on offer will be paid to employees and pensioners and depositors, that is a matter for them,' he said. The third issue concerned whether the C&amp;G directors should be disqualified from entering into the transfer agreement because, under the C&amp;G rules, they had a personal interest in the transfer. Sir Donald said: 'The proposed transfer is conditional on the passing of the requisite transfer resolutions by the members. The interest which the directors have under the agreement can never materialise unless the agreement is approved by the requisite shareholders' resolutions.'</p>

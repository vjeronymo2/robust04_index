			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Chancellor and Treasury detail reasons for 1/2-point rise The following statement was issued yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor: After discussion with the governor of the Bank of England, I have decided to increase interest rates by  1/2 per cent to ensure that, in the conditions of strong economic growth that we are now experiencing, we take no risks with inflation. It is because the growth of our economy is becoming so strong so quickly that I have made this move now. Output is growing at its fastest rate for six years. Exports are at record levels and export volumes continue to grow. Investment is rising, especially in manufacturing. My overriding aim now is to make sure that this healthy growth can be sustained to deliver higher living standards and more jobs. So often in the past, accelerating inflation has prevented us from enjoying sustained growth. I am determined this will not happen again. Underlying inflation is currently 2.2 per cent, the lowest level for 27 years. To make sure it stays that way we need to act in good time to prevent inflationary pressures taking hold - especially since changes in interest rates affect inflation only after a considerable lag. We are now enjoying accelerating growth with low inflation. This is a healthy recovery and today's move will help to keep it healthy and lasting. Permanently low inflation is the only way to deliver permanently rising living standards. The Treasury set out its detailed reasons for the rise: Inflation is currently very low: Underlying retail price inflation in July was 2.2 per cent, in the lower half of the government's target range. In recent months some indicators have suggested that cost and price pressures may start to pick up. Sterling commodity prices are 10 per cent higher than a year ago, and this is starting to be reflected in manufacturers' input prices which have risen over the last year by around 3 per cent. Recent CBI surveys have shown an increasing proportion of companies expecting to raise their prices. The main monetary indicators are mixed: M4 growth is within its monitoring range and house prices are fairly stable but the exchange rate has fallen slightly and M0 growth has been above its 0-4 per cent monitoring range since early 1993. Although in part this reflects the expected result of previous interest rate reductions, the persistence of M0 growth above its range is a cause for concern. Activity has been strengthening since the beginning of the year: The latest GDP figures show annual growth of 3.7 per cent (3.0 per cent excluding oil). Revisions to GDP growth also mean that the level of GDP is now over  1/2 percentage point higher than earlier estimates, and the level of spare capacity has fallen. Manufacturing output expectations in the August CBI Survey rose to their highest level since September 1988, pointing to a further acceleration of output in the months ahead; and the CBI's measure of capacity utilisation is now above its average level. Activity in the major overseas economies has also continued to strengthen somewhat faster than expected. Against this background of a strong economy the chancellor is determined to take no risks with inflation.</p>

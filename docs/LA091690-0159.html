			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVOY REPORTS SOVIET OVERTURE TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ready to restore diplomatic relations  with Israel after a 23-year gap if Israel agrees to participate in an  international peace conference, Italy's foreign minister said Saturday.  </P> <P> Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has made it clear that Israel would only  consider taking part in an international conference limited to the Persian Gulf  crisis.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis met with Gorbachev a day after the Soviet  president met with Israel's finance and science ministers. That meeting Friday  was the first between a Soviet leader and Israeli Cabinet ministers since the  nations broke diplomatic relations in 1967.  </P> <P> "President Gorbachev told me about the Soviet side's readiness to recognize  Israel immediately if it agrees to participate in an international conference  that would determine rules and principles for security and cooperation in the  region," said De Michelis, whose country holds the presidency of the European  Community.  </P> <P> On Sept. 4, the Soviets proposed an international conference to discuss the  Persian Gulf, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Lebanese civil war.  </P> <P> At the time, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the Soviet  Union "might take a fresh look at the issue of Soviet-Israeli relations" if the  Jewish state agreed to participate.  </P> <P> Israel has long opposed Soviet-backed ideas for an international conference  over the Palestinian conflict, fearing such a wide forum would try to force  Israel to concede territory to the Arabs.  </P> <P> Gorbachev met in the Kremlin on Friday with Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and  Science Minister Yuval Neeman, who were in Moscow discussing a trade deal. The  meeting was not announced beforehand.  </P> <P> Neeman said Saturday in Jerusalem that Gorbachev's warm reception of the  Israeli ministers set the stage for establishing diplomatic relations.  </P> <P> "We are bringing home a new atmosphere," he said in a radio interview, adding  that Israeli-Soviet relations had been "raised to a new level that, I assume,  is the last before complete relations."  </P> <P> In another development, Italy agreed to give the Soviet Union $2.72 billion in  credits Saturday, one day after Gorbachev warned that his nation is in danger  of bankruptcy. De Michelis announced the loans after meetings at the Kremlin  with Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> For decades the Soviet Union was considered a good international credit risk  because the government always promptly paid its import bills. But because of a  widening trade gap the Soviets have fallen behind on payments and are seeking  trade credits.  </P></p>

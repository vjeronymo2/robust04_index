			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Canadian banks cut prime rate as recovery steadies A SPATE of encouraging economic statistics has lifted hopes that Canada's recovery is at last on firm ground. Despite earlier warnings that a No vote in last week's constitutional referendum would be a serious blow to investor confidence, many economists are optimistic that uncertainty during the referendum campaign has only slightly delayed the upswing. Canadian banks yesterday implemented the second cut in their prime lending rate since the referendum, bringing the rate down by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.5 per cent. The prime rate jumped by two points in the run-up to last week's vote. Mr Ernie Stokes, chief economist at the Wefa consultancy group in Toronto, predicted that the sharp rise in interest rates prior to the referendum would delay the recovery by no more than about three months. Wefa forecasts the prime rate will drop as low as 6.25 per cent next year. Evidence of strengthening business conditions includes a 0.4 per cent increase in Statistics Canada's composite leading indicator in August, the biggest rise since last November. The government also reported real growth of 0.5 per cent in gross domestic product in August, pointing to an annualised expansion of about 2 per cent in the third quarter. With the exception of some forestry and energy companies, corporate profits showed a marked improvement between July and September. Economists expect a growth rate of about 2 per cent for 1992 as a whole, rising to about 3 per cent next year. 'While this is a slow and unspectacular recovery, it remains a recovery nonetheless,' said Mr Ravi Bulchandani, of Goldman Sachs in New York. The pace of the upswing is expected to depend heavily on the Bank of Canada, which has so far kept monetary policy tight to avoid a plunge in the Canadian dollar. With inflation running at slightly more than 1 per cent, real interest rates remain high. Mr John Crow, the central bank's governor, has indicated, however, that while monetary stability is a priority the authorities have few immediate concerns about inflation. Mr Crow said in a speech last week that inflation had fallen faster than expected. 'What is particularly important is the fact that costs of production in Canada are now under much better control,' he said.</p>

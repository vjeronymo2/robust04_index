			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / EU transport ambitions depend on private cash Private sector finance will be needed to fund half the European Union's ambitious plans for a trans-European network of transport links, a leading specialist said yesterday. Of the Ecu70bn (Pounds 540bn) needed for the ten most advanced transport projects, Ecu35bn will have to be raised from private sources, according to Mr Wolfgang Hager, director of the European Centre for Infrastructure Studies, a think-tank. Only Ecu23bn would come from taxes (including the Union budget), Ecu9bn from the European Investment Bank, and Ecu3.5bn from the railway companies, he told the Financial Times conference, Transport in Europe. The ambitious scale of the EU's transport plans raised the danger of the overall vision being lost and the project petering out before it had properly begun, he warned. Traditionally, transport plans had emerged from a slow technocratic process, based on traffic forecasts, 'which relieve bottlenecks perfectly obvious to everyone for decades', he said. The trans-European network programme, by contrast, involved a far-reaching vision of the future. The limited financial resources available to carry out the programme were in stark contrast to the ambitious political and economic goals of the programme, Mr Hager said. It sought to achieve a physical integration of the internal European market, to boost regional development, to support industrial policy and to deregulate the supply of goods and services. The programme might also run into problems because of the shift in spending involved from roads to public transport, Mr Hager said. Mr Jurgen Erdmenger, a director of the European transport directorate-general, said that at present EU member states spent 66 per cent of their Ecu50bn annual transport budgets on roads, 23 per cent went on rail, 5.6 per cent on airports, 3.5 per cent on ports and 1.5 per cent on canals. The trans-European network programme envisaged spending a total of Ecu400bn over the next 10-20 years, of which just 30 per cent would go on roads, 60 per cent on rail and 5 per cent on canals.</p>

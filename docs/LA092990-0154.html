			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> RUSHING WON'T COME OUT EVEN  </P> <P> Curt Warner has been the starter and main Ram rusher for the first three games,  although he might not be the starter Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals at  Anaheim Stadium. If Warner doesn't start, Cleveland Gary will.  </P> <P> So, where does that leave Gaston Green, the third-year third wheel of this Ram  tailback triumvirate? It's hard to say.  </P> <P> Green, who had an impressive exhibition season after two disappointing seasons  in a Ram uniform, has carried only 15 times for 65 yards this season.  </P> <P> "He's getting caught in the middle somewhere a little bit," Coach John Robinson  said of Green. "But there's nothing wrong with him. He's going to play.  </P> <P> "I can't make them all come out of each game with 12 1/2 carries. I don't do it  right all the time. I'm just trying to get the guys in the game and respond to  the game as it goes. I mean, I don't have an obligation to any one of them to  give them a certain amount of carries. I've got to try to do the best I can."  </P> <P> With the NFL's recent decision to reinstate practice squads, Robinson says he  would probably add a running back and either an offensive lineman or a  defensive lineman if he gets the chance.  </P> <P> Teams must carry a minimum of three first-year or rookie players on the squads,  and can have a maximum of five. The players earn $3,000 a week.  </P> <P> Rookie receiver Tony Lomack and rookie tight end Joe Price, who have hamstring  injuries, must be counted on the squad because they are rookies on injured  reserve but are practicing with the team. First-year tight end Richard Ashe,  who was put on injured reserve with a foot problem, is another candidate for  the list.  </P> <P> The Rams worked out three defensive linemen Friday, including Mark Walen,  formerly of UCLA and the Dallas Cowboys.  </P> <P> Robinson said that the workouts were the evaluations of available talent that a  team normally does throughout the season.  </P> <P> The others worked out were former Detroit defensive end Milford Hodge and  defensive tackle Gary Hadd, a 1988 draft pick of the Lions.  </P> <P> Walen, who because of injuries has not played in a pro game, was a third-round  pick of the Cowboys in 1986, and was released this exhibition season.  </P> <P> The Rams will work out two more defensive linemen today -- 1985 New England  draft choice Ben Thomas and 1990 New Orleans eighth-round pick Derrick Carr.

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARISIAN PARKS ARE WHERE TO FIND FRENCH SHOWING THEIR TRUE COLORS  </P> <P> As Post-Impressionistic French painter Georges Seurat illustrated a century  ago, there is nothing better than a day in the park for a relaxed, intimate  portrait of Paris and its people.  </P> <P> Alas, the particular park on the banks of the Seine where Seurat painted his  distinctive pointillist masterpiece, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La  Grande Jatte," has been elbowed aside by the growth of Paris.  </P> <P> But there remains within the city a wealth of other parks where on a bright  day, preferably on a weekend, you can revel in the varied landscaping; stroll,  promenade or jog; picnic on the grass, snack at a stand or dine luxuriously in  a restaurant; or simply find a chair or a bench, or sit under a tree, lean back  and observe the passing scene.  </P> <P> My appreciation of the city's parks was heightened considerably a few years ago  when my wife and I, accompanied by our then-15-month-old son Josef, took an  apartment in Paris. Josef's need of at least one extended romp a day and our  desire to experience a Paris beyond the usual tourist attractions combined into  an diverting exploration of the city's scattered parks and playgrounds.  </P> <P> To me, the parks of Paris are where residents shed their reputedly brusque  manners, along with their ties or high heels, to play with their children,  treat them to a merry-go-round or pony ride, read the weekend paper or a book,  indulge in a game of chess, go rowing, kick a soccer ball, flirt or merely doze  away a warm afternoon. It is in parks, I believe, that the Parisians become  real people, at ease with the world and more tolerant of tourists.  </P> <P> Parisian parks vary, reflecting in the differences their rich histories, the  pretensions of their neighborhoods and the proclivities of nearby residents.  </P> <P> Perhaps no park demonstrates this better than the Luxembourg Gardens. A 60-acre  oasis of green located in the heart of the Left Bank, it was designed in the  formal French manner of straight paths, edged by disciplined trees, pampered  flower beds and manicured lawns. Among the park's 90 odd -- some very odd --  monuments is a 9-foot-high model of the Statue of Liberty by Frederic Auguste  Bartholdi, who lived and worked a few blocks away.  </P> <P> The park's focal point is a marvelous octagonal-shaped basin and fountain  around which you can sit and watch children of all ages launch toy sailboats  and remote-controlled boats. There is a wealth of other diversions, including  tennis and boule courts, playgrounds, pony rides, a marionette theater, a chess  pavilion, a modest cafe and restaurant and the usual scrumptious snack stands.  </P> <P> Bordering the park on the north is the Luxembourg Palace, built in a flamboyant  Italian-style in the early 17th Century for Queen Marie de Medici to remind her  of the Pitti Palace of her native Florence. Over the years it has served as a  monastery, a prison for those who were to be guillotined during the Reign of  Terror, a parliament house, headquarters for the German Luftwaffe stationed in  France during World War II, and, at present, the home of the French Senate.  </P> <P> But what makes the Luxembourg Gardens special is the broad cross section of  people who frequent it. On a given weekday morning, even when the skies are  gray and the air nippy, the park attracts joggers, mothers and nannies with  young children, chess players and solitary citizens with books; at lunchtime,  tastefully dressed politicians and legislative aides from the Senate,  executives and secretaries from nearby offices, and tourists eating alfresco;  in the afternoon, older children, teen-agers and more-senior citizens; and  throughout the day waves of students from the nearby Sorbonne. It is the  students studying, arguing, and romancing that adds a special Parisian  ambience.  </P> <P> For me, Sunday is the Luxembourg's best day, when it seems that everyone is  there; the students, the bon chic yuppies and their bon chic babies, the  grandparents, the tourists and the inevitable park wardens keeping an eye on  everything and making sure that only children under 6 (and their guardians)  play on certain patches of grass, that no one picks the flower displays that  are constantly being redone, and that everybody is out of the park half an hour  before sunset so that the ornate, gold-paint-tipped gates can be locked.  </P> <P> More sedate, reflecting its residential surroundings in the fashionable 17th  Arrondissement, and more fanciful is Parc Monceau, which was designed in 1778  for the Duke of Orleans by the artist Carmontelle as a land of dreams. He  scattered across the undulating English-styled landscape a pyramid, a pagoda, a  Roman temple and a colonnade, among other follies. By far the most diverse and  diverting park in Paris is the 2,224-acre Bois de Boulogne. Here there is  something for everyone; gardens for "taking the air," woods for hiking and  bird-watching, meadows for picnics and kite flying, fields for soccer and an  occasional softball game, tennis courts, a range for clay-pigeon shooting, the  famed Longchamp for thoroughbred racing, and Autiel, the steeplechasing track.  </P> <P> Also in the Bois, as it is popularly known, are bicycle paths, lakes for  rowing, a children's amusement park, including a zoo and and farm; a more  informal and dubious adult amusement area, where soliciting prostitutes gather  at dusk; and a range of restaurants to satisfy the gourmand and gourmet, as  well as three generations of a bourgeois family out for a Sunday feast, or a  romantic couple seeking anonymity.  </P> <P> My favorite area in the park is the Bagatelle, a collage of formal and informal  gardens, groves of trees, rolling lawns, sculpted, shadowed lakes and a  waterlily pond that brings to life scenes of an idealized French countryside  that could have been painted by any of the great Impressionists. Particularly  ethereal are the rose gardens, especially if you catch them in full bloom in  June. Beckoning after a stroll through this idyll is a cafe under a canopy of  oaks in a courtyard behind a petite chateau that was built in 1775 as a  plaything for Marie Antoinette.  </P> <P> What the Bois de Boulogne is to the haute west side of Paris the sprawling Bois  de Vincennes is to the robust east side. Both serve as a reflection and a  refuge. Here, dogs and children roamed, the laughter at family picnics seemed  louder, the wine and food appeared more hearty, the music at the free concerts  louder, the play in the soccer games rougher and the lovers in the woods  bolder.  </P> <P> Yet with its lakes, floral and tropical gardens, meandering walks and deep  forests, an impressive zoo, biking and horseback riding and historic chateau  dating to the 14th Century, the park could also be diverting and genteel.  </P> <P> Almost everywhere we went in the city we found an inviting park or playground,  where we could sit and enjoy the surroundings. There was, for instance, the  square around the corner from the Picasso Museum.  </P> <P> I forget its name, but not the memory in my mind's eye of the sun streaming  through the trees there, creating a play of light and shadows on the lawn,  flower beds, the people sitting on the benches and the children playing in the  sandbox. I remember thinking at the moment that I didn't need to go to one of  the nearby museums to view the art, for the scene in the square was in itself a  memorable portrait of Paris.  </P></p>

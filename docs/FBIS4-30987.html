			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek by Nikola </F> Sostaric; place and date not given: "Being a Slovene Is Too  Little"]    [Text] The signing of the agreement on wage policy  will automatically regulate pensions as well; the next biggest  challenge is to reduce interest rates; let's wait for Italy to  gain a government; the president would be satisfied if the  present coalition remained; when you invent a culprit.    We spoke with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek just one  hour after he finally signed the wage policy agreement and thus  also formally concluded the social pact that his government had  been advocating ever since its inauguration. The first question  is therefore understandable:    [Sostaric] What are the guarantees that the documents you  have signed will also be carried out?    [Drnovsek] The signatures themselves are a considerable  guarantee that they will be carried out. Furthermore, the trade  unions and the Chamber of Commerce agree that the government  will ensure instruments for implementing those agreements, and  the law can also be such an instrument.  <H5>  Pensions Also Regulated </H5>   [Sostaric] Are pensions the next challenge now? Retirees are  protesting against any sort of changes, since they do not want  to give up the relatively favorable position that they have now.    [Drnovsek] There is always a lot of fuss over pensions. We  in  the government are constantly under pressure from assessments by  economists that pensions consume relatively too large a part of  the social product. That is a burden on the economy, which is  also consequently not competitive enough. With the retirees'  protests, however, it is necessary to find some middle course.  That is why I also think now that it is necessary to withdraw  the interventionary law, study once again what has been  proposed, and settle it in agreement with the retirees. We have  submitted a bill to amend the law for legislative proceedings,  and it is to be adopted through normal proceedings, which makes  it possible for us to verify it with the retirees. They want  changes in pensions to be coordinated with changes in wages. Now  we can withdraw that interventionary law, because the social  agreement on wage policy will contribute to bearable changes in  wages, and thus pensions should not deviate from that either.  Assuming that we have regulated wages, we can claim that we have  also regulated pensions.    [Sostaric] Wages have been regulated, but what is the next  challenge?    [Drnovsek] I hope that with the social agreement we have at  least reduced the tension, if we have not yet eliminated it.  That should ensure social peace. Now it is time for the final  adoption of the budget by the State Assembly, which should  happen in May.    The procedure for adoption of the budget has been going on  for more than half a year now, which in my opinion is extremely  irrational, although the State Assembly's rules of procedure  specify that procedure. We are now actually adopting the budget  at least twice. The adjustments are very dramatic, and then we  have to start it all over again. Normal countries adopt budgets  once; they are coordinated and adopted. In our case as well the  process should be simplified and shortened.    I hope, however, that we will adopt the budget next week,  after all the possible adjustments. The government insisted on  the original figures offered; there were only minimal  deviations, which are not fundamental. If that kind of budget is  adopted, it will be quite rational and frugal, the most that we  can afford now.  <H5>  Reducing Interest Further </H5>   [Sostaric] We adopt a budget every year, and we are  interested in all sorts of other more long-term economic policy  issues that would have to be resolved.    [Drnovsek] Recently economic trends have been favorable,  production has kept growing, and inflation is still declining,  since the average monthly inflation during the first three  months was 1.3 percent, which means annual inflation between 15  and 18 percent, and perhaps we will achieve another percent or  so less. Unemployment has also started to decline, and if we  also add to that the encouraging foreign trade trends, we can  say that the economic results are encouraging.    With the new budget, we will regulate the total level of  public and budgetary spending, but in any case interest rates  are one of the fundamental issues of economic policy. The  government has already achieved something in that area, and with  the measures coordinated with the Bank of Slovenia, there has  been a partial reduction in interest rates. They are still too  high, however. I expect that we will also reduce them somewhat  further during the coming period. That can be achieved primarily  by monetary policy measures, because it is within the purview of  the Bank of Slovenia, and on the other hand, the finance  minister can influence the interbank interest rate primarily by  loaning out and guiding state money.    [Sostaric] But the chronic shortage of money in general  affects the level of interest rates.    [Drnovsek] And also the incomplete rehabilitation of the  banking system. It is taking place, to be sure, but it is not  yet finished and consequently loopholes from the past are still  influencing interest rates. We will review bank rehabilitation  once again and try to determine what else can be done.    [Sostaric] Dr. Mencinger, however, thinks that last year  Slovenia showed successes because of mistakes in economic  policy. You yourself, at a meeting of the government's economic  council, stated that some economists were advising you to  restrict wages, and others to free them. With such different  opinions, what is the truth?    [Drnovsek] The opinions are very different. When we froze  wages last year, everyone criticized us, including economists,  and then the same people complained that the freeze did not last  longer. It is a really delicate area, and that is why I am glad  that we reached an agreement. If it goes into effect as we  agreed, it will undoubtedly be better than a law freezing wages.  If that agreement is in effect over the long term, it will be  extremely important for the economy, since it is very difficult  for us to adjust public spending, pensions, and wages. The  government itself has very limited instruments to do so.    [Sostaric] We expect a great deal from privatization, but it  is proceeding more slowly now than we anticipated. Will the  government speed it up?    [Drnovsek] We are speeding it up as much as we can. We are  monitoring the activity of the Privatization Agency, and we are  trying to help solve the problems. In any case, I think that  privatization is taking place rather intensively. A lot of  programs have already been approved, and I think that there are  two reasons for the delays: the audits done by the SDK [Public  Auditing Service], since many enterprises have applied, and the  SDK has a limited number of trained personnel. The rest of the  delays are due to the denationalization proceedings, which  hinder enterprises from more rapid privatization. At any rate,  we will try to speed up the proceedings even more and make them  more efficient, but we do not anticipate any general changes in  the privatization process.    [Sostaric] There are two options in denationalization:  restoration of the nationalized property through compensation,  or the return of that property in kind. What is your position?    [Drnovsek] We have to act in accordance with the valid law,  which also allows returning it in kind. Many people consider  that a controversial solution, which other countries do not  have, but our parliament passed the law a while ago. Changing  that law would also be extremely sensitive politically. We  therefore did not try to undertake it, and we as a government  are trying to do everything possible within the framework of  that law. At any rate, that law contains the brakes on the  privatization process.  <H5>  The Fatal Year 2001? </H5>   [Sostaric] Slovenia is a country that has to join the world.  If we look at the free trade zone agreements and Slovenia's  intention of joining the European Union, we note that 2001 will  be the year when the protective barriers to foreign competition  will fall to the minimum. In just seven years, therefore, the  Slovene economy will have to prepare for full foreign  competition. Isn't that too soon?    [Drnovsek] We have already had to adjust quickly to very  difficult conditions. The shock that our economy experienced  after independence and the loss of its markets was much worse  than the further adjustment to world competition and developed  Europe will be. It is true that after independence we had many  bankruptcies, and that the number of people unemployed grew  drastically, but at the same time, what happened strengthened  the enterprises that survived, and that means that they will  also continue to endure. I think that we will adjust to the new  requirements, and the present relatively liberal policy that is  trying to open Slovenia up as much as possible is also  contributing to that.    [Sostaric] In a way, Slovenia's future position in Europe  will also be decided by our group negotiating with the European  Union. Do we have enough competent experts for Slovenia, as a  future member of the European Union, to secure the best possible  starting position?    [Drnovsek] There are never enough experts, and we are short  of them as well. In any case, we will have to obtain them, since  joining Europe is a serious issue. All our legislation,  standards, and other regulations will have to be adapted to the  European Union, which will be extremely extensive work. Of  course, we are counting on the cooperation of experts from the  European Union. Sometimes it seems that we have many experts on  everything else, on beating a dead horse, but there is a  shortage of them when serious work has to be done.  <H5>  Caught Between the Great Powers </H5>   [Sostaric] That has probably also been shown by the  negotiations with GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade],  when we were quite optimistic, but to this very day we are not  yet members of that organization.    [Drnovsek] As far as GATT is concerned, I still think that  we  will succeed in becoming a member by the end of the year, before  the establishment of the World Trade Organization, in which we  could become founding members. The reason why it has not  happened yet is that we were caught between the interests of the  United States and the European Union. In their trade war, both  of them are putting pressure on little countries like Slovenia,  which have to adjust to one side or the other. If we come closer  to the European Union and its regulations and standards, the  Americans make problems for us, and vice versa. We are in the  middle, and we are trying to get out of it.    [Sostaric] With all of this, the issue of Slovenia's  promotion abroad has been raised for a long time. The fact is  that we are doing a poor job of promoting Slovenia, and to the  best of our knowledge, some government office ought to take over  that business.    [Drnovsek] A lot is said about promotions, and everyone  would  like to be involved in them, so that sometimes the problem is  how to coordinate various promoters or various ministries. That  is why there is a proposal in progress for the establishment of  some body that will coordinate those responsible for promotions  and make them more efficient.  <H5>  Relations With Neighbors </H5>   [Sostaric] The Foreign Ministry has issued an analytical  document that talks about how we are in a semi-colonial position  with respect to Austria. The question that arises is whether  Slovenia, in regulating its economic relations with Austria,  will wait for the latter to become a member of the European  Union, or seek a different path to regulate mutual relations?    [Drnovsek] Slovenia does not have any sort of semi-colonial  relationship with Austria. We have good-neighborly relations  with Austria, and a completely independent policy. Austria will  probably become a member of the European Union in a very short  time, and we consequently have to count on it primarily as a  member of the European Union and measure our subsequent steps in  accordance with that fact. So far we really have sought  possibilities for cooperation within the framework of EFTA  [European Free Trade Association], but the fact is that all the  Scandinavian countries and Austria are going into the European  Union, and consequently EFTA no longer interests them. To be  sure, we are still trying to keep EFTA involved, but it is  obvious that a relationship with the European Union is greatly  preferable.    [Sostaric] There have been significant political changes in  Italy. It may happen that relations between Italy and Slovenia  will not be pleasant. Is Slovenia as a country prepared for  those changes?    [Drnovsek] What Italy's actual policy will be like has yet  to  be seen. To be sure, there is a great deal of shouting now,  there is still no government, and this is consequently a sort of  transition period, which should not be perceived as appropriate  for judging Italian policy toward Slovenia. When a government is  put together and it has to try to solve problems constructively,  I can hardly imagine that Italy will resort to a different  policy than the usual one in the European Union, since Italy  itself would therefore end up in serious difficulties within the  European Union, and Europe also would not tolerate it,  especially if there came to be such an aggressive Italian policy  that it would threaten Italy's neighbors. It is something that  is unacceptable by European standards.    If it does happen, we will have problems, of course, but in  that case Italy will also have difficulties with democratic  Europe, and therefore we will not be isolated in defending our  interests. We are now just waiting for Italian policy to settle  down somehow and start to function normally.    [Sostaric] What about the present Istrian campaign for some  sort of union of the Croatian, Slovene, and Italian  municipalities in Istria?    [Drnovsek] We do not intend to change the state system.  <H5>  Normal With Croatia </H5>   [Sostaric] As far as Croatia is concerned, the data indicate  that bilateral trade is declining every month, and political  relations themselves are stagnating.    [Drnovsek] Trade is declining with all the former Yugoslav  republics, including Macedonia. In Croatia's case, that trend  has existed since the end of the free trade relations between  the two countries. In any case, this February we achieved  progress in our mutual relations, when we signed several  agreements with Croatia, so now I can say that relations are  normal. Obviously there is also less and less tension in the  media, and the fact is that Croatia has other problems that it  has to solve. There are a few individual issues that are  hindering more rapid clarification of our mutual relations. In  addition to the problem of the borders, which is slowly being  solved by the joint commission, we also have the issue of  Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, which is a serious problem in our  mutual relations, and the issue of the nuclear power plant. We  are talking with the Croats about those issues and preparing  solutions. We have already proposed some of them, and we have  yet to propose others, so I hope for progress if we maintain the  present level of bilateral relations.    [Sostaric] Of course, the Slovene economic delegation's  visit  to Bosnia-Herzegovina showed that Slovenia is still interested  in economic cooperation with the southern republics.    [Drnovsek] Enterprises and the economy are always interested  in business deals. If there is a market there that they can work  with, Slovene enterprises will cooperate in it just like all  other foreign enterprises. Of course, because of their  familiarity with that market our enterprises have some  advantages, and thus when the situation settles down there will  be normal bilateral economic relations.    [Sostaric] Even with Serbia?    [Drnovsek] When the sanctions are lifted, when the  international community normalizes relations with Serbia,  Slovenia will do so as well.  <H5>  I Support the Status Quo </H5>   [Sostaric] A question about the coalition--the present big  coalition of three parties is now functioning fairly well, but  there is talk about a new coalition of the LDS [Liberal  Democratic Party] and the SKD [Slovene Christian Democrats].    [Drnovsek] The coalition is functioning, and the agreements  that I have with both the partners, the SKD and the United List,  are in effect; the LDS is prepared to continue working in that  coalition, since it now has enough parliamentary support to  guarantee the operation of the state, the government, and the  whole system. As long as it works, we will try to keep the  trilateral coalition. The problem is that the SKD no longer  wants to cooperate with the ZL [United List] in the government,  and thus the two other partners cannot manage with each other.    The LDS's position is that it is no longer possible to act  within a trilateral coalition, we will have to decide and  determine which bilateral coalition and possibly which group of  deputies could allow establishing a stable government. At this  time that still does not mean an a priori decision in favor of  one party or the other, but rather a thorough study of the  situation and then a very firm agreement with the coalition  partner. The government needs strong parliamentary support, so  that by the end of our term we can carry out everything that we  planned at the start.    That is why I am not in a hurry to change the coalition. The  pressure will come from elsewhere, and we have yet to see when  and how we will reach an agreement.    [Sostaric] Nevertheless, if that trilateral coalition  actually does collapse now, no alliance would have a majority:  You need the help of the small parties in parliament. Which  ones? Perhaps Jelincic's?    [Drnovsek] That is still an open question. We still have  democrats here who have not joined the LDS, and are still  independent deputies. Thus, in both options, either with the  Christian Democrats or the United List, we could achieve the  necessary majority in parliament.    [Sostaric] You would obviously prefer the status quo?    [Drnovsek] From the standpoint of consolidating the state,  that would be best.  <H5>  Most Progress Last Year </H5>   [Sostaric] It was recently determined that Slovenia's  standing in the world had declined.    [Drnovsek] According to the latest international  assessments,  it has risen. The last such assessment comes from the  INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR magazine, which is highly esteemed in the  banking world. It thought that Slovenia was last year's winner.  Of all the countries in the world, it made the most progress in  one year. On the scale of the top 10 winners of the year,  Slovenia is in first place according to the criteria of which  country, according to a world standard, gained the most in one  year. At all sorts of international meetings and at  institutions, Slovenia is receiving good assessments, and in a  way we are being treated like a country that has succeeded  considerably faster than the world expected. I must say that  Slovenia is viewed considerably better abroad than it is at home.    [Sostaric] In spite of that pleasant circumstance, we are  having difficulties over the unallocated Yugoslav debts, and  there are problems with succession.    [Drnovsek] We are still negotiating with a consortium of  banks about the debts. There will be more negotiations again  soon. It is hard to predict the outcome of the negotiations,  since we are negotiating quite hard, but we will try to settle  the matter. It is important for us, since that is precisely what  is keeping us down in the international ratings; the "Yugo risk"  is still in our financial credit rating. I am a moderate  optimist about this, in spite of our domestic financial  disagreements, which have also politicized that issue.    Actually we are now making use of the domestic tension over  the foreign debt, which some people brought to light as--I don't  know--some sort of discovery, although we have all known about  it for 10 years now. We are telling our credit partners, the  commercial banks, that we also have populist policies that  present matters in radical terms. We are thus trying to induce  them to accept our proposals and not some subsequent  alternatives that would seriously hurt them and Slovenia.  Fortunately our negotiating partners are not interested in  anything like that, since they would obviously put a solution of  the problem off until the future.    [Sostaric] In view of what has been said, is the story about  Slovenia as a winner still relevant?    [Drnovsek] For anyone who is familiar with the situation and  knows the kind of circumstances with which Slovenia had to cope,  what it means to lose 40 percent of the markets overnight, as  Slovenia did, and had to compensate for them during a period of  world recession, and at the same time carry out changes in the  economic system at home, all without outside financial  assistance, our achievements are convincingly good.    That is not understood by those who are not familiar with  world realities, who think that it is enough that you are a  Slovene and then everything will work out by itself, and that  just changing the signs and the name of the country is enough  and then everything will be better--those who do not know that  you have to win everything yourself, that in this world one has  to survive a very hard struggle. People have to know that.    [Sostaric] Then the so-called UDBA [State Security  Administration] mafia is not to blame for everything?    [Drnovsek] We witnessed such phenomena after World War I,  when the economy, objectively, collapsed. At that time people  also invented a culprit who was to blame for everything and  exploited others, who therefore lived poorly. At that time it  was the Jews. That is an extreme example, of course, but it is a  good illustration of where that sort of simplification and  demagogy can lead.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Call for more resources to be given to rural areas ECONOMIC and social change in Britain's rural areas is creating poverty, deprivation, distress and unemployment which have been largely ignored by the government, according to a report published yesterday by the Duke of Westminster. The report calls for the government to launch programmes similar to those devoted to inner-city regeneration. Government and EC policies should be directed towards keeping farmers in business to maintain the landscape, it says. Action is needed to encourage the forestry industry and the growth of small business. The duke also calls for more resources for the countryside, particularly for schools, public transport and inexpensive housing. He says; 'Everyone knows about the problems of inner cities, but people suffering much the same difficulties in rural areas get precious little attention. People in the countryside may not be rioting, but they do more serious things like killing themselves.' The report opens with a letter to the prime minister signed by the duke and 44 leading figures from the business, public and voluntary sectors calling for a recognition of the needs and difficulties of country dwellers. It calls for action to maintain a socially stable and economically viable rural society and to conserve the rural landscape. The Problems in Rural Areas.

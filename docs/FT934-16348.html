			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Polish coal accord POLISH miners yesterday ended their occupation of coal-mining industry management offices in Silesia after winning promises of redundancy settlements twice as generous as those enjoyed by the country's remaining 2.7m unemployed. The coal industry is facing the prospect of reducing its workforce from 320,000 to 200,000 by the end of the century, and the agreement will serve as a benchmark for other workers in heavy industry. The 2,500 miners at the loss-making Zory pit, which is to close by the end of next year, also went back to work yesterday after a two-week strike called after redundancy notices were served on the first of 500 men to lose their jobs this year. Under the agreement signed between coal industry management and the unions, miners made redundant as a result of closures will be entitled to 24 months of pay at half basic rates but not less than 3m zlotys (Pounds 100) a month. At present, normal unemployment benefit amounting to 1.4m zlotys a month runs for only one year.</p>

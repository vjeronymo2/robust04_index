			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Supermarkets vie to fill up tanks as well as trolleys: An increase in shopping around for petrol is worrying oil companies COMPETITION between Britain's supermarket chains has found a new battleground. No longer content just to fill shopping trolleys, they are vying increasingly to fill petrol tanks as well. Indeed, their campaign has been so successful that it has started to nettle the oil companies, which now sense a growing threat to their dominance of petrol sales. 'Motorists, whether sensitive or insensitive to petrol prices, are shopping around as never before,' says Mr Bruce Petter, director of the Petrol Retailers' Association, which represents about half the UK's 18,000 service stations. Supermarket petrol stations have been springing up as rapidly as the out-of-town superstores to which most are attached. According to Petroleum Review, the industry journal, there were more than 660 stations attached to supermarkets at the start of this year, almost twice the number two years earlier. The stations at supermarket sites sell petrol at between 5p and 15p per gallon cheaper than the branded oil company outlets - although in areas where several supermarkets compete the difference can be more than 20p. So far, the supermarkets have captured between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of a sluggish market. They are hungry for more. Tesco, with 151 petrol forecourts, plans to add a further 20 in the next 12 months, as does Safeway, which operates 37 sites. J. Sainsbury, with 100 forecourts, plans 30 more next year and believes it could eventually raise the total to 200. Mr Michael Rosen, Sainsbury's director of non-food sales, believes supermarkets could together account for a quarter of all petrol sales in five years. That would exceed the 20 per cent now held by Esso, the market leader. Such forecasts are questioned by some oil industry experts, who say difficulties with planning permission and the distance of many supermarket sites from main roads may slow their expansion. But no one disputes that the supermarkets have become an important - and probably permanent - force in petrol retailing. Publicly, the oil companies affect nonchalance towards this trend - partly because they have encouraged it. Burdened with excess UK production and refining capacity, most have been glad to find new customers. Privately, however, some are starting to sound worried, accusing the food retailers of 'cherry-picking' business from a few large sites. 'The supermarkets don't view petrol as an essential service. We do,' says one oil company. 'We have 2,500 sites. Some are in remote places which make little money and where distribution costs are high.' Food retailers say they make a profit on petrol by buying bulk supplies at a discount and sharing retailing costs with their supermarket operations. But some people in the oil industry complain they have an unfair advantage because they do not have to carry expensive stocks. One large oil company is pressing the Department of Trade and Industry to even the balance by compelling supermarkets to meet an EC requirement that suppliers selling more than 50,000 tonnes of petrol a year should carry 66 days of stocks. But the retailers appear unperturbed. Tesco is understood to be arranging for its suppliers to hold stocks for it. Sainsbury, which claims already to sell more than 50,000 tonnes of petrol a year, says the government has exempted it from stockholding. Although supermarkets began selling petrol more than a decade ago, their emergence as a serious competitive threat dates back to the surge in international spot market prices which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August By holding down retail prices, the supermarkets increased their share of sales in the following six months from 6.8 per cent to 11 per cent. Once the short-lived oil crisis ended, they held on to their market by cutting prices faster than their established competitors. The recession has also helped. Traditionally, many of their customers have been private car owners who pay for their own petrol. However, cost-conscious employers providing company cars are starting to set petrol allowances at the prices charged by supermarkets. Whether the supermarkets are succeeding in their original purpose of attracting more food shoppers is questionable. Safeway reckons 40 per cent of customers at its petrol stations do not shop at its adjoining stores. However, that is little consolation to their rivals in the oil industry. The latter are counting on features such as improved facilities, forecourt shops and 24-hour service to win back business. But many supermarkets now offer similar attractions: Safeway has installed car washes at half its sites and has begun opening some 24 hours a day. Whether open hostilities will erupt is a topic of keen debate among petrol retailers. But perhaps it need not come to that. Oil companies in Belgium and France have recently eliminated some of their supermarket competitors by buying their petrol-retailing businesses, re-equipping their forecourts and restoring prices to more 'normal' levels. 'The oil companies can match the supermarkets price-for-price if need be,' says Mr Petter. 'If it came to slugging it out, I guess they would win.'</p>

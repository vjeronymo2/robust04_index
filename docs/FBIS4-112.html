			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare March 30 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's Government on  Wednesday [30 March] attempted to control damage caused by the  scandal over land leases to top government and ruling ZANU  [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front])  officials in the face of first signs of a party split on the  question.    President Robert Mugabe is currently abroad seeking foreign  investment.    At a news conference Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai  accused Zimbabwe's press of being "bent on frustrating the  efforts of government promoting foreign investment" with reports  of how at least a dozen senior officials had been issued with  large commercial farms initially intended for resettlement of  landless peasants. Mr Kangai denounced the independent DAILY  GAZETTE for being "misguided and mischievous".    But the government was criticised for the first time from  within the ruling ZANU (PF) party, with chairman of the populous  and influential Mastingo Province, Dzikamai Mavhaire, denouncing  the land policy as "government's worst corruption ever". His  remark was a sign the scandal could create a split in the party.    On March 3 the DAILY GAZETTE reported former agriculture  minister, and now minister of education, Witness Mangwende, was  the first beneficiary of the land policy of confiscating  white-owned farms to resettle landless black peasants.    Mr Mangwende pushed for the Land Acquisition Act two years  ago. The act allows government to seize land and pay farmers a  rate of compensation determined by government. It also excludes  farmers' claims for unfair compensation.    The newspaper has since named eleven other officials --  including two cabinet ministers and the police and army chiefs  -- who were granted leases for land of white tenants or land  bought over the last decade to resettle [word indistinct]  farmers.    At Wednesday's news conference, Mr Kangai repeated his  assertion that "there is nothing wrong with giving farms to my  colleagues", but refused to provide a list of beneficiaries.    The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe on  Wednesday "condemned unreservedly the so-called tenant  resettlement scheme" under which officials were granted land "at  the expense of landless peasants whose need is desperate".    A commission statement said the allocation of farms to  officials was "highly unethical (and did not) in any way redress  the disparities in land distribution, but simply has the effect  of replacing one elite group with another". The commission said  its concerns about the legislation had been vindicated by the  current trends.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Franjo Kiseljak: "Kuna on Statehood Day"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb -- After being used for three years and five  months and honorably accomplishing the task of achieving the  monetary independence of Croatia, the temporary Croatian dinar  will go into the albums of numismatists and the memory of its  users as the currency with which they experienced difficult  times and the end of hyperinflationary humiliation. The dinar  vouchers issued by the Ministry of Finance, as announced  earlier, will be withdrawn from circulation on Statehood Day.  They will be replaced with the real money of the National Bank  of Croatia, which was originally supposed to be called kruna but  has been renamed kuna.    It is interesting that the replacement of the money will be  complete. In addition to paper money, the kuna, citizens will  also find in their pockets coins called lipa. Parents will again  be able to buy for their children "piggy" saving boxes and  similar devices for collecting coins that could eventually be  transferred in the savings books.    The entire operation of replacing money and all the  technical  details will be elaborated on in a special bill. The National  Bank of Croatia has already prepared the working version of the  bill, which will require endorsement by the government and the  assembly. Correspondents have not seen the working version yet,  but, judging by what was said at the government's session last  Thursday [28 April], the most serious option concerning the  exchange of money is the one proposing that three decimal points  be knocked off. For instance, newspapers costing 2,500 Croatian  dinars would cost 2.5 kunas.    Such a denomination would be extremely simple and practical,  even for those who require more time to work with naughts.  However, some people are proposing that even four naughts be  knocked off. In this case, coins would gain in value, something  that could turn out to be useful for several reasons. The state  would earn more. The state is entitled to the difference  between the nominal value and the cost of producing the coins.  The coins with greater purchasing power, which is still more  important, would make people more aware of the fact that every  coin, even the lowest denomination, are worth something and  should therefore be respected.    Possible objections to the "impossible psychological parity"  of one German mark only being worth 37 lipas, or 3.7 kunas in  the case of knocking off three decimal points, could be  countered in the following way: It could be assumed that, as a  result of structural disturbances, inflation will do its part  and real wages will in the meantime rise to 1,000 German marks.  Once we start receiving decent wages, it would not be a bad  idea to stick with simple, four-digit figures. It would be good  to hear what experts and those who will replace money in about  one month have to say about this.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK CATEGORIES?  </P> <P> I was disappointed that George Michael won in the favorite R&amp;B male soul  and favorite R&amp;B soul album categories at the American Music Awards  telecast ("American 'Michael' Awards: More Advertising Than Art," by Robert  Hilburn, Feb. 1). Categories have been developed to recognize a variety of  musical styles and artists. The soul category traditionally has been reserved  to honor black artists.  </P> <P> COLLEEN S.

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UN warns of human catastrophe as Serb forces battle into Bihac The United Nations warned last night of a potential humanitarian catastrophe as Serb forces, defying a fresh wave of air strikes by Nato, fought their way into the north Bosnian town of Bihac, a UN-protected area. Nato bombers struck Serb anti-aircraft batteries in three places yesterday, implementing tough new rules of engagement that were secretly agreed with the UN on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, said he had worked out a peace plan for Bihac with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic which he would put to all the warring parties. He also said he had secured agreement for a convoy to supply the 1,000 Bangladeshi UN peace-keepers trapped in the enclave. However, it was unclear whether any plan put together in Belgrade would halt the fighting on the ground. Mr Akashi also apparently failed to get permission for passage of emergency food supplies to 180,000 Moslems trapped in Bihac. Earlier, Nato ambassadors, under pressure from France and the US, had held emergency talks in Brussels on how they could stop Bihac falling. They also considered a plan to implement a total UN withdrawal from Bosnia, which has been prepared over several months. The prospect of a 'nightmare scenario' was raised by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as thousands poured into Bihac town from outlying villages which have fallen to the Serbs. Mr Kris Janowski, a UNHCR spokesman, said food and water could run out if the town, virtually cut off from emergency provisions for several months, became overcrowded. Russia, breaking ranks with the US and western Europe, cautioned against 'excessive use of force' by Nato and announced a diplomatic initiative on Bosnia by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. Itar-Tass news agency said Mr Kozyrev would go to Belgrade and parts of former Yugoslavia after talks with the German government in Bonn tomorrow. Nato bombers struck Serb anti-aircraft positions near the towns of Otoka and Bosanska Krupa in Bosnia and at Dvor in Croatia, in two separate missions. They initially intended to aim only at Otoka - in retaliation for an attack on UK fighters on Tuesday - but broadened their aim after Serb radar locked on to Nato reconnaissance aircraft. Bosnian government radio described the situation in Bihac as 'real hell', saying that 'the Serbs are shelling the town itself, and refugees are pouring into the very centre of Bihac'. UN officials - who in the past have accused the Bosnian government of exaggerating the extent of Serb assaults - confirmed that fighting had spread to the town. Mr Alexander Ivanko, a UN spokesman, said the Serbs were backing up their infantry with artillery fire from Mount Grabez, a strategic position outside the town.

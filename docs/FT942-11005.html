			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Packer team loses bid for Sydney casino Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Circus Circus, the large US gaming group, yesterday lost their joint bid to build the USDollars 1bn-plus Sydney casino complex, which is forecast to have annual gaming revenues of around ADollars 500m (USDollars 357.1m) when it comes on stream in 1997. Instead, the New South Wales Casino Control Authority announced yesterday the winning development proposal had been submitted by Leighton Holdings, the stock market-listed Australian engineering and construction group in which Hochtief, the German construction group, has a 48 per cent shareholding. Although the CCA stressed no one factor had influenced its decision, the Leighton bid - made in conjunction with Showboat, a US casino group - offered a much higher upfront payment to the NSW state in return for the casino licence. The consortium has promised to pay ADollars 441m over three years, or ADollars 376m as a single upfront sum - a figure which even Mr Chris Cullen, the CCA chairman, described as 'exceptional'. Mr Packer - whose involvement in the rival consortium was through his Nine Network and Consolidated Press companies - said his group had 'bid our maximum price and came up over ADollars 80m short'. 'On that basis, (Leighton/Showboat) deserved to win and good luck to them,' said the businessman, known to be a keen gambler himself. The Sydney casino is the last, and largest, in a string of such development announcements in Australia. Growth in the industry is expected to explode over the next three years. Casinos are due to come on stream in Cairns, Brisbane and Melbourne during that time and - with Sydney included - the country's total annual gross casino revenues could top ADollars 2bn by the late-1990s. Mr Packer already has connections with - and a potential direct interest in - the Melbourne property. The Sydney casino has always been seen as a 'prize' because of the city's strong Asian tourist trade. In addition to the upfront licence payment, the state expects to get annual tax revenues of around ADollars 100m once it starts operating. The Leighton/Showboat proposal includes a five-star hotel, serviced apartments, a floorshow theatre and a 2,000-seat lyric theatre, as well as the 'themed' casino with its 170 gaming tables and 1,480 gaming machines. Leighton said the consortium company, called Sydney Harbour Casino, would be floated by 1995.</p>

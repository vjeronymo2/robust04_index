			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Geneva peace talks reach crucial phase THE RENEWED fighting between Croats, Serbs and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia comes as the Bosnian peace talks appeared to have been given a boost by the Bosnian Serb parliament's acceptance of a constitutional framework for Bosnia. The negotiations, due to be resumed in Geneva today, are about to deal with the most controversial element of the international mediators' peace plan - the detailed map of the ten provinces into which Bosnia will be divided. 'There are no illusions; the map discussions will be difficult,' Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman said yesterday. As with the negotiations last week on the constitutional principles, the talks will be attended by the top leaders of the rump Yugoslavia, federal President Dobrica Cosic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Montenegran President Momir Bulatovic. It was President Milosevic's intervention, in particular, which persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to accept the constitutional framework. Anxious not to lose the momentum of the negotiations, the Geneva conference's co-chairmen, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, will urge an agreement on the map during the current session of the talks. They are prepared to draw out the talks as long as necessary. However, given the deep disagreements over territory which still divide the three ethnic groups, a more realistic prospect is that the negotiations will run into the sand by about Tuesday and will be adjourned for a few days to give an opportunity for further bilateral contacts. The mediators' plan provides for the creation of an independent, unified state of Bosnia, divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. But though the Croats have already accepted the provincial map, both the Moslems and Serbs are deeply unhappy with some of the provincial borders. The Moslems, who accounted for more than 40 per cent of Bosnia's population before the conflict began last April, are demanding more land than the approximately 26 per cent which has been allocated to them. The mediators, however, have stressed that the Moslems were mainly city-dwellers and therefore occupied much less land than might have been warranted by the size of their population. The Serbs, who have been assigned about 43 per cent of the territory of Bosnia, clearly do not want to give up the additional 27 per cent, which they now occupy as the result of their military conquests and policy of 'ethnic cleansing.' But they might be prepared to do a deal which would at least ensure that their provinces are joined up by land corridors across Croatian terri tory. At the back of the Bosnian Serbs' minds is that, one day, they will still be able to create an independent Bosnian Serb republic, in spite of the fact that the future constitution of Bosnia-Hercegovina rules out such a solution, unless it is approved by the central government.</p>

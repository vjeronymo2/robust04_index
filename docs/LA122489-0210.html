			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: ORANGE;  </P> <P> 15-YEAR-OLD HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING  </P> <P> A 15-year-old boy was wounded by gunfire during an evening drive-by shooting in  a residential neighborhood, a police spokesman said. The youth, whose identity  was being withheld, was hit once in the leg, said Lt. Steve Ames. He added that  it was not known if the attack was gang related. "Normally these things are,  but we don't know the specific circumstances," Ames said. Ames said that the  youth was standing with a group of friends at the corner of Washington Avenue  and South Park Lane late Friday. As the boy walked away, he heard gunshots in  the neighborhood. Suddenly he spotted a large brown car, possibly a Ford LTD,  rounding the corner at Washington and Park, Ames said. An unidentified man  leaned out the passenger window and fired a handgun at the boy, Ames said. "The  victim jumped over a fence" to escape the gunfire, Ames said, "but he was shot  in the rear of his left thigh." Ames added that police were investigating the  incident. No one else was reported shot in the attack.  </P></p>

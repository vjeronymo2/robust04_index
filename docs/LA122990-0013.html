			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINER HAS MAJOR ROLE AGAIN; USC ROUTS HARVARD  </P> <P> After losing 78 of 116 games during his first four seasons at USC, you would  think Trojan basketball Coach George Raveling would be overjoyed at the  prospect of a 27-point victory.  </P> <P> Not really.  </P> <P> Raveling was angry after watching the Trojans rout Harvard, 103-76, Friday  night before 1,351 at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> "Tonight we lost the contest because we didn't play to the level of our  ability," Raveling said. "The scoreboard said we won, but our play didn't say  the same thing.  </P> <P> "The question we had coming into the game was 'Could we play at a level that we  played against Colorado State and Notre Dame?' The answer was a resounding  'No.'  </P> <P> "We never really were a cohesive unit tonight. We won because we had the better  players."  </P> <P> The Trojans won because they had Harold Miner, Robert Pack and Duane Cooper in  the backcourt.  </P> <P> Miner scored 31 points in 27 minutes as USC (7-1) extended its winning streak  to six.  </P> <P> Miner, who hit 11 of 19 shots, scored more than 30 points for the third time in  eight games this season. The Trojans topped 100 points for the third time this  season.  </P> <P> Miner pumped life into an otherwise dull game with a flying, double-pump,  reverse dunk with 5 1/2 minutes left. He had missed a routine one-handed dunk a  minute earlier.  </P> <P> "I took off too far from the basket," Miner said. "I didn't realize where I was  on the floor."  </P> <P> The Trojans, unbeaten since going to a three-guard offense, continued to  flourish as Pack scored 11 points and matched his career high with 10 assists.  Cooper had a season-high 12 points and four assists.  </P> <P> "I love their guards," Harvard Coach Peter Roby said. "And I'm not talking  about Harold Miner because everybody talks about him and everybody knows how  good he is.  </P> <P> "But if he doesn't have those two other guys out there running the show, then  he's going to be a guy who scores a lot of points on a team that doesn't win  games. Pack and Cooper are terrific because those guys have no ego. All they  want to do is win."  </P> <P> Forward Ronnie Coleman added 18 points for the Trojans and Rodney Chatman had  10 points in a reserve role.  </P> <P> Center Ron Mitchell led Harvard with 18 points, forward Tyler Rullman had 15  points and forward Ralph James added 13 points as the Crimson (2-8) lost its  third consecutive game.  </P> <P> Leading by 21 points, USC seemed to lose interest. Harvard outscored the  Trojans, 11-6, at the start of the second half to move within 14 points.  </P> <P> But Miner took control of the game, scoring eight points in a row. After making  two free throws, Miner hit two three-point shots from the right side.  </P></p>

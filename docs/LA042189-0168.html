			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EX-NEO-NAZI LEADER BURNS OFF 'SYMBOLS OF HATE'  </P> <P> Former neo-Nazi leader Gregory Withrow underwent successful surgery Thursday to  remove two swastika tattoos between his shoulder blades after declaring: "I  would rather have scars on my back than these symbols of hate."  </P> <P> UC San Francisco Medical Center doctors said the 4-square-inch tattoos were  burned off by laser beam and chemicals. Withrow left the hospital immediately  after surgery and neither he nor his surgeon would comment, hospital  spokeswoman Alice Trinkle said.  </P> <P> Withrow said Wednesday that the swastikas were symbols of a life he has now  rejected.  </P> <P> "The surgery is the next step in my evolution away from the white supremacist  movement," said Withrow, 27, who was a founder of the White Students Union and  the Aryan Youth Movement as well as a member of the White Aryan Resistance, the  Ku Klux Klan, the Skinheads, the American Nazi Party and other racist groups.  </P> <P> "Once I get these tattoos off my back, I want nothing else to do with this  stuff," Withrow said. "The further I get away from it, the better I feel. I  know it is going to hurt, and I don't like pain at all, but I would rather have  scars on my back than these symbols of hate."  </P> <P> He said he had been raised by his father to support "Hitler, Nazism, racism,  fascism," but started to sever connections with ultraright groups when he fell  in love with a young woman named Sylvia.  </P> <P> He does not know where she is now, but her name remains tattooed on his right  biceps.  </P> <P> "Until I met her, I never experienced the emotion of love," Withrow said.  </P> <P> His former comrades were not pleased with his new philosophic turn, he said.  </P> <P> In July, 1987, he was attacked with a baseball bat and suffered a broken jaw  and nose and a concussion. A month later, a gang of Skinheads nailed Withrow's  hands to a board and slashed his throat with a razor.  </P> <P> After barely surviving that attack, he said, he quit drinking and taking drugs  and "laid low in the mountains."  </P> <P> He added that there was a second message to young people in his story. Besides  rejecting Nazi philosophy, "People should not get tattoos, especially stupid  tattoos," he said.  </P></p>

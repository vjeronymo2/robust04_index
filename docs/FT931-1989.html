			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructure plan for Pineapple Ms Debbie Moore is to restructure Pineapple, the fitness and fashion retailing group she took private in 1988 after a short but spectacular stock market career. Three London clothes stores have been closed and Pineapple Ltd, one of the subsidiaries, will cease trading, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs out of 150. Ms Moore blamed the closures on bad trading conditions together with high rents and interest rates. She said the rest of the group, consisting of 26 retailing concessions, two dance studios, fashion design and cosmetics, will be unaffected. The Pineapple group is believed to be loss-making; turnover totals about Pounds 5m.</p>

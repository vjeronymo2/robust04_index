			<p>BFN     [Text] Murdiono, minister/state secretary, briefed  reporters on the outcome of talks between President Suharto and  Cambodian co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen at the Merdeka [Presidential] Palace in Jakarta today.    He said that the Government of Cambodia has expressed its  wish for the essential goods from Indonesia to be dispatched  directly to Phnom Penh instead of going through a third country.  In the past, Indonesian goods exported to Cambodia were  delivered through a third country. The leaders had also reached  an agreement on the banking and trade procedures to be observed  by the two countries.    Murdiono said that Indonesia is still in great demand for  the  supply of soybeans to fulfill its domestic needs. For this,  President Suharto suggested that if Cambodia could produce the  commodity, bilateral trade between the two countries could be  stepped up.    Meanwhile, speaking at a news conference at Wisma Negara  [State Guest House] today, Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that  Cambodia will not seek military assistance from Indonesia but  wants to learn more about Indonesian military's experience in  handling the communist and separatist movements.    According to Hun Sen, the only problem that Cambodia faces  now is its internal politics, because the Khmer Rouge group  still wants to remain isolated.</p>

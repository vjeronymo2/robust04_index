			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE/GGD: "EU-Ukraine Partnership Agreement: </F> Probable Signing at Corfu Summit"]    [Text] Brussels, 16 May (BELGA) -- The European Union (EU)  and Ukraine should be signing a partnership agreement in June,  probably at the European summit on the Greek island of Corfu,  and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk could be invited to  attend this twice yearly meeting of European heads of state and  government for this purpose, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy  Claes indicated on Monday.    The agreement, as signed by the two parties in Brussels in  March, has been held over pending ratification by the Ukrainian  Parliament of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty].    At a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the Belgian foreign  minister recommended that the EU should adopt an uncompromising  position, believing that this would help strengthen Mr.  Kravchuk's authority. But most of his colleagues favored an  immediate signing, thereby forcing Ukraine to sign the NPT  before ratification of the partnership agreement by the European  Parliament and the national assemblies of the Twelve.    The ministers also confirmed their commitment to EU  financial  aid for Ukraine, notably by funding the purchase by the Kiev  authorities of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides in order to  relaunch a farming sector which has fallen into decay due to  lack of funds.    The ministers also discussed at length the question of civil  nuclear power. They were unanimous in calling for the shutdown  of reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, seriously  damaged following an accident in April 1986.    (On Monday afternoon, the Kiev authorities requested  financial aid in order to allow them to permanently shut down  Chernobyl and ensure energy supplies for Ukraine.)    In return, the Twelve expressed a willingness to contribute  to financial aid granted in the framework of the G7 (a grouping  of the world's seven most industrialized nations) in order to  complete the construction of two new nuclear power stations.  Mr. Claes stated that these new reactors are already between 90  and 70 percent finished.    The Belgian minister did, however, express some reservations  regarding the future of the civil nuclear program in Ukraine.  "I do not believe it is wise to envisage the continued  production of nuclear energy in Ukraine. There are other  alternative solutions, such as the sale of electricity at very  low prices while waiting for traditional power stations to be  built," he told the assembled press.</p>

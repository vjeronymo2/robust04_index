BY DAVID HEILBRONER (PANTHEON  BOOKS: $19.95; 280 PP.; 0-394-58191-1)  </P> <P> David Heilbroner's vivid account of his three years as an assistant district  attorney in Manhattan should be compulsory reading for every politician whose  answer to crime is more jails and longer sentences. The criminal-law system  revealed here is an insatiable bureaucracy whose single goal is to "keep the  cases moving" without much regard to notions of justice. In this system, which  Heilbroner calls "assembly-line litigation," the gravity of a crime is  measured, ultimately, by what it's worth in a plea bargain rather than by the  degree to which it offends the social contract.  </P> <P> In "Rough Justice," Heilbroner shows how he attempted to obey the bureaucratic  imperative without becoming a bureaucrat. Tellingly, after three years, he  resigned.  </P> <P> Heilbroner, whose father is a professor and whose mother writes children's  books, seems an unlikely prosecutor. He had been attracted to the job of  district attorney because he thought it would satisfy his curiosity about the  "dark world of criminal law" while putting his law degree to a socially useful  purpose. And he had been encouraged by his first mentor at the office, who told  new recruits that they had not been hired merely to "win cases and seek the  maximum penalty" but to "do justice."  </P> <P> There is nothing more seductive to a freshly coined lawyer than that siren  song; doing justice, after all, is the ratio decidendi of the profession. In  theory, prosecutors, with their significant discretionary powers, actually may  be in a position to carry out the collective fantasy. As Heilbroner points out,  it is the prosecutor who decides whether to file a case or seek a grand-jury  indictment, whether to reduce a charge or even dismiss a weak case in the  interests of justice. While a defense attorney has but a single client to  represent, the prosecutor, as attorney for the People, represents the system  itself -- the system by which justice, however imperfectly, must be dispensed.  </P> <P> Yet, as Heilbroner soon learned, in practice the prosecutor's discretionary  powers are circumscribed by both political and bureaucratic necessity. For  instance, district attorneys are sometimes compelled to crack down on  relatively minor criminal activity in response to constituent complaints --  witness the prostitution sweeps in Hollywood a few years back. Inevitably, the  effect of such a hard line is to clog up court calendars with marginal cases  that would otherwise have been rejected at filing or reduced. More often, it's  simply the need to keep the cases moving that sets the limits on the exercise  of discretion.  </P> <P> With so many cases, only a few can be considered thoughtfully and only a tiny  fraction can make it to trial. The system's solution? Squeeze dazed pleas of  guilty from unsophisticated criminal defendants, a process that left Heilbroner  "sick at heart."  </P> <P> Heilbroner also was disillusioned by his relationship with the police. Although  the police are indispensable to the prosecution, police officers and  prosecutors make an uneasy team because each suspects the other may be subtly  selling his teammate out. Police officers complain that prosecutors engage in  legal hair-splitting when they reject meritorious cases or reduce or even  dismiss others. Prosecutors, in turn, may come to believe (as did Heilbroner)  that the police routinely violate proscriptions against illegal searches and  seizures and then lie about the violations in order to secure filings and  convictions.  </P> <P> Clearly, the two sides are operating under different notions of justice, making  clashes both inevitable and rancorous. Heilbroner was sufficiently upset by his  experience with what he sees as police duplicity that he advocates fining and  ultimately prosecuting officers who engage in illegal searches, seizures and  arrests. What the police thought about him is not recorded.  </P> <P> Heilbroner is equally dubious about another of the system's sacred cows, the  insanity defense. Under the M'Naughten Rule, first set forth in the mid-19th  Century, a criminal defendant could not be held responsible for his crimes if  "a disease of the mind" prevented his knowing the "nature and quality of his  acts" or distinguishing "right from wrong." The M'Naughten Rule remains the  cornerstone of the modern insanity defense.  </P> <P> One of Heilbroner's early assignments was to the city's insane asylum, where he  represented the People at hearings that determined whether inmates adjudged  criminally insane had become "non-dangerous" and eligible for release. It was  here that he came up against the contradictions inherent in the insanity  defense.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that the inmates were compelled to commit their criminal  acts by mental illness, nonetheless Heilbroner observed that their illness "did  not rob them of the ability to understand what they were doing at the time  (they committed the crimes), or (to) grasp the proceedings that determined  their fate." How, then, he wondered, could the insanity plea be justified?  Putting this question to his supervisor, he was told that the insanity defense  is "the right thing to do. End of story."  </P> <P> Right by whose standards? the reader may well ask. Implied throughout  Heilbroner's book is the question of whether the criminal-justice system has  any moral content at all, or if it operates simply on principles of  bureaucratic and political expediency. The question was vividly dramatized for  me in a little story Heilbroner tells about being yelled at by a judge who  found Heilbroner's plea offer on a "farebeat," e.g., a defendant charged with  hopping a subway turnstile, excessive. Because the defendant had many previous  arrests, Heilbroner asked for 60 days. The incredulous judge replied, "Sixty  days for a farebeat? Listen, Mister, you better get it together or you'll be  practicing law in Poughkeepsie."  </P> <P> "Getting it together" means, in this context, learning how to keep the cases  moving. To that end, each offense, from farebeat to first-degree murder, is  worth a certain amount of time from which there is virtually no variation. This  kind of law-by-numbers may move things along but what it provides is  statistical uniformity, not justice.  </P> <P> Heilbroner clearly is troubled by this lack of justice but fails to truly  grapple with his concern. His book suffers from a sort of identity crisis in  that he wants to have written both a picaresque memoir of his passage through  the criminal justice system and an indictment of that system. Some of his  anecdotes actually serve his polemic purposes, but many seem included simply  for their bizarreness.  </P> <P> Perhaps his literary purposes would have been better served either through  fiction or a frank nonfiction expose. Still, "Rough Justice" is a useful  antidote to the lynch-mob mentality that the mere mention of crime seems to  inspire these days, a mentality perhaps best typified by gubernatorial  candidates posing proudly next to the pictures of criminal defendants whom they  promise they will, if elected, send to their deaths.  </P> <P> BOOK MARK: For an excerpt from "Rough Justice," see Opinion, Page 5.  </P></p>

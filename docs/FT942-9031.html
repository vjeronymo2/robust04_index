			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Balaguer secures narrow poll lead President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic took a narrrow lead yesterday as counting continued from Monday's election, opening the prospect of a seventh term in office for the veteran leader. With nearly half of the 3.3m votes counted, Mr Balaguer's Social Christian Reform Party had 43.6 per cent, with the Dominican Liberation Party of Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, on 40.47 per cent. The count was accompanied by charges of fraud and irregularities from the Dominican Liberation Party and others contesting the election. Mr Pena Gomez said yesterday he would ask for new elections in several provinces where many people, most of whom he claimed were his party's supporters, were unable to vote. The election was subject to 'major fraud' perpetrated by the ruling party, he said. Reform Party officials yesterday dismissed the charges as 'fiction.' Hundreds of thousands of voters were prevented from casting ballots on Monday either because their voting cards were confiscated by the military and the police, or because their names were not on lists of voters. Mr Pena Gomez, who is black, claimed that many of those prevented from voting were told that they were not Dominicans but illegal immigrants from neighbouring Haiti. The elections commission extended voting by three hours on Monday night following the charges. Public opinion polls before the election indicated a close win for Mr Pena Gomez, 54, a social democrat and a former mayor of the capital Santo Domingo. Reform Party officials always maintained Mr Balaguer, 87, would win. Political tension was high yesterday as the votes were being counted. The army imposed an undeclared curfew in several cities following outbreaks of shooting.</p>

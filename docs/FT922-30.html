			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Revamped AES set to make profit ASSOCIATED Energy Services, the construction, household goods and industrial equipment group where Mr John Broad and Mr John Mullarkey were last October appointed chairman and managing director respectively as part of a rescue package, saw pre-tax losses increase from Pounds 199,000 to Pounds 1.07m for the year to November 30. Turnover amounted to Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.43m). Losses per share were 3.58p (0.78p). The group now comprises two main divisions: Guardian (Southern), the piling and underpining group which Mr Broad and Mr Mullarkey bought into the group, and Howlett Group Services, the original building and environmental operation. There is also a smaller cellular communications offshoot. Management accounts for the period from December 1 to June 30 will be published shortly and these should show a trading profit, Mr Broad said. Dividends would be paid as soon as retained reserves and cash flow allowed. The company intends to consolidate its ordinary capital from 1p share to 5p shares, apply to move from the USM to the main market and change its name to Guardian Group.</p>

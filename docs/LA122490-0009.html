			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GENIUS FOR POLITICS, BUT WHAT ELSE?;  </P> <P> MARIO CUOMO: HE HAS AN EXQUISITE SENSE OF TIMING AND WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT  UNLESS HE'S SURE TO WIN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN GOVERN.  </P> <P> Will Mario Cuomo run for President in 1992? The answer is simple and will  persuade anyone who overlooks its slight defect of not being an answer at all.  </P> <P> Mario Cuomo will run for President if he senses he will win. He won't if he  senses he will lose. He will have judged correctly in either case. Those  assessments of the political future that are un-useful speculations for the  rest of us are dead certainties for him. He always knows.  </P> <P> Cuomo's peculiar gift is a genius for politics, which is not, to be sure, the  same thing as a genius for governing. When his wind is up as an orator, he can  more than occasionally bemuse his auditors, not to say himself, into thinking  him a lonely antagonist of destiny. But what he really is, instead, is  destiny's favored messenger.  </P> <P> On Labor Day, 1989, New York's Democratic mayoral primary was approaching its  climax with most observers unconvinced that Edward Koch's official franchise  for giving offense might not extend to another four years. Then Cuomo greeted  the Labor Day marchers with the wickedly wistful expression of the hope that  New York would find leaders of the sort who heal rather than wound. He cited  David Dinkins and two other officeholders. He did not mention the incumbent  mayor; it could be felt with resistless conviction that all was up for Koch.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the governor roused the New York Daily News strikers with  incandescences of solidarity. He closed the question while men of good will and  bad alike were still struggling to keep it open. No sensible politician could  conceivably thus flame for the oppressed if he could remotely imagine that the  oppressor might have a chance to pay him back.  </P> <P> I have one or two friends who have crossed the News picket line and many more  who have refused to; and the abandonment of all hope of a happy ending for any  of them is a bitter thought. But Cuomo can be trusted never to throw caution to  the winds if he feels the faintest breath of a breeze in the air. There is no  appealing his cool and sober judgment; he had but to strike the opening chord  of destiny's overture to persuade the ear that the curtain will fall upon the  death of the Daily News.  </P> <P> There are complaints that Cuomo's views on the Persian Gulf crisis are  inscrutable. They are likely to stay that way so long as the event itself  remains so inscrutable that even destiny cannot think of the lines to prompt  him. Our official policy seems to have arrived at a condition of incoherence  that suggests management of the sort that puzzles itself as much as it does its  antagonist.  </P> <P> Uncertainties of this sort do not fit Cuomo's style, which depends upon  exquisite subtleties of timing inapplicable to messy and unresolved situations.  Economy of effort marks the genius for politics; its highest art is waiting  until the candidate for disposal wanders to the edge of the abyss and then  giving the unobtrusively slight shove that carries him all the way down to the  coroner's verdict of suicide.  </P> <P> That was the fashion of Cuomo's dealings with Koch and it apparently obtains  for his dealings with the Daily News. It was also the fashion of Joe McCarthy's  riddance by Dwight Eisenhower, who may have been our last President to combine  an acute genius for politics with a considerable talent for governing when he  had to -- and who at the same time contrived to keep both secret from observers  thought wiser than he.  </P> <P> A genius for politics never permits itself a calculated stroke without its  proper disguise as the spontaneous expression of a heart that can be silent no  longer. If Cuomo runs for President, he will win. If he doesn't, he would have  lost. How do I know? I don't have to; Cuomo will. A genius for politics is that  rarest of presences, the one that frees us from guessing for ourselves because  it somehow knows for sure.  </P></p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Attack On Baghdad: Saddam finds it's business as usual for White House JUST in case the rest of the world was in any doubt, Saturday night's missile attack on Baghdad has underlined that, for the Clinton administration, it is business as usual with Iraq. The brief speculation during President Bill Clinton's first three months in the White House that he might adopt a less confrontational response to the provocations of President Saddam Hussein has been answered. The Iraqi leader can now abandon any remaining hope that Mr Clinton would be even marginally more accommodating than former President George Bush. The message had already been clearly spelled out last month by Mr Martin Indyk, the director for Near East and south Asian affairs at the National Security Council. In a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Mr Indyk laid out the broad lines of US policy, a core part of which was the perception that the threats posed by Iraq and Iran had at all costs to be contained. Because the US was now the sole superpower in the region, the need to sustain either country as a bulwark against the ambitions of the other had gone. Both were to be treated equally as fundamental threats to US interests in the Middle East. Mr Indyk stressed that Washington did not seek or expect a reconciliation with President Saddam's regime. 'Our purpose is deliberate,' he said. 'It is to establish clearly and unequivocally that the current regime in Iraq is a criminal regime, beyond the pale of international society and, in our judgment, irredeemable.' It is against that assessment that the missile attack on Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad has to be seen. From the American perspective there was a proven Iraq attempt on the life of Mr Bush, and the response was appropriate. The shortcomings of US policy are as obvious as ever. Since the third year of the eight-year war with Iran, President Saddam has survived in large part by posing as the saviour of his people against external aggression. The US missile attack on a Baghdad suburb, which also killed civilians, is further grist to his propaganda mill. It will probably not have weakened his grip on power in any way, despite the impact of worsening economic conditions on the majority of Iraqis. In the wider region the reaction of Egypt, a key US ally in the Arab world, reveals the nervousness of America's friends. 'I wish that American policies were as strict towards the crimes the Serbs carry out against Bosnia-Hercegovina, which violate all legitimacy and international conventions,' said Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister. Others would have added a string of other examples, most emphatically the US attitude towards Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Heights and south Lebanon. While the Clinton administration argues that it must contain the ambitions of countries such as Iran and Iraq in order to make an Arab-Israeli peace agreement possible, some of America's Arab friends believe it has the opposite effect. They fear that the emotional impact on Arab populations of US military strikes on Baghdad strengthens opponents of the peace process and bolsters opposition groups, especially Islamic radicals, in countries where governments are generally sympathetic to the west. Equally, it will be used in Tehran by those factions within the regime which are against any attempt to present a more tolerant face to the outside world. The Clinton administration has already identified Iran as the world's foremost sponsor of terrorism. It has urged other governments to do everything within their power to deny weapons to Iran and squeeze the country economically, arguing it is vital to act now while Tehran's ambitions still outstrip its capabilities. The unproven assumption is that if the economic pips are squeezed hard enough, populations will rise up and remove their political masters. Such has not yet been shown to be the case in Iraq, and probably will apply equally to Tehran, where the regime is no less vigorous in responding to any internal challenges. By linking the regimes of the two countries so simplistically, the US has bitten off a large chunk of the Middle East with which to be in confrontation. It is a policy which demands a substantial, continuing military presence in the area and, no less critically, the wholehearted support of its regional allies, primarily Saudi Arabia together with the other five members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, and Egypt. So while there is no love lost between Baghdad and Tehran, there is likely to be a growing coincidence of interest between the two regimes in seeking to undermine American policy at its most vulnerable - that is, among its local allies. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has said several times that Iran is behind the current wave of terrorism designed to destabilise his government, while there have been renewed signs in Saudi Arabia of the Islamic right flexing its political muscle. The dominance of US military power conferred by the collapse of the Soviet Union offers no answer to populist movements in the Middle East, and has limited effect in weakening the hold of dictatorial governments. Yet, in the absence of progress towards the resolution of long-standing Arab grievances, primarily the Arab-Israel conflict, it will be seen in the region as the primary tool of a selective American policy. There was widespread disappointment among Arab peace negotiators at the departure in January of Mr Bush, and that earlier of Mr James Baker, his secretary of state. The two men had been credited with a genuine commitment to securing a Middle East peace settlement acceptable to the Arabs, and a readiness to twist Israeli arms. Doubts persist whether that commitment is as fully shared by Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher. If, after the latest attack on the Iraqi regime, it appears to many Arabs that Mr Clinton has inherited Mr Bush's readiness for military action, but less of his muscle in promoting a peace agreement, then hostility towards the US in the Middle East is likely to grow.</p>

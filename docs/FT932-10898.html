			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Yield gap narrows between French and German paper THE YIELD gap between the French and German government bonds broke through the 40 basis points barrier yesterday, with the market believing that a further cut in French interest rates was imminent. The spread between the 8.50 per cent OAT due 2003 and the 7.125 per cent bund due 2002 at one stage narrowed to 38 basis points and was still at 39 basis points late in the afternoon. This compares with 71 basis points just before the French general election on March 21. Explanations include the view that France, against the background of a strong currency, has further scope to cut interest rates independently of Germany. Another  1/4 point fall in the intervention rate would bring it to 8 per cent, still a little above German levels. With France described as 'flavour of the month', some economists say the spread could narrow to 20 basis points. THE Bundesbank's auction of DM4.53bn of 6 3/4 per cent 10-year government bonds was more easily absorbed than expected. The average price was 99.9, giving a 6.76 per cent yield. This helped the 10-year bund to gain about  1/4 point and the market was generally stronger across the yield curve, with some backing from the strong overnight performance of US Treasury stock. A 4 basis point cut in the repo rate to 7.71 per cent was in line with the re-established view that the Bundesbank will carry on with small cuts for some time. Hope has faded that the recent larger reductions in the Lombard, discount and repo rates heralded a run of faster, deeper cuts. The Bundesbank Council meets today, but nothing startling was expected by way of either comment or action. The June futures contract opened at 94.87 and closed just over 20 basis points higher. MOODY'S decision to downgrade Italy's foreign currency debt sent the Italian government bond market into a one point fall. This was contrary to the trend in other continental markets. The downgrade takes the rating to less than the level required by some investors. The currency also weakened a little. Some of the lost ground in bond prices was recovered later in the day. The BTP contract closed less than  1/2 point lower at 96.75, still above its level before the appointment of Mr Carlo Ciampi as prime minister - and above the 95.50 prevailing when Moody's launched the review in mid-February. THE UK government bond market had a quiet day, with little to give it direction after last week's fall. A lack of economic indicators and some caution ahead of the next gilt auction announcement were two of the factors behind the vacuum. Caution showed through in the buying of longer-dated index-linked gilts, pushing them up a quarter. US TREASURY prices were mixed late yesterday after the Treasury unveiled its long-awaited plans to cut the frequency of future long bond issues. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104 5/16 , yielding 6.782 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.792 per cent. Prices fluctuated in thin trading throughout the morning as dealers and investors speculated about the Treasury's plans to alter the composition of its quarterly refunding round. Tuesday's news of bigger-than-expected May bill auctions had raised expectations that the size of the May bond issue would be cut. The Treasury said it would reduce the May bond issue and issue 30-year bonds only twice a year, instead of every quarter. To make up the difference, more shorter-dated coupons and bills would be sold.</p>

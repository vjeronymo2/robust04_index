			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Scotland faces new charity rules Pressure to extend some controls on English charities to Scotland will be generated by the report today of a Department of Trade and Industry taskforce set up as part of the government's deregulation exercise. The taskforce has been seeking ways to reduce accounting, fundraising, trading and other burdens on charitable activities and its report will make a number of recommendations in these areas. But as far as Scotland is concerned, it will have the effect of arguing for more regulation. In Scotland the charitable sector is less strongly policed than in England and Wales. There is no Scottish equivalent of the Charity Commissioners and the 1992 Charities Act, designed to tighten up on potential abuse, does not apply there.</p>

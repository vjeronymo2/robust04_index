			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SARAH VAUGHAN  </P> <P> I remember one magical night in Agoura High School Gymnasium about 13 years  ago.  </P> <P> It was a school variety show and Sarah Vaughan sang for us. We were an audience  of students, parents and teachers -- not a very large audience. Vaughan brought  with her that night her own back-up musicians.  </P> <P> It was a night my family and I will never forget. Thank you, Sarah.  </P> <P> LILLIAN SAROIAN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

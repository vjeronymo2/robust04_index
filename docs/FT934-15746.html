			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting up a will trust I WOULD like your opinion about setting up a will discretionary trust into which the first spouse to die puts his/her Pounds 150,000 allowance, with the trustees ensuring that the surviving spouse has the use of the interest and capital. Presumably, the surviving spouse could not be one of the trustees. What do you think of the scheme, and does the Inland Revenue approve? All our investments are held jointly, but I am told they need to be divided before a trust is formed. We assume that your intention in setting up a discretionary trust such as you describe is to utilise your Pounds 150,000 nil rate band in the most tax-efficient manner while, at the same time, retaining an element of flexibility as to whom you wish to benefit. Provided that you have divided your assets (a preliminary step which, I am afraid, is necessary) it would be possible to set up a trust under your will and you could settle Pounds 150,000. We assume that the remaining part of your estate is to be transferred to your wife. In setting up a trust, your wife could be nominated as a beneficiary and you could leave a letter of wishes with the trustees, directing them to exercise their discretion in making payments to her from time to time. But she would have no legal entitlement to such payments. Obviously, in such a case, your wife's position would be somewhat precarious; and if her livelihood depended upon inheriting your share of the jointly-owned assets, then the discretionary trust is not a device which would suit you. If you wish your wife to have a legal entitlement in the trust, then the creation of a life interest in her favour is necessary. This, however, would negate the tax planning achieved by setting up a discretionary trust in the first place. This is because the trust funds in which the life interest subsists would be regarded as forming part of her estate on her death (which result would have occurred, anyway, if your assets were still owned jointly).

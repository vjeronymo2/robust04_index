			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "The Fleet Sets Sail, But </F> Uncertainty Still Surrounds the Anti-Knight Role"]    [Text] Rome -- The "habemus papam" ["we have a pope"] came  at 2030. It was uttered by Davide Visani -- the Botteghe Oscure  [PDS headquarters] bigwig who had been sitting at a negotiating  table which occasionally resembled a boxing ring -- thus  announcing the end of the long negotiations between the eight  souls of the progressive camp. An agreement has been reached --  a "positive" understanding which includes a number of "qualified  and important" choices. As from today, then, the left can  actually launch its electoral campaign against what Visani calls  "the old and new right."    The last round ended at about 1800, thus bringing also  another match to a close, namely, the Sicilian match that  resulted in the only serious wound inflicted on the allies by  Rete, which was unshakable in its determination to exclude the  Socialists from single-member constituencies. [Italian  Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Del Turco made a forceful  protest, denouncing the fact that not even the outcome of the  elections in Catania "could convince those who started out with  strongly held positions." Competing with the progressives, the  PSI candidates will in Sicily also run single-member  constituencies, but in a responsible fashion, the PSI secretary  said. "We will not dramatize this disagreement beyond the  confines of the island."    The Sicilian case, they say at the Bottegone [PDS  headquarters], was the last hurdle to be confronted. Basically,  it confirms the fact that [Rete leader] Orlando's troops will  have the lion's share with 26 out of 41 candidates for  single-member districts. In Palermo, Luciano Violante will  serve as a rival attraction, heading the list against [Forza  Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, and -- among others --  Antonino Caponnetto, Pietro Folena, Alfredo Galasso, and Gaspare  Nuccio will be running in single-member constituencies. In  eastern Sicily, the best known names are those of Anna  Finocchiaro, Giuseppe Ayala, Claudio Fava, Tano Grasso, and  Franco Corleone.    The greatest uncertainties have also been dispelled in the  Lazio region, even though there is still some doubt concerning  the identity of the progressive candidate in the toughest  contest of all -- that against Silvio Berlusconi in the Rome 1  constituency, in the elections for the lower house. This  constituency is a prestigious showcase including the historical  sites -- and some are not hiding the possibility of a  "sensational surprise," consisting of an "unimpeachable and  outstanding" personality entering the field to take advantage of  the 3 percent lead won by the progressives in the area following  last December's contest between [Rome mayor] Rutelli and  [National Alliance leader] Fini. At the regional coalition  headquarters, however, they were saying that it was almost  certain that the candidate would be Loredana De Petris, from  Rome, aged 36, who was a member of DP [Proletarian Democracy]  before joining the Greens, whose parliamentary floor leader she  now is. "It came as a surprise, and also a bit of a shock," she  acknowledged in her role as the "philosopher" against the Knight  [Berlusconi's nickname], "but all in all it will probably be an  amusing challenge. Anyway, we will not be fighting only over  such issues as sidewalks which need mending...."    In Rome, following the established tradition, the list will  be headed by the PDS secretary in constituencies with  proportional voting; Giovanna Melandri will be leading AD  [Democratic Alliance], whereas Ottaviano Del Turco will be the  PSI's number one. Catholic Edoardo Missoni, the nephew of the  well-known designer, will meet the impossible challenge posed by  Gianfranco Fini in the Prati constituency. Much safer  constituencies will be fought for by "lightning" minister  Vincenzo Visco, in eastern Rome, and Communist Renewal member  Famiano Crucianelli, who will be contending with Lucio Manisco  for North Viterbo. A good constituency -- Civitavecchia -- also  goes to Carlo Alfredo Moro, the statesman's brother, who has  accepted Carniti's Social Christians' invitation.    Basically, the pattern of the candidacies in the left's  strongholds has been confirmed: Turin acknowledges Communist  Renewal's strength (with Fausto Bertinotti as candidate),  whereas Genoa is garrisoned, among others, by Gino Giugni and  Ferdinando Adornato, heading AD's list. Umbria -- reflecting  the fact that of 12 single-member district candidates, five will  be journalists (Walter Veltroni, Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe  Giulietti, Paolo Raffelli, and Leonardo Caponi) -- has  definitively given the progressive team the nickname of "the  editorial team." In Tuscany, the following candidates will be  standing: Armando Cossutta (in Scandicci), Sergio Garavini  (Arezzo), Mauro Paisan (Pisa), Enrico Boselli (Valdichiana),  Valdo Spini (Florence 3), and Sandra Bonsanti (Florence 1), with  Luigi Berlinguer, Carlo Ripa di Meana, Antonino Caponnetto, and  Willer Bordon heading the lists in the proportional elections.    In Emilia -- traditionally a communist and republican  stronghold -- the safe-constituency strategy prevented the  rescue of Augusto Barbera, who had previously announced that he  was willing to withdraw his candidacy. Among the best known  "parachuted" candidates are Giuseppe Ayala in Ravenna, Claudio  Petruccioli in Bologna-Modena, and Willer Bordon in Rimini --  all of whom are standing as candidates for the Senate. As  regards the lower house, the candidates are -- together with  Occhetto in West Bologna -- Gianni Mattioli in Rimini-Riccione,  Fausto Vigevani in Cesena, Gianfranco Pasquino in one of the  Reggio constituencies, and singer Pierangelo Bertoli in  Piacenza. Giorgio Benvenuto will head AD's list in the  proportional elections.    Among other candidacies which have been confirmed -- in  addition to Franco Bassanini playing the anti-Bossi part in  Milan 1 -- there are Giovanni Raboni and Giandomenico Pisapia,  who will be standing for the Senate in Milan. Giorgio Ruffolo  will head AD's list in Calabria, and Miriam Mafai will be the  lower house candidate for Pescara city -- a comeback, almost 40  years later, following her long experience as a local councillor.</p>

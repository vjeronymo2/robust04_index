			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: HERE'S TO YOU, SENORA ROBINSON;  </P> <P> IN PRAISE OF THE STEPMOTHER BY MARIO VARGAS LLOSA TRANSLATED BY HELEN LANE  (FARRAR, STRAUS GIROUX: $18.95; 148 PP.)  </P> <P> Advancing age tends to rearrange the eyesight so that in order to see the page  clearly, you hold it farther away. After grappling intimately, stylishly, with  the aching turbulence of Latin America, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas  Llosa has taken a witty distance to construct a lucid literary artifact.  </P> <P> "In Praise of the Stepmother" is a toy, but rather on the order of the gold  clockwork nightingales in Yeats' Byzantium. It says a heartlessly lofty thing  or two about human folly, though it has a good deal of fun, some lascivious, in  doing so; and imparts it to us as a Japanese chef might impart a blowfish:  pleasure on the edge of poison.  </P> <P> The story of the exquisite Don Rigoberto, his beautiful and susceptible second  wife, Lucrecia, and her golden-curled, limpid-eyed little stepson, Fonchito, is  a comically cautionary tale. Rigoberto arranges himself an earthly paradise; it  implodes on him. Build yourself a better mousetrap, and you will inevitably  fall into it.  </P> <P> Rigoberto is the dull though prosperous manager of a Lima insurance company.  Thedullness is like the facade of a Spanish-colonial house: uncommunicative  white walls, iron-barred windows and, in the interior, a flowering patio with  songbirds. As a youth, Rigoberto joined Catholic Action in order to fashion a  more perfect world. Now, middle-aged, he labors devotedly to fashion a perfect  world for himself in the castle of his home.  </P> <P> Perfection means assiduous cultivation of his body: his health, his toilette,  his excretory functions. Like an alchemist turning lead to gold, he spends  hours each evening cleaning, pumicing, trimming, polishing and perfuming  himself. All this perfecting, this body worship, has as its object the bodily  worship of Lucrecia, and the achievement of superb nightly orgasms.  </P> <P> Rigoberto and Lucrecia are labored over -- by Rigoberto; we shall see about  Lucrecia -- with the inspiration that goes into a work of art. To assist his  fantasies, Rigoberto has collected erotic paintings, prints and texts. And the  successive chapters of Vargas Llosa's brief book -- as polished as Rigoberto's  armpits, or his talcumed feet that give off "a slight, virile odor of  heliotrope at dawn" -- meld the story with selected paintings.  </P> <P> Colored plates of these, mostly celebrated and sensual, are inserted for the  reader. The effect of Jordaens' Gyges and King Candaules spying on the king's  bathing wife, of Boucher's "Diana at the Bath," of Titian's "Venus With Cupid  and Music" as successive keynotes for the text is not illustration so much as a  gently sardonic hyperinflation.  </P> <P> Rigoberto, for example, who among other fixations is specially fond of  buttocks, proclaims himself to Lucrecia as King Candaules showing off to Gyges  the splendid proportions of what he likes to inflame himself by calling his  wife's "croup."  </P> <P> The thing about fantasies, though, is that everyone can play. Lucrecia acts out  Rigoberto's with wifely devotion, but she has her own. She too sees herself as  Venus, but a Venus whose particular arousal comes not from her lord and master  but from the Cupids fluttering about her. The cover of the book -- a detail  from Bronzino's all-but-drooling portrait of the goddess in high excitement  from the child tweaking her nipple -- clearly foretells what will happen.  </P> <P> Fonchito will. Beautiful as a cherub, amoral as the tiny love-god, malevolent  as a vengeful Puck, he seduces his stepmother. More exactly, he helps her to  seduce herself. What comes of it need not be described here, but at the end,  Lucrecia has been thrown out, Rigoberto has turned to prayer and mortification  -- we are helpfully offered Fra Angelico's "Annunciation" as the final colored  plate -- and Fonchito reigns.  </P> <P> "Fresh, round and full, childish, his laughter drowned out the sound of the  water in the washbasin, appeared to fill the whole night and mount to those  stars which, for once, had appeared in the muddy sky of Lima," Vargas Llosa  concludes.  </P> <P> The author is silky; so is Helen Lane's translation. Vargas Llosa has written a  genuinely erotic story and a marvelous parody of one. The epigraph by Cesar  Moro strikes precisely the note of Gallic intellectualism that he seeks: sex as  discourse, with roots going back to Laclos and Sade:  </P> <P> "It is only natures entirely given over to vice whose contours do not grow  blurred in the hyaline mire of the atmosphere."  </P> <P> From there we get the foolishly exalted comedy of Rigoberto's absolutions. At  stool, he conducts a delicate rite of purification. "You're gone, you rascal  you," he interpolates the results, "and can't ever return." Fantasies of  perfection are punctured by fantasies of beastliness. A deformed face by  Francis Bacon allows him to imagine himself as a monstrous, boil-inflamed nose,  seducing women by allowing them to confront their own secret shames and fears  of ugliness.  </P> <P> Lucrecia's transports with Fonchito, equally parodic, are less amusing;  probably because, more innocent, she will be the more abominably victimized.  Paradoxically -- eroticism is paradoxical by its nature -- they are more  genuinely sexy.  </P> <P> In fact, Rigoberto's lucubrations are not really about sex at all, but about  power. If Vargas Llosa's toy has a message beyond its inveigling clockwork, it  is here. Behind the macho is the solipsist. The Spanish yo is the strongest and  most assertive of first-person singulars; much more so than the frailer English  I, the French je, the German ich.  </P> <P> Rigoberto's ultimate fantasy concerns not fornication but reigning alone,  untouchable, immune to any external contingency. If you cannot rule the world,  you can dictate to your body, your senses, your bedchamber. Is Vargas Llosa  aiming at the ungovernability of a male society made up entirely of one-subject  dictators? Somewhat, I think. In any event, Fonchito is an agent of  revolutionary chaos that goes far beyond Don Rigoberto's perfumed domestic  arrangements.  </P></p>

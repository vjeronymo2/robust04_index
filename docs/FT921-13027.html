			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Liverpool steps up to blow its own trumpet / A report on moves to woo US investors On July 5 1981, British police first used CS gas against rioters on the streets of Toxteth in Liverpool. But while the city's riots might have seared into the British collective memory, they caused barely a blink in the US, which is about to become the focus for a promotional push by the Merseyside Development Corporation. The MDC, a government-funded organisation set up in 1981, is about to ride a PR-marketing caravan into the US east coast, where public awareness of north-west England's problems is low. Just before Christmas, Liverpool City Council was owed nearly Pounds 200m in unpaid taxes, costing Pounds 15,000 a day in interest charges. In October, Derek Hatton, former deputy leader of the left-wing City Council, was arrested by police investigating allegations of corruption. Hattonism - a blend of jocular toughness and ultra-leftist agit-prop - still has a healthy grass-roots presence in Liverpool. The MDC is presumably hoping that some ignorance - in the US - is bliss. MDC's original aim was to regenerate some 800 acres - now 2,372 acres - of the Merseyside and Wirral waterfront and over the last decade, the government has provided Pounds 250m. On February 5, the citizens of Washington DC will be able to see where Pounds 150,000 of that has gone, when they listen to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Libor Pesek. The RLPO will be doing an 11-city tour of the eastern seaboard, sponsored by the MDC as part of a campaign which it hopes will attract Pounds 1bn of investment from foreign companies over the next decade. Jean Waters, MDC's marketing manager, is frank about the reasons for the sponsorship: 'By sponsoring the orchestra's tour, the MDC is trying to make sure that we get onto the shopping lists of businesses on the US east coast.' Last July the MDC sent out 5,000 mailshots targeted on high-tech, pharmaceutical, food and motor industries in that part of the US. Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool university, a former member of the MDC board, resigned largely because of its 'obsession with creating tourism, office and retail developments rather than manual worker-oriented jobs'. Minford emphasises that his complaints may need readjusting under the new boss, Desmond Pitcher, group chief executive of the Littlewoods Organisation, who took over the helm of MDC in April 1991. The US campaign will be a litmus test. Pitcher apparently understands the scale of the task: 'The practical reality is that we have got to reverse 50 years of dereliction. The administration and management of the city in the recent past has been poor.' He also admits that there has been a reluctance by British investors to re-locate in Liverpool. 'When I recently spoke to the key institutions with long-standing investments in Liverpool, I expected a raspberry. But instead they were very pleased with the high yield on their investments. It's changing; only 3 per cent of all commercial property in the area is currently available for renting.' Minford wants to see the MDC attract manufacturers into the area. 'A good example of the sort of scheme is that which attracted Nissan to Tyne and Wear, or Japanese electronics factories to south Wales.' Maybe the MDC is now set on a marketing course which will start that slow process. Robert Odell, an American who handles marketing for MDC in the US, acknowledges that Liverpool may have an image problem in Britain. 'In the US when you say Liverpool, you get one of two responses. Either it's Paul McCartney and the Beatles, or people have a neutral feeling.' In any case, 374 US companies have taken up the initial mailshot, and Desmond Pitcher has 25 meetings arranged with US companies to coincide with the orchestral tour. If those meetings result in some lasting, job-creating investment, the MDC's Pounds 1.2m marketing budget for this year might itself prove to have been a clever investment.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX-SHOW SENTENCES DISALLOWED;  </P> <P> COURT: STATE JUSTICES SAY A JURY TRIAL IS APPROPRIATE TO CONTEST CHARGES OF  PERMITTING LEWD ACTS AND PROSTITUTION IN VIOLATION OF A COURT ORDER.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that sex-show operators and others are  entitled to a jury trial to contest charges of permitting lewd acts and  prostitution in violation of a court order.  </P> <P> The justices struck down the six-month jail terms and $62,000 in fines facing  James and Artie Mitchell of San Francisco in a contempt proceeding brought  without a jury under the state Red Light Abatement Law.  </P> <P> The court, in a lead opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, noted that even  though the sentences were imposed for contempt, their severity matched that for  violations of many criminal misdemeanors. "The California Constitution  guarantees the defendant the right to trial by jury in such a proceeding,"  Eagleson wrote.  </P> <P> The decision marked the second time the case has come before the state high  court -- and the justices Thursday reached substantially the same result as in  a previous January, 1987, ruling under then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.  </P> <P> Shortly after Bird and two other justices defeated in the fall, 1986, election  left office, the new and more conservative court voted quickly to reconsider  the theater case and five other recently issued rulings by the old court. In  five other cases, however, Bird court decisions were rejected or significantly  modified.  </P> <P> Significant Ruling  </P> <P> The decision was hailed by an attorney for the Mitchells as a significant  expansion of the right to a jury trial. "Historically, the jury has been a  fundamental protection of the citizen against overzealous prosecutors and  pliant judges," said Thomas Steel of San Francisco. "In a case like this, where  emotions often run high, a jury is especially important. It keeps the average  citizen in the process of decision-making."  </P> <P> Amitai Schwartz, who represented the Bar Assn. of San Francisco in urging the  justices to uphold the jury-trial right, said: "It's good to see the California  Constitution is alive and well. . . . There's been no retreat."  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Sullivan expressed disappointment with the  ruling but declined to speculate on its potential effect. "We felt we had a  reasonable argument against a jury trial here," Sullivan said. "But obviously  the court disagreed. We accept that."  </P> <P> In Thursday's action, the court set down other restrictive guidelines for  contempt proceedings under the venerable abatement act, a law that allows  officials to proceed against businesses that offer lewd performances and  prostitution.  </P> <P> The justices ruled that violators of injunctions in such cases may be charged  with only one count of contempt for every day prohibited acts occur -- rather  than being charged with one count per act. Permitting a $1,000 fine for each  lewd act would be "totally out of proportion," the court observed.  </P> <P> And while as an alternative, violators may be held liable for contempt without  a jury trial under a separate, more lenient law -- one with a maximum five days  in jail and $1,000 fine -- the accused must be notified at the outset under  which law prosecutors intend to proceed, the court said.  </P> <P> The ruling resulted from a nine-year legal battle between authorities and the  Mitchell brothers, proprietors of a well-known film and live adult-theater  business that has operated for more than 20 years here.  </P> <P> In 1980, San Francisco prosecutors filed a public-nuisance action against the  Mitchells and theater manager Vincent Stanich under the abatement law. A court  injunction was issued barring the men from allowing acts of "lewdness or  prostitution" at the theater.  </P> <P> In 1982, police visiting the premises over a four-day period charged that  performers permitted patrons to engage in oral copulation and other acts off  stage in return for tips. On stage, police said, performers engaged in several  lewd acts with other performers.  </P> <P> After a hearing without a jury, Superior Court Judge Frank W. Shaw found that  the three men had violated the injunction. Under provisions of the abatement  law, the two Mitchells were each fined $62,000 -- $1,000 for each of 62 lewd  acts. Stanich was fined $6,200 -- $100 for each act. All three were sentenced  to the maximum six months in jail but the sentences were stayed pending appeal.  </P> <P> In Thursday's decision, the court noted that the state Constitution guaranteed  trial by jury for all alleged misdemeanors as well as felonies. By clear  implication, the justices said, such protection was intended to extend to other  proceedings where jail terms and fines were as severe as that for some  misdemeanors.  </P> <P> The court rejected the theater operators' contention that there was  insufficient evidence of lewd acts or prostitution occurring in violation of  the injunction.  </P> <P> The justices found, however, that there was not enough proof that Stanich, the  manager, had been able to prevent the acts that took place. While the Mitchell  brothers could be retried, Stanich may not, the court said.  </P> <P> All six court members who participated in the case agreed that the contempt  judgments must be invalidated. Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the newest member of  the court, did not participate.  </P> <P> Justice Stanley Mosk, in a concurring opinion, said he did not believe  prosecutors should be allowed to proceed under the more lenient contempt  statute in order to prevent defendants from receiving a jury trial.  </P> <P> In another decision Thursday, the court reaffirmed its previously imposed ban  on testimony induced by hypnosis -- but ruled that in some instances, witnesses  may still testify about their recollections before they were hypnotized.  </P> <P> The court, ruling in a 1979 San Mateo County murder case, reversed the  defendant's conviction because post-hypnotic testimony identifying him as the  killer was erroneously allowed. But on retrial, the witness will be permitted  to testify about events that she recalled and related before hypnosis, the  justices said.  </P> <P> A 1985 state law sharply restricts the use of pre-hypnosis testimony to cases  where statements have been preserved in writing or tape and subsequent hypnosis  was performed by licensed experts. But the law, the court said, applies only to  pre-hypnotic evidence taken after the law was passed.  </P></p>

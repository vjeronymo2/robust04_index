			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) All other commissions will be appointed by the Commander, USARCS, to act on any claims referred to the commission regardless of where the claim arose. Commissions appointed by the Commander, USARCS, for units based in CONUS may act on any claim arising out of the operations of their unit. Any claims commission operating in or adjudicating claims arising out of an area within the jurisdiction of a command claims service will comply with the legal and procedural guidance of that service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A commission may operate as an integral part of a command claims service that will determine the cases to be assigned to it, furnish necessary administrative services, and establish and maintain its records. Where a commission does not operate as a part of a command claims service, it may operate as a part of the office of a division, corps or higher command SJA, who will perform the foregoing functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Any appointing authority may relieve a commission appointed by him or her. One copy of each order concerning appointment, relief, or change of responsibility of a commission will be forwarded without delay to the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Normally, the claims commission is responsible for the investigation of all claims referred to it, using the procedures in subpart B, Investigation, and any local procedures established by the appointing authority or command claims service responsible for the area in which the claim arose. The chief of a command claims service can request assistance on claims investigation in their geographical areas from units or organizations other than the claims commission. The Commander, USARCS can do likewise for any claim referred to a commission appointed under his authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) When a foreign claims commission intends to deny a claim, award less than the amount claimed, or recommend an award less that the amount claimed but in excess of its authority, it will notify the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative, in writing by the means most likely to ensure receipt by the claimant, of its intended action on the claim and the legal and factual basis for that action. The purpose of this notice is to give the claimant an opportunity to object to the commission's action and state the reasons for the objection before final action on the claim. Where the commission intends to award the amount claimed or to recommend to higher authority an award equal to the amount claimed, this procedure is not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This notice should be given at least 30 days prior to final action by the commission, except for small claims processed under the provisions of subpart B, Small Claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the commission proposes to make a partial award or to recommend a partial award to higher authority, a settlement agreement should be enclosed with the notice. If the commission is recommending an award in excess of its authority, the agreement should indicate that the recommendation is contingent upon approval by higher authority. Claimants will be advised they may either accept the commission's action by returning the signed settlement agreement or, if they are dissatisfied with the commission's action or recommendation, they may submit a response in writing stating the factual or legal reasons why they believe the commissions proposed action is incorrect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A commission may alter its initial decision based on the claimant's response or proceed with its intended action. If the claimant's response raises a general policy issue, the commission may request an advisory opinion from the Commander, USARCS while retaining the claim for final action at its level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Upon completion of its evaluation of the claimant's response, the commission will notify the claimant of its final decision and advise the claimant that its action is final and conclusive by law (10 U.S.C. 2735), unless the final decision is a recommendation for payment above its authority. In that case, the commission will forward any response submitted by the claimant along with the commission's claims memorandum of opinion to the approval authority and will notify the claimant accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Every reasonable effort should be made to negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement on meritorious claims. When an agreement can be reached, the notice and response provisions above are not necessary. If the commission recommends an award in excess of its authority, the settlement agreement should indicate that its recommendation is contingent upon approval by higher authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.157  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Composition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A foreign claims commission normally will be composed of either one or three members. Alternate members of three-member commissions may be appointed where circumstances require and be substituted for regular members for specific cases by order of the appointing authority. The appointing orders will clearly state who is designated the president of a three-member commission. Two members of a three-member commission will constitute a quorum, and the commission decision will be determined by majority vote.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

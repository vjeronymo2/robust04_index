			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: MIM decline blamed on weak metal prices MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday blamed weak metal prices for a 12 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 46m (Dollars 34.8m) for the nine months to April 5, on sales down 12.6 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn. The result represents a significant improvement over the first six months, when MIM reported a 76 per cent cut in net profits to ADollars 16m, on sales down 10 per cent to ADollars 840m. After including a second-quarter abnormal profit of ADollars 45.7m from the sale of its interest in Teck Corporation, net profits rose to ADollars 91.8m, from ADollars 52.8m the previous comparable period. Net profits fell to ADollars 70m after including foreign exchange losses and minority equity interests. The equivalent profit in the first nine months of last year was ADollars 30m. MIM said profits were affected in the third quarter by weak metals prices, but reported excellent results from the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM subsidiary.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Opposition pressure on Hata grows: LDP and SDP join forces Japan's two main opposition parties have joined forces to step up pressure on the fragile eight-week-old minority government. The Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party have overridden government protests to summon former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to testify before parliament tomorrow over allegations of financial impropriety. Mr Hosokawa resigned in April because of LDP pressure to divulge details of loans from a gangster-linked parcel delivery company. The opposition hopes the hearings will embarrass the ruling coalition and increase the pressure for a vote of no-confidence. The LDP and SDP are internally divided, but if they can agree on the confidence issue, a vote could happen some time after this year's long overdue budget passes the upper house of parliament. This is expected on Wednesday or Thursday, and before the parliamentary session ends on June 29. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, said over the weekend his cabinet would resign to pave the way for the formation of a new government rather than call a general election if a no-confidence vote succeeded. In that event a new coalition would probably include members of the LDP and SDP, Japan's traditional government and opposition respectively for 38 years until last July. A majority of members of parliament signed a petition last week opposing a snap election for fear of delaying popular plans to reform the electoral system. This latest political tremor comes at an inopportune time for Mr Hata because his hands are already full with urgent international business. Fresh talks with the US to resolve the trade deadlock are in full swing and the North Korean crisis is barely under control. Mr Hata's team is also working hard on a deregulation and tax reform package for presentation at the Group of Seven industrial nations' summit in Naples early next month. Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president, is planning to meet Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his Socialist counterpart, this week to seek support for a no-confidence vote. It is not yet clear, however, whether the two opposition leaders have the support of their party ranks, which are split on whether to accept or reject coalition overtures to join the government. Mr Kono is out of line with such powerful LDP elders as former prime minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, and former foreign ministers Mr Michio Watanabe and Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. They want to negotiate a wide and stable alliance of centrist politicians, not unlike the LDP before it started to fragment last summer. Such an alliance would best suit the current political situation, Mr Nakasone said on a visit to Washington last week. Indeed, Mr Watanabe was reported in the Japanese press to have presented plans for a new coalition including the LDP to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's backroom strategist. The SDP's left wing ironically supports uniting with the conservative LDP to bring down the government. Yet the Socialists' right wing represented by Mr Wataru Kubo, the party's second in command, still hopes to rejoin the ruling coalition without LDP help. In the meantime, Mr Ozawa is making use of remaining LDP and SDP hesitation over launching a no-confidence vote, to seek an alliance with members of both camps.</p>

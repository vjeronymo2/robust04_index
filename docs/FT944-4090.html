			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia plans to step up oil exports as output tumbles Russia is to increase its exports of oil - in spite of still tumbling oil production. At the same time, Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, has made a strong plea for extra financing from the budget to invest in the industry. Ministers are now counting on energy exports doubling in the next 10-15 years, as part of a strategic decision to export oil in order to raise funds for the modernisation of the industry. Oil exports are expected to amount to 85m tonnes this year (80m tonnes in 1993) while gas exports should hold steady at about 100bn cu m, according to Mr Vitaly Bushuyev, the deputy energy minister. These aspirations assume cutting back further on sales to the former Soviet states, most of which cannot afford to pay world prices for their oil - and on restricting the supply to the domestic market by energy saving measures. 'The most important part of the strategy is increasing the efficiency of energy consumption,' Mr Shafranik told a commission of ministers on Wednesday. Figures released yesterday to the official news agency, Tass, show some 275.2m tonnes produced from January to November this year - down 12 per cent on the same period last year. Gas production was also down, but much less markedly, at 549.8bn cu metres, a 2.1 per cent fall. The production of the main Russian oil companies was: Rosneft (a holding company including several enterprises), 111.4m tonnes; Lukoil, 39.9m tonnes; Sidako, 31.8m tonnes; and Yukos, 24,8m tonnes. Mr Shafranik, also in comments to TASS, warned that at least Rbs24,000bn (Pounds 4.7bn) were needed for modernisation and reconstruction schemes this year. The coal sector, he said, was in particular need of modernisation - and of the closing down of exhausted pits, something the coal industry committee has yet to tackle.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' PREP BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> COUNTY TEAMS HAVE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW  </P> <P> It might be tough for girls' basketball teams in Orange County to match last  season's playoff performances, but this year's crop of athletes might have the  talent to keep pace.  </P> <P> Enjoying their most successful season ever last year, Orange County teams won  three Southern Section titles.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda won the 3-A championship, Katella the 4-A and Valencia the 4-AA.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda captured the county's first state championship, the Division II  title, and Katella, led by all-state guard Joni Easterly, made it to the state  Division II final.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel was named player of the year in her division last  season and La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia led the state in scoring with a 31.2  average.  </P> <P> While Easterly has gone to USC, some new faces have joined some of the familiar  ones. Brea-Olinda (26-0), which has on a school-record 48-game victory streak,  returns all-state players McDaniel, Tammy Blackburn, Jinelle Williams and Jody  Anton.  </P> <P> Jalewalia has raised her scoring average to 33.4 points and Edison's Debbie  Fischer has set records for most three-point baskets in a game (10), season  (92) and career (100).  </P> <P> In 3-AA, top-seeded Brea-Olinda has a first-round bye and plays the winner of  the game between Bassett (11-9) and El Dorado (7-13) on Saturday. In 4-A,  top-seeded La Habra (19-3) plays the winner of Katella (9-15 and Garden Grove  (11-11). In 3-A, top-seeded Rancho Alamitos (18-3) plays the winner of St. Paul  (3-18) and Covina 9-14).  </P> <P> Other county teams expected to perform well are Ocean View (24-0), which plays  the winner of West Covina (19-4) and Hueneme (14-10); Woodbridge (20-4, which  plays the Loara (13-10) and California (16-6) winner, and La Quinta (23-3,  which plays the Buena Park (9-9) and Pioneer (10-12) winner.  </P> <P> * COMPLETE PAIRINGS: C11  </P></p>

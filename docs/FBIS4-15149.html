			<p>BFN     [Text] I adhere to the idea that the regions of Ukraine  should have the broadest possible economic independence.  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk said this at a meeting with  journalists at the Market Reforms Press Club in Kiev. As far as  political federalization is concerned, the president believes it  is premature, although he does not rule out its introduction in  future. Today, according to Leonid Kravchuk, this is  unrealizable due to objective reasons, and could endanger  Ukraine's independence and the progress of the economic reform.    In addition, the president termed as dangerous the policy  which the president of Crimea has been conducting of late.  Leonid Kravchuk emphasized that not a single decree on economic  issues has so far been issued by Yuryy Meshkov and no economic  decisions have been made toward that end.</p>

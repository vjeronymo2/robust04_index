			<p>BFN     [Text] The central committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] issued a statement on the exceptional joint meeting of the  central committee of the YSP and the party's parliamentary bloc,  held under the chairmanship of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice  chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of  the YSP.    The statement said that the meeting first heard the  secretary  general, who reviewed the current situation in the country and  the state of belligerency ignited by al-Ahmar gang in all parts  of Yemen after striking the 5th Brigade in Harf Sufyan, the 3d  Brigade in 'Imran, and the attack on the Ba Suhayb Camp last  Wednesday [4 May]. The statement affirmed that these attacks  were carried out in accordance with the war decision taken by  'Ali Abdallah Salih in order to bury the democracy, and [he]  announced in his speech the war decision, which put the country  in an endless disaster after having maneuvered about the  convention document. The war had been paved by the series of  murders and massacres of the Armed Forces of the unity, and all  this means that 'Ali Abdallah Salih and his gang had looked at  the unity as laying down his influence on the land of his  authority by using various pawns of power.    The statement said that the war carried out by al-Ahmar  house  usually interprets their rejection of the unity and their  insistance on carrying out their separationist project. This  gang miscalculated when it did not take into account that the  unity had become a reality and that the unity has had its own  defenders. The socialist party and all patriots and honorable  people will defend the country and the unity, and continue its  sacrifices to defend the homeland and its unity.    The statement warns that the shelling of the civil  establishments and economic corporations and villages and the  killing of innocent people is a desperate attempt to justify the  war and its crimes. By declaring a state of emergency, 'Ali  Abdallah Salih has slain democracy and rejected all Arab and  international efforts to stop bloodshed. This has been expected  from 'Ali Abdallah Salih, who rejected the national consensus  and the document.    The statement added that the central committee declares its  rejection of the state of emergency and the use of the House of  Deputies to cover up the war. The central committee at the same  time condemns the declaration of the war by 'Ali Abdallah Salih,  and appeals to all the masses and the Armed Forces to repel this  conspiracy. It praises the heroship of the Armed Forces of the  unity and the masses for their resistance of the aggression.    The central committee welcomed the Arab and the  international  calls to stop the war and continue the political and serious  dialogue.</p>

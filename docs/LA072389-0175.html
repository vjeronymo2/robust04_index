			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDER TWO DIFFERENT SHADOWS OF THE APOCALYPSE;  </P> <P> COMPARING 'NEBRASKA,' 'WALK IN THE WOODS'  </P> <P> There is a scene somewhere around the middle of Keith Reddin's "Nebraska" in  which not one word is spoken.  </P> <P> It happens when two military officers -- Swift and Fielding -- are on 24-hour  duty in the hermetic launch center of a nuclear missile silo 70 feet  underground.  </P> <P> The lights go up. The men stare into space. Awkward minutes go by. Blackout.  </P> <P> The scene speaks volumes.  </P> <P> We've seen these guys there before. Alone together. Bored. Whiling away the  suffocating tedium. We've also seen them earlier, in jest, rehearse the  commands they'd have to execute to "enable" a successful launch. We know -- as  they know -- that we're really talking about the possibility of nuclear  annihilation.  </P> <P> "Up there, who knows what's exactly going down," Fielding had said grandly over  drinks one night to a bug-eyed army clerk he wanted to impress. "You gotta  figure the worst."  </P> <P> "Everything could be dust by now," echoed his buddy Swift, playing along. But  something of that flippant bar-room banter lingered. One day on that stupefying  duty in the pit, Swift asks Fielding, "Could you shoot me?"  </P> <P> "Right now?"  </P> <P> "Say I balk."  </P> <P> "You wouldn't."  </P> <P> "Say I do."  </P> <P> "Come on." Fielding is incredulous. Swift insists. "I get cold feet, you gonna  train the metal on me?"  </P> <P> "Of course. And you would do the same." Would he? Some exchanges later the  conversation is dropped. But the harm's been done.  </P> <P> At the La Jolla Playhouse, where "Nebraska's" playing, we discover by degrees  that no one on this forlorn base in the middle of nowhere is entirely rational.  This business of baby-sitting rockets with the ability to pulverize  civilization is not exactly life-enhancing. It provokes derangements.  </P> <P> Swift, who entered the service because his father before him had proudly served  as a career military officer, comes hard and slowly to the realization that  this choice of profession may leave something to be desired, especially now  that it has been nuclearly redefined. But not before he's done some things that  don't add up -- such as asking Fielding the $64 question that puts his very  fitness for the job on the line -- and straying from a rocky marriage (with the  wife of his commanding officer, no less), a marriage he claims he wants to  save.  </P> <P> Nor is he the only person on base with performance problems. Gurney, the CO, is  so tied up in knots he can't even complete a sentence. Any sentence.  </P> <P> No wonder his wife takes courses at the local college, visits bars and has  affairs as recreational therapy. They are warning flares to a husband as  inarticulate sexually as he is verbally.  </P> <P> Reddin doesn't have to fill in the blanks. They speak to us loud and clear. By  the time that wordless scene in the middle of the play comes around, we know  exactly what is not being said.  </P> <P> All of this strange behavior is not strictly the effect of living in the shadow  of the Apocalypse. Like Lee Blessing's "A Walk in the Woods" (seen two years  ago at La Jolla), Reddin's "Nebraska" is not directly concerned with nuclear  deterrence (as is "Woods") but with the deadlier terms of a life lived in the  negative mode. Dedication to making sure something doesn't happen, instead of  making things happen, is a killer. It's "living" spelled backwards.  </P> <P> Blessing's "Walk," a discourse for two voices, is much more forward-looking.  This zestful series of private conversations between an American arms  negotiator and his Soviet counterpart as they roam the woods outside Geneva is  engaging, personal, surprising, amusing and garrulous. They discuss everything  -- from Mickey Mouse and banjos and brown suits and the likelihood of  friendship to country Western music and -- oh yes, alternatives to the arms  race. Even its outdoor setting is life-embracing. It does get around to testing  some knotty questions, but it is, in a phrase, all happy talk.  </P> <P> "Nebraska," on the other hand, is all strained silences. Its messages are found  between, not in the lines.  </P> <P> This is particularly unusual when you consider the origins of the piece. Reddin  had been asked to develop a documentary for PBS on nuclear weapons systems. It  never materialized but the playwright was left with stacks of research material  and "became interested in looking at the subject from a smaller angle."  Documentaries are anathema to plays, but "Nebraska" director Les Waters'  description of the final product as "Strindberg Meets Pacman" fits. Aside from  a mutual reliance on humor, what links the plays is contrast -- the degree to  which they demonstrate that you can achieve similar ends through diametrically  opposite means.  </P> <P> The loquacious "Woods" sparkles with accessible wit. It thrives on verbal left  turns as well as the difference between the fledgling American, naively  convinced that his diplomacy can make a difference, and the world-weary Soviet,  droll and down-to-earth, who knows that political systems shift without really  changing. (This argument may have lost some of its bite now that glasnost is  pointing another way.)  </P> <P> "Nebraska" is more chilling. Its fundamental proposition has a negative thrust  -- and we're not talking missiles -- that ultimately implodes. It's attrition  vs. nutrition. The ravages of such an existence are subtle. They do their worst  almost imperceptibly. But it doesn't take a savant or even a psychologist to  tell us that a perpetual death watch is murder on the elan vital. A skillful  playwright will do.  </P> <P> That is where "Nebraska" shines -- not so much as it unfolds scene after  taciturn scene, in an understated episodic build, but in the power of its  cumulative effect. Unlike the lip-smacking "Woods," which declares its  intentions early and tackles them head on, "Nebraska" is all implication and  sour aftertaste.  </P> <P> "Woods" comes sugarcoated. It is, therefore, much more of a crowd pleaser. Also  a dream exercise for two actors. So it comes as no surprise that it was  embraced for airing over PBS or that Des McAnuff, the artistic director at La  Jolla who staged the original "Woods" (at the Yale Repertory, in La Jolla and  in New York), has decided to mount two more versions of the piece next fall: In  Moscow, with a pair of Soviet actors -- and in Vilnius, with a pair of  Lithuanians. A perfect choice when you consider the play's portability, its  dual nationality and topical appeal.  </P> <P> It's unlikely that something as subtle and semaphoric as "Nebraska" would work  particularly well on television which, as a medium, favors bolder and more  declarative statements. And it's even less likely that it will find ready  commercial markets. But a performance in the USSR or Lithuania would be an  interesting idea -- in rep, perhaps, with "A Walk in the Woods"?  </P> <P> Who is to say, on balance, if the play that says the least speaks the loudest?  Or the other way around? There's virtue in both. What remains fascinating is  the infinite variety of approaches to a subject.  </P></p>

It already has two regular air routes: from Wuyishan city to  Xiamen city, Fujian Province, and Wuyishan to Shanghai. Next  month a regular service to Hong Kong is expected to start.    Located in the Wuyi Mountains in the northern part of  Fujian,  Wuyishan city has a national nature reserve and is a tourist  area.    More than 6.22 million tourists went there between 1986 and  1992.    The local government raised 100 million yuan to expand the  Wuyishan Airport. The work started in 1992, and in November last  year, new runways, parking areas, waiting rooms and office  buildings were completed, while imported telecommunications and  navigation facilities were installed.</p>

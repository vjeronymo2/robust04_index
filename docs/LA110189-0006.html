			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BRUNO;  </P> <P> ACCORD ON RULES FOR PROP. 103 HEARINGS  </P> <P> A discussion of procedures to be used in two months or more of Proposition 103  implementation hearings by the state Department of Insurance concluded in San  Bruno, three days earlier than planned. Both insurance industry lawyers and  consumer representatives had shown signs that they wanted to get on with the  more important issues of possible rate rollbacks and changes in pricing  methods. Chief hearing judge William J. Fernandez expressed gratitude for the  progress made so far and signed a final order setting out briefing schedules,  rules for legal discovery of insurance company rating data and compensation of  consumer legal representatives for their participation in the proceedings.  </P></p>

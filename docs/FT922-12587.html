			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / European computer makers in joint plan EUROPE'S three leading computer makers - Olivetti, Bull and Siemens-Nixdorf  -have agreed to co-operate in developing large computer networks for public sector bodies in the European Community, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. They have set up Trans European Information Systems (TEIS) as a first step to developing projects for compatible information systems in Europe based on common system and software applications. The aim of the TEIS venture is to enable the three companies to offer compatible solutions to European public sector agencies. These agencies will have to work increasingly closely with the coming of a single market and steps towards political union. The potential users include government ministries and agencies responsible for cross-border issues such as immigration, health and social security, or environmental monitoring. The three companies have set up research laboratories at Pozzuoli near Naples, as well as in Munich and Paris. The Naples unit will check whether hardware and software from the three companies is inter-operable.</p>

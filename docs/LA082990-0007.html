			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON AMERICAN POWER;  </P> <P> NO. 1 BUT OVERSTRETCHED?;  </P> <P> WE'RE SO BEDAZZLED BY THIS DISPLAY OF OUR MILITARY PROWESS THAT WE'RE BLIND TO  ITS EFFECT ON OUR SAGGING ECONOMY.  </P> <P> Among the varied responses to the Kuwait crisis that are observable these days  in the American media and among strategic analysts, one of the more prominent  has been a sense of satisfaction at the country's rapid projection of military  force halfway across the globe.  </P> <P> After all of the worrying talk about the decline of the United States, it was  clear once again that only America had the capacity to dispatch large military  forces to Saudi Arabia, to deter further Iraqi aggressions and to preserve  international order.  </P> <P> By comparison, the German and Japanese, touted as the new economic superpowers,  had failed the basic test; the European Community once again displayed the  weaknesses of not being a unitary state; a weakened Soviet Union played a  marginal role.  </P> <P> America was still No. 1, the actor who dominated the world's stage. Far from  displaying imperial overstretch, it had robustly demonstrated its  quasi-imperial power. And the only worry left was whether its own public  opinion had the will to support a conflict that might be both lengthy and  bloody.  </P> <P> Such feelings of satisfaction at the display of American power may, of course,  dissipate if the conflict does become costly or stalemated.  </P> <P> Yet all of this focus on U.S. military capabilities, or on national willpower,  may be obscuring rather than illuminating the larger question of the real U.S.  position in world affairs. That obscurity stems in large part from the media's  excitement at the demonstration of American military muscle, which causes us to  forget the critically important, nonmilitary dimensions of national power. If  we allow this to be so, we will be repeating the national blindness of many  earlier great powers engaged in large military operations abroad.  </P> <P> Consider, for example, Spain's decision in 1634 to send a powerful army into  Germany to join its beleaguered Austrian Hapsburg cousins during the Thirty  Years War. Its infantry and generals were first-rate, its deployment (from  Spain by way of Milan, the Alps, the upper Rhine) swift and professional, its  troops moving to the battlefront from a wide array of Spanish bases and  possessions.  </P> <P> No other European nation at the time could equal such force projection; Spain,  it was clear, was still No. 1 militarily. Yet it was a country that, in the  nonmilitary dimensions of power, was beginning to sag badly: enormous debts,  inefficient industries, reliance on foreign manufactures, vested interests that  debilitated rather than strengthened.  </P> <P> Naturally, little attention was paid to those features in the excitement of  watching the glittering Spanish battalions pour into the Rhineland. By the  1640s, however, the suspension of interest payments and declarations of  bankruptcy by the Spanish Hapsburgs fully revealed the decline of Spanish  power.  </P> <P> Is there a lesson here for the United States?  </P> <P> No doubt many critics will rush in to claim that America in 1990 is not like  Spain in 1634 (and they will be right; no two countries in history are ever  alike). But that misses the basic point, which is that to remain No. 1  generation after generation requires not just military capabilities, not just  national will, but also a flourishing and efficient economic base on which the  nation's military strength ultimately rests.  </P> <P> This, then, is the larger irony of President Bush's bold decision to commit  American forces in strength to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The cause may be a rightful one (as the Spaniards and British believed their  causes to be rightful). The deployments may be impressive and the actual  fighting by U.S. forces -- if it comes to that -- may also demonstrate  efficiency and resolve.  </P> <P> All of this is going to take national attention, energies and resources away  from dealing with the signs of America's growing fiscal, technological and  educational weaknesses.  </P> <P> Bush, like Philip IV of Spain, much prefers to be in the glorious role of  commander-in-chief than to be haggling over budget deficits; and much of the  media reflects the same bias.  </P> <P> The most significant news item of recent weeks may, therefore, have occurred  neither in Kennebunkport, nor in Baghdad, but in an inner-page article of the  Wall Street Journal, where it was reported that next year's budget deficit will  almost certainly be the largest one in American history, between $250 billion  and $300 billion.  </P> <P> The cost of the military deployment (estimated by some to reach $1.5 billion  before October, even if no shots are fired), the likelihood that there would be  smaller (or no) cuts in overall defense spending, the difficulty of imposing a  gas-hike tax, the slowing of the economy and consequent drop in revenues, would  all weaken America's fiscal position. In consequence, the article concluded,  the "cuts" authorized by the Gramm-Rudman budget law will likely be canceled by  legislation.  </P> <P> Is it any surprise that the dollar's value has been sagging, the stock market  quaking and voices rising to demand that super-rich Japan and Germany help pay  the spiraling cost of America's force projection?  </P> <P> The American nation may get out of this within a short while, and without  serious fighting and cost. But it may also find itself dragged into a lengthy  and expensive stay in the Arab world, which will certainly worsen its fiscal  position and make it increasingly dependent on foreign capital, just as  occurred to Britain when it lingered too long "East of Aden," until the Suez  crisis.  </P></p>

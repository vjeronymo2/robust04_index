			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK HISTORY MONTH  </P> <P> As I anxiously awaited your magazine each Sunday during the month of February,  I grew increasingly disappointed. For alas, your magazine decided to ignore  Black History Month entirely except for an article on Malcolm X and another on  black haircuts.  </P> <P> Amazingly, during this Black History Month we had the joy and privilege of  seeing Nelson Mandela released from prison after 27 years. This wondrous event  couldn't even merit a cover.  </P> <P> The usually provocative and thoughtful Los Angeles Times Magazine instead chose  to hail the fabulous '50s ("When We Were Very Young," by Charles Perry, and  "Mid-Century Memoirs," by Karen Lansky), which most people know were not so  fabulous for many African-Americans. My disappointment changed to disgust when  I read the hedonistic article on plastic surgery aimed at white, middle- and  not-so-middle-aged, vain, professional men.  </P> <P> I hope the magazine can once again find its former social consciousness -- and  quick.  </P> <P> MARY M. MILLER  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (8): Review may opt for varying standards - Contaminated land CONTAMINATED land is likely to rank high among the worries of any manager contemplating relocation. With green shoots appearing and interest rates low, expansion or relocation may seem tempting, and safer than it has appeared for years. But the threat of contamination could make relocation impossible to finance; worse, if discovered after the move, it could saddle the company with unexpected liabilities. The question has certainly given Whitehall officials unexpected headaches, as national policy has just been shelved after four years of wrestling to find a solution. The risk, officials and ministers fear, is that, as the economy claws its way out of recession, redevelopment of former industrial land could be hindered by the legislative uncertainty. As a result, relocation may tend to favour environmentally risk-free zones, thus increasing pressure on the green belt. Although estimates of the amount of contaminated land in the UK vary, Whitehall officials, industrialists and environmentalists agree that the problem is there. According to a report last month by the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and Technology, the industry-backed research group, there could be some 100,000 hectares of contaminated land in the UK, covering some 50,000-100,000 sites. A widely-publicised appeal court ruling in November reminded companies, if they needed reminding, of the potential liabilities. The court held Eastern Counties Leather responsible for pollution of underground water tapped by Cambridge Water, even though the contamination had occured nearly two decades ago. Detailed estimates of the potential costs of cleaning up the UK are necessarily scarce. But according to CEST, the UK market in restoring land quality could be worth Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 4bn between 1992 and the end of century. It adds that this is around 20 per cent of the total spending that will be needed to investigate and clean up fully - but environmentalists regard these estimates as too low. The government attempted to address these problems through Section 143 of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. This placed a duty on local authorities to compile and maintain registers of potentially contaminated land, which had been used in the past for certain specified industrial activities. However, the proposals for a register, which were made less demanding after one public consultation, have now been scrapped following a second. The registers aroused fierce and sustained opposition from the property industry, industrialists and homeowners, because they would have recorded potential rather than actual contamination. Critics argued that it would cause property blight over much of the country, including perhaps a third of the Black Country, the former industrial heartland. Bankers and insurers warned earlier this year, in a report by the government's advisory committee on business and the environment, that raising finance for expansion where liabilities were hard to quantify could be hard, thus restricting the ability of companies to move and grow. The confusion over the government's intentions was increased when the dropping of the register was followed rapidly by a postponement of the similar 'duty of care' rules on waste-management companies, also part of the 1990 EPA, which would have imposed a unending liability for pollution from landfills (rubbish dumps). The government has said that the delay is caused by the technical problems of harmonising EC and UK law. But it is clear that the local authorities' obligations to monitor the pollution, and the question of where liability would ultimately rest, similar questions to those raised by the register, were also causing concern. It would be wrong to suggest, as some environmentalists did, that the row over the register proposals paralysed the industrial property market. In a survey in January, property consultants Hillier Parker argued that the market had not resorted to panic, but had rapidly become sophisticated in judging probable liabilities and reflecting them in transaction values. 'A majority of respondents said that they would make an adjustment in their offer figure rather than withdraw automatically from the site', it concluded. But it is clear that a different approach is needed. The government appears to have rejected the purist's - and environmentalist's - solution of requiring local authorities to compile a full list of actual contamination, because of the costs this would impose on them, which many of them, already strapped for cash, could not support. The government is now setting up a third, three-to-four month review to look at where to go next. It is considering whether to adopt different standards for different land, depending on future use: land buried under a car park might need lower standards than that used for housing. But according to Ms Clare Deanesly, of Gouldens, the solicitors: 'I don't think the removal of the register has taken the issue away, now that it is on the agenda. It has become a matter of local conveyancing practice.' She points out that, in practice, planning authorities still have the authority under separate regulation to impose the clean-up of land, and adds that 'in practice (the register proposals) simply increased the issue's prominence'. There is unlikely to be a single solution to the problem of how to identify and clean up the UK's contaminated land, and how to finance that improvement. It is clear from property companies' continuing worries that, while they welcomed the dropping of the register, they would find removal of the uncertainty an additional help in doing deals. But the evidence of practitioners suggests that the market is finding its own ways of dealing with the issue, and probable contamination is increasingly reflected in the price. Companies considering relocation cannot ignore potential contamination, but are more likely than several years ago to find conveyancers and bankers who can accommodate it with equanimity, and may find that it is not the deterrent to moving that some once feared.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In today's Friday prayers sermons in Tehran, the  president stressed the need to reform the system of payment of  various subsidies. In his debate on the issue of social  justice, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to subsidies paid by  the government, and said: The situation regarding subsidies  during recent years has in effect constituted a kind of  injustice. This has of course been alleviated.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then set out to describe the details  of this year's budget, and said: During the current year [ending  21 March 1995], 600 billion tomans will be paid in form of  various subsidies. Of course, a large proportion of these will  be distributed in a fair manner. However, this system must  undergo a comprehensive reform.    The president added: About half of the said sum will be  earmarked to basic commodities, so that the people can obtain  cheap edible oil, rice, and sugar. Of course, in a healthy  economy, only those with a low purchasing power should be able  to benefit from such subsidies.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, moreover, announced the sums  allocated to payment of various subsidies, and added: In sectors  such as agriculture, culture, education, and purchase of  medicine and dried milk, payment of subsidies to the deprived  strata who are covered by Imam Relief Committee or other  organization is fair. However, payment of bread subsidies does  not constitute a fair system. This system should be revised  according to a systematic plan, with a view to political and  social prerogatives, so that the said subsidies may be available  only to certain strata. One must also do something about fuel,  so that by regulating the method of payment of these subsidies,  fairness can be introduced into this system. This is because  every year around 20 trillion rials of the country's reserves  are spent on fuel without any considerable return. The  situation in other countries, however, is clearly different.    The president stressed: The present situation, under which  everyone, even the well-off strata and those without a real  need, benefit from subsidies, is an injustice to the really  needy people. This situation should be changed.    The president then referred to the occasion of Army Day, 29  Farvardin [18th April]. He praised the services of the army of  the Islamic Republic of Iran during the years after the victory  of the Islamic revolution. He said: The role of the army during  the war was highly worthy of praise. Alongside the sacrifices  of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, Basij and other defense  institutions, the army was a highly reliable entity. He then  said that solving the problems of military personnel is in  harmony with solving the problems of society's other strata.    On Bosnia, the president said: Because of apathy and the  weak  attitude of the United Nations, and other organizations, the  Serbs' impudence has reached a level that they even express an  opposition toward the forces of that [UN] organization. The  interim Friday imam of Tehran added: This ugly attitude of the  West has, in fact, caused disgust among human society; since the  experience of the Iraqi attack on Kuwait has shown that Western  powers, if they wish, can stop the Serbs' aggression.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the continuing clashes in  Afghanistan as regrettable and called on the leaders of jihadi  groups to show forgiveness and refrain from seeking power so as  to reach a solution to the existing problems. The president  said: The continuation of this situation has, in practice, made  it impossible to help the Afghan people.</p>

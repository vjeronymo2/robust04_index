			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to limit the relevant population to those persons with prior knowledge of the release or discharge and the affected resources. These commenters thought that if individuals did not have prior knowledge of the injury, then they could not have experienced a loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that the Department develop standards to protect against the influence of improper motives. These commenters expressed concern that respondents might provide answers based on the warm glow of supporting a worthy cause rather than their WTP for injury prevention or resource restoration. These commenters also thought that the Department should ensure that respondents are not motivated by vengeance against PRPs. In particular, some commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to demonstrate that the results of a CV study do not change if respondents are asked their WTP to prevent a naturally occurring injury rather than an injury resulting from human activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters thought that, given the novelty of the task they are asked to perform, CV respondents are unlikely to consider all relevant factors on their own. Therefore, these commenters suggested that respondents be reminded of their budget constraints and the availability of substitutes for the resources being valued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous commenters thought there should be standards for determining whether CV studies produce results consistent with the basic tenets of rationality. For example, several commenters thought that WTP should increase as the amount of the commodity being valued increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters thought that the Department should develop guidance on how to calibrate hypothetical WTP with actual WTP. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials attempt to collect actual funds from CV respondents and use the results to calibrate stated WTP. Other commenters thought that the Department should develop a formula for calibrating WTP based on a ratio between lost use values and lost nonuse values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has carefully reviewed the standards offered by the commenters and the standards included in the NOAA panel report. The Department does not believe that assessment of lost nonuse values should be restricted only to cases involving long-lasting injuries to resources with few substitutes. The Department believes that such a restriction would not address the reliability of CV and, therefore, would be inconsistent with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to restricting the relevant population to persons with prior knowledge of the discharge or release and the affected resources, the Department has decided to solicit additional comment, as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to improper motive, the Department finds no evidence to suggest that warm glow and vengeance are necessarily prevalent in CV studies. The Department believes that when CV respondents are asked their WTP in a credible context they are adequately focused on the commodity of injury prevention or resource restoration rather than some other commodity such as the warm glow of giving or vengeance toward PRPs. NOAA's proposed rule includes a requirement that trustee officials use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive compatible. Further, the Department believes that vengeance is not a prevalent motivation in a CV study in which respondents are asked how much they would be willing to pay rather than how much a PRP should be required to pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that CV respondents may not always consider every relevant factor on their own. NOAA's proposed rule would require that the survey instrument place the commodity to be valued in the context of related natural resources. NOAA's proposed rule would also require respondents to be reminded of their budget constraints prior to being asked their WTP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also agrees that questions of unreliability arise when studies produce results that are inconsistent with basic tenets of rationality. NOAA's proposed rule includes a standard to ensure that CV survey responses satisfy one important tenet of rationality, namely that WTP increases as the severity of the injuries or the level of effectiveness and timing of the restoration or prevention program increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP, NOAA's proposed rule includes a calibration requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters responded to the Department's request for comment on the proper placement of any guidance developed for the use of CV. Some commenters thought that any guidance developed by the Department should be placed in the preamble or in a guidance document. These commenters noted that CV is an evolving methodology and expressed concern that placing guidance in the rule could lock in standards that might soon be found to be ill-advised. Other commenters thought that detailed standards should be placed in the rule itself to minimize the risk of unreliable studies being given a rebuttable presumption. Some commenters thought that the establishment of clear standards in the rule was particularly important since there are no generally accepted standards among CV practitioners. These commenters noted that any standards placed in the rule could be updated during biennial reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

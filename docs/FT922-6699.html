			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pirelli challenges voting restrictions at Continental PIRELLI, the Italian tyre-company, is launching its second attempt to curb voting restrictions at Continental, Pirelli's German rival in the European tyre-markets. The move represents a new outbreak of hostilities between the companies, which in December last year abandoned discussions after nearly 18 months of merger talks. The news emerged yesterday as Continental announced it will make a clear profit this year after losing DM128m (Dollars 80m) at the group level in 1991. The Italian company, which owns 5 per cent of its German rival and has options over a further 34 per cent after last year's abortive takeover attempts, has linked up with one other Italian shareholder to launch a challenge to the rule which limits voting rights in Continental to 5 per cent, no matter how big the stake. Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, yesterday said he had spoken to legal and financial advisers and was convinced the move was aggressive. It will be voted on by shareholders at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in July. This curb, in place at a number of large German companies, is seen by the Continental management as a guarantee of its independence. It faced a similar challenge at a special shareholders' meeting last March. It lost the vote - which needs a simple majority - but the voting restriction is still in place while Continental appeals against the decision in the courts. Pirelli responded to Mr Grunberg's by saying the removal of the voting curb would simply help clarification of the value of its stake, and this should in no way be seen as aggressive. However, analysts said the move could pose complications for Continental's proposed DM150m rights issue, announced earlier this month, for if relations between the two companies deteriorate, Pirelli may not vote its stake for the share issue. It could also be seen as an attempt by the Italian company to ensure it obtains the highest price possible for its share stake, on the assumption that shares in Continental without voting restrictions would be worth more than with the block still in place. Mr Grunberg said the hostilities did not affect talks between the two companies over the possible purchase of some of Pirelli's non-tyre businesses. And the door was open for full merger talks in 'two to three years time', he said.</p>

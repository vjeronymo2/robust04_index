			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Campaigning to spread the word - In a Nutshell The Management Charter Initiative, set up to improve the performance of the UK's managers, has launched a campaign to spread best practice in the field of small business initiatives. The Managing for Growth campaign comprises the publication of recent research into small business problems, seminars and consultancy help. The aim is to ensure small business organisations do not 're-invent the wheel' but will be able to obtain information on schemes which are already working. Among early examples of good practice identified by the MCI are a programme which provides high-level women managers as role models for their counterparts in small and medium-sized businesses and secondments of unemployed large company managers to small businesses. MCI, Russell Square House, 10-12 Russell Square, London WC1B 5BZ. Tel: 071 872 9099.</p>

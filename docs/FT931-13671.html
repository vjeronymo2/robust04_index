			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Personal View: The flaws in central bank freedom The call for an 'independent' Bank of England as the remedy for Britain's proneness to chronic inflation has become a parrot cry. It deserves more scrutiny than has so far been accorded it. The Bank is the UK's central bank, but it performs many functions not necessarily associated with a central bank: banking supervision, the management of the government's borrowing programme, the operation of the government's foreign exchange portfolio, and exchange control (when it existed), to mention only four. None of these can be regarded as a necessary responsibility of a central bank, and the independent exercise of them seems not to be in the minds of those who canvas the idea of independence. It is the core function of a central bank which is the issue, viz the provision of short-term liquidity to the banking system when needed at an interest rate determined by the bank as a deliberate act of policy. The central bank does not, many would say cannot, determine the money supply growth rate, though it may be able to influence it through its short-term interest rate decisions. Nor can it 'ensure the stability of the currency' (pace the Bundesbank's charter), though it can, through monetary policy (the setting of short-term interest rates), have some influence on inflation. But monetary policy is only one of many instruments of policy which have a bearing on inflation. Government borrowing, taxation, competition policy and public sector pay all have some part to play in the fight against inflation. If beating inflation is so important and the politicians cannot be trusted to give it the priority it deserves, logically we should take out of their hands not only monetary policy but a range of other policies as well. The idea exists that monetary policy is different because it is a simple technical operation with a single clear-cut objective and with well-understood and reliable techniques of operation. This is a delusion. It is a matter of great importance for the jobs and standard of living of millions of people. It does not affect only inflation, nor does it affect everyone equally. The nature and degree of its effects cannot be free from doubt and argument. High inflation in the UK, when it has existed, has not been only or even mainly the result of lax monetary policy - nor do we believe that monetary policy has been conducted on terms of which the Bank of England disapproved. Simply changing the system of control or designated priorities of that policy would only marginally contribute to reducing inflation, if other policies were not designed with the same objective. Britain's present policy of controlling inflation rests in effect on maintaining economic activity for the time being at a relatively low level. An independent Bank of England would not remove the central dilemma of that policy - what is to be the balance between high unemployment and inflation. This sort of decision should not be handed over to bankers. But, the argument goes, what about Germany and the US? The US is not a particularly happy exemplar. Its inflationary record over the past decade has been significantly inferior to Japan's, and only marginally superior to that of France, neither of which has more than nominally independent central banks. The German case is, however, regularly mobilised in support of the proposal for independence, but in a way which makes no allowance for all the other factors which have helped that country successfully to fight inflation. Low inflation has not been only, or even mainly, the work of the Bundesbank. Germans are aware of the dangers and costs of inflation from two bitter experiences. The same attitudes which have made them willing to hand responsibility to the Bundesbank would have ensured relatively low inflation if their system had been similar to the UK's. The Maastricht treaty incorporates the idea of an independent European central bank, and on this ground, if no other, we believe it to be flawed. It was, of course, the central bankers, via the Delors Committee, who put it in. Sir Bryan Hopkin is a former chief economic adviser to the government and Sir Douglas Wass is a former permanent secretary to the Treasury</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, March 30, (IRNA) -- Foreign Ministry  Director General for CIS and Transcaucasia Countries Morteza  Bank here today said that the countries of the region should  increase bilateral and multilateral contacts and play a more  active role for settling the Karabakh dispute in order to  maintain security in Caucasia and Central Asia.    He added that Iran and Turkey had many political and  economic  commonalties which required continuous contacts between the  officials of the two countries.    Bank also said that during the talks with the Turkish  officials the issue of Karabakh was raised and the two sides  were informed on each other's stances in this regard.    Iran, Turkey and Russia maintain their own views regarding  the Karabakh issue, but the commonalties of the countries of the  region require more closness of these views, he added.    He noted that the Armenian and Azeri officials seriously  feel  that the ongoing war of attrition had gravely affected their  economy, therefore, both countries were prepared to maintain  peace.    Bank also added that the interference of some foreign  elements as well as particular approaches of certain Armenian  factions had caused the continuation of the war, however, he  said, peace needs to be restored in the region.</p>

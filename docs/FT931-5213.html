			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: This wall will fall . . . PART OF my property is overlooked by the back wall of a warehouse, about 20 ft high. This wall is beginning to lean at the top and will eventually fall on to my property. I have spoken to the owners of the warehouse and asked them to have the wall repaired. I have also written to them and so has has my solicitor - to no avail. The council and environmental health department do not wish to know. I have even written to my insurers, who say they cannot do anything as the wall does not belong to me. I am told I cannot repair the wall myself because I do not own it. What can I do? Unfortunately, pre-emptive action on your part is not available. It was correct to write and put the owners of the wall on notice of the special danger should the wall collapse. Apart from writing again - this time, direct to the managing director or chairman of the company that owns the wall - there is no recourse so long as it is wholly within the neighbouring land. If, however, the top of the wall is sufficiently out of true to be invading the air space above your side of the boundary line, you could seek an injunction in the county court based on the trespass and on the risk that serious damage will be caused in the future (a quia timet injunction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Tories fail to answer basic questions: A party braced for further disclosures The government's back-to-basics initiative was mired in a philosophical quagmire yesterday as Tory MPs struggled to agree on a moral framework for the campaign. The party appeared deeply split as some ministers insisted the initiative was not aimed at personal morality, while others said it ought to be. Ominously for Mr John Major, the prime minister, both rightwing moralists and normally supportive liberals were saying privately that the issue had been badly handled. The party is bracing itself for the possibility of further disclosures about the private lives of those MPs perceived by elements of the media and some constituency activists to be guilty of moral turpitude. To add to Mr Major's problems, MPs return to Westminster today for the start of a parliamentary session which was always expected to be difficult for the government. Moral issues will come under the Commons spotlight early in the session when MPs debate whether to reduce the age of consent for homosexuals from 21 to either 18 or 16. The government will also introduce two controversial law and order measures  -the Police and Magistrates' Courts bill and the Criminal Justice bill - described by Mr Major as crucial to back-to-basics. In addition ministers will have to decide whether to accept demands for changes to the education bill - another back-to-basics measure - following a frosty reception in the Lords at the end of the last parliamentary session. However, the government's most important task will be to agree on a way to clarify the aims of back-to-basics and defuse attacks by constituency activists on the behaviour of some MPs. Ministers were sending confusing signals yesterday, suggesting that the government is still groping towards a coherent moral framework for the initiative three months after it was launched at the Conservative party conference. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the campaign was 'not about drawing up a check-list for individual behaviour in every set of circumstances because that is not something which governments can or should do'. Mr William Waldegrave, the Citizens' Charter minister, also said the government had 'better things to do' than to lecture voters on private morals. But Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, and Mr John Patten, education secretary, both said moral issues were important to the government. Mr Patten said: 'I always feel a child who is brought up without a father suffers terribly. It doesn't matter whether they are married or not - I prefer them to be married myself - but I think the fathers should be there.' But it was this sort of language, employed by rightwing ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, which caused back-to-basics to be seen as a moral crusade. Dame Jill Knight, a vice-chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said moral issues were a 'narrow but extremely important aspect of responsibility'. Mr Bill Cash, a leading rightwing critic of the prime minister, said a policy based on traditional family values was sustainable 'despite the fact that a number of people seem to have wandered off course'. There were nervous references at Westminster yesterday to 1963, when the Profumo scandal did much to prepare the ground for a Labour general election victory. For the moment, however, the controversy is merely embarrassing for the government, rather than dangerous. The spate of disclosures about MPs in the past week has shaken ministers, but party managers believe the damage can be contained as long as the revelations end soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brno, South Moravia, April 12 (CTK) -- The  Constitutional Court today decided to abolish part of Article  102 of the criminal code dealing with the defamation of  parliament, the government and the Constitutional Court. The  ruling will take effect on the day of publication in the Digest  of Laws.    The Constitutional Court reacted to President Vaclav Havel's  proposal to delete the above provisions, but to keep the  provision on the defamation of the republic.    Article 103, concerning the defamation of the president of  the republic, also remained untouched. President Havel had not  recommended that it be deleted.    Court spokesman Vladimir Klokocka said the Czech Republic  was  not exceptional in protecting the republic and its  constitutional organs in this special way. What was unusual, he  said, was the way in which they were protected, with no  difference being made between the crime of defamation in various  specific constitutional organizations, which had certain  functions and certain competence.    Justifying the court's ruling, Klokocka said that similar to  Article 102 were Articles 154 and 156, which dealt with gross  insult or slander of a state organ or public official.    The similarities and differences between Article 102 and  Articles 154 and 156 would lead to interpretations which kept  under which parliament, the government and the Constitutional  Court would not count as state organs, although they were. In  Article 102 they were offered a superior type of legal  protection, which was otherwise only usual for abstract symbols  of a state, such as the republic. Here Klokocka pointed out that  the conception of Article 102 was at variance with the Czech  Republic's international undertakings, and that it went over the  head of its constitutional order.    "What is important is not only how Article 102 would be  interpreted by the courts, but also the way in which these laws  would be interpreted by the general public. If people are  uncertain about the law, they will lose confidence in the legal  state and will also be hindered in civic activity," Klokocka  said.    Because suitable special protection for these institutions  was not specified, "the concept of defamation takes on a general  and indefinite meaning, abused by the old authoritarian  regimes," which in certain questions allowed misty formulations  to be used, and these could be interpreted according to need.    Article 102 did not have to be a necessary measure for the  very reason that the protection offered to state organs in  paragraphs 154 and 156 was sufficient, and from the point of  view of limiting the object of protection, even more precise,  Klokocka said.    The concept of "defamation" was used in the Czech lands by  the criminal law in 1852. In 1923 Czechoslovakia incorporated  it into the law on the protection of the republic, and later  into the criminal codes of the 1950's and 1960's. Defamation  was understood as a gross detraction of dignity, gross  dishonoring, degradation and ridicule.    The term was still understood in the same way today,  Klokocka  said, but the difference was that the 1923 law used it only in  connection with defamation of the republic, with a concept,  therefore, which was not an expression for a certain institution  with certain competence.</p>

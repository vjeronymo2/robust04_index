			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIAPER RASH  </P> <P> When Michelangelo had finished his Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel,  certain Vatican art experts were disturbed by all those nudes with their  privates visible from anywhere in the room. Full frontal nudity was just a  little too racy for Counter-Reformation sensibilities.  </P> <P> The authorities got the painter's student and friend, Daniele da Volterra, to  paint little curls of cloth over the offending parts of the figures, much to  the relief of the moral arbiters of the Church. Immediately upon completion of  his thankless project, Daniele was dubbed by local wags "the Diaper Maker," a  name that has stuck to this day.  </P> <P> Leafing through the May 13 Book Review, one discovers an illustration by  Danziger that accompanies your review of Shisako Endo's book, "Foreign  Studies." And, voila: The spirit of the Council of Trent is vigorously with us  at the Good Gray Times!  </P> <P> Here hunches the poor, wet Japanese scholar before Francois Rude's "La  Marseillaise." In the original relief, standing among a clutch of hairy Gauls,  is the personification of the youth of France clad in a bundt-cake mold, a  length of rope and his socks.  </P> <P> As he is presented by M. Rude, there's not much question about the gender of  this very physical spirit. The boy in Danziger's drawing, however, wears an  ABD-pack wrapped around his right quadriceps/femur, which hides the source of  any possible Mother's Day embarrassment to Times readers. Thanks to Danziger  and The Times Curia for protecting us from the awful truth.  </P> <P> ROBERT P. JENKINS  </P> <P> Professor: Art History  </P> <P> Citrus College  </P> <P> PASADENA  </P></p>

The Manager, NCS, will identify, upon the request of the Senior FEMA Official, a Communications Resource Manager from the NCS/National Coordinating Center (NCC) staff when any of the following conditions exist: (1) When local telecommunications vendors are unable to satisfy all telecommunications service requirements; (2) when conflicts between multiple Federal Emergency Communications Coordinators occur; or (3) if the allocation of available resources cannot be fully accomplished at the field level. The Manager, NCC, will monitor all extraordinary situations to determine that adequate national security emergency preparedness telecommunications services are being provided to support the Federal response and recovery operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Summary of Response Mission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> byproduct, source, and special nuclear material, including activities at commercial and research nuclear facilities. If an incident involving NRC-regulated activities poses a threat to the public health or safety or environmental quality, the NRC will be the LFA. In such an incident, the NRC is responsible for monitoring the licensee to ensure that appropriate protective action recommendations are being made to offsite authorities in a timely manner. In addition, the NRC will support its licensees and offsite authorities, including confirming the licensee's recommendations to offsite authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with NRC's agreement to participate in FRMAC, the NRC may also be called upon to assist in Federal radiological monitoring and assessment activities during incidents for which it is not the LFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Capabilities and Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The NRC has trained personnel who can assess the nature and extent of the radiological emergency and its potential offsite effects on public health and safety and provide advice, when requested, to the State and local agencies with jurisdiction based on this assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The NRC can assess the facility operator's recommendations and, if needed, develop Federal recommendations on protective actions for State and local governments with jurisdiction that consider, as required, all substantive views of other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The NRC has a system of direct-reading thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) established around every commercial nuclear power reactor in the country. The NRC can retrieve and exchange these TLDs promptly and obtain immediate readings onscene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

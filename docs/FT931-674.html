			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark debate heats up MEMBERS of the 500-strong Clark family will meet early this week to consider alternatives to a sale of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe manufacturer which is the focus of an offer from foods and property company, Berisford. The debate will be fuelled by the publication of the company's annual results and an accompanying letter calling an extraordinary general meeting to consider Berisford's offer. The results are likely to be announced within the next week. Meanwhile, it is believed that one of the four dissident directors has been rebuffed in attempts to get other bids considered. The majority of the board backs the bid from Berisford, which was invited by Clark's advisers, Schroders, to participate in the tender process.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A delightful view of Lear Sir, Your review of The Tale of Lear by the Suzuki Company of Toga (Arts: 'Suzuki's austere 'Tale of Lear' ', November 11) reminded me of the analogy of the father meeting his daughter's fiance for the first time: regardless of how perfect this fiance is, the father automatically dismisses him without reason. Suzuki's version of King Lear was thoroughly accepted and applauded by the UK audience, the home country of Shakespeare, but was summarily rejected by critics without any logical argument. Suzuki has interpreted the original text as the madness of aged men and projected it on to the Japanese spiritual world using well-trained Suzuki-method actors. As a Japanese, I appreciated this production, because it did not cheaply sell exoticism to the western audience. In fact, I felt nostalgic, a kind of comfort, as though the story was derived from our traditional tales, or as if it were Japanese Samurai drama produced for a Japanese audience. Therefore, it is natural that some British people could have felt alienated or deprived by this performance. But please do not deny the possibility that Shakespeare can be interpreted and performed in a 'different' cultural context, 'different' that is to you. For me, Suzuki's success was a delight. The production was evidence that we could establish a common world culture, a culture that can be shared by any ethnic group and a culture which is no longer Eurocentric.

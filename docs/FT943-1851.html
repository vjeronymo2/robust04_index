			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Anti-nuclear policy survives Mr Paddy Ashdown was narrowly spared further embarrassment when a majority of four votes prevented the party's consistent opposition to nuclear power being overturned. Divisions among the leadership as well as the rank and file emerged amid repeated demands that the party adopt a less prejudiced stance pending the outcome of the review of the nuclear industry ordered by the government. The initial vote, on a show of hands, was judged to have carried a motion refusing to reaffirm the existing policy. After protests from the floor a count was held and the decision was reversed with the existing policy upheld by 226 votes to 222. Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader, voted to reaffirm the party's opposition to the nuclear energy industry while other MPs abstained.</p>

A source in the press bureau of the Russian Border Guard  told  INTERFAX the detail and a reinforcement that had arrived from  the post beat off the assault, one Russian serviceman being  wounded.    The same day, another clash occurred on the same section of  the border, the Tajik militants retreating and dispersing in  rush thickets on the bank of the Pyandzh River.    The press bureau reported that Tajik guerrillas on Friday  launched four attacks, using small arms, rocket missiles and  grenade projectors, on Russian squads guarding the strip of the  border controlled by post No. 12 of the Moskovskiy Border Guard  Detachment. The Russians suppressed all the firing points of the  guerrillas, the bureau said. It said none of the Russian  servicemen were hurt, the guerrillas' losses being so far  unknown.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH HOSTEL IN VENICE  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's letter (July 30) regarding youth hostels was  misinformed. Her letter responded to the article which featured the Share-Tel  International Hostel on Brooks Avenue in Venice Beach ("L.A. On a Shoestring,"  Metro, June 26).  </P> <P> In 1988, Share-Tel was determined by the Los Angeles Department of Building and  Safety to be in full compliance with the city's building codes and zoning laws.  Despite this, Galanter has been using her office to harass Share-Tel by filing  complaints with several city agencies. For example, in 1989, a complaint was  filed with the Rent Control Board. The board determined that Share-Tel was not  in violation. Recently, the city's tax and permit division audited Share-Tel's  transient occupancy tax payments. Under state laws and city ordinances,  transient occupancy taxes are payable only for tenants who stay for 30 days or  less. The auditors nevertheless determined that Share-Tel owed back tax  payments for the long-term tenants who stayed more than 30 days. An appeal is  pending.  </P> <P> Youth hostels are not prohibited in the RD1.5 zone. They are not even mentioned  in the zoning ordinance. Nevertheless, the Board of Zoning Appeals, a political  body appointed by the City Council, decided that Share-Tel is operating a  "hotel business." Share-Tel does not, however, fall under the definition of  "hotel" in the zoning ordinance. It should be noted that the building was  constructed in 1908 when Venice was an independent city, and that as far back  as 1927 the building was used for weekly rentals by people coming to enjoy the  beach. Share-Tel is an apartment building. It has not been converted or  altered.  </P> <P> KEN TENNEN  </P> <P> Share-Tel International Hostel  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

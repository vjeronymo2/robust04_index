			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: Better deal for small investors Sir, Lex suggests ('Sharelink', July 24/25) that 'without further tax incentives from government, the high ideal of a share-owning democracy will remain no more than that'. Perhaps a more effective incentive would be for market makers to reduce their bid-offer spreads? A Pounds 1,000 purchase typically returns Pounds 725 to Pounds 925 on selling at an unchanged mid-price, with Pounds 20 to Pounds 200 going to the market maker, depending on the liquidity of the security, Pounds 50 to the stockbroker and Pounds 5 to the government in stamp duty. If everyone received as little as the government, the small investor would be well served. M E R Robinson, 26 Fairfield Close, Grove, Wantage, Oxfordshire 0X12 0NQ</p>

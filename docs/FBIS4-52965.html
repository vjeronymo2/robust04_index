			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Obey the Demand of the </F> International Community"]    [Text] While studying at George Washington University,  Bill Clinton asked a senator for a job. He was told that there  was no permanent job in that office. There were only two  part-time jobs available there. Clinton offered to hold the two  posts. This might symbolize Clinton as a hard worker or a  monopolizer. This event happened about 30 years ago. He is now  occupying the White House as head of a world superpower. The  world is now demanding that Clinton work hard. We simply want  him to take up the greatest and most challenging job, that is to  use his power to end the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Clinton once wrote: "A leader will only be useful if he or  she is strongly determined to confront any issue. We cannot  accept a policy marginally or are reluctant to act as this will  cause politics to lose its essence."    During a meeting with Clinton yesterday, Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir gave a viewpoint that contradicted the U.S. action  regarding the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will Clinton be  able to fulfil the demand? We are confident that Clinton, being  the first U.S. President elected in the post-Cold War era, will  be able to fulfil the wish of the international community  without much ado. We abide by the principles that Clinton  belonged to a generation that grew up during the Cold War era  and that realized how a superpower rivalry could bring the world  to destruction. He was already aware that wars had brought  about the worst effects the world can experience. Why, however,  has he acted so weakly? Clinton should know that the current  generation should not be forced to tie itself to the mood  [preceding word in English] and events formed in the superpower  political arena. The entire world is being haunted by fears of  worsening wars.    The international community wants a world that is reliable  and capable of ensuring the welfare of mankind. They want  strong, noble world leaders capable of telling the truth. We  want to see Clinton, being leader of a superpower, to give the  the world a greater sense of security. Is he capable of leading  the world or is the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina too great to  resolve? Does he remain a "monopolizer?"    As Clinton was once a strong supporter of Jimmy Carter's  human rights policy vis-a-vis the refugee issue, this is time  for him to prove his commitment by settling a greater issue --  brutal persecution, rapes, and murders. We want Clinton to  fulfill the demand of the international community. We want the  United States to rethink and work for the welfare of the rest of  the world.    The United States should use this opportunity to restore its  image before the international community. The United States  should change its policy of seeing a problem on the basis of  potential profit to one based on humanity. The policy that arms  sales are more important than human lives means that the United  States has no respect for the international community. It would  be useless for Clinton to say that education should be available  for all human beings, if Bosnian children were unable to study  because school buildings had been destroyed and it was dangerous  to go to school.    The United States should not deceive the world by distorting  facts about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this continues, a  proverb that "a nation creates a war to gain wealth, while an  anti-war nation in fact creates a war" is correct. The slogan  "Make Profits Out of War" is nothing new in the superpower  context. As explained by Dr. Mahathir, the United States should  use its power and influence to end the brutalities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

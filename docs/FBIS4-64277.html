			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Leotard Decides To Launch Helios II </F> Satellites"]    [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard recently decided  to implement the definition phase of the Helios II military  ground observation satellite program, which, for the time being,  is solely French. Compared with Helios I (two optical  observation satellites, one of which will be put into orbit at  the start of 1995), the Helios II program will develop  higher-capacity satellites which will use infrared technology to  see at night as well as during the day and even in bad weather  conditions. They are due to enter service in the year 2001.  The overall program will cost 10 billion francs [Fr] (for two  satellites), including Fr770 million for the definition phase.  The Helios I program, run jointly with Italy (14 percent) and  Spain (7 percent), had been estimated at almost Fr8 billion.  The Helios II program initially provides for the launch of a  satellite in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2006.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Foreign Minister and  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] head Tsutomu Hata garnered the  biggest support as Japan's next prime minister among more than  130 House of Representatives members in a poll released Thursday  [14 April].    Nippon Broadcasting System Corp., a Tokyo radio station,  said  it conducted the survey on Wednesday and Thursday, covering all  the 508 lower house members, to ask who is best as Japan's next  leader. Of them, 132 lawmakers or 26 percent responded by fax.    The largest number, 61 respondents, picked Hata, followed by  29 who supported Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 13 for Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium  chairman of the opposition Japanese Communist Party, and 10 for  former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP, they said.    Hata, head of Shinseito, a core component in the seven-party  coalition, is already thought to be the most likely candidate to  succeed Hosokawa.    Hata gained support from members of ruling parties including  the Social Democratic Party, Shinseito, Komeito [Clean  Government Party] and the Japan New Party, but Kono and Fuwa  were backed only by members of their parties, the poll showed.    Those who backed Hata said he is appropriate for premiership  because he has served in many ministerial posts, is eager for  political reform and has a fine character, it said.    Supporters for Kono said he should be premier because he is  head of the largest single party in the Diet and because he says  Japan should keep its war-renouncing constitution.    Those who cited Watanabe said he has leadership skills and  is  knowledgeable about the economy.</p>

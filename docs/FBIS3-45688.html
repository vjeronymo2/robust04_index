			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Firmly Supports China's </F> Return to GATT"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen's China  visit has made inspiring achievements and vigorously promoted  bilateral trade and economic cooperation. With the issuance of  a joint statement by the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee  yesterday, a new framework for closer trade and economic  contacts between the two countries was set up. This was a  successful attempt to handle matters concerning the economic  interests of both countries in the spirit of "seeking common  ground while reserving differences."    The joint statement pointed out: The financial ministers of  both countries agree that the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee  will meet every year in the two countries by rotation. Meetings  of the committee have been suspended for seven years. Now with  the establishment of a new cooperative mechanism under which the  committee will meet once a year, cooperation between the two  countries in the industrial, agricultural, scientific and  technological, financial, and trade fields will surely be  vigorously promoted. China is now going all out to promote  market-oriented economic reform and trying to dovetail its  economy into the world economy. This is not only a good thing  for China but also a good thing for the world. The United  States clearly expressed its stand of "firmly supporting China  to restore its position as a signatory state to GATT."    If China's position as a signatory state to GATT is  restored,  all countries will be able to open up commodity, financial, and  service markets in China, and Western countries, which are  striving hard for economic prosperity, will be greatly  benefited. That is why the United States is firmly supporting  restoration of China's position as a signatory state to GATT.  More than that, Lloyd Bentsen gave the following message to  China on behalf of President Clinton: "The United States  supports a stable, prosperous, and modernized China." The United  States has not only spoken favorably of China's policy decisions  on reform of its monetary and financial, tax, and foreign  exchange systems, but also expressed willingness to provide  technological aid for these reforms. To help China carry out  reform of its monetary system, the United States is willing to  provide China with professional knowledge and practical  experience. For this reason, Chairman Greenspan of the U.S.  Federal Reserve Board will also visit China later this year.  The United States always carries out macroeconomic regulation  and control, regulates the exchange rates of the dollar, and  readjusts relations between the issuance of banknotes and its  internal and external economic and trade activities by means of  the interest rate and other means such as issuing bonds and  bills and directly interfering in the exchange market.  Undoubtedly, these are all experiences for China to study.    Of course, the United States has its own interests. The more  mature China's market system is, the more opportunities there  will be for U.S. investment in China. Moreover, establishment  of close, friendly, and cooperative relations with China is also  good for the United States in opening up and occupying the  Chinese market. That is why the chairman of the U.S. Federal  Reserve Board will follow the treasury secretary and come to  visit China. Apart from cabinet members, some sub-cabinet work  groups will also be engaged in handling three major items,  namely, "currency and banks," exchange rates, and investment and  economic cooperation. The three subministerial work groups will  meet once every six months. Between the meetings, there will be  some special technological officials to take charge of  coordination matters and provide aid so that the work groups can  make achievements as soon as possible.    The third item, "investment and economic cooperation," is  particularly eye-catching. In the next five years, China will  import $700 billion worth of equipment. All countries are vying  with one another for these contracts, which will be carried over  to the next century. By establishing a work-group-level  permanent channel and promoting economic cooperation with China,  the United States has taken an early step into the Chinese  market and gained an advantage of being in a favored position.  Following the United States, there will be another "China  craze" in the Western countries. Japan and west European  countries will come one after another to take "China--an  economic express train." This is because if one does not get a  seat at the crucial moment and lets the market be occupied by  others, one will find it very difficult to enter the market in  the future and will always be at a disadvantage in competition.    Trade between China and the United States is still being  obstructed by some outdated laws. The United States should  relax restrictions on exports of certain scientific and  technological products to China and on China trade. The dispute  over China's MFN status every year also seriously hinders  development of Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations.  Therefore, at a press conference, Lloyd Bentsen pointed out  that China and the United States should first resolve the MFN  issue. This is a change in policy for looking ahead. Provided  China and the United States observe guidelines of the communique  on establishing diplomatic relations and do not interfere in  each other's internal affairs, all issues can be resolved  through consultations. China is now adopting an open and  pragmatic attitude. It is hoped that the U.S. side will also do  more solid work and break away from quibbling over certain  issues to vigorously make a new step forward.</p>

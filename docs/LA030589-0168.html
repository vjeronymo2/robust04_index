			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAIN SAW USE REQUIRES WATCH FOR INTERNAL STRESS  </P> <P> If you cut wood with a chain saw, be sure to position yourself so as to prevent  the cut log section from rolling. Solo Inc. advises holding the saw on the  right side of your body, outside the line of sight across the chain. If the log  shows signs of internal stress -- a bowed appearance -- the operator should not  cut on the stressed side, since this could lead to pinching and result in a  kickback of the saw.  </P></p>

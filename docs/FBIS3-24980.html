			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kirundi </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Inaugural speech by President Cyprien Ntaryamira in </F> Bujumbura on 5 February--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, before I embark on my  speech, allow me to thank the religious leaders of our country,  to thank them wholeheartedly for the blessing they have just  poured on us and the blessing of God they have just showered on  Burundi. I think that if God has not heard the prayers, then he  must have already left our country. [passage omitted]    Burundi ladies and gentlemen, Burundi has really suffered  and  greed has exacerbated the already bad situation. You have  either heard about it or have seen it for yourselves: houses,  bridges, schools, hospitals in many parts of the country have  been destroyed because of the crisis which has just prevailed in  Burundi. People killed one another, and those who managed to  escape in the regions concerned became helpless refugees and  fled elsewhere within the country. Others sought sanctuary in  neighboring countries. The refugees who fled these troubles, who  are outside the country, exceed 700,000. The internal refugees,  excluding those in the valleys and in the bush, exceed 200,000.  We have not yet clearly established the number of victims of  this disaster, but you know that they number thousands, and that  will take Burundi backwards economically and socially.    All Burundians need peace and mutual trust so that they can  live together once more. Mutual distrust and hatred among the  people should be fought against strongly. Burundi is in  bereavement [kubura]. All Burundians are in bereavement.  Please overcome your anger so that hatred (?does not build).  There is also a saying that by avenging your own people, you  bring about the end of your family. Burundi is a common farm  given to us by God. It will never be divided into two or three  parts. Burundians should once more come together, unite in  restoring peace, restoring security so that our country may  prosper once more.    Whoever dreams about worsening the situation so that Burundi  remains in crisis, I call on you to strongly reject him without  condoning evil. I take this opportunity to remind Burundians  who still dream of destruction and [word indistinct], and, more  particularly, members of some opposition parties, let them look  at the misery confronting our helpless Burundian brothers and  then stop their designs which can bring nothing to us other than  adding insult to injury. The times we are living through are  not right for arguments but rather for rescuing each other.    We urge Burundians who still dream of shedding blood, all  those who are behaving in a riotous manner, those who spend  their time brandishing their weapons at each other--we urge them  to remember that they did not create those they threaten and  that they are not at all allowed to torture or (?harm) those of  different political or ethnic affiliations. Respect for human  life is upheld worldwide, and we are going to take swift  measures to stop killings which are rampant in Burundi.    In our programs, in which we believe and will be teaching,  we  must make all Burundians understand that it is an offense to  abuse human rights. No matter who is concerned--whether he is a  Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--his life, his family, and his property must  be respected. There is no tribe destined for extermination, no  tribe to be trampled upon, no tribe better than another; a  tribe for killing, one for preserving alone. All  Burundians--whether they are Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--are equal  before God and the law.    We call on all the registered parties of Burundi to work  accordingly towards the goal of reconciliation and  reconstruction. We call upon them to do their utmost to assist  the government in strengthening peace and tranquility in the  country for the benefit of all Burundians without bringing  hatred among ethnic groups. I promise to always meet party  leaders so that we may study how peace and tranquility are never  disturbed again.    However, members and leaders of parties must know that a  party does not give the green light to its leaders or its  members to be carefree, to intentionally break the law. The  government will not hesitate to punish a law breaker,  irrespective of his identity, even if he is a party leader.    I also take this opportunity to remind the youth, because  they have a great role to play in building the Burundi of  tomorrow -- we call upon them to come back to their senses. We  ask them to avoid deceitful advisers who want nothing from them  other than to use them as tools. [passage omitted] Parents, who  are in charge of education, are called upon to be a good example  in upholding unity, peace and understanding. Let them avoid  sowing seeds of division of any kind, because by so doing they  will be digging a grave for Burundi. There is an old saying  that he who steals while carrying a baby on his back teaches the  latter to do the same. [passage omitted]    Burundians, the recent killings that the country has been  experiencing have caused clear mistrust amongst the people,  especially on ethnic grounds. Many among you may be asking  yourselves whether it is still possible for Burundians to live  together as before. Most of you may be asking yourselves how  the future government will behave so that citizens may once more  live together in peace, government employees work hard for  development once more, so that those who have fled their homes  may return unhindered, so that those with arms may lay them  down, so that the ever-increasing banditry may be stopped, and  many other questions that we do not want to talk about. All  those questions to yourselves are being asked at the right time  and because of what has happened.    However, there is no remedy other than all of us agreeing  that the laws and rules of the country should be respected first  so that we may work in peace. That is why we ask the security  services to open their eyes more. They should work impartially,  stop the bad actions which keep on causing problems in our  country. We shall be very happy when we see them heeding this  call, when they carry out their duties without hesitation (?and  impartially).    In summary, we are going to act fast to restore discipline  in  the country, discipline in the army, discipline in schools,  discipline in leadership, discipline in the whole of Burundi so  that Burundians may respect each other, respect the laws and  pursue their work, the source of development. Nothing else will  save Burundi apart from work, justice and respect for human  rights. [passage omitted]    Burundi ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow morning we will form  the government that will help us to implement our programs to  revive Burundi in all its sectors. You have heard for the past  few days that we have been meeting party leaders, church leaders  and representatives of international organizations, namely the  United Nations and the OAU. You will hear later on about what we  agreed on the government that we intend to form. However, I  would like to tell you about the main points that we shall  implement soon.    First, the prime minister will be chosen after looking into  the current political problems in the country, especially the  current ethnic conflicts that we have been experiencing. We  shall appoint him after assessing his wisdom and courage and  after assessing whether he is committed to peace and democracy  for all. As we agreed during the discussions that we held with  other political leaders, we shall choose him from the largest  opposition party. After studying his behaviour during the  difficult times that we have undergone, after ensuring that he  has had no hand in the recent killings and disturbances. The  next prime minister will be a wise man or woman who unreservedly  agrees to assist the president in his duty to implement programs  so that the new Burundi we want takes root.    Second, the men and women to be appointed to the Burundi  Government will also show proof of leadership and enough  knowledge in assisting the head of state to find solutions to  the problems facing Burundi currently, whether political or  economic. As you know, the task of forming the government  belongs to the head of state in consultation with the prime  minister. We shall carry out the job as soon as possible in  accordance first, with the ideas of the Front for Democracy in  Burundi [FRODEBU] party which won the elections. We shall also  appoint senior government employees in consultation with the  prime minister and ministers, bearing in mind the good of the  country, and without discrimination. We ask all those charged  with these duties to carry them out for the common good and that  they show determination to revive our country.    The main goals of the government that we shall form in the  near future will be as follows: First, to pacify the country  and do everything possible so that peace, tranquillity and  mutual trust return among all Burundians. Second, to teach  respect for human rights in the entire country. Third, to  resettle the displaced without forgetting the previously planned  repatriation of refugees from abroad. Concerning the revival of  the economy.    The government will strive to rebuild what has been  destroyed  in the recent disturbances. However, this is a job for  everyone. The government will also revamp the country's economy  through all the activities in our country. It will also  continue the projects that had been halted due to the recent  disturbances. [passage omitted]    Burundi ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conclude this address  without wholeheartedly thanking the Burundians and foreigners  who made sacrifices or assisted in enabling Burundi to reach  this stage. Allow me to particulary thank the Government of  Burundi which was led by Her Excellency Sylvie Kinigi [short  break in transmission] Ntibantunganya. We also thank those who  contributed towards getting Burundi out of the crisis,  particularly neighboring and friendly countries, international  organizations such as the United Nations and OAU, private  businessmen, religious leaders and whoever made any contribution  to the return of peace or helped our victims. Please join me in  hailing them. I take this opportunity to ask them to continue  supporting us as they have always done. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Observer: Sweet SA Aren't new democracies a wonderful thing? Take South Africa, now racing towards its April 27 general election. Not only do all South Africans get a vote, but they can now bite the head off the politician of their choice. Mister Sweet, an inventive Jo'burg company, is selling bags of 'Multi Party Politics' sweeties under the slogan: 'All the politicians you can swallow]' You can masticate a jaundiced-coloured F W de Klerk; gobble up a chocolate Desmond Tutu; or swallow a pink Eugene Terreblanche. And with what is either a genuflection towards deep political correctness, or an irony which may escape most South African voters, all taste the same.</p>

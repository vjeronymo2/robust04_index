			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS WASTE IN HOME A CONCERN;  </P> <P> TOXICS: LONG BEACH TURNS TO DEVELOPING A STATE-REQUIRED PLAN FOR DEALING WITH  DANGEROUS HOUSEHOLD WASTE, EVEN THOUGH SOME QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A  PROBLEM.  </P> <P> Paint thinner, oven cleaner, fingernail polish they can all develop split  personalities around the house.  </P> <P> On the garage shelf or under the kitchen sink, they're everyday household  items. In the trash can, they suddenly become hazardous waste, possessing some  of the same corrosive, flammable or toxic qualities as the carefully regulated  hazardous waste of industry.  </P> <P> Yet the half-empty bottle of garden pesticide or carburetor cleaner typically  gets tossed in the trash to be carted away by the garbage truck to the local  landfill, or in the case of Long Beach, to the local trash incinerator.  </P> <P> For all the attention heaped on industrial hazardous waste during the past  decade, domestic hazardous waste has gotten relatively little. Like the  majority of cities in the state, Long Beach has no program for collection and  special treatment of household hazardous waste.  </P> <P> "You know there is nothing and everybody is appalled," insisted Virginia  Siegel, a recycling activist and member of the city's new solid waste advisory  committee.  </P> <P> Well, not quite everybody. "Historically, household hazardous waste has not  been viewed as the top problem we have had to deal with," commented Bill Davis,  manager of the city's solid waste bureau.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, a wide-ranging state recycling law passed last month will require  all California cities to develop plans for dealing with household hazardous  waste by July of 1991. Next year the state will also start distributing grant  money to counties and cities to develop household hazardous waste programs.  </P> <P> Currently, the Long Beach Health Department is talking to Los Angeles County  about holding a county collection day in Long Beach, probably once a year. And  when the recently created city position of hazardous materials coordinator is  filled, that person's responsibilities will include household hazardous waste,  said Dick Smith, hazardous waste operations officer in the city's Health and  Human Services Department.  </P> <P> A wide variety of household products are considered hazardous waste, such as  used motor oil, varnishes, nail polish remover, insecticides and window  cleaners. Some of them can legally be disposed of in a landfill, others, like  motor oil, cannot.  </P> <P> Estimates of the quantities of such materials that wind up in municipal garbage  vary enormously. When consultant Gary Mitchell conducted a study for the  federal Environmental Protection Agency three years ago, his company concluded  that only about one-half of 1% of typical municipal trash was household  hazardous waste. His company also failed to document any environmental damage  that could specifically be traced to household hazardous waste, other than  occasional fires in garbage trucks.  </P> <P> At the same time, Mitchell found that the cost of collection programs can be  enormous, ranging as high as $9 a pound, which amounts to $18,000 a ton.  Indeed, the six collection days held by the city of Los Angeles so far this  year have cost about $1.5 million, including publicity, collection and  disposal, according to the Los Angeles Public Works Department. Some of the  material is recycled and some is shipped to special hazardous-waste treatment  facilities, which are very costly.  </P> <P> "These collection days are extremely expensive," Mitchell said in a telephone  interview from Georgia. "They are not cost effective. The money could be better  spent to educate the public about household hazardous waste. . . . I think the  furor over household hazardous waste is blown way out of proportion."  </P> <P> Mitchell argues that it would be more prudent for government to concentrate on  eliminating household hazardous waste to begin with. For instance,  environmental programs should be mounted to get people to use up all of their  pesticides by sharing them with neighbors, or letting paint dry out before  discarding it. With a bit of a chuckle he even suggests using up odd remnants  of paint by brushing it on old pieces of wood and throwing out the wood.  </P> <P> Environmentalists also advocate using nontoxic alternatives around the house,  such as a mixture of vinegar and water instead of window cleaner.  </P> <P> Mitchell's arguments notwithstanding, there is a camp that contends that  however small the quantity, household toxics can have a cumulative harmful  effect in landfills and trash incinerators, contributing to water and air  pollution.  </P> <P> Some are also dubious of strategies to reduce domestic hazardous waste. Sniffs  Siegel, "Just for fun I wanted to take a can of paint and see how long it would  take to dry."  </P> <P> City officials insist that Long Beach's new trash-to-energy incinerator was  designed to burn whatever shows up in typical household trash, including small  amounts of hazardous waste. Davis said the boilers can handle the small  explosions from such things as a can of paint, adding, "These are designed to  take almost literally land mines."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the regional air quality board said that while environmental  tests are still being conducted on the plant, which burns refuse to produce  electricity, thus far there have been no air pollution problems that could be  linked to the burning of household hazardous waste.  </P> <P> Whatever the practical arguments over collection programs for domestic  hazardous waste, Smith said his office gets a call about once a week from  someone wondering what to do with their leftover paint or motor oil. "People  want to do something," he noted.  </P></p>

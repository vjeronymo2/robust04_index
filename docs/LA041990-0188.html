			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STANTON M.D. CHARGED IN DRUG SELLING CASE  </P> <P> Criminal charges were filed against a Stanton physician on Wednesday, alleging  that his medical practice was little more than a front for selling prescription  drugs to addicts, including a mother and daughter who overdosed within two days  of each other.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office charged Dr. Lowell Orgill Kirk,  59, with 14 felony counts of illegally selling sedatives and pain relievers  although the buyers were not under his care nor required medication for any  health problem.  </P> <P> Four charges relate to Susan Gunn and her mother, Elsie, both of Garden Grove,  who overdosed in April, 1989, on a variety of drugs, including codeine,  morphine and Valium, some of which were allegedly purchased from Kirk.  </P> <P> Coroner's reports show that Elsie Gunn, 60, died April 24, 1989, from massive  internal bleeding caused by the combined effects of at least 10 drugs in her  system. Authorities said Susan Gunn, 34, overdosed the next day on six  different prescription drugs but recovered in the hospital.  </P> <P> "We believe he is no different than any drug dealer on the street," said  Special Agent Andy Alonso of the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement in Santa  Ana, which investigated the case. "Maybe he's even more dangerous by selling  pure drugs that are very addictive and harder to kick."  </P> <P> In connection with the Kirk case, prosecutors said they are also preparing  charges against John Movsesian, 58, a pharmacist who shut down his operation  last year at Kirk's Crescent Medical Group on Western Avenue. Movsesian, who  could not be reached for comment, could face misdemeanor counts of illegally  supplying prescription drugs to Kirk's patients.  </P> <P> Although Elsie Gunn obtained her drugs from Kirk, prosecutors declined to file  a manslaughter charge against the doctor because it could not be shown that he  gave Gunn the lethal dose.  </P> <P> "There was a causation problem," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie Ferris Johnson,  the prosecutor. "The drugs she took were linked to him, but you have an  independent party other than Kirk administering them."  </P> <P> The doctor is scheduled to surrender Friday in Municipal Court in Westminster.  If convicted, he would face a maximum penalty of three years in prison on each  count of illegally supplying prescription drugs.  </P> <P> Kirk, who has been practicing medicine in Orange County for 30 years, could not  be reached for comment Wednesday. But in earlier interviews with The Times, he  repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, although he acknowledged that he has made  some "mistakes" in prescribing drugs to certain patients.  </P> <P> Frederick L. McBride, Kirk's attorney, declined to comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement began an undercover investigation of Kirk  in July, 1988, when an Orange County Sheriff's Department informant told agents  that prescription drugs could be easily obtained at the doctor's office.  </P> <P> Subsequently, undercover operatives and state agents said, they made repeated  purchases of sedatives, sleeping pills, depressants and painkillers from Kirk  without proper medical examinations nor the health problems that would require  the drugs they bought.  </P> <P> Investigators also said they found evidence showing that Kirk improperly  prescribed diuretics, which increase the flow of urine, to a 30-year-old  anorexic woman. Physicians say diuretics can cause even further weight loss in  anorexic people and endanger their health.  </P> <P> "He's been doing this for a very long time," said state Special Agent Spring  Robbins, who is assigned to the case. The California Medical Board, formerly  called the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance, "has had numerous  complaints about him over a period of years," Robbins said.  </P> <P> The case is the first time, however, that Kirk has been charged with a crime  after 11 years of inquiries by state and federal authorities into allegations  of insurance fraud and illegally prescribing controlled substances.  </P> <P> State narcotics agents said Kirk was first suspected of illegally distributing  prescription drugs in 1979, when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  looked into whether he was selling methaqualone, a sedative to treat insomnia.  </P> <P> Five years later, the California Medical Board, an agency that monitors the  professional conduct of physicians, investigated charges that Kirk was  illegally prescribing drugs.  </P> <P> New suspicions were involved in February, 1988, when 18 federal and state  investigators wearing bulletproof vests stormed into Kirk's medical clinic and  seized his files. Kirk's practice was one of 24 searched that month by a task  force looking into allegations that diagnostic laboratories were fraudulently  charging insurance companies millions of dollars for unnecessary medical tests.  </P> <P> No criminal charges ever resulted against Kirk from any of the investigations.  Court records show that the only official action was a warning to him from the  California Medical Board to stop prescribing excessive amounts of drugs.  </P></p>

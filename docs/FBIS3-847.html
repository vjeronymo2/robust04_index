The Nigerian  minister was accompanied to the presidential private residence  by Ouattara Fambare Natchaba, his Togolese counterpart, and His  Excellency Vincent Okobi, the Nigerian ambassador to Togo.  After his discussions with the head of state, Mr. Kingibe had  this to say to correspondents:    [Begin recording] [Kingibe] First of all, since the Supreme  Court published the results of the recent legislative elections,  we congratulated the Togolese people and expressed the hope that  from now on there will be progress concerning the ruling of the  country under a democratic regime and in line with the  Constitution.    Of course, we also discussed the problem prevailing between  Nigeria and Cameroon. As you know, President Eyadema took some  initiatives with a view to mediate between the two countries.  Recently, he sent my brother, the Togolese foreign minister, to  Cameroon, which I also visited. The head of state and I  reviewed the developments in the situation and reached a number  of conclusions, mainly how to pursue dialogue in order to  resolve the problem peacefully. This is the wish of everybody,  including the Nigerian and Cameroonian leaders.    [Unidentified correspondent] In view of the recent  developments in the situation, what conclusions did you reach?    [Kingibe] We stressed the need to relentlessly pursue  efforts  toward finding peaceful solutions to the dispute; that is,  through dialogue. We also stressed the need to avoid at all  costs violence and more tension on the peninsula. [end recording]    As for Anthony Ani, the Nigerian deputy foreign minister, he  recently began a tour of five African countries for their  support in the border dispute between his country and Cameroon.  He is expected to visit Gabon, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and  Zambia.</p>

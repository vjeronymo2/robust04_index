			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (16): Key facts for the visitor TAXIS Zurich is one of the most expensive towns in Europe for taxi rides. Short trips in town cost SFr20 (Pounds 9 or Dollars 13.28) very quickly, and for a 15-20 minute ride to or from the airport you can expect to pay between SFr45 and SFr60. In general, one does not hail a cab in Zurich. There are several ranks in the centre of town, or a phone call to one of the co-operative radio cab centres will almost always produce a cab within five to ten minutes. Tel:271-1111 or 444-4444. TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT Avoid taking a taxi in rush hours. It is much quicker and cheaper to take a train from the main station (Hauptbahnhof). Trains run every 10 to 20 minutes and the journey takes roughly 10 minutes. You alight at the station underneath the airport building. Some hotels have a shuttle service. PUBLIC TRANSPORT Zurich's blue painted trams and buses are the epitome of Swiss efficiency. They have reserved lanes in most streets, so they do not get bogged down in traffic, even in rush hour. Board at any door except the front one next to the driver. Alight from any door. Make sure you buy a ticket before boarding as there is a SFr50 (Pounds 22.50) fine, payable on the spot, for those caught by random inspections without one. Every stop has a vending machine with instructions in four languages, and manned kiosks are at Paradeplatz, Bellevue and under the main station. Tickets cover zones and a given time period. If you are taking at least two rides in the central zone within a 24-hour period, it is worth buying a SFr6 day ticket (Tageskarte), which entitles you to as many rides as you like for the next 24 hours. Timetables at tram and bus stops are unfailingly adhered to. Vehicles run roughly between 6am and midnight at fairly frequent intervals. BOAT EXCURSIONS Take a boat trip on Zurich's lake - in good weather, this can be a quick way to get away from it all and relax. The main departure stop is at Burkliplatz. One boat features a midday trip, complete with lunch, which is pleasant in the summer. TOURIST INFORMATION The Tourist Office on Bahnhofplatz (main station) is a mine of useful information and usually very helpful. TRANSLATION SERVICES Rarely needed in this multilingual business centre, especially as most Swiss companies have their own in-house translators. Try Agentur der Dolmetscher-und Uebersetzervereinigung, Lindenbachstrasse 7. Tel: 362-3714. CONSULATES Addresses of consulates in Zurich (the embassies are in Berne, the official capital): Austria: Minervastr. 116 Tel. 383 7200 Belgium: Bellerivestr. 36 Tel. 385 3033 France: Muhlebachstr. 7 Tel. 251 8544 Germany: Kirchgasse 48 Tel. 265 6565 Italy: Todistr. 67 Tel. 286 6111 Japan: Utoquai 55 Tel. 252 9897 Netherlands: Mainaustr. 8 Tel. 383 8818 Spain: Hotzestr. 23 Tel. 363 0644 Sweden: Wiesenstr. 9 Tel. 383 4162 UK: Dufourstr. 56 Tel. 261 1520 US: Zollikerstr. 141 Tel. 422 2566 CHANGING CURRENCY Banks will quickly and efficiently exchange your Japanese yen into Italian lire without batting an eyelid. Normal banking hours are 8am to 4.30pm. But the offices at the airport and main railway station have much longer hours. STOCK MARKET PRICES All the big banks in the city centre have the prices on display screens in their windows. Or go to the Investor's Club in Nuschelerstrasse, in fact a public cafe, where information on all financial markets is available. TIPPING A service charge of 15 per cent is automatically included in all restaurant or cafe bills, but many people still round up the figure. Taxi fares also include a service charge but the drivers usually expect a slight rounding up of the bill, especially if they heave your heavy luggage about. CINEMAS Zurich has a large number of cinemas - and they almost always show foreign films in the original language, with subtitles in both German and French. Cinema listings in the newspapers specify the languages by use of letter codes, for example, Efd, meaning English with French and German subtitles. French films come with only German subtitles and German films usually come with none.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Bulgaria begins debt-cut talks Bulgaria and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday began detailed discussion in Frankfurt of last November's outline agreement for a 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.28bn) debt to a group of more than 300 commercial creditor banks led by Deutsche Bank. Previous talks had reached deadlock with Bulgaria seeking a 70 per cent discount while the banks offered only 38 per cent. The talks take place against renewed weakness for the Bulgarian currency, with the lev losing nearly 10 per cent of its value against the dollar in recent trading. Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, finance minister, who heads the Bulgarian delegation, said a final agreement might not be signed earlier than the middle of this year. A deal depends not only on reaching agreement on technical details with the banks but on a new standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Bulgaria has had to rely on financing from the IMF, the World Bank and foreign aid since 1990 when the socialist government stopped first interest and then capital repayments on the foreign debt. IMF officials visited Sofia last month; they said they wanted to see a budget deficit ceiling of 6.2 per cent of GDP before moving ahead with a new standby arrangement and a Dollars 300m special loan for countries in transition. Parliament re-opens today when debate on the 1994 budget will begin.</p>

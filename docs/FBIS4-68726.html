			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Ghosts Have Appeared in the Duma"] </F>   [Text] Supernatural things sometimes happen in our young  Russian parliament. On 13 April the state Duma was disturbed by  the news of the NATO bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia.  They decided to consider the situation, as speaker Ivan Rybkin  put it, "concretely and specifically." And immediately the  deputies turned their attention to the fact that Andrey Kozyrev  was not among them at this difficult time.    The renowned minister and unknown deputy Kozyrev had failed  to grace the Duma with his visits previously as well. But here a  case like this! Some of the Duma members lost their patience.  Vladimir Semago angrily demanded that "the deputy from the  Murmanskiy electoral district working also as minister of  foreign affairs, Kozyrev, be in attendance in our ranks, that he  be here if only for two or three sessions."    Kozyrev did not show up that day and his deputy, Sergey  Lavrov, answered for him to the people's elect. And yet--and  here is the supernatural part!--the elusive deputy minister, it  turns out, was at the session of the state Duma on the morning  of 13 April. He was--if you are to believe the information from  the electronic registration.    It was not so easy for the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer to get  his hands on this information. Although it is not secret,  according to a just adopted regulation of the state Duma,  permission for access to the information from the electronic  system shall be granted "to individuals other than deputies" by  the chairman of the committee for organizing the work of the  lower chamber. They were warned in the committee that granting  permission depends on the newspaper's position toward the state  Duma. Ultimately it turned out that OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was "not  the worst newspaper" and the permission was given.    Taking up 27 sheets, the registration table contains a good  deal of interesting information. Above all--about the diligence  of the people's elect. It is understandable that the electronic  system does not know the reasons for the absence of a  deputy--they can be quite respectable, nonetheless....    First place in terms of the number of sessions missed is  held  by a group of deputies who simultaneously hold eminent posts in  the structures of executive power. And the undoubted record  holder among them is A. Kh. Zaveryukha: If one is to believe the  electronic registration, he did not manage to attend a single  session. Slightly behind him are two other deputy prime  ministers-A.B. Chubays (attended four sessions out of 50) and  A.N. Shokhin (six sessions). Minister of Culture Ye.Yu. Sidorov  as a deputy attended seven sessions, Minister of Justice Yu.Kh.  Kalmykov--nine, and Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan--10. Added  to this group of deputies are A.L. Adamishin, first deputy  minister of foreign affairs (he was at six sessions out of 50)  and V.P. Kvasov, leader of the government apparatus (he was at  eight sessions).    Two other "risk groups" consisting of deputies who also seem  to be engaged on the outside (entrepreneurs and eminent  scholars) are more disciplined. Most frequently absent is  academician-economist N.Ya. Petrakov (he attended only 12  sessions).    In this position the journalist has a right to ask a number  of rhetorical questions. Why, for example, do the voters need  deputies who do not attend sessions? Does their behavior not  contradict the spirit and letter of the Constitution, which says  that "deputies of the state Duma work on a permanent  professional basis"? Finally, for what services do the absentee  deputies enjoy the rights, privileges, and benefits granted to  members of parliament? It is not mandatory to answer these  questions. Even before the elections it was clear that the  deputy prime ministers and ministers would not be going to the  sessions in the Duma. And why they were elected is a question  not for them but for the voters.    But God be with them, the ministers--at least they have  other  duties that also are for the state. Moreover, they do not  receive deputy wages. It is more difficult to understand the  "free politicians," especially the leaders of factions and  parties, who do not grace the Duma with their attention either.  About half of the plenary sessions were missed by Ye.T. Gaydar,  G.A. Yavlinskiy, and V.P. Lukin, and more than half--by B.G.  Fedorov. Understandably, leaders of parties, factions, and  deputy groups have other business than sitting in parliament,  but none of them was forced to do this, and even today it is not  too late to refuse the mandate.    The "continuous absence" of a number of deputies at plenary  sessions is, incidentally, only the surface. As it turned out in  the case with Andrey Kozyrev, attendance registered by the  electronic system is sometimes worse than out-and-out failure to  show up. According to the figures from the registration the  deputy minister was at that morning meeting on 13 April,  although no one within the walls of the Duma saw him or could  have seen him. It turns out that this is a fairly simple natural  miracle: A.V. Kozyrev turned his deputy card over to his  colleague in the faction, who not only marks the minister as  present but also, possibly, votes for him. (The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  observer could give the name of the deputy who has Kozyrev's  card in his pocket, but is refraining from this because of  ethical reasons.) This is an undoubted violation of the  regulations of the state Duma, not to mention propriety.    Unfortunately, turning their cards over to someone else has  become a bad habit. The pathetic explanation: "Where is the Duma  subcommittee on ethics looking!"--would sound like a weak report  on inoffensive pranks. For the essence of the matter is that the  fictional, "electronic" presence of the deputies raises doubts  about the results of the voting. More than once already the  chairman has garnered the votes he lacks literally one by one.  In such cases one or two fictional votes could bring about the  most "fatal" decisions.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON COMMITS TO USC;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: EL TORO HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK SAYS HE'LL PLAY FOR TROJANS AND IS  EXPECTED TO SIGN IN FEBRUARY.  </P> <P> El Toro quarterback Rob Johnson, The Times' Orange County high school football  back of the year, has orally committed to attend USC and is expected to sign a  national letter of intent with the Trojans on Feb. 6.  </P> <P> Johnson, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound senior, was the top-rated quarterback in the  county, passing for 2,207 yards and 25 touchdowns while completing 71% of his  pass attempts in 10 regular-season games.  </P> <P> An all-county wide receiver as a junior, Johnson became the first player in 32  years to make the team at different positions. But his versatility isn't  limited to football. He was the Orange County athlete of the year for 1989-90  after earning all-league honors in football, baseball and basketball. Johnson,  a right-hander, pitched in the Southern Section 3-A championship baseball game  at Anaheim Stadium as a freshman.  </P> <P> Johnson said he will play football and baseball at USC. He visited Penn State  and Notre Dame and canceled trips to Iowa and Brigham Young. He will visit USC  on Jan. 11-12.  </P> <P> "I was recruited by some great schools, but the situation at USC was the best  for me," Johnson said. "I like the (football) coaching staff, the quarterback  situation, their offense is similar to El Toro's, and the baseball facilities  are great."  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich could return for his junior season as USC's quarterback, but  there has been speculation he will be available for the NFL draft in the  spring. Also expected to return at quarterback is redshirt freshman Reggie  Perry.  </P> <P> "I talked with the coaches about the possibility of Todd turning pro, but his  future never played a part in my decision," Johnson said. "I plan to come in  and compete for the job. Todd is the No. 1 quarterback. The plan at this time  is to redshirt my freshman year."  </P> <P> Johnson's older brother, Bret, and Marinovich played for rival schools at El  Toro and Capistrano Valley in 1986-87 and were two of the most highly  publicized and recruited quarterbacks in county history.  </P> <P> Bret played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to Michigan State, where he  will be eligible next season. USC will play Michigan State in the John Hancock  Bowl on Monday, and Rob was asked which team he'll be rooting for.  </P> <P> "I'm for the Trojans all the way," he said.  </P> <P> And the possibility of a showdown with Bret in a future Rose Bowl game?  </P> <P> "That would sure give the reporters something to write about."  </P> <P> As for baseball, Johnson said he spoke with USC Coach Jim Gillespie during a  camp in Lodi last summer and figured he had a good opportunity to pitch as a  freshman. Johnson's fastball has been clocked at 86 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "I'm going to USC on a football scholarship, and I'll play baseball in the  spring," he said. "If I'm contributing to the baseball team, I'll remain with  the team like Rodney Peete did. If I'm not contributing, I'll move on to spring  football."  </P> <P> Johnson, who has a 3.4 grade-point average at El Toro, said he is undecided  about his major.  </P> <P> Johnson is the second high school quarterback to commit to USC. Last week, Kyle  Wachholtz, a 6-5, 200-pound senior from Norco High School, committed to the  Trojans.  </P> <P> Johnson is the second county player to orally commit to USC, joining Los  Alamitos receiver Tyler Cashman. Other players who have committed early include  running back Jeff Grenier of Fullerton (Colorado State) and offensive lineman  Karl Schroller of Fountain Valley (UCLA).  </P></p>

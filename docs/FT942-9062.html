			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Pressures on drachma send rates up again Greek interest rates surged again yesterday as pressure on the drachma continued, but the currency held its ground against both the D-Mark and the US dollar. The three-month interbank lending rate averaged 77 per cent, up from 48.5 per cent on Monday, while the one-month rate reached 100 per cent. Dealers reiterated that devaluation could not be ruled out, believing pressure on the drachma would resume once interest rates started to decline, even if depreciation were speeded up in the meantime. Said one: 'These rates can't be sustained beyond the end of the month. The drachma may be allowed to slip 5 per cent until then, but the speculators will still be waiting.' The drachma weakened only slightly against the D-Mark, closing at Dr148.3 compared with Dr148.2 on Monday. It was unchanged against the dollar, at Dr247.9. Government officials voiced relief that the threat of a devaluation immediately after curbs on short-term capital movement were lifted last weekend had been averted. They said that new measures to reduce the budget deficit, including an expanded privatisation programme and a tougher crack-down on tax evasion, would be announced by next week. 'The speculative pressure has been less than we expected,' one adviser said. 'The crucial matter now is to reinforce revenue-raising measures and gain policy credibility.' However, there was little indication that confidence in the drachma was being maintained. Two new issues of Ecu- and dollar-linked bonds at higher interest rates, aimed at attracting funds from overseas investors to boost the foreign exchange reserves, raised less than anticipated. According to initial estimates, they raised a total of Dollars 250m in funds from abroad, against a target of Dollars 500m. The government extended the subscription period for a second day. Despite the liberalisation of short-term capital movement, Greek investors may still have difficulty moving funds to other European Union countries. The complex procedures laid down by the central bank are designed to prevent rapid capital outflows by deterring investors from exporting money earned on the flourishing black economy much of which is currently funnelled into tax-free government bonds. According to the new Bank of Greece regulations, transfers of more than Ecu2,000 (Pounds 1,540) must be accompanied by the sender's tax details. Nearly Dr1bn (Pounds 2.7m) worth of state bonds were claimed yesterday to have disappeared from the Bank of Greece and officials fear they may have already been encashed, AP reports from Athens.</p>

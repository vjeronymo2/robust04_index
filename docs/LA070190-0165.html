			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONALD TRUMP'S WOES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> Allan Sloan seems to think that it is fun to watch a man go down the tubes. His  immature delight over Donald J. Trump's financial problems only sheds light to  me of the columnist's sadism and the fact that he probably should be writing  for one of the scandal tabloids.  </P> <P> The reporting of information was as shallow as his attitude, and it is  fortunate that he was not writing an article on AIDS.  </P> <P> While he was rolling in the aisles he forgot to let us know about the effects  of the Trump default on bondholders and the shareholders, the market, the  economy in the areas of Trump holdings, the position the lawyers involved in  the Trump divorce are now taking and probably a multitude of other  ramifications that a good reporter would look into in a situation like this.  </P> <P> I am sure your readers, including this one, would not delight in the fact that  Mr. Sloan lost his job even though we would rather read about business in the  Business section.  </P> <P> ALLAN DORFMAN  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Petrochemical companies  should change some of their business practices which seem to be  hindering price competition, the Fair Trade Commission said in a  report Friday [15 April].    The commission said Japanese petrochemical firms generally  negotiate with customers on prices for domestically produced  naphtha by taking into account the average price for imported  naphtha over a three-month period.    Although the practice was formed based on a Ministry of  International Trade and Industry "administrative guidance" in  1982, it seems to be a problem in terms of promoting fair price  competition in the industry, the commission said.    In addition, the practice of setting prices for domestically  produced resin higher than those for imported resin is also a  problem, it said. The situation stems from reasoning that  domestic firms provide after-sales service.    The commission also said joint sales ventures should be  disbanded because they appear to hinder competition. There are  seven such ventures at present, set up by petrochemical firms  for sales of general-purpose petrochemical products.    The commission, however, said that since the autumn of 1992,  prices for five petrochemical products, including naphtha and  ethylene, had appropriately dropped along with import prices for  the products' raw materials. The drops reflect the yen's rise  against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchanges during the period.</p>

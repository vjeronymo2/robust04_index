			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Sickness need not harm your wealth - Permanent health insurance can provide a decent income if you are too ill or disabled to work. Bethan Hutton explains the advantages ALMOST 1m people of working age have been off work sick for more than a year at any given time. State sickness pay, at Pounds 52.50 a week, is hardly enough to meet most people's financial commitments, and company sick pay does not last forever. The arguments for permanent health insurance, which provides an income if you are too ill or disabled to work, would seem clear but it is often described as the most under-sold form of insurance. Only 3m people in the UK are covered by a PHI policy. Around 50 companies offer PHI (sometimes also called income protection or income security insurance). The basic policies are all very similar, promising to pay up to 75 per cent of your normal income, less state sickness benefits, if you are unable to work due to sickness or an accident for more than a few weeks. They continue to pay out until you recover and return to work, or until you reach retirement age. How much you pay in premiums depends on the level of income you want to insure, your job, sex, age and state of health. Insurers will refuse some dangerous jobs, such as the armed forces and some oil industry workers, and will charge far more for heavy manual workers than for white-collar workers. Women pay less for life assurance than men but, when it comes to PHI, they can pay up to 50 per cent more. The companies cite statistics that women are more likely to be off work through illness than men and take longer to recover. Some insurers offer reduced premiums for non-smokers, but others argue - unlike life insurance - that there is no evidence of increased levels of claims under PHI from smokers. Mark Bolland, of independent financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe, says: 'The main thing to look for is cost - at the end of the day, this is a very premium-driven market. You are then looking at flexibility, in terms of whether or not the policy is index-linked or level and whether or not there is any proportionate/rehabilitation benefit.' An important factor in deciding the premium level is how long you are prepared to wait after falling ill before having payments start. This will depend on your employer's sick pay arrangements and your level of savings. Self-employed people often need benefits to start after one or two months because their income dries up as soon as they stop working. Employees may find they are covered by company sick pay for six months or a year, so can afford to wait until that runs out. The longer the deferred period you choose, the cheaper PHI becomes. The shortest waiting period available is one month (although some companies do not offer this); the longest is two years. The most common periods are 13 and 26 weeks. The other choice to be made is between level and increasing cover. Level means that the benefit remains the same and decreases in real value because of inflation; increasing gives you the option of premiums rising by a set 5 or 7.5 per cent a year, or being index-linked, with the benefit going up in proportion. With some policies, the benefit level will rise by 5 per cent a year while you are claiming, but will return to the original level when you return to work. PHI has been available for several decades, but claims have been more frequent recently and for longer periods than insurers had previously experienced. This has left some companies with a shortfall and a choice between raising rates, changing the premium structure or pulling out of the market. 'Some insurance companies are moving towards reviewable premiums so that they can cover themselves against a sharp increase in claims,' says Bolland. A reviewable policy means that the company can increase your premiums at its discretion if claim levels are higher than expected. But Friends Provident and Sun Alliance are two PHI providers which still offer guaranteed premiums for the life of the policy. A number of policies are unit-linked so that they build up a cash value over the years. This can act as a cushion to prevent premiums rising immediately if the company is hit by high claim levels. It can also provide a cash lump sum when the policy expires or the holder dies. The sum will be very small in relation to total premiums paid, however, and probably non-existent in the early years. PHI policies are not designed as savings products. Most policies last until retirement age, but some companies offer renewable policies which are for a fixed term, usually five or 10 years. At the end, you have the option to renew the contract without further underwriting but with higher premiums. Companies which offer only reviewable premium policies will need to be notified if you change your job, and may increase your premiums if the new job is seen as higher risk, but the ones which have guaranteed premiums will not usually make you pay more in these circumstances. All companies exclude war disabilities, and injuries or illnesses caused by alcohol or non-prescribed drugs. Attitudes to customers becoming HIV positive vary. Some companies will cancel a policy automatically if the holder tests HIV positive. Others will keep it in force but pay out only if the person is unable to work because of an accident or illness unconnected to HIV, such as a broken leg from a car crash. Normally, the insurers will pay out if you are unable to do your own job. But there are some occupations where insurers specify they will pay only if you are unable to perform a job for which you are 'reasonably suited by education, training or experience.' This usually applies to professions such as airline pilots where even a minor problem, such as poor eyesight, can end a career. Some jobs normally have an earlier retirement age than 60 or 65, and the policy will incorporate that. It is obviously in the companies' best interests to encourage you to return to work as soon as possible. For this reason, most have a rehabilitation option which allows partial payments if you return to your old job part-time as you begin to recover. Most will also pay proportionate benefit if you take up another less well-paid occupation while still unable to do your normal job. Some insurers offer housewife/husband policies which will pay a benefit if you are bringing up children or looking after the home but cannot do this because of illness. There is usually a standard level of benefit, around Pounds 100 a week, under such contracts. High earners need to check carefully how much of their salary a policy will guarantee to replace. Some have relatively low limits, offering 75 per cent of salary only up to around Pounds 30,000, and perhaps as low as 25 per cent after that. The maximum salary which can be covered under individual policies is in the region of Pounds 120,000. Benefits paid under individual PHI policies are tax-free until after one complete tax year has passed. Thus, if you start claiming in May one year, you could receive up to 23 months' benefit free of tax. This does not apply to employees covered by a company scheme, where benefits are taxed immediately under PAYE.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Ellington pit votes to close Miners at Ellington colliery in Northumberland, the last pit in north-east England, yesterday voted to accept closure, reversing their decision last weekend to put the mine into the industry's colliery review procedure. Union officials, who had recommended fighting the closure, said they were disappointed, but understood the men's decision against a background of deep uncertainty, mistrust of British Coal and high local unemployment. The redundancy package on offer to the 1,100 Ellington employees, worth up to Pounds 47,000 for the longest serving, includes a Pounds 7,000 bonus offered by British Coal since mid-1993 at pits where it was seeking immediate closure, plus a further Pounds 3,000 top up offered at five pits named for closure since the start of 1994. 'At the end of the day they were bribed out,' said Mr Ian Lavery, Ellington NUM lodge secretary. Production stopped yesterday at the pit. British Coal has yet to decide when its pit ponies, Britain's last, will be brought to the surface. Mining unions plan to meet British Alcan, whose adjacent aluminium smelter is Ellington's main customer, to discuss the chance that the company may bid for the pit in a joint venture with Ryan Group. Seven hundred miners at Ollerton colliery and a further 700 at Annesley colliery, both in Nottinghamshire, also voted yesterday to accept closure.</p>

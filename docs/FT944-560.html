			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Yeltsin vows Chechnya victory: Russian president halts Grozny bombing but says breakaway leader will be ousted Russian president Boris Yeltsin promised a sceptical nation yesterday: 'Order and peace will be restored in Chechnya.' But he made clear that the two-week war would not be halted until all Chechen units were disarmed and the regime of General Dzhokar Dudayev, the region's leader, replaced. In a 30-minute televised address, he softened the government's message by calling a halt to the bombing raids on the Chechen capital, Grozny, and by offering negotiations between senior Russian officials and leaders of the breakaway republic. Mr Yeltsin said some Chechen leaders understood that further resistance was 'senseless'. His promise of an end to the bombing was somewhat compromised by a later announcement by the defence ministry, which claimed that the use of laser-guided bombs would guarantee accuracy and avoid civilian casualties. The president's address, strongly and clearly delivered, was, in large part, directed at the more than 10,000 Russian soldiers now fighting determined resistance in Chechnya. The Russian army's leadership has been divided over the campaign. Mr Yeltsin said: 'You have a defined mission: to disarm the gangs of bandits and secure the handing over or the destruction of their heavy weaponry. I ask you to bend all of your efforts to fulfil the tasks assigned to you.' Mr Yeltsin spoke distinctly and showed no signs of after-effects from a nose operation that kept him in a Kremlin clinic for most of the early phase of the conflict. He made two brief swipes at the liberal politicians and the media opposed to the war. He said that the former were serving their own ambitions and some of the latter were funded by 'Chechen money'. He gave no details. Nor did he comment on the more serious opposition to the war from some senior military commanders including deputy defence ministers, now reportedly under sentence of dismissal. He said the republic, which proclaimed its independence at the end of 1991, endangered the stability of Russia. Proclaiming that no region of Russia had the right to secede, the president said that 'the longer the situation in Chechnya continues, the greater the destructive effect' to Russia's stability. He sought to reassure the Chechens that the republic would be restored to peace and to economic stability, but claimed that the Dudayev regime had transformed Chechnya into a haven for arms traders and drug traffickers, and that it had diverted state funds to buy arms. He said leaders 'to whom the Chechen people are dear' must be brought into the work of a future government of the republic, and that elections would be held. A three-man commission, composed of Mr Nikolai Yegorov, deputy premier for nationalities, Mr Sergei Stepashin, head of the Federal Intelligence Service, and General Anatoly Kvashnin, the officer commanding the Chechen operation, had been empowered to open negotiations. They are to be aided by a commission of parliamentary deputies from both houses of parliament and a supervisory committee, including Chechen tribal elders and religious figures. In an effort to calm the fears of Russians worried by the effects of the war on the political order and budget, he said: 'I want to assure all Russians - do not worry. Order and peace will be restored to Chechnya. We will take measures to avoid prolonging the search for a solution to this complex problem.'

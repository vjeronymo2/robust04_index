			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Two bids made for Sealord Products TWO rival bids were last night submitted for Sealord Products, New Zealand's largest deep sea fishing company, which was put up for sale by Carter Holt Harvey (CHH), the forestry group. One bid was from a New Zealand government backed Maori-led consortium which includes Brierley Investments, the investment group. The other was from Ashlar, a consortium led by Royal Greenland, a Danish state-owned fishing company. Both bids are unconditional, following due diligence procedures. CHH, which is selling Sealord to reduce debt, said the bids had been received by its 5pm deadline. Earlier yesterday Maori representatives signed a deal under which the government will lend them NZDollars 150m (USDollars 80.79m) to buy a half share in Sealord. The Ashlar consortium includes Ord Minnett, of Australian banking group Westpac, and Polar Products, a New Zealand fishing company. Ashlar said Royal Greenland's interest in the consortium was not more than 24.9 per cent, but would not disclose the size of the other members' stakes or name all its partners. It had not ruled out the prospect of some Maori investment in the consortium to represent tribal fisheries claims. Ashlar said it would also look at selling a portion of Sealord through a public share flotation, once Royal Greenland and Polar Products had improved its efficiency. CHH said it would make a prompt decision after reviewing the rival bids.</p>

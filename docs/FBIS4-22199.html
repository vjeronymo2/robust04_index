			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, Commander </F> of the Naval Forces of Ukraine: "The Way To Eliminate Tensions  Is To Implement the Yalta Agreements"]    [Text] Lately, especially after the meeting of the  presidents of Ukraine and Russia in Massandra, a concerted  effort has been under way in the Russian mass media and in the  Black Sea Fleet to inculcate the notion that this Fleet should  now be regarded as belonging to Russia and that this issue has  already been decided. There is also evidence of concrete steps  being taken to make this so. Thus, Russian Army insignia have  been issued to the members of some units of the Black Sea Fleet,  such as, for example, the naval infantry brigade. This process  is continuing: Military personnel serving in the Black Sea Fleet  are being made to change into Russian uniforms. Not too long  ago, Russia's St. Andrew's flag was raised on auxiliary vessels  and some warships in Sevastopol. As a matter of fact, these  flags have still not been lowered. This is a violation of  Article 7 of the Yalta agreements, which stipulates that the  naval insignia of the Black Sea Fleet is defined and approved  jointly by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia.    These and many other facts attest that the various conflicts  and misunderstandings that emerge result primarily from  violations of the Yalta agreements and an unwillingness to abide  by these agreements.    Many officials of the Russian Federation and Crimea, as well  as the Ministry of Defense and the Naval Forces, tend to view  the protocol of intent, signed by President Leonid Kravchuk of  Ukraine and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation in  Massandra, as an agreement that is now void, and they insist  that all problems be settled solely on the basis of the  Massandra documents.    As we know, these documents stated that the Ukrainian side  was prepared to consider the Russian Federation's proposals that  Ukraine hand over her portion of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia  as payment of Ukraine's debt for energy supplies. To consider  the possibility, but not to hand over her portion of the Fleet.  As to the handing over of the infrastructure, this was out of  the question from the beginning -- this territory belongs to  Ukraine and it will not be handed over. The specific mechanisms  of compensation for that part of the Fleet that was to be handed  over and the question of Russia's use of naval bases on the  territory of Ukraine were to be decided in the course of future  negotiations on the basis of recommendations submitted by  commissions of experts from both sides. But this question  remained unresolved because no mutually acceptable solution was  found. We, therefore, return to our earlier positions.    Referring to this problem, Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko in a recent interview with  Interfax-Ukraine stated that future talks on the  Black Sea Fleet should be based primarily on the Yalta  agreements of 3 August 1992.    According to these agreements, the Black Sea Fleet is to  serve as a basis for the creation of the Russian Navy and the  Naval Forces of Ukraine. While these are being created, the  Fleet remains under the joint command of the presidents of both  countries. Thus, during this transitional period, that is until  its status is finally decided at the highest state level, this  Fleet belongs to both states. Ukraine and Russia have equal  rights to the Fleet. The Fleet is bound to defend the interests  of both states to an equal degree. One might have thought that  the Black Sea Fleet would serve as the basis on which the two  sides would achieve mutual understanding and draw closer  together.    It is the duty of the command of the Black Sea Fleet and all  its command structures to educate its military personnel and its  blue- and white-collar workers in a spirit of love and respect  for Russia and Ukraine in equal measure and to foster the same  attitude towards both. It needs to do everything in its power to  ensure that every sailor, sergeant, petty officer [starshyna]  warrant officer [michman i praporshchyk], officer, and admiral,  every blue- and white-collar worker, is deeply aware that he may  not and has neither the legal nor the moral right to disregard  the interests of either side by his actions and his conduct,  because for the time being he serves both sides. That is why it  is sad, to say the least, to hear a high-ranking commander, who  should set an example of this attitude, making statements that  "the fleet of Ukraine is the fleet of a foreign state." It  should have long since been clear that, whatever the ultimate  future of the Black Sea Fleet might be, under no circumstances  should attitudes that are negative towards Ukraine in even the  slightest degree be encouraged in this Fleet. This is the  country where this Fleet is based, and the Fleet should comply  unconditionally with this country's laws, both during this  transitional period and in the future.    That is how it should be. This is in the spirit of the Yalta  agreements. And if everyone in the Black Sea Fleet understood  this problem thus, there would be no situations that lead to  conflicts.    In practice, things are quite different. We know that all  agreements reached with respect to the Black Sea Fleet,  beginning with the agreement in Dagomys on 23 June 1992, do not  nullify but rather supplement one another in defining the legal  mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet. From the  beginning, taking into account Russia's interests on the Black  Sea, Ukraine has been meticulously fulfilling the obligations  she assumed.    However, immediately following the meeting of the two  presidents in Dagomys, there began an attempt to artifically  exacerbate the problems of the Fleet. First, they declared the  Black Sea Fleet to be the fleet of all the CIS members, charged  with the "defense of the southern borders of the Slavic states."  Then, rejecting all military theoretical concepts, they declared  it to be a strategic fleet, yet forgetting to identify what and  whose strategy they had in mind. When it proved impossible to  sustain this myth, they began to plant the notion in people's  minds through the mass media that the Fleet belonged exclusively  to Russia. Moreover, this unwholesome propaganda uproar is  supported by raising the Russian flag, adopting Russian  insignia, etc.    As a member of the military, it is difficult for me to  believe that the Black Sea Fleet command cannot put an end to  these excesses. This looks more like an unwillingness to bring  order to the situation or a deliberately planned action. The  position of the Black Sea Fleet command is further attested by  the fact that it does not regard the laws of Ukraine and the  orders and directives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as  documents that must be obeyed, while the orders of the Ministry  of Defense of the Russian Federation and of the  Commander-in-Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation are  carried out unconditionally and fully. The fact that it is  subordinated solely to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia and  not to the ministries of defense of the two countries is cited  by the command of the Black Sea Fleet only when it is refusing  to carry out some request made by the Ukrainian Ministry of  Defense.    Recently, the level of combat readiness of the units and  formations of the Black Sea Fleet has been unilaterally raised  without informing the Ukrainian side. The Fleet is perfecting  amphibious assault operations [vidpratsyovuyutsya desantni  operatsiyi], dozens of ships are being put out to sea, and some  are even being sent to the shores of other states. These  large-scale operations are being conducted on Ukrainian  territory and on Ukrainian bases without any kind of  coordination with Ukraine.    The level of these activities increased markedly during the  presidential election in Crimea. This was anything but "innocent  military training," as the Black Sea Fleet tried to represent;  this was a purposeful and planned action. Especially, inasmuch  as it was accompanied by a build-up of social tensions with the  help of the mass media.    Strange as it may seem, the Black Sea Fleet conducted itself  in this situation as if these events were not developing and  taking place on the erritory, bases, and in the waters of  sovereign Ukraine. It is difficult to imagine the naval forces  of any country, based on the territory of another state,  behaving in such fashion with complete disregard for the laws  and interests of the host country. There is no precedent for  such conduct anywhere else in the world. If the Black Sea Fleet  acknowledges that it is an operational formation [operatyvne  formuvannya] of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, it is  completely incomprehensible why such measures are conducted  without the knowledge and approval of the Ukrainian side. And it  is even more incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet's  operations plan is approved in Moscow rather than in both  capitals.    Nor can I ignore the following problem. Various mass media  are spreading false information that Ukraine is violating the  agreements on financing the Black Sea Fleet. Publishing data  from the last few months, when Russia's share has indeed been  larger than Ukraine's, the authors of these reports and  broadcasts deliberately keep silent about the fact that Ukraine  financed the Black Sea Fleet one hundred percent through all of  1992 and up to May 1993, and that Russia has not settled its  accounts with Ukraine to this day. Ukraine also pays the  pensions and provides various social benefits to the military  personnel of the Black Sea Fleet. Another fact that has received  no publicity is that the Russian side is violating the  agreements by financing the Black Sea Fleet through its own  commercial structures rather than through the National Bank of  Ukraine. That is the reason for the irregularities and delays in  issuing payments. This attitude towards people is totally  unjustified. As before, the legitimate desire of many servicemen  in the Black Sea Fleet to take the loyalty oath to the people of  Ukraine, in other words, one of the states to whom the Black Sea  Fleet belongs and on whose territory it is based, the home of  its sailors and their families, is perceived as a hostile act.  There ave been instances, by no means isolated, in which such  officers and warrant officers [michmany i praporshchyky] were  dismissed from their posts by order, kicked out by the naval  infantry [vykydaly za porih sylamy morskoyi pikhoty], and even  discharged into the reserves, declared oath breakers, and so on.  Such actions are confirmed by the most recent instance, in which  the military personnel at the hospital base in Mykolayiv, who  had taken a loyalty oath to the people of Ukraine, were  dismissed on the spot from their jobs. Justice was done,  however, and these servicemen received protection and were  declared to be part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Yet Article  7 of the signed protocol, which regulates the procedure for  transferring (assigning) military personnel from one country's  armed forces to the forces of another state, stipulates that the  parties to the agreement will not hinder the transfer of  officers and warrant officers. The Yalta and other agreements  provide for mutual obligations on the part of Russia and Ukraine  to protect all the rights of servicemen in this respect and  allow them complete freedom of choice.    We witnessed a series of other serious situations that  disturbed not only members of the military but also the  residents of the city. These occurred when housing was being  divided between the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of  Ukraine, when the question of supplying heat to the village of  Holandiya was being decided, when there were unsanctioned  flights by airplanes of the Black Sea Fleet in violation of  existing regulations, and when our fuel was seized from the fuel  storage base in Sevastopol. It is no secret that the personnel  of the Black Sea Fleet take part in various political actions,  thereby violating the laws of both Ukraine and Russia.  Currently, this type of activity is very much on the rise.    Lately, the Black Sea Fleet command has taken discriminatory  steps in providing medical care for the personnel of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine, including Ukraine's Naval Forces.    How do we propose to solve this situation, first and  foremost  with respect to Sevastopol?    We believe that the structure of the military command in  Sevastopol should be changed immediately so that the garrison  chief is appointed directly by the president of Ukraine. This  should be an admiral or a general, who would take his orders  solely from the president of Ukraine and who would be a member  of the city's military commission and collegium. The  commandants' offices [komendatury], hospital, polyclinics, all  building and maintenance services, the military trade facility  [voyentorh], and the sports and cultural institutions of the  Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine should be placed  under his command.    The services under his command should serve all the military  units in Sevastopol but be independent of both the Black Sea  Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine. The garrison chief should  be in charge of the subunit, the regime service [sluzhba  rezhymu], and other garrison facilities. Working closely with  the administration of internal affairs and the Security Service  of Ukraine, he and the structures placed under his command would  then be able to safeguard genuine order in the city and prevent  any conflicts.    The problems associated with basing ships in Sevastopol are  also extremely important. In order to solve all the problems  presented by relations between the two military entities, a  structure needs to be created that would be independent of both  the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine -- the  Sevastopol Naval Base [SVMB]. On the basis of an agreement, the  SVMB could provide basing in Sevastopol for both the Russian and  Ukrainian fleets, and, if necessary, also the fleets of other  CIS members. It would be the task of the SVMB to provide all the  necessary facilities for basing. In our view, this solution  would remove the tension between Russia and Ukraine regarding  Sevastopol and the basing of their fleets.    The Black Sea Fleet is a structure of the former USSR.  Article 1 of the Yalta agreement states that it is to be divided  between Russia and Ukraine so that it can serve as a basis on  which the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Navy of the Russian  Federation will be created on the Black Sea.    In order to establish the Naval Forces of Ukraine, we need  bases and funds for both general and specific -- i.e. fleet --  purposes. This is why it is very important to abide  unconditionally by the joint agreement between the Russian  Federation and Ukraine on acknowledging and regulating property  relations by both sides. The agreement stipulates that all  property of the Black Sea Fleet and its bases, both real and  movable, is to be used in equal parts (50-50) by both states,  Ukraine and Russia.    There is currently a process under way to downsize the Black  Sea Fleet, and as part of this process, various materal assets  are being leased to commercial structures and private  individuals. The sale of the transport ship Donbass serves as an  excellent example of what is happening. The vessel was sold at  one-tenth of its real value. The agreement does not permit such  actions without the approval of Ukraine's state structures and  her Naval Forces. But this approval is not sought, which results  in serious losses to Ukraine and her Naval Forces.    This unsupervised process of squandering the material assets  of the Black Sea Fleet has been going on for more than two  years. This is confirmed by the large number of criminal cases  that have been brought. That is why today the question of  dividing up the Black Sea Fleet cannot be dealt with without a  special preliminary investigation and the necessary  preparations. A commission must be formed to determine what  assets the Black Sea Fleet had on 6 December 1991, that is, up  to the date of the proclamation of sovereignty by Ukraine, and  what has happened to these assets since then. The Russian and  Ukrainian people should be told the whole truth about the losses  they have suffered.    The second stage in the implementation of the Yalta  agreements on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet should consist of  removing those ships and armaments from combatant service that  have completed their service life and putting them up for sale.  Only those armaments should be retained that are needed in the  new circumstances and that are capable of ensuring that the two  fleets are able to carry out their assigned missions.    As part of the third and final stage, it is necessary to  divide up what remains, but taking into account the portion that  was sold or removed from Ukraine.    Throughout the entire transitional period, that is, until  the  end of 1995, Sevastopol must remain the main base of both the  Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian  Federation until Russia solves the problem of creating a base on  its own territory.    In conclusion, I would like to encourage those who persist  in  driving a wedge between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to  reread again and again the Yalta and other agreements on the  Black Sea Fleet that were reached at the highest interstate  level. All these agreements are imbued with a spirit of  friendship and mutual respect between the two states and a  desire to maintain equal relations between them, founded on the  norms and principles of international law.    This example is worthy of emulation. Common sense tells us  that this is the only viable approach. This approach also  reflects the fraternal spirit and good-neighbor relations which  the two people have always maintained. Unquestionably, the  implementation of the Yalta agreements will continue to promote  this relationship.    The future lies in just such relations, no matter what kind  of misunderstandings we are currently experiencing. Those who  stand in the way of the development and firm establishment of  such relations are doing serious harm to both Russia and  Ukraine. And it is difficult to say whom they are harming more.  Those who sow the seeds of enmity and distrust between people  will never grow and reap a good harvest. For there to be  understanding between people, there must be a desire for such  understanding.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOME IS BURGLARIZED, DEFACED IN 'HATE  CRIME'  </P> <P> Vandals who broke into Jill Williamson's Pacoima home Wednesday did more than  steal a VCR and jewelry -- they defaced the home with racial slurs in what  police are calling a hate crime.  </P> <P> The incident occurred between 7:30 a.m. and noon Wednesday. Vandals ransacked a  room, slashed a water bed and scrawled racial slurs on the walls of the living  room, Los Angeles Police Detective Larry Queen said. "The fact that someone  marked the epithet on the walls classifies it as a hate crime," Queen said.  </P></p>

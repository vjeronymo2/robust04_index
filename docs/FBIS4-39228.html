			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tatyana Korupayeva report: "At Mention of Words `Hard </F> Currency' People Keep Quiet"]    [Excerpts] People are thieving again in Russia.... They  are swiping everything that comes to hand, everything to which  the people have access, be it nails or gold bullion. But, as  emerged at a briefing at the Russian Ministry of Internal  Affairs [MVD] yesterday, people are most often put away for  trifling matters as they are easier to investigate. Whereas the  battle against "criminal infringements on hard currency assets,"  that is, against the plunder of the country's gold reserves, is  very problematic. [passage omitted]    According to Russian Federation MVD statistics, six times  more gold is being diverted today (than in 1984). The situation  is the same with regard to other precious metals and stones  (mostly industrial diamonds).    Inflation in Russia has forced citizens to think about the  future -- should they invest their assets in freely convertible  currency or get hold of it by any available means irrespective  of how the Criminal Code regards them. For example, many people  are today convinced that Article 88 of the Russian Federation  Criminal Code has actually been repealed. No, dear fellow  countrymen, it is alive and kicking, only they have stopped  "putting people up against the wall" for illegal currency  trafficking, and, what is more, nobody really knows what is  legal and what is not today. If somebody buys $100 at the  exchange rate from his neighbor, this remains legal until  law-enforcement agency staffers collar him. If you have done  this on the quiet, then well done. But in general it is  forbidden by law to buy up hard currency from individuals. For  example, there are some 15,000 bureaus de change in Moscow for  this purpose, of which one-third, as a check showed, were set up  independently, illegally, and have no license from the Central  Bank of Russia or its representatives.    In 1993 alone 70 percent of crimes in Moscow were connected  with foreign currency, which, as a rule, was unrecorded. It is  used for bribes and to pay off extortionists, and a few Russian  citizens are setting up numbered dollar accounts in Western  banks with it. The U.S. Congress has already discussed the  question of $40 billion being siphoned into West European banks  from Russia. They are very concerned about this matter there.  In Russia people are also concerned and perplexed, but at the  moment no one is in a position to even halt this currency crime  wave. Incredible efforts by law-enforcement agencies have  managed to return only one-fifth of what is circulating outside  the homeland to its coffers.    Predictions made by MVD staffers are very alarming: In the  next three or four years there will be a repartition of spheres  of influence among criminal structures in the gold- and  diamond-extracting industry.</p>

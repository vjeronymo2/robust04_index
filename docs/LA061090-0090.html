			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THREE TENNIS GREATS TAKE FANS FOR WALTZ DOWN MEMORY LANE  </P> <P> Waiters in white jackets moved quickly through the stands offering bowls of  strawberries and cream to ladies in straw hats and pretty dresses.  </P> <P> "Aren't the strawberries lovely, darling," said one woman to her companion.  </P> <P> This wasn't a scene out of the Great Gatsby, nor was it an afternoon at  Wimbledon, where snacks of strawberries and cream are as traditional as its  rules of white-only tennis attire.  </P> <P> But Saturday at John Gardiner's Rancho Valencia Resort in Rancho Santa Fe,  three legends of men's tennis took center court and waltzed down memory lane in  a charity tennis event to benefit Scripps Memorial Hospital's Stevens Cancer  Center.  </P> <P> Actually, the audience did most of the waltzing. All-time greats Pancho Segura,  Ken Rosewall and Vic Seixas were busy drawing gasps of recollection and delight  from a gallery that was seeing them now, after having seen, or heard about, the  way they dominated the game in their primes.  </P> <P> "See that two-handed forehand," said a gentleman who recognized one of Segura's  trademark strokes. "He was doing that years before anyone else was."  </P> <P> "He still has that beautiful form he had when he played Rod Laver," said  another admirer.  </P> <P> Segura, Rosewall, Seixas, and Ted Schroeder, who didn't play, were to be  inducted into Gardiner's Bridge of Champions after a morning of exhibition  singles and doubles matches, but rain delayed play for hours.  </P> <P> During that time, Gardiner introduced the players to fans who had paid $100 for  a day of tennis with the stars, or $1,500 for the weekend. Laver and Jack  Kramer were also to have been inducted, but were unable to attend.  </P> <P> Segura teamed with Sam Nunez, the resort's head professional, against Rosewall  and Seixas in an eight-game pro set. The players were engaging, the tennis was  entertaining. But a championship, with thousands of dollars on the line, this  was not.  </P> <P> "I didn't know you could still hit that shot," Seixas said after Segura tricked  his opponents with a perfectly placed lob.  </P> <P> "Move faster Pancho, faster," Segura scolded himself.  </P> <P> "Oh, you guys are serious," said Rosewall after Nunez drilled a volley down the  middle. But Rosewall and Seixas eventually won, 8-6.  </P> <P> Rosewall, 55, is the touring pro for Gardiner's tennis resorts in Arizona and  Northern California. When he is not conducting clinics or playing on the men's  senior tennis tour, he runs two tennis facilities on the Gold Coast of  Australia. He lives in Sydney.  </P> <P> Rosewall said that during his prime he didn't realize he could make a living  playing tennis.  </P> <P> "We're fortunate the growth of the sport has allowed us to stay in it," he  said.  </P> <P> According to Rosewall, Australia is going through a drought of top players, and  he is hoping that change is on the way.  </P> <P> "Pat Cash was our last player to win at Wimbledon," Rosewall said. "Hopefully,  we can come up with some players and bring Australia back to the top."  </P> <P> It has been 40 years since Segura, who turns 69 June 20, left his native  Ecuador to make a life of tennis in the United States. It's a move he has never  regretted.  </P> <P> "This is a dream come true," said Segura, who has been the resident pro at La  Costa for 19 years.  </P> <P> Since Segura's reign in the 1940s and '50s, Ecuador, a small South American  country, has produced few top players. Today in Paris, one of them -- Andres  Gomez -- meets American Andre Agassi for the French Open men's singles title.  </P> <P> "I am proud," said Segura, wearing a bright pink and black Nike shirt that  Agassi has made famous. "Gomez and myself. We are the best Ecuador has  produced. We are such a small country. There are only, maybe 4,000 tennis  players there."  </P></p>

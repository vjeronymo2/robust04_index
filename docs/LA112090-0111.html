			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE ON PEACE HAS PARIS MOTORISTS READY TO GO TO WAR  </P> <P> It was supposed to be a summit marking the end of the Cold War, but Paris  looked like a city under siege. The three-day meeting of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe opened Monday in a tense melange of pomp and  high security that snarled traffic and pushed the short-fused Parisian populace  to the verge of explosion.  </P> <P> At times Monday it was difficult to tell which looked more threatening -- the  lines of heavily armed police or the outraged French citizenry who live and  work in the central Paris neighborhoods where most of the summit events are  taking place.  </P> <P> Incensed over traffic jams and summit-related security zones accessible only to  people bearing special passes, Parisians vented their rage to neighbors,  television crews, parking meter police and anyone else who would listen.  </P> <P> Although the French government had worked hard to win the summit for Paris,  doctors complained that they were blocked from visiting their patients.  Truckers fumed about missing deliveries. Restaurant owners faced empty dining  rooms and demanded that the government pick up the tab.  </P> <P> "I'm writing (French President Francois) Mitterrand," said Michele Plante, 73,  owner of Le Cotton Restaurant, not far from the Kleber International Conference  Center, where the summit meetings are being held. "In order for our customers  to get here, they would have to park 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) away and come by  foot. I pay taxes. The government owes me for this. A three-day summit is three  days too long."  </P> <P> With 34 heads of state and government in town for the meetings, the French were  taking no chances on the security front. Ten thousand Paris police, gendarmes  and military security specialists lined the streets in central Paris near the  Kleber Center and outside key hotels and embassies.  </P> <P> Tough-looking Compagnie de Securite Republicaine (CRS) police -- including  specially trained anti-terrorist brigades outfitted in black flight jackets and  paratroop-style jumpsuits -- stood outside luxury hotels next to doormen in  livery and top hats. Upscale shopping streets such as the Rue du Faubourg  Saint-Honore -- where Hermes, Yves Saint-Laurent and Gucci all have boutiques  -- were virtually closed to shoppers who did not have special passes during key  hours of the day.  </P> <P> In the ultra-sensitive three-block area surrounding the Kleber Center, not far  from the Arc de Triomphe in the stolidly bourgeois 16th District of Paris,  subway stations were closed and all traffic halted except for police and  official motorcades. Police units even took the precaution of cramming coiled  bunches of razor-sharp concertina wire into manholes to block potential routes  for terrorists through the famous Paris sewer system.  </P> <P> But while security was extremely taut in some spots, it was surprisingly loose  in others.  </P> <P> Reporters attending the signing of the historic conventional arms treaty Monday  morning at the Elysee Palace were amazed when guards barely glanced at their  credentials, although President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,  British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders were all  inside the palace, sitting comfortably under crystal chandeliers and priceless  Gobelin tapestries in the ornate Salles des Fetes ballroom.  </P> <P> Even before the summit, traffic and the perpetual Paris traffic jams known as  bouchons (literally, "corks") or embouteillages ("bottlenecks") were already  favorite topics of conversation in the French capital -- second only, perhaps,  to the traditional French preoccupation with liver problems. But the Parisian's  frustration with traffic has reached a new high with the CSCE summit.  </P> <P> In addition to closed streets, roadblocks and the presence of hundreds of  additional police vehicles in the city, the continual high-speed parade of  official motorcades on the narrow streets has the city tied in knots. At one  point Monday morning, 48 different official motorcades, each with a fleet of  security cars and motorcycle escorts, were on the road, klaxons blaring and  lights flashing.  </P> <P> In response to the summit gridlock in the capital, an anchorman on one of the  French television networks came up with a new meaning for the acronym CSCE.  Instead of Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, he suggested the  following French version: Conducteurs Serieusement Coinces dans Embouteillages  ("Drivers Seriously Trapped in Traffic Jams").  </P> <P> Given all the pre-summit hype comparing the event to the 1813-1814 Congress of  Vienna and other epoch-changing events, it was nice to see that the  literature-loving French hadn't lost their sense of priorities. Only moments  after the historic conventional arms reduction treaty was signed Monday morning  at the Elysee Palace, the leading story on Antenne 2, the main state-owned  television network, was not the summit but the announcement that the  prestigious book award, the Prix Goncourt, had been give to author Jean Rouaud  for his novel "Champs d'Honneur" (Fields of Honor).  </P> <P> Before winning instant fame for his novel, Rouaud worked selling newspapers at  a corner stand. The novel centers on the lives of a French family that lost  many of its members in World War I, which Rouaud, oblivious to the fall of the  Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, called "the main  event of our age."  </P> <P> Part of the problem in maintaining security at the Paris summit is that with 34  national leaders attending, the number of enemies and potential attackers  increases almost exponentially. Nearly every leader has some group or national  separatist movement back home that opposes him or her. Nearly all the  separatist movements have representatives in France, which prides itself as a  haven for political exiles.  </P> <P> Several leaders have multiple opponents. For example, French police are giving  special security protection to Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who is opposed by  Armenian as well as Kurdish militants. Other world leaders given enhanced  security are British Prime Minister Thatcher, the leading target of the Irish  Republican Army, and Gorbachev, who may have been the target of a potential  assassin in Red Square last week.  </P> <P> An additional police unit was assigned to Canadian Prime Minister Brian  Mulroney after police received a tip that French-speaking Mohawk Indians were  in town and looking for the Canadian leader's scalp.  </P> <P> Back home in Quebec, the Mohawks are involved in a bitter, occasionally  violent, feud with the Canadian government over land rights and other issues.  According to the police tip, a contingent of Mohawks planned to set up camp  under Mulroney's window at the luxury Plaza Athenee hotel on the Avenue  Montaigne.  </P> <P> Mulroney spokesman Gilbert Lavoie said Monday that the Canadian delegation was  on the lookout but so far had seen no sign of the Mohawks.  </P> <P> President Bush is well known for his fast-paced golf game, but he may have set  an all-time speed record of a sort that will win no hearts here: shortest time  spent eating dinner at the Elysee Palace, where he dined with President  Mitterrand on Sunday night.  </P> <P> Dinner is usually a leisurely ritual at the Elysee, official residence and  office of French presidents. Although Bush staffers had set aside a respectable  hour-and-a-half for the meal, French spokesman Hubert Vedrine said it concluded  after only 45 minutes -- a rarity in the French culture, where food is often  accompanied by conversation.  </P> <P> The menu has not been disclosed. But the President may have simply been saving  room for Thanksgiving, when he and wife Barbara are scheduled to eat a  traditional turkey dinner with three different American units stationed in  Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The world leaders were treated to a more traditional feast Monday at the  Elysee. Presidential chefs presented Mitterrand's guests, including Bush, with  a menu of a mousse of scallops accompanied by fresh-water crayfish; grilled  Charolais beef with roasted shallots; artichoke heart cooked in olive oil;  assorted cheeses, and a rich desert of chestnuts and cream. The wines were a  1985 Burgundy, Beaune Clos des Mouches (about $100 a bottle); a 1978 Bordeaux,  Chateau Grand Puy Lacoste ($80 a bottle), and a 1982 Champagne, Louis Pommery  ($75 a bottle).  </P> <P> As usual, the menu was reviewed critically by leading chefs and restaurateurs.  Jean-Claude Vrinat, owner of Taillevent, a Paris restaurant renowned for its  wine list, praised the menu and the first two wines.  </P> <P> He described the Bordeaux as a perfect wine for the beef course. "It's a wine  that lets you go on working after you eat," he said. "I presume these people  needed to work." However, Vrinat declared himself very disappointed by the  choice of Champagne as the dessert wine.  </P> <P> "I just don't understand it," he said. "The chestnuts are a very rich dessert.  It is an excellent Champagne, but I am afraid it may have been destroyed by the  chestnuts. It is very sad."  </P></p>

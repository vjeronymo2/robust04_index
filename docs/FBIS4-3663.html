			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Conditional MFN' Status Will Not Work"] </F>   [Text] Wu Yi, minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, concluded her U.S. visit this  week. During her visit to the United States, Minister Wu Yi  attended the Eighth Conference of the Chinese-U.S. Commercial  and Trade Joint Committee, during which both sides profoundly  discussed the question of strengthening economic and trade  cooperation. Their discussions were frank and pragmatic and  yielded constructive results. The Chinese-U.S. Trade and  Investment Symposiums in New York and Los Angeles also concluded  satisfactorily, during which various U.S. corporations signed  all kinds of agreements with Chinese central and local  authorities as well as enterprises, involving a total amount of  $10 billion. This has once again proved that there is huge  potential for Chinese-U.S. economic exchanges and that such  business talks are greatly beneficial to both sides.    The problem now is that, at a time when Chinese-U.S.  economic  and trade relations are developing vigorously, an irrelevant  factor to economic and trade relations is casting a shadow over  the two countries' entrepreneurs. That is, what policy will the  United States adopt on the question of renewing China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] status? In April and May every year,  U.S. exporters to China frown because the White House stand and  practice on this issue are quite unfavorable to them. The  Chinese side is concerned about this and Hong Kong and Taiwan  businessmen who have built factories on the mainland are  seriously worried about it.    Last year the Clinton administration decided to renew  China's  MFN status for a year, with the caveat that "China must make a  significant improvement on the human rights issue" before it can  obtain renewal this year. In other words, this is a conditional  MFN status. When meeting U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  last month, the Chinese side explicitly clarified its position  on this issue: China cannot accept a conditional MFN status.  China's human rights concept is different from the U.S. one but  this does not prevent the two countries from having a dialogue  on this question. However, China absolutely does not allow  others to interfere in its internal affairs on the pretext of  human rights. China's position is clear and its attitude is  reasonable.    China needs MFN status because it affords both sides equal  treatment and mutual conditions in trade and also because the  United States is China's biggest export market. Similarly, the  United States needs China: It needs to import large amounts of  cheap but good quality industrial products from China and it  also needs China because it is a big market. While in the  United States, Minister Wu Yi said that, in future, China will  import commodities worth $1,000 billion from the United States.  For U.S. corporations, Chinese markets are absolutely  necessary. As Wu Yi said, should the United States withdraw  China's MFN status, a trade war could break out between China  and the United States in which there would be no victor.    The Clinton administration is unlikely to withdraw China's  MFN status rashly because this could hit U.S. entrepreneurs  heavily; more seriously, Chinese-U.S. economic and trade  relations would break off and this would affect Chinese-U.S.  political relations and even the global strategic pattern.  China is a large country which plays a decisive role in the  Asia-Pacific region, is the pillar for economic growth and  stability in this region, and is a permanent member of the UN  Security Council. Should the United States prefer a  confrontation with China, U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific  region will be affected. The U.S. economy is just starting to  recover and the Clinton administration is facing difficulties  which are proving hard to cope with in the diplomatic field,  such as the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. If the United States prefers  confrontation against China, it will, as Minister Wu Yi said,  commit a strategic mistake.    Recently the Clinton administration held discussions with  Democratic congressmen about China's MFN status. Reports said  that the U.S. side may possibly propose a so-called partial MFN  status. That is, it may possibly cancel preferential treatment  for products imported to the United States by Chinese  state-owned enterprises. This act of discrimination against  Chinese state-owned enterprises will not work. Let us put aside  this question of "conditional MFN," which is technically hard to  execute; imposing sanctions against Chinese state-owned  enterprises could damage the Chinese people's feelings and the  Chinese Government will not accept it.    There is only one action for the U.S. Government to take: It  must separate the human rights issues from trade and grant China  permanent MFN status. This will be the best conclusion for the  United States and China and both sides will be the victors.</p>

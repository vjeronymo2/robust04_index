			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Domestic Asset Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing that all firms using the financial test have assets in the United States at least equal to the sum of the costs they seek to assure through the financial test. This domestic asset requirement is intended to ensure that the Agency has access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. Without this requirement, the Agency could experience substantial difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms that have their assets outside of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The domestic asset requirement proposed for the subtitle D corporate owners and operators of MSWLFs is consistent with revisions to the domestic asset requirement of the subtitle C corporate financial test proposed today (see section V. of this preamble for further discussion).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VII. National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Discussion of the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 16, 1990, NSWMA submitted a rulemaking petition to the Agency. The Agency has addressed many of the concerns raised in the petition in a July 1, 1991 proposed rule (56 FR 30201) and a September 16, 1992 final rule (57 FR 42832). While today's proposed rule addresses two more issues raised in this petition, it does not represent the full Agency response to NSWMA's petition. The Agency continues to examine the concerns raised in NSWMA's petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Meridian Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its analysis, the Agency evaluated the test developed by the Meridian Corporation, which was submitted to EPA on February 16, 1990, along with a rulemaking petition, by the National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA). Using the methodology described above, the Agency found that the test was not as effective at minimizing public and private costs as the test proposed on July 1, 1991. As a result, the Agency has not proposed the test developed by Meridian Corporation for further analysis. The NSWMA petition, the test developed by the Meridian Corporation, and the Agency's analysis of that test can be found in the docket in support of this proposal. The Agency will consider and respond to any comments it receives on the Meridian financial test in evaluating the revisions to the corporate financial test for subtitle C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Request for Comment on Allowing Owners and Operators to Discount Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The financial assurance requirements in many EPA program areas (e.g., RCRA subtitles C and D, TSCA PCBs) require owners and operators to calculate cost estimates in current dollars, and aggregate these estimates (even though these costs may be incurred many years in the future). Owners must obtain a financial responsibility instrument for at least the amount of this aggregated cost estimate. The RCRA regulations currently do not allow owners and operators to adjust this aggregated cost estimate to reflect the fact that these activities are scheduled to occur in future years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has received many requests to allow owners and operators to meet the financial assurance requirements based on the present value of these future obligations. In a rulemaking petition submitted on February 16, 1990, the National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) recommended that the Agency allow firms to use a present value based on a discount rate to estimate their costs for post-closure care and for the extended care portion of corrective action. (The NSWMA petition can be found in the docket of today's rulemaking.) In addition, the Agency has received public comment making similar requests during the development of other financial-responsibility-related rules. In the preamble to the proposed local government financial test, the Agency solicited comment on the whether to allow owners and operators to discount costs associated with MSWLFs (see 58 FR 68353 at 68361, December 27, 1993). The Agency recognizes that this is an issue of interest to many parties, and has reviewed and considered all comments received to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

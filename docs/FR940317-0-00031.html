			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has received anecdotal information from some commenters indicating that certain nonprofit research institutions (which do not fall within the definition of nonprofit educational institution as provided in 10 CFR 171.5) and Federally-owned research reactors should receive the same treatment as educational institutions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, the Commission does not believe it has sufficient information on which to base a generic exemption for such research institutions and reactors. Because the proposed rule did not suggest that the educational exemption be expanded in this way, the Commission received a smaller number of comments than are needed to make an informed decision on this issue. For that reason, the current policy of charging such entities annual and user fees remains in effect. Those nonprofit research institutions and Federally-owned research reactors who believe that they qualify for an exemption from the annual fee based on the public good concept are, of course, free to request one from the Commission. See 10 CFR 171.11. Depending on the outcome of any such requests, the Commission may need to revisit the question of whether to make nonprofit research institutions generically exempt from fees in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Most Federally-owned research reactors were exempted from fees by Congress in earlier legislation. See section 6101(c)(4) of OBRA&hyph;90, 42 U.S.C. 2214(c), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, the reactor in question operates at a power level greater than that specified in the legislation for exempt facilities, and therefore does not meet the definition of a ``research reactor'' for purposes of the statutory exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that medical licensees should continue to pay annual fees. This is consistent with past Commission practice. Contrary to some commenters' assertions, the Commission's fee policy does not result in a competitive advantage for university medical licensees over nonprofit hospitals. Both are charged fees for licenses authorizing medical treatment using licensed nuclear material. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission does not believe that medical licensees are analogous to nonprofit educational institutions. Their function is not pure research and education, but primarily to provide services to paying customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, materials licenses held by nonprofit educational institutions which authorize remunerated services or services performed under a Government contract are also subject to fees. See 10 CFR 170.11(a)(4) and 171.11(a)(1) (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Commission does not dispute that medicine provides significant benefits to patients, such treatment is both depletable and excludable. The benefits of medicine are therefore a private rather than a public good. By contrast, an educational institution generally disseminates the results of its basic research to all who want it, even going beyond the confines of the university itself, without receiving compensation from any of those benefitting from that knowledge. The key to nonprofit educational licensees' singular treatment is not merely that they provide valuable social benefits; rather, it is the existence of certain market failure considerations (discussed above) that apply to producers of pure knowledge through basic research, but not to medical practitioners. The distinction between educational and medical licensees is addressed at greater length in the Commission's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice discussing the petition filed by the American College of Nuclear Physicians and the Society of Nuclear Medicine seeking a fee exemption for medical licensees (published in the Proposed Rule Section of this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission does not plan to adopt the suggestion of some commenters that most or all other licensees should contribute something toward the costs of exempting nonprofit educational licensees. The agency, in any event, is not recouping these costs for FY 1993, as it is legally precluded from retroactively collecting those costs from licensees. The Commission in its Energy Policy Act-mandated review of fee policy has concluded that the costs of exempting nonprofit educational institutions should be excluded from the fee base through legislation modifying OBRA&hyph;90. In its study, the Commission concluded that if legislation to accomplish this is not enacted, these costs should continue to be recovered through fees assessed to power reactor licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

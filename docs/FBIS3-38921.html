			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on a recent statement by the Turkish  Foreign Ministry alternate spokesman accusing our country of  alleged violation of the Muslim minority's human rights, Foreign  Ministry spokesman Kostandinos Bikas said that the government  condemns Turkey's attempt to intervene in Greek decisionmaking.    The spokesman said: Greece is a just state and fully  respects human rights. Turkey is neither concerned nor  interested in alleged violations of the Muslim minority's human  rights in Greece. It is merely seeking excuses, encouraging  nationalistic extremism, distorting situations and facts, and  unhesitatingly using the minority issue, obviously realizing the  damage done to Greek-Turkish relations and stability in the  region.</p>

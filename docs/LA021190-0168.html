			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS ENDORSE EARLY GERMAN REUNIFICATION  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday assured West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Soviet support for the early reunification of Germany  at a pace and in a way determined by East and West Germany themselves.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, reaffirming what Moscow regards as the German "right of  self-determination," in effect cleared the way for the opening on Tuesday of  preliminary negotiations between East Berlin and Bonn on reunification by  pledging to respect the outcome.  </P> <P> "Germans themselves should make their choice in what state forms, what periods  at what pace, and under what conditions they will be realizing their unity,"  Gorbachev told Kohl, according to an official statement.  </P> <P> Kohl, clearly jubilant, told a late-night press conference, "Gorbachev and I  agreed that it is the sole right of the German people to decide whether they  want to live in one state. He told me unmistakably that the Soviet Union will  respect the German decision. This is a very good day for Germany."  </P> <P> Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said that an  understanding was also reached during his talks with Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  the Soviet foreign minister, on a negotiating framework and an accelerated  timetable that envisions a fully ratified agreement by the end of this year.  </P> <P> The agreement reached between East Berlin and Bonn will be put before the four  victorious Allied powers of World War II -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union  and the United States -- for approval and then for presentation to an  all-European summit conference at the end of the year, Genscher said.  </P> <P> While the negotiations are expected to be complicated, particularly because the  question of German reunification is racing ahead of European security and  disarmament issues with which it must be coordinated, the Soviet declaration  was regarded by West German officials as laying the foundation for the talks.  </P> <P> "The unification of the two German states will take place in an orderly way,"  Genscher said.  </P> <P> Soviet approval of the negotiating framework was also significant, West German  officials said, because it recognizes the priority of the agreement between  East and West Germany, effectively settles how the interests of Germany's  neighbors will be dealt with and accepts the accelerated pace of change in East  Germany.  </P> <P> With popular and political pressure building in East Germany for speedy  reunification, there has been growing apprehension that the negotiations  necessary on such a difficult issue will be overtaken by actual events.  </P> <P> Asked how quickly the two states could merge, Kohl said he believes this will  follow the parliamentary elections in East Germany next month and the  subsequent efforts to form a government.  </P> <P> Kohl, who is on a diplomatic push that will take him to Paris, London and  Washington after meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday with East German Prime  Minister Hans Modrow in Bonn, is seeking to "get ahead of the curve," as a  Soviet foreign affairs specialist said.  </P> <P> "He wants to get as much of the agreement in place, if he can, before the  people on the streets in Germany start dictating its terms. We understand and  want to cooperate."  </P> <P> Gorbachev cautioned the West German leader during their nearly three hours of  talks in the Kremlin to take a "balanced," even "cautious," approach to the  question of German reunification to ensure that present European stability is  maintained, according to an official account of the meeting distributed by the  Soviet news agency Tass.  </P> <P> "German rapprochement should not damage positive results achieved in (the  European security) process or in East-West relations as a whole and upset the  European balance," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> "Only such a policy is acceptable that takes into account all realities and all  possible aftermaths -- domestic and foreign policy and economic consequences  and, naturally, a psychological reaction of Germans and other countries,  especially those that participated in the Second World War," the Soviet leader  continued.  </P> <P> "The solution of the German question is inseparable from the success of the  disarmament talks in Europe, from the changing role of the two military and  political alliances and from questions concerning the presence of foreign  troops in European states."  </P> <P> Despite these strong Soviet caveats, Kohl felt that he had secured a major  diplomatic breakthrough in his talks with Gorbachev, and he pledged that the  negotiations, now certain to be accelerated, will be coordinated with the  superpowers, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact  and with other European countries.  </P> <P> The understanding with Moscow is important for Bonn, West German officials  said, because it means that the Soviet Union indeed recognizes the German right  of self-determination and will not attempt to use its still considerable  influence in East Berlin in an attempt to shape the agreement, nor will it  impose conditions on the agreement with the threat of a veto.  </P> <P> But Shevardnadze, addressing a news conference on Saturday morning before the  Kohl talks, recalled the Soviet proposal, dating back to the 1950s, for a  united but demilitarized Germany to remind Bonn and its allies in NATO that  German reunification is a particularly sensitive issue for Moscow, not one that  can be easily solved with just quiet diplomacy and a few ambiguous phrases.  </P> <P> "We have been for the unity of the German nation from the beginning, but the  neutrality principle has always been central to our thinking," Shevardnadze  said -- although Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meeting with Soviet  officials here last week, rejected neutrality and called for a united Germany  to be at least an "associate member" of NATO.  </P> <P> "There must be a solution to the problem that does not contradict general  European interests," Shevardnadze said when pressed on the question, "and there  are various possible solutions."  </P> <P> Senior Soviet officials do not exclude the possibility of Germany as an  "associate member" of NATO, participating in the alliance's political  activities but not in the military matters, if there were firm East-West  understandings on the terms.  </P> <P> Some Soviet foreign policy specialists, in fact, see such a status as  preferable because of its implied limitations to a nominally neutral Germany  with larger, better equipped and better positioned armed forces than any other  European country.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union now has 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany, roughly  two-thirds of those it has in all of Eastern Europe, and their future is an  important question for Moscow.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze also warned that the question of postwar European borders, an  issue that arouses strong nationalist feelings in West Germany and considerable  fear among its neighbors, will have to be resolved in any agreement on  reunification.  </P> <P> Moscow wants recognition of current borders as one way of reassuring the  neighbors, which include its Warsaw Pact allies of Poland and Czechoslovakia  and by extension even the Soviet Union, that a reunified Germany threatens no  one.  </P> <P> Kohl, questioned closely on the borders issue, said that acceptance will have  to be left to the new parliament of a reunified Germany, that recognition of  all Germany's present borders could continue but that the matter could be  resolved only then.  </P> <P> The West German leader said that he acknowledged in his talk with Gorbachev  that the process of reunification is proceeding much faster than anyone  anticipated and that there have to be ways of managing it.  </P></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Mamet goes minimalist - Martin Hoyle finds the playwright's latest work too flimsy for words With Oleanna's shock tactics fresh in the collective theatregoing memory and Glengarry Glen Ross revived at the Donmar, a third David Mamet play has opened in the West End. The Cryptogram flutters into the Ambassadors Theatre like an insubstantial wisp of memory; a sensitive and elusive short story of childhood, perhaps, unwisely spun out to theatrical length (only just: even with interval the evening is short though not, alas, rapid). For a world premiere by America's leading playwright the occasion is strangely flat. The management has offered London first refusal. I for one refuse it. For all his popular identification with strong language and thrusting macho values, Mamet is a versatile writer. Glengarry presents a frieze of flat characters as frozen in hieratic postures as in an ancient Egyptian inscription. All immediacy and impact, they lack a past, history, backgrounds. His new play is the reverse, soggy with significance, every action and sentence setting off resonances that will plainly affect the small boy at the centre of the action for the rest of his life. This is John, aged ten, who cannot sleep and hears voices, and whose father has just left his mother. She finds out by accident and is at first comforted by Del, a family friend and for some reason homosexual. In the course of their talk it emerges that the departed Robert had borrowed Del's room for assignations with another woman. As a sort of hush-money he passed on a German survival knife, as one does to compliant chums, that he won in the war (this is Chicago, 1959). Donny, the wife, reveals that the knife, far from being the spoils of combat, was a souvenir bought in the streets of London. Devalued, it is finally given to the child, as guilt and shame are passed from one generation to another. Little effing and no blinding; but there remains the Mamet trademark of elaborately jagged, and perfectly interlocking, jigsaw dialogue. Equally calculated is his shy at Pinterese: a teasing, repetitive interrogation which squeezes out revelations with the almost ritualistic spareness of minimal music. Bob Crowley's sets desperately attempt to add something to this flimsy meandering: a dark room, a staircase, suddenly transparent walls that give glimpses, big deal, of kitchen or child's bedroom though no sign of the emperor's new clothes. The piece is acted for more than it is worth by Lindsay Duncan, a stylishly intelligent actress who has been wasted in more bad plays and/or misguided productions than Equity has resting members. She manages to make lines like 'I am not God; I don't control the world' sound deliberate instead of autopilot domestic-drama writing. Interest naturally focuses on Eddie Izzard as Del. Parted from the drag that he frequently affects, the stand-up comic plays from his own persona: rueful, puzzled, inquisitively following a line of thought that results in a slap in the face. A fleshy young man in a sports jacket bearing a more than passing resemblance to a youthful Michael Grade, Izzard is remarkably assured in his first dramatic assignment, apart from an occasional anticipated cue that increases his air of naturalness. Danny Worters is a touchingly reproachful boy. If minimalism appeals to you, The Cryptogram may prove rich with hidden meanings, allusive, echoing. Or you may find it precious, pretentious and pompous and the hell with it. Ambassadors Theatre (071-836 6111)</p>

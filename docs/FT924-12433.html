			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Nomura to lose 50 jobs in London THE retreat from continental European equities, once seen as the next big money-spinner for securities houses, continued yesterday as Nomura closed down its London-based marketmaking activities in non-UK stocks. The move, which follows Baring Securities' decision last month to cut back its continental European business, came as Japan's largest securities house announced a cut of a third in its London-based equities staff to around 70. The total of 50 redundancies yesterday, which included several in investment banking, mark the first widespread cuts in London by a Japanese financial institution. They are likely to undermine the reputation for job security built up by Japanese houses - though the squeeze on broking houses following the fall in the Tokyo stock market made redundancies far more likely. Nomura began making markets in continental European equities only two years ago, and had been quoting prices in 65 stocks. Like other securities houses with large London operations, Nomura had seen a move into continental stocks as an antidote to the overcrowded UK equity market. However, against a background of rising costs and low turnover, many brokers have found the continental equity business to be an expensive one to maintain. The redundancies in UK equities yesterday mean that Nomura will no longer research a number of sectors of the UK stock market, including building, financials, insurance, chemicals and utilities. It remains a marketmaker in 130 UK stocks.</p>

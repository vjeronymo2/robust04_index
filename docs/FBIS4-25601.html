			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Song Ning: "State Awards Italtel $10.5m Telecom Deal"] </F>   [Text] A leading Italian telecommunication equipment  manufacturer was awarded a $10.5 million contract over the  weekend to supply telephone switching facilities to four Chinese  railway agencies.    Italtel will supply 100,000 lines of programme-controlled  telephone switching equipment to Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot and  Lanzhou railway bureaus. It is the first equipment supply  contract Italtel has won on the Chinese market.    The four cities are major railway hubs in China. Chinese  officials said the operation of the equipment, scheduled to  begin next year, will improve management and transport capacity  in Northeast and Northwest China.    The project was funded by a World Bank loan. Italtel  defeated other contenders because of its reasonable price,  Chinese officials said.    "We're proud of this contract," said Alberto Cnirieleison  [as  published], chief representative of Italtel in Beijing, "because  it signifies a new starting point for the co-operation between  Italtel and China."    The company's equipment is used in 18 countries, mostly in  Europe. But officials predicted it could get a sizable share of  the Chinese market relatively soon because the market here is  huge.    The untapped potential of China's telecommunications sector  was the focus of a conference held last week in Beijing as  foreign manufacturers fiercely compete to pry open the market.  Many of them have already started manufacturing in China, like  Canadian North Telecom and Siemens of Germany.    China is expected to spend $6 billion on telecommunications  equipment this year and up to $90 billion by the year 2000.    Italtel does have a short history of aiding the Chinese. It  agreed to transfer the technology of producing digital  transmission equipment to the Number 515 Factory in Chongqing,  Sichuan Province, in 1985. The products have now been sold  abroad.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Burnham Beeches declared a nature reserve BURNHAM BEECHES, an ancient wood in Buckinghamshire which borders Dorneywood, the traditional country home of the chancellor of the exchequer  -and has inspired composers and poets - has been declared a national nature reserve. As well as soothing the pre-Budget nerves of chancellors, the wood inspired parts of Mendelssohn's famous music for Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and also Thomas Gray's Elegy. Burnham Beeches is recorded in the Domesday Book. The woodland includes a 450-year-old pollarded beech tree. It is owned by the Corporation of London. The Corporation of London has reintroduced traditional management techniques during the past 10 years in an attempt to encourage rare flora and fauna. The woodland pasture is grazed by traditional breeds such as Berkshire pigs, British White cattle and Exmoor ponies. The corporation's work was praised by English Nature, the government's statutory adviser on nature conservation, which designated the wood a national reserve.</p>

At a joint press  conference after the meeting, both leaders stressed that it was  constructive and frank and voiced the hope that the first  official visit to Spain by the president of Kazakhstan and the  documents signed in Madrid will promote the development of ties  between the two states in a wide variety of spheres.    Replying to journalists' questions, Felipe Gonzalez noted  the  great potential for mutually beneficial cooperation with  Kazakhstan in political, economic, cultural, and other spheres  and also within the framework of international forums and  organizations.    Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke at the press conference about the  economic reforms being implemented in the republic, the  strengthening of democratic processes, and the activity of the  CIS. Because of the forthcoming official visit by the president  of Kazakhstan to Moscow, he had to answer many questions from  journalists regarding present and future relations with Russia.    Nursultan Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan has had common  bonds with the Russian people for over 200 years. Our policy is  aimed at ensuring the very best relations with our large  northern neighbor. We have a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation,  and Mutual Assistance that is the basis of stable relations  between two neighboring friendly states.    What is happening in Russia now, the president went on, is  happening throughout the CIS. So it is the desire of the  presidents of the countries of the Commonwealth for the  transition from one condition to another and the reforms being  implemented to be evolutionary and to prevent major interstate  or other conflicts. The main thing now is to tackle the economy.  Right from the start I have called for integration because I am  well aware how a single economy functioned in the state that was  the USSR, when some were suppliers of raw materials and others  were consumers. This market remains the main market for us  today.    The euphoria of the initial years after independence is  already passing. However, I said back in 1991 that sovereignty  alone would not fill stomachs. But everyone thought that they  would start selling their goods to the West. However the  Western market was already full and only we needed those goods.  So, the president said, Kazakhstan drew up the plan for the  economic union and it was adopted in September. Unfortunately,  the different approaches of different states is so far  preventing this plan from being implemented in practice.    If the economic union is to work, we will have to conclude a  monetary union and a customs union and coordinate foreign  economic policy at least on the export of raw materials, as well  as create a common parliament to bring our legislation into  line. In other words, we need to do what Western Europe has  been doing for 30 years. Bearing in mind our considerable  experience of living together, we could reach this more rapidly.    Like all of us, Russia is now experiencing a difficult time  in its history. The hopes of Kazakhstan and the hopes of the  West should be linked primarily with the continuation of the  process of democratization and socioeconomic reforms. All  Russia's neighbors will benefit from the continuation of this  path. I am confident, the president of Kazakhstan concluded,  that no one will succeed in turning back the common trend  towards progress.</p>

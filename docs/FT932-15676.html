			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES figures proves the lure of risk-free tax shelters - At a glance The BES binged last year on non-recourse loans, which made up a large part of Pounds 957m invested in the schemes. Figures, prepared by the Allenbridge, show just how much happier people are to shelter from tax if they do not have to take a risk. Before property investments were allowed, the most the scheme had ever raised in one tax year was Pounds 175m, in 1987-88. The amount raised by trading companies fell to Pounds 29m the next year, rose to Pounds 36m in 1989-90, and then fell to Pounds 10m. Meanwhile, the totals taken by the scheme have risen steadily as sponsors squeezed out still more risk. One of the scheme's starting aims was to foster the entrepreneurial spirit, and it seems to have failed. See BES: cause for anxiety, Page VI</p>

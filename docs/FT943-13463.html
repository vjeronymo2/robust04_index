			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (4): It's tough at the top - Industry is worried about its future To the rest of the world, Japan still seems an unstoppable economic leviathan which dominates many industrial markets, has a huge trade surplus  -especially with the protesting US - and cultivates a work ethic superior to that of most competing countries. But while its products remain successful and its people hard-working and disciplined, the picture is very different when seen from inside. Japan's high costs and strong currency, which last month forced the dollar below Y100, have put hurdles in the way of its continued industrial progress. Industrialists and economists talk constantly about the potential 'hollowing out' of Japanese industry as it opens more operations in lower-cost countries in North America, Europe and South-east Asia. Big companies are striving to make their employees more flexible and productive by restructuring operations to cut costs and increase efficiency without sacrificing lifetime employment and destroying loyalty and motivation. It is proving tough. After investing heavily to meet demand during the expanding 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s, many companies have too much capacity. 'After the bubble, corporations faced a huge cost burden as they had expanded too much,' says Haruo Shimada, economics professor at Keio University. They have cut down on recruiting, leaving a trail of disaffected graduates, and eased back sharply on pay. Many are also trying to move away from the tradition of pay by seniority rather than merit and ensure that able managers move faster up the ladder. Making workers redundant to cut costs is virtually unheard of in consensus-minded Japan. Not only is it culturally unacceptable, and legally awkward, but some companies fear they may be short of labour again once the economy picks up. Even so, workforces are being reduced as companies do not replace those who leave. 'Japanese management is facing a huge challenge,' says Mr Masaya Miyoshi, director general of the Keidanren, the Japanese business federation. 'The system needs overhauling.' Some companies are taking tough action within the constraints of the Japanese system. In cars and computers, Honda and Fujitsu are shaking up their management structures, looking at every aspect of their operations and trying to inject a more entrepreneurial spirit into them. 'It's not enough just to cut the workforce,' says Toru Katsurada, a director of Fujitsu, which made a loss in 1992 but is now back in profit. 'We need to review every business we are in.' The Nissan car company has even taken the bold step of closing its plant at Zama to concentrate output in newer facilities. But the closure is being spread over two years and the 2,000 production workers shifted to other sites; no-one is being laid off. Nissan's plan is to cut costs by Y200bn (Dollars 2bn) up to 1996, much of it by sharing more components between different models. Honda, Toyota and Mazda are also rationalising the way they build cars. About 50 per cent of the parts used in Honda's newest Accord family car are shared with the previous model or with others in the range; previously, it was only 10 per cent. This amounts to a big saving. But Honda is also trying to revitalise its management by moving aside people who do not progress fast enough and introducing performance-based pay. This is vital, says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, if it is to move with the times. 'We are trying to cope with the problem of the decline in Japan's competitiveness in world markets due to the high yen and political issues.' The latter mainly concern US attempts to persuade the Japanese industry to buy more parts there. As Mr Kawamoto points out, many of the steps being taken by companies like Honda go against the traditions built up in growth-conscious Japan after World War Two. Until the post-bubble recession, companies prized their keen and productive employees who in turn valued their lifetime connections with an employer who gave them a sense of belonging and security. But in these harsher times, companies need to become more flexible and their operations more transparent. 'The traditional Japanese system is now in direct conflict with the competitiveness-oriented system of the western world,' adds Mr Kawamoto. Younger Japanese are more in tune with western ways of living and working. So the actions of companies like Honda have to take their aspirations and abilities into account. Therefore,' says Mr Kawamoto, 'we have to survive through this period of harsh competition and yet maintain the good features of the Japanese tradition. We want to give the next generation something to hope for.' In the opinion of Mr Shintaro Hori, managing director of the Bain consultancy in Japan, this virtually means two companies in one. 'Honda needs a young, motivated, fast track, performance-oriented company and another more middle-aged, balanced, judgment-oriented company. If it can keep this balance, then it has a great advantage.' In the case of such globally-minded industries as cars and computers, this may work. Mr Matthew Ruddick, car analyst at stockbroker James Capel Pacific in Tokyo, believes the cost-cutting activities of the car companies will benefit profits considerably. 'There is good reason to be optimistic about the automotive industry.' Even if the market improves, though, there will still be a surplus of jobs and capacity. But reinvigorating Japanese industry as a whole, without destroying the social and cultural values which helped it become successful, is far more challenging. For one thing, much of the Japanese economy is highly regulated which keeps up costs and hinders competition; moves to change this are proceeding slowly. Also, notes Mr Shimada, 'we have a lot of inefficient sectors'. He reckons only a third of manufacturing industry is competitive in world terms, while large areas like construction, transport and distribution have high costs and low productivity. He adds, ominously: 'If companies and the government don't take drastic reforming action, we'll be pulled into a declining scenario year after year.' More operations will be carried out abroad and Japan's steadily rising standard of living and ability to create jobs will be threatened further. Not all see the future in such stark terms. But even the Keidanren's Mr Miyoshi believes the pessimists among Japanese industry are currently in the majority - 'by hunch, I would say 60 per cent pessimists and 40 per cent optimists. I'm right in the middle.'</p>

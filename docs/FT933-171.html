			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Real reason behind the 'miracle' in east Asia Sir, I was disappointed to read your coverage of the World Bank report, The East Asian Miracle ('State role in growth of east Asian economies questioned' and 'The Asian miracle that wasn't', September 27). It gave too much credibility to the sterile old 'was it the market/was it the state?' debate - and the Bank's (predictable) finding that it was the market, not state intervention, which explains east Asia's development. Anyone with a knowledge of east Asian industry knows that it is the ability, speed and dynamism of Asia's companies which explains the miracle. It is companies which export, earn foreign exchange, acquire technology, generate wealth and raise productivity - not governments, and not abstract markets. Without these companies' skilful, audacious and deliberate strategies (in many cases in co-operation with governments) the miracle could not have occurred. If one-tenth of the resources dedicated to the 'market vs state' debate were put into learning about the strategies of Asia's late-comers we would now have useful advice for Latin America, eastern Europe and our own companies which are trying to compete with Asia's new-comers.

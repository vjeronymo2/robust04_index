			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Women at Freemans win equal pay case FEMALE warehouse workers at Freemans, the mail order company, yesterday won an industrial tribunal case in an equal pay claim that has been running more than eight years. Since October 1984 aspects of the case have been heard at industrial tribunals, the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which is backing the women, said the case demonstrated the need for legislation on equal pay to be simplified. It has been calling for sex discrimination and equal pay laws to be replaced with a single equal treatment act and said this would 'stop women having to undergo such lengthy ordeals in order to get equal pay'. Mrs Rene Pickstone, who brought the action with four colleagues, worked at Freemans' Peterborough base where catalogues and goods are assembled and despatched. As 'warehouse operatives' they were claiming their work was of equal value to that of a male 'checker warehouse operative' who, in 1985, earned Pounds 5.85 more pay a week. The tribunal yesterday accepted an independent expert's view that the difference between the jobs was not 'one which in the real world can be regarded as a material difference'. Freemans said after the ruling it had worked closely with unions and had been conscientious in establishing 'true values for the many different employee grades'. The company might appeal against the tribunal decision.</p>

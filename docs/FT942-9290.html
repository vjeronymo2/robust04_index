			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Civil service union in cash crisis Britain's second-largest civil service union faces a financial crisis, with only three months to persuade three-quarters of its 111,800 members to renew their subscriptions. Only a quarter of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants' members have agreed to allow their employers to deduct union subscriptions from their wages under the check-off system. The union is already in serious financial difficulties - it is running a deficit and its latest financial report says: 'It is only the support of the Unity Trust Bank that is enabling the union to continue functioning.' The crisis also raises questions about plans to merge with the wealthy Inland Revenue Staff Federation. Under new employment legislation the union has until August to persuade members to renew their mandates for the check-off system. The union has budgeted for a 5 per cent membership loss from check-off, which would cost it Pounds 220,000 in subscription income. The union blames 'foot-dragging' by some managers over check-off campaigns. It has to deal with more than 200 salary centres and claims that some managers have been putting administrative obstacles in its way. Fewer than 1 per cent of members at the Department of Employment have signed up, 12 per cent at the environment department, and 16 per cent at defence. At the end of last year the union's overdraft was Pounds 503,109, and the deficit on its general fund Pounds 120,720. The report states: 'Clearly this position can no longer be sustained. Deficits can no longer continue since the union has no liquid assets.' The union has been in deficit every year since 1987. It overspent Pounds 4m over the period, transforming 'a very healthy liquid assets position to a point where our liquid assets do not even cover the overdraft'. The union spends a third (Pounds 3.35m) of its current expenditure on staff, but it says 'the potential for reducing staff members by natural wastage (is) extremely limited'. Moreover, it admits 'the union does not have readily available funds to underpin a redundancy programme - be it voluntary or compulsory'. A number of cost-saving proposals were passed at the union's annual conference last week but delegates refused to accept a shift of money from its political to the general fund and committed the union to more spending that wiped out proposed savings. Members of the NUCPS and the IRSF are due to be balloted in October on forming a joint union. According to their merger plan, both unions are 'financially viable in their own right'. It states: 'Neither union needs to merge on financial grounds.' It adds: 'The new union will organise its finances on a prudent and professional basis to get the maximum benefit from its income. A principal objective will be the avoidance of current account deficits'.</p>

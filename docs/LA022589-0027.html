			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> USC KEEPS NORTHRIDGE WINLESS IN CONFERENCE  </P> <P> John Price, Cal State Northridge's men's volleyball coach, said that it was a  case of "could have, should have and would have," Friday night against USC.  </P> <P> Northridge could have won, but it came up a little short every game as USC, the  defending national champion, swept to a 15-11, 15-13, 18-16 victory in a  Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match at Northridge.  </P> <P> USC, ranked fifth in the nation, improved to 13-5 overall and 5-3 in conference  play. Northridge, ranked 12th, dropped to 3-7 overall and 0-7 in the WIVA.  </P> <P> Friday night's loss follows last week's five-game defeats to UC Santa Barbara  and Stanford.  </P> <P> "We were good enough to win," Price said. "We've lost three close games to  three of the top-ranked teams in the country. I guess we are the world's best  0-7 team."  </P> <P> The Matadors should have won the first game against USC after bolting to a 7-0  lead. The Trojans, however, came back with nine consecutive points behind the  front-line play of Tom Duke, Bryan Ivie and Leon Devaney and captured the game.  </P> <P> Northridge would have won the second and third games had the Matadors found a  way to finish off the Trojans after tying them late in each game.  </P> <P> Northridge broke a 12-12 tie in the second game on a kill by Ron Graening. But  after a sideout, USC ran off three consecutive points on a Northridge hitting  error, a Northridge net violation and a kill by Trojan outside hitter Chris  Martz.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 16-16, in the third game, USC went ahead when a ball  deflected off the hands of Northridge's Andrew Greskovics. With Martz serving,  Devaney put away match point with a kill.  </P> <P> Outside hitter Bob Samuelson paced Northridge with 23 kills. Neil Coffman added  15 kills for the Matadors and setter Tom Ribarich had 25 assists.  </P> <P> Duke and Martz each registered 18 kills for USC and setter Dan Greenbaum had 68  assists.  </P> <P> Northridge continues its quest for its first WIVA victory tonight when it plays  host to UC Irvine.  </P> <P> The Matadors will visit UCLA next week.  </P></p>

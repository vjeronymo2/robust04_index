			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi plans weigh upon Italian banks SENIOR bourses remained active, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN turned its attention back to Ferruzzi. The troubled group posted losses for the first five months of the year which were more than double earlier estimates as the Comit index eased 1.54 to 588.77. Ferruzzi and Montedison were suspended ahead of a meeting of the Ferruzzi board, which said it was cutting its issued share capital to L205bn from L1,370bn and slashing the nominal value of its shares to L5 from L1,000. The Montedison board meets today. The group's creditor banks were marked lower. Mediobanca, which leads the group of seven banks preparing a rescue plan, lost L505 or 3 per cent to 16,319. Credito Italiano shed L90 to L2,645, BCI fell L227 to L5,150 and San Paolo declined L243 to L8,817. Fiat rose L99 to L7,009 in volume which picked up to almost 12.5m shares, as long-standing rumours resurfaced of an international sale or alliance. Among telecommunications issues, Italcable continued its climb, adding L423 to L9,569 in volume of 11.8m shares in response to the planned merger with Sip. FRANKFURT saw a sharp about-turn in financials, but there were some useful gains elsewhere as the DAX index eased 7.14 to 1,865.16. Turnover rose from DM7.5bn to DM8.9bn. Bundesbank repo market action was seen as an attempt to stabilise money market rates after their recent sharp declines. Allianz fell DM35 to DM2,384, Commerzbank by DM7.70 to DM322 and Deutsche Bank by DM8.90 to DM773; Dresdner, which produced better than expected half-year results, fell by DM9 to DM410.50. Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that, while buyers were more cautious, the DAX had three tries at breaking through the 1,880 level yesterday, balking at an intra-day high of 1,879.49. Good news included encouraging sales for Daimler's new Mercedes C range, but although the stock led the most actives list, it closed just DM1.50 higher at DM686. Auto-related stocks like MAN, DM14 better at DM326, and Varta, DM12.50 higher at DM320, produced the big gains in the sector, while Volkswagen fell again, by DM3.70 to DM367.50. PARIS was more resilient than its German neighbour although here, too, there was a suggestion that buyers were waiting for lower prices. In the end, some dealers felt that they could not wait and the CAC-40 index fashioned an afternoon recovery to close 1.26 higher at 2,139.78 after falling by nearly 15 points during the session. Turnover rose from FFr3.17bn to FFr3.44bn. Foreign interest remained, and Michelin seemed to benefit from an outperform rating from Lehman Brothers in New York as it rose another FFr2.10 to FFr193.50. As in Frankfurt, motor industry sentiment was mixed. Peugeot closed unchanged at FFr687 before after-hours news of an 11.6 per cent drop in first half sales. Elsewhere, Lafarge-Coppee fell FFr5.60 to FFr450.40 on profit-taking. ZURICH was dragged lower by futures related hedging, and renewed profit-taking in banks ahead of half-year figures which begin with UBS tomorrow. The SMI index fell 36.0 or 1.5 per cent to 2,384.5. Some Swiss brokers have forecast profits growth from the banks of 40-50 per cent but London analysts are more cautious. They are looking for rises in the 20 to 30 per cent range which, while healthy, would still prove a disappointment to some investors. UBS fell SFr29 to SFr1,181 and SBC was SFr13 lower at SFr458. AMSTERDAM continued its advance, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.7 to 124.60 amid widespread short-covering by professionals who had shorted cyclical stocks in the false expectation that they were about to fall from recent highs. Fokker, the aerospace group, added 50 cents at Fl 20.90 before announcing a first-half net loss after hours. Philips finished Fl 1 higher at a year' high of Fl 36.50, and its PolyGram affiliate rose Fl 1.90 to a 12-month high of Fl 61.40 after its better than expected half year figures and acquisition of Motown. MADRID's volume stayed thin, although it rose from Pta10.5bn to Pta12.6bn as the general index closed 0.71 higher at 271.63. Banesto rose Pta70 to Pta2,330 as it completed the second stage of a massive, three-tier funding operation. BRUSSELS saw more volatility in steels, Arbed erasing Monday's advance with a BFr260, or 6.1 per cent, fall to BFr4,015. The Bel-20 index eased 6.28 to 1,336.86. STOCKHOLM took profits after its recent rally and the Affarsvarlden index dipped 10.9 to 1247.1. SKF B shares slipped SKr4 to SKr112; the company is expected to lead a string of earnings reports with a sharply higher loss today. New highs came in DUBLIN and VIENNA, the former more spectacular as the ISEQ overall index closed 26.35, or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,745.39 with a 2.0 per cent gain in financials in further appreciation of Monday's AIB results. Austria's ATX index closed 4.67 higher at 1,009.70.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 10                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30        11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1267.94     1265.92     1265.69     1264.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1354.77     1353.84     1352.91     1352.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1262.22     1259.83     1260.85     1261.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1350.03     1349.45     1349.06     1348.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Aug 9     Aug 6     Aug 5     Aug 4     Aug 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1269.95   1272.34   1268.56   1268.09   1261.49 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1352.97   1348.44   1340.80   1339.61   1341.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1268.70; 200 - 1355.70 Low/day: 100 - 1259.33  200 - 1346.19.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: Simply Red - Wembley Arena You hardly ever come across a pop concert that is as near as dammit perfect. So many things can irritate - the star may have the personality of an insurance salesman; the band may be plugging an album reflecting a change in artistic direction; the venue may be awful and the audience repellent. But Simply Red are passing through their Golden Age, or perhaps their Platinum Period, given that their latest album Stars is out-selling Michael Jackson, Queen, the lot. Catch Simply Red on tour and restore your faith in pop music. My irrational dislike of Mick Hucknall, who fronts the band and controls it with the authority of a Spanish traffic cop, is an irrationality based on his political posturing; his use of other people's songs - 'Money's too tight to mention', 'If you don't know me by now' - for the band's hits; and a hair style best suited to Medusa. But all this melted within minutes. He really has a most bewitching voice, as strong as it is pure, as tingly in the higher reaches as it is funky in the lower. He has also written for Stars a batch of classic songs, which could have stepped out of a lost, late Beatles album, but updated with the soul strains of the 1970s. And, just to make the cup overflow, he wears a natty suit and a controlling hair band, at least for the first half, and his current love affair is with the European Community (he boasts the EC emblem as a tattoo) which makes his 'message', concentrated in the song 'Wonderland', so bland as to be acceptable. Simply Red, or rather Hucknall, delivers the perfect pop video live. There is a touch of gimmickry for old times sake - the inevitable slides of Mrs Thatcher; a restrained fountain of fireworks for the encore, the insidious 'Something's got me started' - but the overwhelming impact comes from the music. Hucknall is the boss but he has hand-picked a superb band which he allows plenty of rope. Gota, from Japan, is about the only drummer I remember actually watching in happy amazement, while Heitor TP from Brazil proves you can be a guitar giant and not be flash. Hucknall hardly speaks, but the music pours from him in a well-balanced flow, mainly slow songs in the first half then a non-stop boogie after the interval. Perhaps it lacks a bit of good honest sweat; perhaps it is a bit too carefully contrived, son-of-Fleetwood Mac music for the happy masses rather than meat for the discerning few, but anyone craving a fix of escapist pop should beg a ticket.</p>

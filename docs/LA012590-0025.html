			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FUMES FROM DRAIN FORCE 50 TO FLEE YMCA  BUILDING  </P> <P> About 50 people were evacuated from the Pomona Valley YMCA building Wednesday  after drain-cleaning chemicals mixed and filled the building with fumes.  </P> <P> Fourteen people required medical treatment and three were hospitalized,  including William Hampton, 54, the YMCA's executive director.  </P> <P> Pomona Fire Captain Ron Bozarth said YMCA workers had poured a drain cleaner  containing sulfuric acid down a clogged drinking fountain. When the drain  remained closed, he said, workers opened the drain pipe and sulfuric acid  spilled out. A reaction between the acid and solutions that had been poured  down the drain earlier also produced fumes.  </P> <P> Hampton and Luis Moran, 29, a maintenance worker, received burns and were  overcome by the fumes. They were hospitalized along with staff member Daisy  Mergerson, 36, who complained of throat discomfort. A spokeswoman at Pomona  Valley Hospital Medical Center said all three were in stable condition.  </P></p>

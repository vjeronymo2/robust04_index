			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / SA parliament to vote on transitional body today SOUTH AFRICA'S parliament is due to vote today on legislation to end exclusive white rule, against a background of mounting political violence including two massacres on Tuesday night which left at least 30 blacks dead. Parliament is expected to approve the Transitional Executive Council bill, which will set up a multi-racial advisory council to oversee the transition to democratic elections next April. MPs from the ultra-right Conservative party disrupted parliament yesterday, and several were suspended, but the party does not command sufficient votes to block the legislation unless MPs of the ruling National party rebel. Passage of the bill is the key to lifting remaining international economic sanctions against South Africa. Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, is expected to react to the bill's passage by calling for remaining non-military sanctions to be lifted when he addresses the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid in New York tomorrow. Mr Mandela, President FW de Klerk and other black and white leaders are launching a drive in the US to attract business and investment to South Africa. Passage of the bill will not immediately bring the Transitional Executive into existence, however: the bill will not be promulgated - and thus will have no force - until agreement has been reached on a new constitution, a process which could still take months. Tension remained high in the black townships of Thokoza and Katlehong, where most of those killed in recent violence have died. Roads were barricaded and officials of the Inkatha Freedom Party were attacked by residents after one of the massacres on Tuesday when gunman shooting at random on a nearby highway killed 18 people.</p>

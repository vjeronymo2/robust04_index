			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Saving the day for solar energy - The latest developments in sun power Why is one of the UK's most important research centres into solar energy located indoors? It's not a joke, especially not to Professor Brian Brinkworth, who is in charge of the laboratory at Cardiff University's mechanical engineering department. 'It's because you can simulate different conditions far more accurately,' he explains. Most people expect an answer blaming the British climate, saying you cannot generate solar power if the sun does not shine. However, such beliefs - allied with a damning report in 1980 by the Department of Energy which decided that solar energy was too uneconomic to merit government help - have put the solar power industry in the UK under a cloud for more than a decade. Now confidence is rising. A new report on the economic strengths of the technology is due out in the next few months from the government's advisory body, the Energy Technology Support Unit (Etsu) at Harwell. 'I think the government is prepared to look at solar energy in a much better light,' says Roy Swayne, director general of the 30-strong Solar Trade Association (STA), an industry body of makers and fitters of solar equipment. Business is booming among STA members: the first six months of last year produced twice as much work as 1990, continuing a rising trend during the past three years. 'After two hot summers and two mild winters, people are beginning to get interested again,' Swayne says. The STA bloomed before, in 1980 when it had more than 100 members. Business, measured in the number of square metres of solar panelling installed, attained a peak that year at roughly 21,000 square metres. Then came the government report, as well as the realisation among the public that some of those providing systems were cowboys. Business shrank - down to about 5,000 square metres in 1985. Installations in the UK are expected to exceed 10,000 square metres again this year. The key to this revival is the public's perception of the industry. In the 1970s and early 1980s those promoting solar energy offered it as a solution to high energy costs. Now the justifications are environmental: it is non-polluting and kind to rainforests. Solar energy systems can absorb any ambient solar radiation. 'There are hardly any days when you don't get any sunshine at all,' says Brinkworth. 'There is just a big seasonal variation. And nowhere on earth gets more than three times the solar radiation that we do here.' The systems fall into three categories: In 'active' systems an outside panel absorbs radiation, and heats up a storage medium - typically water. That is circulated by a pump. Used in hot water systems or central heating, active solar systems can save between 50 and 65 per cent of a home's annual energy costs. Roughly 45,000 are installed in the UK. A system with four square metres of solar panelling costs about Pounds 1,000. Passive systems are facets of building design, such as smaller windows and the use of double-glazed conservatories to create a private 'greenhouse effect'. Government estimates say that by 2025 widespread use of passive systems could shave Pounds 100m off the nation's fuel bill and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2m tonnes. Photovoltaic systems were originally developed for space-going satellites but are now familiarly earthbound on everything from watches to calculators. They typically contain silicon-based semiconductors, which generate electricity directly from light. They have no moving parts but high manufacturing and material costs make them roughly 10 times more expensive than coal or nuclear power. There are no manufacturers of photovoltaics in the UK, though BP Solar (a BP subsidiary) makes them in Spain and Australia. Most manufacturers are Japanese or American, with a few in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Industrially, the technology is regularly used to power remote sensors far from the electricity grid. Users include Thames Water, British Telecom and even the national grid itself. For all three forms, government support in research is vital, which is why the decisions of 1980 still rankle. 'They got it all wrong, says Swayne. 'They averaged everything, rather than looking at what the best results were.' In 1980 the Department of Energy classified alternative energies as suitable for medium- or long-term research funding. Passive solar heating was identified as a short-term solution, and therefore was not eligible for funding. Active solar systems meanwhile lost on economic grounds. 'They said it didn't compete with existing fuels,' says Swayne. 'That included nuclear. But they hadn't looked at the real long-term costs of nuclear power - of decommissioning.' Photovoltaics were dismissed as energy sources in the mid-1970s, and again in 1982: 'The Department decided it was not practical,' says Brinkworth. 'But the rest of the world didn't. The impression given by the report's conclusions at the time seriously set back the industry's own efforts and research. Work in other countries has progressed, but the UK has only just kept going.' Other countries have been more enthusiastic about solar power as a supplement to conventional energy sources. Japan has an operational 1MW photovoltaic power station. Germany gives tax allowances on solar systems, which has made it the biggest market in Europe. In the Netherlands, government grants of up to 60 per cent of the installation costs are available for photovoltaic systems. But in the UK, says Etsu, no incentives are provided. However, last November Colin Moynihan, the energy minister, announced a Pounds 150,000 feasibility project to investigate the potential for using large, amorphous silicon panels as cladding for buildings. The project will be carried out by BP Solar and will supplement its electricity supply. Although such panels are about 5 per cent less efficient than smaller systems, they have the advantage of size: they can be hundreds of metres square. Photovoltaics may have the brightest future of all the solar technologies. In a recent issue of Nature magazine, Brian O'Regan and Michael Gratzel announced a system which captures 46 per cent of available light and converts more than 80 per cent of that into electricity - giving overall efficiency of 37 per cent. The scientists say that is more efficient than photosynthesis in plants. It compares with present photovoltaic systems which are between 12 and 14 per cent efficient. The new system uses very thin films of titanium dioxide on glass, which can convert the longer light wavelengths in the infra-red. However, until that development reaches the market, solar power companies have to make do with what they have. Solar power enthusiasts also know they have not really crossed the divide from 'alternative' to practical until industry starts buying their products. 'There's a big market there, or should be, for energy savings through heat exchangers,' says Roy Blower, managing director of Filsol, a solar heating installer. The reason offered is that unlike domestic buyers, industry wants a very rapid payback. 'If it's longer than two years they put a big question mark against it,' Blower adds. The solar industry is also fighting to widen its typical buyer beyond the typical profile - middle-aged or retired, middle-class, with some money to spare, perhaps after children have left home. Young buyers are rare. As Swayne puts it: 'For young people, if the choice is between buying a new car or a solar energy system, they buy the new car every time.'</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COOK WELCOMES CHANCE TO START WITH SAINTS  </P> <P> This is one Cook who doesn't mind turning up the heat, both on himself and on  his team.  </P> <P> "This is my third season. I feel I should start. They need to have me on the  field," said Toi Cook, who starred at Montclair Prep and now plays for the New  Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> As a veteran vying to become the starting right cornerback, Cook knows that the  trick is to keep the heat on without getting burned.  </P> <P> "I can make the big plays. If I don't start, it's no one's fault but mine. I'm  going in as the starter; I intend to come out as the starter for the next four  or five years and hopefully mix in a few Pro Bowls," he said. "You give me a  chance to play, and in the end you'll be very happy."  </P> <P> After two years as a reserve, Cook is slated to start, but he might have  ruffled some feathers by moving back to his Westwood condo midway through  voluntary workouts this spring. The sultry Southern summer can get a little  slow for a guy used to the L. A. cool of the fast lane.  </P> <P> "Right now, I think they're mad at me," Cook said of the Saints' management. "I  love playing in New Orleans. I'm totally happy with playing there, but I'm not  from the South. I don't want to live there in the off-season."  </P> <P> In coming back to California, Cook returned to the site of his prep and college  exploits. A three-sport athlete at Montclair Prep, Cook was an All-Southern  Section selection three times in both football and baseball and helped his  basketball team to a Southern Section championship game.  </P> <P> Cook matriculated to Stanford after his Montclair Prep career and started in  baseball and football there. As a senior he helped Stanford to the Gator Bowl  in football and the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball championship.  </P> <P> Cook (5-foot-11, 188 pounds) has split his summer workouts between Southern  California and Stanford in preparation for the beginning of training camp July  21. While playing pickup basketball recently in Palo Alto, Cook was kneed in  the calf by former Stanford football teammate Garin Veris, who plays defensive  end for the Patriots, but he is otherwise healthy and eager to put on the pads.  </P> <P> "I get fired up just thinking about going to training camp," Cook said. "I'm a  big Raider fan, but I love playing for the Saints. We've got the Dome, great  fans, the black uniforms and a great defense."  </P> <P> After joining the Saints as an eighth-round draft choice in 1987, Cook has  steadily moved up the depth chart. He recorded his first interception last year  and played in every game. He was also one of 37 players the Saints protected  under the free agency system.  </P> <P> Having played mainly on special teams and gimmick defenses during his first two  seasons, Cook now figures he is finished with that nickle-and-dime stuff.  </P> <P> "Before, when I first came to college, I just wanted to play pro ball. Now  there are things I want, and to obtain them I need money," Cook said. "By the  time I'm 30 I definitely want to be worth a million, and it all hinges on my  ability to play the sport."  </P> <P> Cook began planning for his future even before he declared a communications  major at Stanford.  </P> <P> "I want to get into TV," he said. "I think what I want to do is take Ahmad  Rashad's route. I think I can broadcast two sports. From there, I want to go to  the movies.  </P> <P> "I want to have a Ronnie Lott career football-wise and an Ahmad Rashad career  broadcast-wise."  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Proudfoot shares fall further amid trading uncertainty SHARES IN Alexander Proudfoot, the management consultant, tumbled again yesterday in the face of continuing nervousness about its trading outlook. The shares lost 22p to 172p and have now fallen by more than 50 per cent since the annual meeting at the end of May. At the meeting, Proudfoot released a gloomier than expected trading statement. Invesco MIM, Proudfoot's former majority shareholder, also sold its remaining stake. Lord Stevens is chairman of Invesco and Proudfoot. However, the slide seemed to be halted by news yesterday that Proudfoot had bought back 100,000 shares in the market. Two directors also made small purchases. Yesterday's fall, as with that on Wednesday, was prompted by a large block of shares changing hands below market value - 600,000 sold at 150p - sending the price just below that level before it recovered. Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, has continued a series of meetings with institutional shareholders. Institutions are happy the company is financially sound, with net cash of more than Pounds 20m; but they are concerned that Proudfoot did not report earlier that trading was likely to deteriorate. 'The market is in the mood to let its imagination run riot,' one institutional shareholder said. He said the sudden departure earlier this week of chief executive Mr Thomas Huhn was not a cause for concern, but the timing had been unfortunate. Proudfoot has bought back nearly 2m shares since the annual meeting, leaving just over 61m in issue.</p>

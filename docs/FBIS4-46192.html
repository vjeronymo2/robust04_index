			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, May 19 (AFP) -- A small bomb exploded in a  Roman Catholic church on the western bank of the Bosphorus  Thursday, church officials said.    The blast in the Santa Maria Draperis church in the Beyoglu  district caused slight damage and no injuries, the officials  added.    In calls to Turkish newspapers, anonymous callers claimed  the  blast on behalf of the Islamic Front of Fighters of the Great  Orient, an armed underground Islamic group believed to have  staged several attacks against churches and banks.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Equipped with the tools of the trade - In A Nutshell While many small companies are spending freely on training, hard-pressed businessmen and women often feel they have neither the time nor money to train themselves. The Institute of Directors is attempting to fill the gap with a series of one-day workshops around the country, specially designed for owner-directors. 'The Business Toolkit' consists of courses on six topics ranging from finance and winning new business to leadership, team-building, and how to keep customers. Each workshop costs Pounds 110 plus VAT for IOD members and Pounds 125 for non-members. Contact the Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED. Tel: 071 839 1233</p>

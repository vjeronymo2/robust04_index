			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in  Spanish on page 16A of its 25 March edition carries a 300-word  item highlighting the results of a survey on people's views in  the wake of the 23 March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio,  presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI).    The item, published under the heading "Opinion Concerning  the  Attack," comprises four pie charts and four graphs that show the  results of the survey, which questioned an unidentified number  of Monterrey and Mexico City citizens on issues ranging from the  possibility of rescheduling the presidential elections to who  should replace Colosio on the PRI presidential ticket.    Most citizens polled in Monterrey and Mexico City believe  that the date for the scheduled 21 August elections should not  be changed and that there likely is a covert mastermind behind  the crime. Of the citizens polled in Mexico City, 54 percent  responded by saying the date of the elections should not be  changed, while 51 percent of Monterrey citizens opposed changing  the date of the elections. Of those polled in Mexico City, some  15 percent believe opposition parties are behind Colosio's  killing, followed by fellow PRI members (11 percent); Manuel  Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas (9 percent); the government (9 percent); Party of the  Democratic Revolution candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas (3 percent);  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (1 percent); drug  traffickers (1 percent); and foreigners (1 percent). Also, 39  percent of those polled in both Mexico City and Monterrey said  they believe the motive behind the killing was political.    Meanwhile, 20 percent of those polled in Mexico City said  the  killing will bring about more violence and will destabilize the  country. Regarding people's preferences to replace Colosio, 36  percent of those polled in Mexico City said they favor Manuel  Camacho Solis, who was followed by Pedro Aspe Armella (4  percent), Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon (6 percent), Fernando  Ortiz Arana (5 percent), Jaime Serra Puche (2 percent), Jorge  Carpizo (6 percent), and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios (2 percent).</p>

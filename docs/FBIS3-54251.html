In his address, 'Ali Kafi dealt with the current situation  in  the country and the national conference scheduled for next  Tuesday and Wednesday [25, 26 January]. Over to you, Mahfud.    [Mahfud] 'Ali Kafi said that the national conference was  nothing but the result of great efforts that have been made  since 1992 and thus the HCE had the duty to open the doors for a  meeting with all the parties in the dialogue in order to consult  in depth about the crisis, so that strong foundations can be  laid for the Algerian state.    'Ali Kafi added that the HCE was keen to preserve the  dialogue and its aims were to sum up the views of the parties in  the dialogue within a draft formula for the national platform,  which permits the achievement of a national consensus, i.e. the  evolving national proposal.    The HCE chairman and secretary general of the National  Organization of War Veterans did not hide the fact that some  parties engaged in one-upmanship and maneuvering during the  increasing events experienced by the country. He also wondered:  At the expense of whom is this behavior taking place?    He said that history would not have mercy on wavering people  and those who maneuver and sometimes conspire against the  Algerian nation. In this context, 'Ali Kafi called on parties  to go to the conference and on everyone to work to make it  successful by giving new hope to the Algerian people through a  serious dialogue and concessions by all parties and to stand as  one against whoever wants to destroy Algeria.    He said in particular:    [Begin Kafi recording] We say to all parties on the eve of  this conference: Enough messing about, let us all go to the  conference with everyone working to make it successful, to give  new hope to the people who are looking at us and suffering. We  must make this conference successful and we must give hope in  order to restore the trust between the citizen and his party,  and the citizen and his state, so that the political and social  life of this country can return to normal.

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Observer: Berlin game While Manchester was quaintly presenting assorted Irish guards and Gurkhas as the 'best of British' at Monte Carlo yesterday, Daimler-Benz boss, Edzard Reuter, who has masterminded the Berlin 2000 Olympics bid, again came up trumps. He wheeled in Steffi Graf and Franz Beckenbauer, and also made sure of a fleet of Mercedes limousines for the International Olympic Committee. Reuter has stayed at a very active epicentre of the roughly DM250m German campaign. In recent months, Daimler-Benz provided IOC members with lavish hospitality at the Stuttgart world athletic championships, while it chipped in a donation to the Olympic museum in Lausanne. Reuter obligingly whistled up the Berlin Philharmonic for the latter's opening ceremony. Reuter also boasts a close personal relationship with IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, once even defending the former Franco supporter as 'an upright democratic man'. 'Berlin is a strong contender,' Samaranch said recently, adding, perhaps superfluously, that as president he does not vote. But then nor did the Catalan vote when the Olympic Games went to his home town of Barcelona. Now that Reuter sees his own birthplace in the frame, how comforting for him to know that Samaranch understands his sentiments.</p>

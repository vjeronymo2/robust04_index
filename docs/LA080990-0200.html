			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR DEALS MARK O.C. AS HOT PROPERTY;  </P> <P> INVESTMENT: MANY OF THE LARGEST DEALS IN LAND AND OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE  SOUTHLAND HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN ORANGE COUNTY. JAPANESE FIRMS FIGURE  PROMINENTLY IN THE TRANSACTIONS.  </P> <P> When big real estate investors haul out their wallets in Southern California  these days, they're as likely to be buying property in Orange County as in Los  Angeles or San Diego.  </P> <P> Nine of the 25 biggest transactions in Southern California through 1989 and  into this year were in Orange County. Of the 10 largest deals in the region,  half were in Orange County, according to a survey by San Diego's Comps Inc. for  The Times.  </P> <P> In 1988, 11 of the 25 largest deals were in Orange County.  </P> <P> Half of the major pacts in Orange County in 1989 and early 1990 involved land  rather than buildings. But there were also some big sales of recently built  Orange County office towers as the once-suburban county rapidly urbanizes.  Those sales came despite bargain-basement office rents in Orange County -- and  throughout Southern California -- because of a glut of office space. In fact,  the weak market has scared off many U.S. institutional investors such as  pension funds, said Joseph A. Leon, a commercial real estate broker at Coldwell  Banker's Newport Beach office.  </P> <P> "The market's very soft," he said.  </P> <P> So the two biggest Orange County office deals were done by Japanese investors,  who have spread out from the big markets of Los Angeles and New York to  secondary markets including Orange County.  </P> <P> Those transactions include the third-largest in Southern California in the last  year and a half: The $82-million sale of Los Angeles-based Transamerica  Insurance Co.'s interest in two buildings at Koll Center Irvine Southwest near  John Wayne Airport to a group of Japanese companies calling themselves World  Trade Center Building. The deal, which closed in October, included the 11-story  Transamerica Building and the five-story Marine National Bank building,  totaling 345,000 square feet. Transamerica sold because it wanted out of the  anemic office market.  </P> <P> The Koll Co., the big Newport Beach developer that built the office towers in  partnership with Transamerica, retains an unspecified amount of ownership in  the buildings.  </P> <P> The fourth-largest deal in Southern California was the $80-million sale of The  Atrium in Irvine near John Wayne Airport, two 10-story towers linked by a glass  atrium. Although the buildings' 336,000 square feet were nearly all leased, the  rates were so low that the owners were said to be having a tough time making a  profit. The building was sold in late 1989 by local developers French &amp;  McKenna to Hyogo Real Estate USA Inc., a Japanese investment firm.  </P> <P> But the Japanese may not be able to maintain such a strong presence in the  local market, said Leon of Coldwell Banker. Interest rates are rising in Japan,  and many of the big players already hold well-stocked real estate portfolios.  </P> <P> Instead, Leon said, investors from other Pacific Rim nations may take up the  slack as some, including Taiwan and Korea, loosen foreign investment  restrictions.  </P> <P> Big apartment deals are slow ing, the Comps survey shows. Real estate brokers  say owners want unrealistically high prices given their inability to raise  rents much.  </P> <P> "Until recently, investors were paying these wild prices," said Julie M.  Hagberg of Apartment Properties, a Santa Ana investor and broker. "Now the  banks and the thrifts are a little more conservative and a little more  experienced, and you just can't get financing to buy most apartments."  </P> <P> And there were as many deals for large, expensive tracts of land around  Southern California as there were for office buildings, according to the  survey.  </P> <P> The two largest land transactions in the region in the last 1 1/2 years were in  Orange County: The $75-million purchase of 3,510 acres near San Clemente called  Talega Valley, and the $71-million purchase of 224 acres around the Los  Alamitos Race Course in Cypress.  </P> <P> In San Clemente, Florida developer Arvida Corp. plans to build 5,000 homes on  the land it bought from Talega Valley Partnership.  </P> <P> In Cypress, buyer Cypress Development Partnership plans to build offices and a  hotel, and to refurbish the race track and a nearby golf course on the property  it bought from Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc.  </P></p>

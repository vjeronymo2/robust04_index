			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A middle that will be crucial for three sides DAVYHULME Conservative majority 8,199 Labour requires 8.1% swing to win. 57% of voters are middle class, 17% managerial/professional MOST voters in the suburban Manchester constituency of Davyhulme think of themselves as middle class but, in terms of personal income, not quite the same middle class as that of London and south-east England. The perception is important and contributes to the absence of any evidence that the tax proposals of the three main parties will be a decisive issue on April 9. Davyhulme and the Stretford seat that preceded it has been held for 22 years by Mr Winston Churchill. To wipe out his 8,199 majority Labour needs a swing of 8.1 per cent. It is just about the last seat Labour needs to put Mr Kinnock into Downing Street with an overall majority. Locally the contest has yet to be fully joined. Mr Churchill was at his son's wedding at the weekend and Ms Jackie Pearcey, the Liberal Democrat, only had her adoption meeting on Friday evening. As elsewhere in the north-west, Labour and its Davyhulme candidate Mr Barry Brotherton appear to have made the fastest start. The constituency ranges from the affluent avenues of Sale through swathes of three-bedroomed semi-detacheds in Urmston and Flixton to the council and terraced housing of Partington and Carrington. Mr Churchill says differences between Labour and Conservative tax policies will be an important element in his campaign, Ms Pearcey is confident that the Liberal Democrats' plans for 1p on income tax to fund education is a winning policy, while Mr Brotherton, leader of the Trafford Labour group, says no-one has raised with him the issue of his party's tax plans. He thinks most of those who would have to pay more tax under Labour are Conservative voters. Mr John Smith's assurance that eight out of 10 taxpayers would be better off as a result of his Budget proposals appears broadly to have been unchallenged, and the majority of people in Davyhulme would identify themselves as part of that 80 per cent. A sales manager at a company in the Trafford Park industrial estate earning what he considers to be good salary of Pounds 19,000 said he worried less about Labour's plans than the depth of the recession and the threat of redundancy. 'I reckon it will hit people much harder down south,' he said. He and several others said they would vote Tory reluctantly because they could not contemplate the prospect of Mr Kinnock in Downing Street. Ms Pearcey, a radiological safety analyst with a PhD in applied nuclear physics, thinks it is the commitment of the Liberal Democrats to fund education through an increase in tax that will help her to push Labour into third place. 'There is absolutely no enthusiasm among dissatisfied Tories to vote Labour. It would be a big mistake to regard this seat as a Tory-Labour marginal.'</p>

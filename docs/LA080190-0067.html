			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING CENTER TO TAKE IN MUCH GREATER VOLUME  </P> <P> Ventura's recycling center will greatly expand operations today, two days after  the Ventura City Council approved agreements with a recycling company and the  city's two rubbish haulers.  </P> <P> The city-sponsored Gold Coast Recycling Center has been receiving between 20  and 25 tons per day from single-family residences since mid-June. Today, the  center will begin receiving an estimated 100 tons a day from businesses,  recycling coordinator Eric Werbalowsky said.  </P> <P> Last week, the center received permits from the California Integrated Waste  Management Board, allowing it to receive commercial loads.  </P> <P> Finance Director Terry Adelman, who oversees the city's recycling program, said  the state permits were necessary because up to 30% of commercial loads consist  of non-recyclable waste mixed with the recyclable materials. The permit allows  the city to handle the non-recyclable solid waste left over.  </P> <P> More than 98% of residential loads can be recycled and no state license is  needed for that program.  </P> <P> Apartments, condominiums and mobile homes will be added to the recycling  program in two to three weeks, Werbalowsky said.  </P> <P> The recycling program cleared its final hurdle Monday when the City Council  licensed the city's two rubbish companies to continue trash-hauling operations  and begin collecting commercial recyclables.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to approve six-month contracts with E.J. Harrison  &amp; Sons Inc. and Ventura Rubbish Service. The city normally hands out  one-year permits, but this year shorter-term agreements were granted on the  expectation of working out a five- to 10-year franchise contract with the  rubbish companies.  </P> <P> City officials said a franchise agreement would make it easier to map out a  city strategy for solid waste in the next decade. The city is under a state  mandate to reduce solid waste by 25% before 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Both rubbish companies are owned by the Harrison family, which has been  involved in the city's trash business for more than 30 years. The Gold Coast  Recycling Center is also partly owned by members of the Harrison family and its  president is Jim Harrison, the son of E.J. Harrison.  </P> <P> At a public hearing before the vote, about a dozen business owners praised the  Harrison companies for their services and asked the council to renew their  contracts.  </P> <P> But not everyone was happy with the council's decision. Morteza Yassani,  president of Rubbish Control Inc., said the council was denying him the chance  to compete with the Harrisons.  </P> <P> "It is my perception that the council is not for the best interest of the  consumer but for the best interest of the city hauler," he said. Rubbish  Control has tried unsuccessfully for years to operate in the city.  </P> <P> At the meeting, Yassani submitted the results of two surveys of businesses  affiliated with the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce showing that about 80%  of the respondents would like the Harrison companies to have a competitor. He  submitted letters from 13 businesses asking for competition.  </P> <P> But city officials and Jim Harrison countered that trash hauling should be  regarded as a utility instead of a competitive business.  </P> <P> More rubbish companies would add to the city's traffic congestion and cause the  city to lose control over its long-term trash-hauling and recycling policies,  they said.  </P> <P> "Now more than ever, rubbish collection should be regarded as a partnership  between the city and its franchise company," Harrison said.  </P> <P> City Manager John S. Baker added that Rubbish Control had not proven that the  city needs another garbage hauler. He said the city would evaluate the survey  results submitted at Monday's meeting.  </P> <P> City officials did not rule out that Rubbish Control or another trash company  could be included in the franchise agreement now in the works.  </P> <P> The council also voted to set aside a $500,000 recycling fund to help pay for  start-up costs until the program becomes profitable, which would require a  volume of between 125 and 250 tons per day -- depending on fluctuations in the  volatile market for recyclable materials.  </P> <P> Ventura officials are counting on the participation of neighboring cities to  meet its daily tonnage quota. So far, Oxnard and Camarillo have expressed  interest in using the Gold Coast Recycling Center, but no agreement has been  reached.  </P></p>

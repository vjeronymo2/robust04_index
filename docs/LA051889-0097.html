			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BLATANT DISCRIMINATION' AGAINST FISHERMEN  </P> <P> Your May 11 article about Channel Islands Harbor certainly sums up 10 years of  blatant discrimination against commercial fishermen. It also clearly shows a  flagrant dismissal and disregard for the California Coastal Commission permit  of 1982.  </P> <P> The statement that the commercial dock and related facilities haven't been  completed because of "unforeseen problems" is ludicrous and insulting to the  intelligence of the public.  </P> <P> The strict language used in the eligibility requirements to define commercial  fishermen for access to the commercial marina is a sham. These requirements  serve only one purpose -- to keep commercial fishermen out.  </P> <P> Even more shocking is the obvious chicanery of certain county officials who  have condoned this type of inexcusable delay. This has been a serious hindrance  to commercial fisherman, a financial detriment to them and other businesses  that would benefit from the enhancement of the fishing business in our area.  </P> <P> When county taxpayers get a hefty increase to cover the cost of the harbor  dredging because the county officials lost the federal funding due to their  predilection for recreational boating facilities, maybe then they will take  notice of the travesty that has taken place against the commercial fishermen of  Channel Islands Harbor.  </P> <P> JEFF R.

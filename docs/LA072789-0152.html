			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> POTATO SALADS;  </P> <P> THE ADDITION OF WINE VINEGARS, CRAB MEAT, APPLES, DILL WEED, CUMIN AND YOGURT  ENLIVEN A CLASSIC AMERICAN SUMMER SIDE DISH.  </P> <P> Why fuss with a good thing? To make it better, that's why, or just for a  change. These are the only reasons for tampering with an American classic such  as potato salad.  </P> <P> The following recipes employ such innovations as shrimp, yogurt, cumin seeds,  apples and brown sugar. They veer a long way from tradition, judging by a  recipe that appeared in the old "Household Searchlight Recipe Book." This book  was first published in Kansas in 1931. In that era, potato salad required only  potatoes, sweet cucumber pickles, onion, hard-cooked eggs and mayonnaise or  boiled dressing.  </P> <P> Such simple mixtures so pleased the American palate that, throughout the years,  annual potato salad consumption has risen to 286 million pounds. This figure  was issued by CPC International Inc., parent company of Best Foods, and was  based on data from a market research firm.  </P> <P> A prime candidate to increase the yearly consumption is the Country Potato  Salad prepared at Julienne, a bistro in San Marino. Susan Campoy, who owns this  restaurant and take-out business, combines unpeeled small red potatoes with  bacon, celery and green onions. The dressing consists of mayonnaise flavored  with bacon drippings, red wine vinegar, brown sugar and Dijon mustard.  </P> <P> Carola Drew of Los Angeles is from Berlin, and the recipe she uses originated  with her mother. That makes it genuinely German as opposed to American-style  German potato salad, which is served warm and includes bacon and vinegar. Drew  adds tart apples to the potatoes and enhances the tang with wine vinegar and  lemon juice. The salad is served chilled. "It's fine for picnics and  barbecues," she said.  </P> <P> Rosemary Burkholder's Dijon Potato Salad is a classic for the '80s, lending  itself to such variations as the addition of bacon, dill pickles, cornichons or  fresh dill. The unusual aspect is its track record. Burkholder, sous-chef at  the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort at Indian Wells, went to China in 1988 to  teach American cooking methods to Chinese food service personnel. This is one  of the recipes that went with her.  </P> <P> "Of course, mayonnaise was not available in China, so we had to make our own,"  said Burkholder. "The only disadvantage to this was that in China there is no  good-quality oil. We had to use rapeseed oil, which has a very strong flavor."  </P> <P> The addition of cumin, mustard seeds and yogurt indicates Indian influence. And  the salad that contains these ingredients was developed by actress Madhur  Jaffrey, well known for her Indian cookbooks and television cook show  appearances. The recipe title, The Best, Lightest Potato Salad, tells the  salad's virtues. The recipe appears in "Madhur Jaffrey's Cookbook: Easy  East/West Menus for Family and Friends," published by Harper &amp; Row.  </P> <P> In Hawaii, the accepted style of potato salad includes shrimp or crab meat,  peas and grated carrot. It's also typical to add macaroni. Mushrooms are  featured in a salad that was designed for a new, buttery tasting yellow potato  from Michigan called Huston's Yukon Gold. Dijon mustard and tarragon flavor the  dressing, and the salad is topped with chopped nuts.  </P> <P> Maureen Bevelaqua of Muttontown, N.Y., cuts the calories in her salad by using  low-fat yogurt and reduced-calorie mayonnaise. The recipe won first prize in a  potato salad contest sponsored by Best Foods mayonnaise and Woman's Day  magazine.  </P> <P> The final salad comes in an edible container, a tomato cup. It's another  calorie-conscious dish, employing low-fat cottage cheese instead of mayonnaise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JULIENNE'S COUNTRY POTATO SALAD  </P> <P> 4 pounds small (2-inch-long or less) red potatoes  </P> <P> 1 pound bacon, chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 3 stalks celery, chopped or diced  </P> <P> 2 to 3 bunches green onions, including tops, chopped  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Boil unpeeled potatoes.

Combine reserved drippings with mayonnaise, vinegar,  sugar and mustard.  </P> <P> To assemble salad, cut unpeeled potatoes in quarters and place in bowl. Add  bacon bits, celery and green onions.

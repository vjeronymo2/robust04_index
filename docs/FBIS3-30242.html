Lexa's Documents"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Ivan Lexa, head of the Government  Office, has informed TA SR that officers from the Slovak  Republic Police Force returned his travel documents to him  yesterday evening and told him that, after "reevaluating the  situation, there are no longer any reasons for holding on to  them." In view of the fact that my documents were seized--on  written authorization--a month ago on account of "the nature of  my criminal activity" and that the legal proceedings being taken  against me in accordance with Paragraph 103 of the Criminal Law  are continuing, I do not understand the current course of  action, said Lexa. At the same time, he described this  situation as a manifestation of the rash behavior and excessive  initiative coupled with a lack of professionalism displayed by  the law enforcement agencies a month ago.</p>

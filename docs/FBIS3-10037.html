Ryslash said  today.    Kiev maintains relations with 132 states and has 44  diplomatic missions, Ryslash pointed out when opening the first  Ukrainian Embassy in Latin America.    Present at the ceremony, among others, were: Ricardo Alarcon  de Quesada, president of the Cuban parliament; Lionel Soto, vice  president of the Council of State; and Isabel Allende Karam,  vice foreign minister.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon emphasized the  significance of the event as this is the first Ukrainian  diplomatic office in Latin America.    The Ukrainian flag was raised over a building located in the  Miramar area, in western Havana, while a memorandum of bilateral  cooperation in various fields was being signed at the same time.    The document, signed by the mayors of Havana and Kiev, Pedro  Chavez and Leonid G. Kosakivskiy, contributes to strengthening  the ties between the two important cities and calls for the  development of economic relations.    Kiev, with a population of some 3 million, wants to obtain  pharmaceuticals in exchange for food and other merchandise, said  city Deputy Mayor Aleksandr Taranenko, who thanked the Cuban  Government for the medical assistance given to the 12,000  children of his country affected by the nuclear accident at  Chernobyl.    The signed document represents one more step in the  improvement of ties between the two states, said Mayor  Kosakivskiy moments before attending a meeting with Sergio  Corrieri, president of the Cuban Friendship With the Peoples  Institute (ICAP).    The Ukrainian delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister  Ryslash  arrived in this city on Sunday and will return home next Friday.</p>

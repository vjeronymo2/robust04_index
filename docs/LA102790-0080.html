			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHILINGIRIAN QUARTET OPENS GUILD SEASON  </P> <P> On the occasion of its appearance on Wednesday to open the new season of Music  Guild concerts in the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, the Chilingirian String Quartet  faced up to one of the mightiest challenges in the repertory. Schubert's vast  Quartet in G, D. 887, is notorious locally for being programmed numerous times  in recent seasons and ultimately replaced by less taxing -- of performers and  listeners -- and familiar fare.  </P> <P> Schubert's technical demands here make even those of the late-Beethoven  quartets pale in comparison and it is structurally among the most intractable  works in the repertory as well. This rapturous monster remains, however, one of  the glories of Romantic chamber music, and the London-based ensemble --  violinists Levon Chilingirian and Mark Butler, violist Louise Williams, cellist  Philip De Groote -- played it with a thrilling blend of rugged intensity and  full-throated songfulness, boldly projecting its often grating harmonies even  at the occasional expense -- well-warranted -- of ensemble elegance. All this  in the face of nagging competition from the Ebell's new,all-too-audible  air-conditioning system.  </P> <P> With atmospheric problems successfully dealt with during intermission, musical  problems surfaced during the evening's second large work, the F-minor Piano  Quintet of Brahms, which the quartet will repeat in Laguna Beach tonight.  </P> <P> Given Gerald Robbins' self-effacing, unincisive pianism -- an exception being  his reasonably heated contribution to the Scherzo -- at an instrument that  seemed to be heard through several layers of cotton batting, Brahms was hardly  given his due.  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, too much burden was placed on the strings, whose  frequently strident, uncoordinated playing did not jibe with the secure,  rich-toned and handsomely nuanced execution displayed in the big Schubert  quartet and in the same composer's brief, potent C-minor "Quartettsatz," with  which the very long evening had begun.  </P> <P>  The Chilingirian String Quartet plays Brahms' F-minor Piano Quintet plus  Haydn's Quartet in D, Opus 71, No. 2 and Prokofiev's Quartet in F, Opus 92  tonight at 8 p.m. in the Laguna Beach High School Auditorium, 625 Park Ave.,  Laguna Beach. Tickets: $20. Presented by the Laguna Beach Chamber Music  Society. Information: (714) 494-2822.  </P> <P> </P></p>

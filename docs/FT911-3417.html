			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (2): Greens urge sales reduction - The Environment DRAW YOUR curtains at dusk. Use a toaster to make toast. Dust your lightbulbs frequently. They may sound like commonsense, but these household hints are a central plank - although some say a shaky one - of the UK government's environmental strategy for the electricity industry. They come from Yorkshire Electricity's recently published Code of Practice on the efficient use of electricity. Under the regulations of the new electricity industry, each regional electricity company must publish such a code, helping the public get more value from each unit of electricity. The industry rarely talks about using less electricity, environmental lobbyists such as Friends of the Earth point out. 'A reduction in electricity sales is needed to reduce the threat of global warming,' the group insisted in a document published in October last year. Electricity is, Friends of the Earth says, 'Britain's number one contributor' to both global warming and acid rain. Every unit of electricity (kWh) used, the group points out, means the emission of nearly 1kg of carbon dioxide (CO), one of the 'greenhouse' gases. The UK electricity industry is responsible for around 33 per cent of the CO released into the atmosphere every year. It is also a leading producer of the gases that cause acid rain - nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxides (SOx), annually releasing around 0.8m tonnes of NOx - 71 per cent of the UK total - and 2.6m tonnes of SOx - 29 per cent of the national total. There are two basic ways to deal with the problem - developing technology to generate electricity more cleanly and efficiently; and using less of it, or energy efficiency. Japan is often held up as a model - its energy ratio is 2.7 compared with the UK's 4.2, undeniably helped by the fact that energy is expensive. It also has a package of stringent regulations enforcing energy efficiency such as labelling for electrical appliances, setting building standards and giving incentives for energy saving measures. The UK government has begun to go the same way - although not far enough, its critics say. It will spend Pounds 26m this year on grants to help low income households use less energy, and will probably introduce a voluntary appliance labelling scheme next year. In addition, under the new electricity industry regulations, all users pay a levy on electricity generated from fossil fuels which then goes to fund more environmentally friendly methods of producing electricity. All the regional electricity companies, moreover, must take a certain percentage of their electricity from these 'renewable' sources, such as wind or wave power. The government's white paper on the environment sets a target of 1,000MW to be generated from renewables by the year 2000, and has further said they could provide 24 per cent of UK energy by 2025. But from the electricity industry's point of view, what really matters is finding ways to make fossil fuel production of electricity cleaner. The industry is under pressure - new UK legislation, under the auspices of the EC, will require power stations to cut SOx emissions to 60 per cent below 1980 levels by 2003, while NOx must be 30 per cent lower than in 1980 by 1998. And the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of stabilising CO at 1990 levels by 2005, with which the UK has conditionally complied. There are three main options for the industry. First, it can clean up after combustion of coal or oil, notably by fitting scrubbers known as 'flue gas desulphurisation' or FGD units to the power station chimneys, which clean the gas as it leaves. This is the route the UK has so far adopted - 8,000MW of FGD are being fitted at present. However, few people regard this as an adequate long-term solution: FGD does not deal with NOx and critics point out that 8,000MW is a negligible amount compared with continental FGD installations. The second option is to switch into another fuel. Natural gas is the frontrunner. It releases very little sulphur or nitrogen, and burnt efficiently in a new 'combined cycle gas turbine' station (CCGT) which recovers waste heat from combustion to drive a steam turbine, it is around 50 per cent efficient compared with 37 per cent at best for a conventional coal fired station. This means less CO is released per unit of electricity produced. Most of the new power stations due to come onstream in the mid-90s in Europe will be CCGT. The third option is to devise technology that burns coal more cleanly. In Europe and the US a new generation of coal-fired power stations is being developed. By the 1990s they will be up and running - and green enough, their creators say, to compete with gas. There are other variants: in the UK British Coal has masterminded a process  -known as 'the topping cycle' which combines partial gasification with the new combustion technology. These clean coal technologies can cut emissions of sulphur by up to 99 per cent, and nitrogen by between 80 and 90 per cent. By improving efficiency from 35 per cent to up to 46 per cent they also cut CO emissions. The UK has no plans for any clean coal plant. The government has invested around Pounds 20m in clean coal research, and is currently conducting a review of the area, which may result in further investment later this year. So far the money to fund a clean coal plant - a new technology that involves commercial risk so cannot win City backing - is just not there. Ultimately, however, it will only be built when the two electricity generators order it, and while gas continues to be cheap and available, they are very unlikely to do so. But environmentalists should take heart. A quiet revolution in industry's use of electricity is taking place. CHP or combined heat and power systems, which generate electricity and heat from a single source, are slowly catching on. These systems can be twice as efficient as conventional boilers and can cut CO emissions by 70 per cent. If CHP capacity reaches 30,000MW by 2020, as the government hopes, national CO emissions could fall by 15 per cent.</p>

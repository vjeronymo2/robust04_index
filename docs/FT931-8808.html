			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Bowater - Woodhouse takes over Bowater's acquisition of Specialty Coatings International has prompted chairman Norman Ireland to bring forward the announcement of his retirement after six years in the job. He will be succeeded by Michael Woodhouse, a director since 1989 and former deputy chairman of Courtaulds. Ireland had planned to announce the step with the company's preliminary results in March, having completed two three-year terms, but will now make way for the new chairman at the annual meeting in May. He remains a director of BTR, the industrial holding group of which he was formerly finance director. Woodhouse, 65, and David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, go back a long way. Woodhouse was Lyon's first boss when he was at Courtaulds between 1959 and 1970 and taught him much about industry. Lyon then went on via Rank Organisation and Redland to become the well-regarded chief executive of Bowater. Woodhouse, educated at Lancing College and Queen's College Oxford, is an industrialist, unlike Ireland who is a finance man, and has spent his whole career at Courtaulds. He started there in 1951, rose to become a director in 1976 and was deputy chairman from 1986 until his retirement in 1991. He has been a non-executive director of Bowater since 1988 and is also on the Prince's Trust for Volunteers. ***** Michael Steyaert, a 51-year-old Belgian, has been appointed managing director of GEC Avery, the weighing equipment subsidiary of the General Electric Company. He succeeds David Scahill, who has become md of GEC Meters. Steyaert has many years of experience managing GEC companies in mainland Europe. He will be responsible for combining the operations of Avery and Maatshappij van Berkel's Patent (Berkel) into the world's second largest integrated weighing and food processing equipment company. GEC bought a majority stake in the struggling Dutch company in 1990 and is now acquiring the remaining shares. Steyaert will remain Berkel's president.</p>

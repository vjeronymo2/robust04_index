			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners and losers in a falling market - A look at why some shares have been hit hard The cold downdraft felt by the stock market since the beginning of February has turned attention from recovery plays to the more defensive types of stock which traditionally do well in more difficult times. Mark Brown, equity strategist at Hoare Govett, says that when the market started to fall at the beginning of February, there was a classic rotation of sectors. Those which performed best in the previous 18-month recovery phase - such as banks and building stocks - were the first to fall in the shake-out. At NatWest Securities, Bob Semple says that examining the reasons for the market's fall - mainly, a fear that inflation was rising again and interest rates would be increased to control prices - explains the winners and losers among sectors and stocks. Bond markets were hit particularly by interest rate worries, so high-yielding equities such as utilities did badly. That, plus renewed concerns about regulation for many utilities, explains the poor showing in the league tables by companies like British Gas and British Telecom, as well as the water and electricity groups. Similarly, fears of rising interest rates have hit the building materials and construction areas, both cyclical sectors which did well when the market was rising. That explains the presence of stocks like Caradon, Anglian Group (which warned on profits in March) and George Wimpey. Conversely, sectors which are seen as benefiting from inflation - whether or not they do, in fact - have fallen less sharply. That includes consumer-related sectors such as food retailers and brewers and stocks such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Wm Morrison, and some stores groups. Warburg Securities suggests that food retailers, which have been experiencing margin pressure from the various price-cutting campaigns, could widen their margins again if inflation returns. Oil has been the best-performing sector since the market peak, but that has had more to do with a rising oil price, and the bid for Lasmo, than with the market. Similarly, other commodity prices have been rising, helping the extractive industries sector and RTZ, in particular. Banks and financials have been poor performers. Merchant banks were caught up in the market whirlpool: they make money from a high stock market through trading securities and acting in bids, rights issues and flotations. Thus, when the market falls, their shares fall. High in the poor performers' list are SG Warburg, Hambros and Kleinwort Benson, despite profit growth. Worst performers in the banking sector among FT-SE 100 stocks have been Standard Chartered and HSBC. Both were affected by the slide in the Hong Kong stock market, and the former by concerns that Lloyds Bank would sell its stake in Standard Chartered after its bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Life insurance groups are still under a cloud from the row over sales of personal pensions and possible compensation. Bids (or rumours of them) have been behind some of the strong individual stock performances. Lasmo and Hogg both received bids, while Portals nearly did. Meanwhile, companies with well-known problems such as London International Group and Eurotunnel have seen their shares near the top of the poor performers' list. Small companies have, in aggregate, outperformed large ones on the way down, with the 'small cap' index falling less steeply than the FT-SE 100. This often happens as fund managers, looking to reduce their exposure to equities and raise cash, pick the most tradeable stocks where they can deal more easily.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SECTOR PERFORMANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            % change                           % change                     2/2/94 - 1/6/94                    2/2/94 - 1/6/94  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil, Integrated                -1.5   Mid 250 ex Inv Trusts      -14.7 Mineral Extraction             -2.9   Mid 250                    -14.8 Chemicals                      -3.7   Food Manufacturers         -14.9 Oil Exploration &amp; Prod         -4.6   Consumer Goods             -15.3 Printing, Paper &amp; Pckg         -7.5   Support Services           -15.5 Retailers, Food                -7.7   Distributors               -15.7 Extractive Industries          -8.1   All Share Index            -15.8 SmallCap ex Inv Trusts         -9.5   350 Index                  -16.3 Engineering                    -9.8   100 Index                  -16.7 Breweries                      -9.9   Pharmaceuticals            -17.3 SmallCap                      -10.1   Transport                  -18.7 Engineering, Vehicles         -11.0   Property                   -18.7 Other Servs &amp; Business        -11.3   Other Financial            -19.9 Spirits, Wines &amp; Ciders       -11.4   Water                      -19.9 Media                         -11.6   Building &amp; Construction    -21.0 Diversified Industrials       -12.1   Building Matls &amp; Merchs    -21.1 Retailers, General            -12.2   Electricity                -21.4 General Manufacturers         -12.4   Utilities                  -22.7 Electronic &amp; Electrical Eq.   -12.4   Tobacco                    -22.8 Health Care                   -12.6   Telecommunications         -23.1 Leisure &amp; Hotels              -12.7   Financials                 -24.6 Services                      -12.9   Life Assurance             -24.7 Non-Financial                 -14.0   Insurance                  -25.1 Household Goods               -14.2   Merchant Banks             -25.9 Investment Trusts             -14.4   Banks                      -25.9 Textiles &amp; Apparel            -14.7   Gas Distribution           -26.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FTSE 100: WINNERS AND LOSERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------                         WINNERS                             LOSERS       % change, 2/2/94 - 1/6/94          % change, 2/2/94 - 1/6/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------- British Petroleum          +0.7    Std.

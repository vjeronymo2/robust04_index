			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Yet another State Duma member  announced on Wednesday he is quitting the faction of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Vladimir  Novikov followed suit of Vladimir Borzyuk protesting against the  "populist policy" of Zhirinovskiy. However, deputy chairman of  the party Aleksandr Vengerovskiy played down the event saying  there is nothing dramatic about it.    "There were a lot of fellow-travellers among LDPR members",  he told TASS. "The LPDR was, is and will be the decisive  political factor in Russia" in the coming two years and even  longer, he added.    "Some party members used to scare us that a coup would take  place at the LDPR congress and that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would  quit the party. But this did not happen", Vengerovskiy said  adding that people are "free to unite in any groups".</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Clinton to go to Moscow for summit US president Bill Clinton will travel to Moscow for a summit meeting with president Boris Yeltsin in mid-January, it was announced yesterday. Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, on a visit to Moscow, said the summit would take place after the Nato summit meeting in Brussels scheduled for January 10 and 11, with a tour of eastern Europe by the US president squeezed in between. Mr Yeltsin was said to have supported a US plan to expand Nato to include former Warsaw Pact countries. The plan, which will be discussed by Nato foreign ministers next month, calls for former east bloc countries to start with joint military exercises and eventually help with peace-keeping missions. Mr Yeltsin characterised these proposals as positive and as deserving support in principle. It is not clear whether Russia will need pressing to join Nato itself. Mr Christopher said he was reassured by the Russian foreign minister Mr Andrei Kozyrev on fair media coverage in the run-up to parliamentary elections on December 12. But later Mr Kozyrev refused to even answer a question on censorship from a correspondent of Pravda newspaper, suspended by Mr Yeltsin earlier this month. Mr Christopher said he hoped Congress would lift trade restrictions against Russia by the end of the year. President Yeltsin moved yesterday to assert Kremlin authority over Russia's provinces by changing a draft constitution and ordering new local elections, Reuter reports from Moscow. A presidential decree said elections to new-style local parliaments in Moscow, St Petersburg and more than 60 regions would be held between December 1993 and March 1994. But Russia's 20 ethnic republics suffered a serious blow when the Constitutional assembly drafting a new basic law struck references to their sovereignty from a new draft.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESS OF STRIKE BY L.A. TEACHERS FELT ACROSS U.S.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles teachers strike is over, but the ripples from it are being felt  across the country.  </P> <P> A plan for power-sharing between teachers and administrators and a pay increase  that will bring top salaries to nearly $54,000 by next year have elicited keen  interest among educators as far away as Vermont.  </P> <P> In districts closer to home, teachers' union leaders are using Los Angeles as  an example to encourage members to hold firm to their collective-bargaining  demands.  </P> <P> "The (reaction) is beginning to astound me," said United Teachers-Los Angeles  President Wayne Johnson, who has received dozens of telegrams and telephone  calls from teachers' groups seeking tactical advice and information on the  power-sharing proposal. "We may have raised the expectations of other  districts."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nine-Day Strike  </P> <P> The 22,000-member Los Angeles teachers' union went on strike for nine days in  May, virtually shutting down education on most of the Los Angeles Unified  School District's 600 campuses. The new agreement, the final wording of which  is still being negotiated, calls for a three-year, 24% pay raise retroactive to  June, 1988, and the creation of school decision-making councils, of which half  the members will be teachers. In addition, the contract contains provisions to  eliminate yard duty for elementary school teachers and give elementary  instructors 40 minutes of paid preparation time a day.  </P> <P> Although some smaller districts already offer better teacher salaries than Los  Angeles, and a few -- notably Florida's Dade County Public Schools -- are years  ahead in experimenting with power-sharing, analysts say that what happens in  Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, merits attention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Receive Attention  </P> <P> "Anything done in Los Angeles . . . will automatically get attention  nationwide, not only because Los Angeles is so large but because it is so  troubled and the challenge is so great," said Adam Urbanski, the president of  the Rochester, N.Y., teachers' association, who is widely respected for his  role in crafting a landmark contract that boosted salaries for some teachers to  $70,000 a year.  </P> <P> In particular, he added, "everyone will be watching very carefully to see if  shared governance can work in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> "The assumed understanding is, if it can work in Los Angeles, it can work  anywhere," Urbanski said.  </P> <P> In terms of pay, Los Angeles has the highest teacher salaries among the state's  big-city districts, including San Francisco and Oakland, and ranks in the top  5% of districts nationally, according to James Guthrie, a UC Berkeley education  professor.  </P> <P> Guthrie said he is not surprised that some school superintendents and board  members are worried that the Los Angeles salaries will lead to unrealistic  demands from teachers in their districts.  </P> <P> "It will lead to what many people see as very high salaries," he said.  </P> <P> Statewide, the average salary increase won in collective bargaining by teachers  this year was about 5%, according to the California Teachers Assn. The Los  Angeles agreement calls for an 8% retroactive raise in the current school year  and 8% in 1989-90 and in 1990-91.  </P> <P> Eighteen of the state's more than 1,000 school districts are still deadlocked  in negotiations, mainly over monetary issues. Ray Tolcacher, president of the  Assn. of California School Administrators, said the Los Angeles strike has made  bargaining over salaries more difficult in those districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bulletin Issued  </P> <P> For example, in San Jose, which has been mired in contract talks for more than  a year, the teachers' union last week issued a bulletin to its members  trumpeting "The Los Angeles (UTLA) Success Story." It gave details of the  salary increase won in Los Angeles and urged San Jose union members to prepare  for their own strike. The union is asking for a 7% raise, and the district has  offered 4.3%.  </P> <P> "As a result of what happened down south," said San Jose Teachers' Assn.  President Roger Evans, "we realized maybe the district does have money. And we  realized that our proposal is an extremely modest proposal. Our members paid  very close attention to what happened in Los Angeles, and they are holding  firm."  </P> <P> San Jose Schools Supt. Hilda Beck said the Los Angeles strike has had "a very  detrimental effect, not only here but throughout the state."  </P> <P> "All of the information put out by the (San Jose teachers') union says if L.A.  can do it, we can do it. It just makes the situation more difficult to handle,"  she said.  </P> <P> Some education analysts say the call for decision-making councils in every  district school is the most impressive aspect of the Los Angeles contract and a  major breakthrough for a district that generally had been perceived as another  big-city school system applying conventional solutions to huge problems of  student dropouts, campus crime and disillusioned teachers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Time  </P> <P> "This part of the negotiations will be followed by teachers in the rest of the  country for the rest of the century," said Jewell Gould, research director of  the American Federation of Teachers in Washington. "This marks the first time  there has been a real strong resolution in a contract of parental and teacher  involvement in school decision-making committees. We're going to see things out  of L.A. that will help the rest of the nation and help solve problems in places  like Chicago and Detroit."  </P> <P> Teacher unions in other large urban districts, such as New York, Chicago and  Miami, have contractual agreements with their districts for power-sharing with  administrators, but Gould said the Los Angeles plan is potentially more  sweeping. It calls for establishing the councils at all district schools,  instead of in a small pilot group, and principals will not have veto power.  </P> <P> District and union negotiators were hoping to finish fine-tuning the wording of  the contract provisions on the power-sharing councils by today. So far, both  sides have agreed on several key points that give the new councils broader  powers than other school committees have had.  </P> <P> Most existing school committees, such as the bilingual education councils on  many campuses, act in an advisory role only. Currently, the only committee with  decision-making authority is the "school site council," which operates on about  half of the district's campuses and has the power to decide how to spend  special state money alloted for school improvement projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Union Members  </P> <P> The new councils will have authority over decisions affecting student  discipline, some budget matters, scheduling and access to certain equipment,  such as photocopying machines. All teachers, regardless of whether they are  union members, will be eligible to vote and serve on the councils, and  decisions will be made by majority vote. Half the members must be teachers,  while parents, community members and staff, including the principal, will  occupy the remaining seats.  </P> <P> Although control over the photocopying machine may strike some as a trivial  concern, teachers say it represents an important symbol of their lack of  authority to exert influence over the most basic aspects of their jobs. With  shortages of books and other lesson materials, teachers say the machines are  crucial but are often broken and their use restricted by some administrators.  </P> <P> "It is symbolic of the intensity of the problem," UC Berkeley's Guthrie said.  </P></p>

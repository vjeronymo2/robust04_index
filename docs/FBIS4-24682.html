That  moment marked the conclusion of three years and 10 months of  valiant struggle to open the whole railway line to traffic, and  the conclusion of Inner Mongolia's history of having no local  railway line within its hinterland. This railway line is 943  kilometers in length, and total investment in this railway line  is 1.8 billion yuan.    The Jining-Tongliao railway line was built with investment  cooperatively offered by the autonomous regional people's  government and the Ministry of Railways. It is the longest  local railway line in China. Construction on this railway line  was completed in four years, this May, one year ahead of  schedule.    Song Zhimin, vice chairman of the regional government,  chaired the ceremony to celebrate the connection of the last  track in Linxi. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party  committee; Zhang Yongfu, vice minister at the Ministry of  Railways; Chen Puru, honorary president of the national local  railways association; Li Xiangyi, general manager of the Inner  Mongolia local railway company; and representatives of road  construction model workers cut the ribbons for the track  connecting ceremony. Shen Shuji, vice chairman of the regional  government, made a speech at the ceremony. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Siren song and lost treasure - The Proms, museums and the treasury JOHN DRUMMOND, controller of BBC Radio 3, could sell music to the Sirens and his launch of the Proms programme is always a tour de force. You had somehow forgotten your longing to hear the USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir sing Rakhmaninov's Vespers in Russian until Drummond tells you he has dreamed of the moment since childhood. As the man with the biggest budget - Pounds 40m - in British music, Drummond can bag the names, and this year's Proms offering of 67 concerts in 58 days has the usual plums - the first Prom visit by the Berlin Philharmonic, the European premier of Tippett's Byzantium, the English revival after 65 years of Dvorak's The Spectre's Bride. There are also curiosities, notably 89 year harpist Sidonie Goossens, the only survivor of Adrian Boult's original BBC Symphony Orchestra of 1930, playing 'The Last Rose of Summer' on the Last Night. For a Pounds 95 season ticket you can hear everything as a Promenader. Over half the 200 works on offer will have been composed this century and there are five new commissions. There should have been six but once again Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen's Music, has failed to deliver. This time he has actually written the piece, but he now sees it as part of a larger work and neither composer, soloist James Galway, nor Drummond think it should be performed out of context. The Gulf War was not an unqualified success - it messed up the Acceptance-in-Lieu scheme under which tax can be paid in works of art rather than hard cash. The Treasury has always hated the idea: it raises the spectre of the American practice where the rich can pay off their tax bills by giving pictures, etc, to museums (sometimes at fanciful valuations), and the Revenue has managed to keep the money it 'lost' to AIL to a theoretical Pounds 12m a year. But in the financial year just ended only Pounds 1.25m was written off against tax compared with Pounds 11.5m in 1989-90. The Treasury's excuse is that the exceptional and unknown costs of the Gulf War forced it to freeze all special provisions, including Acceptance-in-Lieu. So the major deal planned last December, a Sevres service and an 18th century French wardrobe sold to pay off another Pounds 2m of the tax due on the Pounds 90m estate of the late Dolly Rothschild, was suspended until April and will be in the 1991-92 figures. It is surprising that more use is not made of AIL, especially now that prices for British works of art have collapsed at auction. During the 1980s it was easy for Sotheby's and Christie's to convince executors and heirs that rich foreigners would pay a higher price in the saleroom than the Treasury, or any British museum, could muster through AIL or private treaty sale. Even when it turned out that the Chester Beatty estate got a smaller return, after tax, by selling Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' for Pounds 24.2m at Christie's than it would have received from a museum deal at less than half that price; even when major pictures last year, like Constable's 'The Lock' or Benjamin West's 'General Monckton', either failed to meet their estimate at auction or to find a buyer at all, the excitement of a public sale seemed to mesmerise vendors. Apart from auction room hype the other main reason why the AIL provisions are not more widely used is that with a top tax rate of just 40 per cent and schemes to protect inheritances from the Inland Revenue, the very rich are so much richer these days. There is less need for them to sell. But greed will sometimes out and the queue of national treasures waiting in the warehouse for export shows no signs of lessening. The campaign by the Fitzwilliam at Cambridge to keep the Badminton cabinet seems a sadly lost cause. But Nick Serota at the Tate might still find a rich friend to cough up the Pounds 10m needed to save 'The Lock', to grace his forthcoming Constable show, and if York launches an appeal to raise Pounds 2m to retain the Middleham Jewel the National Heritage Fund will rally round with some cash. 'The Three Graces' is in total limbo. The export stop still holds but the owner, widely believed to be a Trust controlled by the Tavistock family, is insisting, without success, that the putative buyers, the Barclay twins, pay the interest it has lost on the Pounds 8m sculpture while the attempts to save it have meandered on. With museum purchasing grants frozen for the last six years the NHF, with its annual grant of Pounds 12m, has become the last chance for diverting works of art away from the docks and into the safety of national institutions. But as Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, pointed out this week, the reliance on the NHF is starting to create a one sided view of art. The Fund, quite rightly, only aims to safeguard British treasures, or foreign masterpieces which have traditionally been admired by British collectors. If extra purchasing money was given directly to museums and galleries the National Gallery and the Tate would be spending it on acquiring foreign works, like 19th century Italian and German art, and 20th century Russian. By channelling all the safeguarding money into a heritage fund a traditionalist and insular tradition is maintained and the wider currents of world art lost to sight. A couple of Thatcherite councillors in Ealing are going to wreck the cultural heritage of the capital. That is the not totally fanciful story being pedalled by the administrators of a hundred London arts organisations who see the Pounds 3m a year they get from the London Boroughs Grants Scheme reduced to, at the best, Pounds 2m, at the worst nothing, because of the spoiling tactics of the Tories. The sums may be tiny, less than Pounds 5,000 in some cases, but the failure of the 1991-92 cheques to arrive has already forced over 50 job losses. Even the bigger organisations are affected. The King's Head has cancelled all in-house productions and the Bush is cutting 40 per cent of its planned productions. Hampstead will go dark for two months in 1992. Eight organisations, mainly ethnic dance and theatre companies, face immediate closure. The best move for the arts companies is not to pretend that London will come to a halt without them but to make the financial case for survival. This is the approach of the King's Head which points out that 41 per cent of the shows in the West End, a magnet for the Pounds 2b spent annually on arts related tourism in the UK, originated from the subsidised sector, and that the Government received ten times as much from VAT on King's Head productions, and transfers, than it indirectly gives in its LBGS grant of Pounds 34,000.</p>

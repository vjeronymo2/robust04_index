			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / People: Seeking a secure future in Japan - Robert Thomson explains why Yoshihiko Miyauchi is embarking on a sales tour Over the next few days, Yoshihiko Miyauchi will be encouraging international investors to sit back, relax and let thoughts of sell orders drift from their mind. Miyauchi will be visiting the UK and US to deliver a sales spiel to investors in his role as president of Orix, the Japanese leasing and financial services company. But the timing means that he will be speaking for more than just his company. The message he brings from the Tokyo stock market will not be comforting. The market has swung alarmingly in the past two weeks with the government under mounting pressure to deliver another stimulus to the ailing economy and to prop up stock prices. As Miyauchi puts it: 'Maybe we will be peeping at hell next year. The government must intervene to encourage more transactions. It has happened in Europe and the US, but in this country it takes a longer time to get a consensus.' Miyauchi moves easily between the worlds of politics and finance. He apparently has a good friendship with prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He also carries influence within the Ministry of Finance, which is often unsympathetic to the so-called non-banks such as Orix. Miyauchi, 58, is linked with Hosokawa in Japanese minds because he is one of the relatively young executives who did not endure the slow climb through the corporate hierarchy, which would only have allowed him four years at the top at an advanced age. He has been president since 1980. His success has entitled him to a long reign. Orix reflects its president's unconventional character. Large Japanese companies are cossetted by cosy cross-shareholdings with other groups. Only a tiny proportion of their shares are owned by foreigners. By contrast, 27 per cent of Orix is held outside Japan, prompting Miyauchi's taking to the road to soothe frayed nerves. 'Foreign shareholders sometimes do not buy the company itself; they buy countries together with companies. They don't always look at the bottom line. If they lose confidence in Japan, they tend to sell regardless of the company. That is happening now,' says Miyauchi, who uses his hands for emphasis more than do most Japanese executives. These are difficult times for Japanese financial companies, and Miyauchi will choose his words carefully while on tour. Four years after the peak in Japanese stock prices, the market is still vulnerable to sudden falls which can reverse months of gradual gains. The latest dive came with the realisation that the banking system was still creaking under the weight of bad loans, made during the bubble era of the late 1980s. That has left Japan's mainstream banks under a cloud but there are deeper fears about non-banks, as financial companies such as Miyauchi's Orix are known. Miyauchi presides over an extended Orix family of companies. The names of subsidiaries stretch over five pages in the annual report. At the core is equipment leasing and consumer finance, then there is aircraft leasing, a securities house, the Orix Collection of fine art, a professional baseball team (the Orix Blue Wave), a car rental company, and a joint venture consumer finance company in Shanghai, which will give Chinese shoppers their first credit rating. 'We have very tight control over group companies. We know what has been happening, especially in the real estate divisions. I am watching the problem loans day-to-day and the problem ventures,' Miyauchi says. 'We have one or two problems in golf courses and resorts. We have already done our best and things are moving forward. They will not be profitable but they will be viable.' He says Orix was the first financial company to tackle non-performing loans, three years ago, though the group's allowance for loan losses fell 3.7 per cent over the year to September, when Japanese banks sharply increased their loan loss provisions. Measuring the Orix exposure is not easy. But it was not exempted from some of the more exotic transactions of the bubble years of the stock market. One member of the family, Orix Alpha, was a lender to Nui Onoue, the infamous woman from Osaka, who used seances for investment advice and presented forged deposit receipts as collateral. The cause of the financial system's lingering ailments is not eccentric stock speculators, but the aggressive lending to the property industry, made painful by a fall in land values and the draining of liquidity from the market. Miyauchi believes demand for residential property could recover but he believes the commercial market is a 'disaster'. The worst is yet to come, he warns. Confident enough to handle an interview in English, he received an MBA from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1960. His interests appear to have become as diverse as his company, which he joined in 1964 on its formation. He bemoans Japanese financial companies' inability to follow the lead of its manufacturing companies, such as Sony, which have a track record for innovating world class products. He says: 'The Japanese economy has become a world power by the power of manufacturing. If you look at the financial sectors, we have a huge amount of funds available, but we have not created any financial service transactions which can be used in other parts of the world. We try to import everything and in many cases the government tries to stop it.' Well connected Miyauchi may be, but Japanese and foreign financial companies struggle to get approval from a conservative finance ministry for new products. After several years of negotiation, Orix became the first non-bank in July to issue commercial paper, giving non-banks more flexibility in raising finance when Japanese banks are wary of fresh lending. Miyauchi's flexibility is rare in Japanese financial circles. But that does not mean he lacks other more traditional Japanese business characteristics, such as patience, which has been one of the hallmarks of its approach to China. The company formed the first joint venture leasing company in Beijing in 1981, and the Shanghai consumer finance deal came after Orix had cultivated contacts for more than a decade. 'China is very, very difficult. It changes very quickly. I ask myself whether it is taking off,' he says. 'People are eager to have a better life. Now they would like more money. That is a big incentive for anyone to become a more economically-aware human being.' Dealing with foreign fund managers should be easier than convincing Chinese cadres to have faith in Orix.

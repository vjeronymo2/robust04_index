			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F> with domestic reporters and unidentified moderator at the  Presidency in San Salvador -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, there has  been some speculation lately as to a possible drop in gasoline  prices. Could you please confirm this and tell us how much? I  also have another question. Has the government decided to  support the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister  Bernd Niehaus for the post of OAS secretary general?    [Cristiani] There is no final word on fuel prices yet. Right  now we are in the final negotiations stage with the oil  companies to open up or liberate oil imports or their finished  byproducts. In other words, fuels that do not necessarily  require handling by RASA [Autonomous Refinery of El Salvador].  RASA is an enterprise that has two of the main oil companies as  shareholders. There is another oil company that has requested  permission to import finished products. We have been waiting  because this requires facilities and these are being built by  the company in Acajutla. We believe the negotiations on how the  free import scheme is to operate should be finished in the next  two weeks. The government would still retain certain controls,  although not in pricing.    This is a complicated matter not just because of refining  but  because of the San Jose Pact, which is an agreement between  governments. We believe, however, that with the drop in oil  prices it is quite possible that when the prices are liberated  these in turn will drop. The question remains as to how much and  I cannot say right now. Current prices are based on, I believe,  $19 a barrel, and I understand the price is approximately $17  right now. Do not take these as hard and fast figures, but more  or less this is the proportion. The idea is to take advantage of  the liberalization and not have the government, like what has  been done in the past, fix prices.    Regarding support to Bernd Niehaus' candidacy, an agreement  was signed during the presidential meeting in Nicaragua, wherein  we Central Americans pledged to support him. El Salvador  continues supporting Bernd Niehaus' candidacy.    [Moderator] Jorge Barahona, Teleprensa.    [Barahona] [words indistinct] public workers will get a new  wage increase. We would like to know when will this become  effective and what will be the amount?    [Cristiani] We believe that the increase will be sometime in  the middle of the fiscal year. We must remember the budget does  not include a specified amount for wage increases. Savings,  however, have been made from the time the budget was implemented  to meet this increase. The other thing that must be taken into  consideration is no amount has been decided on, but we would try  to match the yearly inflation rate taking into account the  latest rate and the projected one to try and ensure public  workers are not unduly affected in their purchasing power, and  that they even receive a real increase, like last year.    These are the overall parameters, but naturally, we have the  defense minister [chuckles] [pauses] I mean the finance  minister, who analyzes how the budget itself is executed. We are  sure we will be able to grant a wage increase about the middle  of the year. Logically, our administration ends 1 June, so we  would have to decide on the increase before, even though it  becomes effective after we leave office, but bear in mind that  we cannot leave a budget problem for the new administration.    Regrettably, when we took office we were left with a  completely unbalanced budget. You will recall that during the  electoral campaign all public workers got an unbudgeted 200  colon increase. When the second half of the fiscal year came,  which was when we took office, there were no funds. This became  a very serious problem. We do not want to leave this sort of  problem. If we grant an increase it will be because the funds  are available.    [Moderator] Mauricio Ramirez from Megavision.    [Ramirez] Mr. President, in light of FMLN's [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] concern -- the left-wing's concern  about not having representatives in the department juntas, an  FMLN delegation has traveled to the United Nations. Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] magistrates have said the United  Nations have no say in the country's electoral affairs. Would  your government be willing to follow UN secretary general  recommendations?    [Cristiani] We, as the government, have nothing whatosever  to  do with electoral topics. You must remember the peace agreements  changed the Central Election Council to the TSE, raising the  member to the rank of magistrate. The law specifies that the TSE  magistrates are the only ones who can interpret or execute the  electoral law. The electoral law is also the result of the peace  agreements, therefore not only was it raised to the rank of  tribunal and the peace agreements yielded an electoral code, but  the TSE was formed as a formula resulting from the peace  agreements. Perhaps we should take into account that the result  is nothing more than what the TSE has considered the current law  should be. We, as the government, have nothing whatsoever to do  with this and do not plan to exert any influence one way or the  other.    What has been done over the weekend was to hold an ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] party meeting to study the  FMLN-Democratic Convergence [CD] coalition request. We consider  their claim as a political party is partly justified. I believe  ARENA is going to do something about this. Their claim is partly  justified when one takes into account the complexity of the  various coalitions or the ways they are participating in the  elections, and this is where, I believe, the main problem lies,  and where the TSE does not have much latitude.    Upon examining the electoral code and its reforms, perhaps  what takes place every 15 years was not taken into account. In  other words, if we think of elections only in terms of the  president, or if elections for deputies and mayors are only  held, which is what normally takes place in the country, then  there would be no problem because it would be a single  coalition, and therefore the current electoral code covers it.  When studying this in comparison with ARENA, we saw there are  gaps when both types of elections are held simultaneously every  15 years. We believe the FMLN-CD coalition is partly correct in  their claim. We do not think their complete claim is justified;  they want more than they deserve.    I am not going to take a stand on this now; this will be up  to the party. ARENA is willing to discuss certain methods of  resolving this problem. The United Nations is not in a position  to interpret our electoral code. This task pertains only to the  TSE. We believe it is a mistake to run and get outside help  everytime a domestic problem arises. It is as if we need to  complain to someone abroad and have someone resolve our  problems. I think these problems need to be resolved  domestically. To my way of thinking this has no other purpose  than to stir things up for propaganda purposes. I repeat, the  party studied this and their claim is partly justified. I  believe this problem can be resolved.    [Moderator] Mr. President, the last question is from Mario  Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast.    [Jovel] Mr. President, which parties in the Electoral Code  are you referring to when simultaneous elections for president,  vice president, deputies and mayors are held? The other question  is: Does the government have information on Salvadorans who  could have suffered in the Los Angeles, California earthquake?  The third question is: When will the deployment of the [words  indistinct] in Santa Tecla and Cuzcatlan?    [Cristiani] When I mentioned the complexity of the electoral  process, it was in regard to the following. There are problems  with the diverse coalitions because in one department they can  be participating as political parties -- individually --  however, at the same time they could be part of another  candidacy within a coalition formed by those same parties in  which they are participating individually. For example, in the  San Salvador Department or at national level, the CD as well as  the FMLN participate as political parties individually for  deputies. Nevertheless, for the presidential ticket, they do not  participate as individual parties; they participate nationwide  as a coalition. We believe this can be partially resolved so all  interests -- individual as well as coalitions' interests -- can  be represented in the department juntas or have representation  in the department juntas to oversee the interests of the  individual party as well as of the coalitions. This would be  without duplicating representatives because this would mean  wanting to have more than what is allowed. This makes reference  to all those who form a coalition.    Up to now we only have knowledge of seven different  coalitions in seven departments. I am not sure how all of this  has been worked out. They organized a mix up of sorts. They are  running individually on one side and in a coalition on the  other. It is legal to form coalitions, no one is questioning  this; however, this is what has probably created the problem. In  addition to the fact that the Electoral Code did not foresee  these general elections for president, vice president as well as  for deputies and mayors at the same time.    One has a tendency to think of the elections in terms of  only  for president and vice president or only for mayors and  deputies. This has been the general rule. Nevertheless, any  party that forms a coalition in this fashion -- that is, a  persons runs individually on one side and in a coalition for  another candidacy -- will face the same problem. I believe this  can be resolved by having representatives on the juntas. This  was analyzed within ARENA. The party has offered to do something  to avoid problems with this.    What was the second question?    [Jovel] Do you have knowledge of Salvadorans who have been  victims of the earthquake?    [Cristiani] We have not had any report on this so far. We  are  waiting for our Los Angeles, San Francisco consul to report to  us, probably through the Foreign Ministry. For the time being,  we do not have any information.    [Words indistinct] The new deployment will take place this  week. I believe today approximately 300 new agents will graduate  from the Academy. They are always granted a couple of days to  prepare for the serious issues they will have to face. As the  saying goes: Dating is a different thing than living with  someone. [laughter]. The Academy is one thing and once they are  out on the streets, it is something else. They are given two  days to strengthen themselves morally and rest up. We expect to  initiate the new deployment in those two municipalities this  week.    We would like to leave you now with the finance minister. He  will make a couple of announcements and then he will take your  questions.</p>

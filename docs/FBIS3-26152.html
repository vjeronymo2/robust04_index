			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Carol Pui-yee Lai and Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] A tax revolt has broken out in China, with regional  governments pledging to defy Beijing's orders to implement a new  capital gains tax on property. Provincial leaders fear the new  tax may drive away foreign investment, which has been the key to  the fast growth of many coastal areas.    Officials in Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai will delay  implementing the tax, and instead try to bargain with Beijing.  They have told foreign businessmen that they would be able to  flexibly set their own capital gains tax rates on property. In  the Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen, officials have told  investors that property deals signed last year would not be  subject to the new tax.    But the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, said on Monday [31  January] that local governments had no choice but to obey the  new regulations laid down by the central authorities, the pro  Beijing Wen Wei Po reported. But Liu said that any  modifications or adjustments in the tax set by local authorities  will be considered "invalid without any exceptions". The  minister added that the views and suggestions of some foreign  businessmen would be solicited before detailed regulations for  implementing the new tax are released.    Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, is scheduled to visit Beijing  next week to demand a reduction in the tax rate, an official at  the city's Foreign Investment Commission said. Huang's trip  follows an unsuccessful attempt last week by State Planning  Commission officials to persuade the city to accept the tax. A  delegation from Beijing which visited Shanghai last week was  subjected to biting criticism from Huang Ju and other Shanghai  officials. "This is a very big problem. We want to follow  other provinces in fighting the tax," the Shanghai official said.    Meanwhile, Guangzhou's Vice-Mayor Dai Zhiguo told visiting  foreign businessmen on Friday the city would send a delegation  to Beijing before the Spring Festival to fight the tax. "Our  strategy is to delay for as long as possible while we bargain  with Beijing," Dai reportedly said.    Fujian is also now considering ways to get around the tax,  following a special meeting of province-wide foreign investment  officials in mid-January, a Fuzhou official said. One approach  being discussed in Fujian is to delegate collection of the tax  to municipal and county governments, which would be left to  decide whether to levy the tax themselves, the official said.    Local officials seeking to attract outside investment are  not  likely to be over-zealous in administering a tax whose revenues  flow to Beijing. But it will be extremely difficult for the  central government to monitor compliance if implementation is  delegated to the county and municipal level. Fujian's response  had been prompted by news of Guangdong's intent to resist the  new tax, she added. "Guangdong's actions are being used as a  reference by all of us."    The anti-tax sentiment is strongest in coastal provinces and  cities, where officials see it as a threat to foreign  investment. The controversial new tax requires all capital gains  on property to be taxed on a sliding ranging up to 65 per cent  for gains over 200 per cent.    But the deductions allowable under the new law are vague and  unclear, according to Michael Taylor, an economist at Morgan  Stanley in Hong Kong. "This makes it impossible for investors  to calculate their actual liability." There seems to be no  provision for this to be offset against the profits tax of 33  per cent to which property developers and investors are already  liable. The Finance Minister defended the new tax as a means of  suppressing pre-sales of property developments.    A People's Daily commentary on January 16 called for strict  enforcement of the new property capital gains tax, asserting  that the "property fad" is rearing its head again, creating a  negative impact on national economic development and efforts to  curb inflation." [no opening quotation marks as published] "If  large amounts of social capital flow into property and real  estate and it is allowed to develop blindly, infrastructure and  the revitalisation of key manufacturing industries will be  seriously affected," the commentary said.    There was little sign of resistance from provinces and  municipalities in northern China, however, which have  traditionally been less bold than the south in defying orders  from the centre.</p>

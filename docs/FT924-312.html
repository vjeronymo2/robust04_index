			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Few food companies see upturn in demand FEWER than half of Britain's larger food, drink and consumer goods manufacturers and their suppliers said they had noticed an upturn in demand for their products by the middle of this month, according to a survey. Almost half of those which had experienced no recovery expected one to start in the first or second quarter of next year. Twenty-five per cent said they expected no improvement until 1994. A small majority of the companies did not want sterling to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism in the next 12 months. This view was particularly strong among British-owned companies. The telephone survey covered directors of 181 manufacturing companies with annual sales of more than Pounds 5m, most of them in consumer businesses. It was carried out for the Financial Times between December 14 and 21 by Nielsen, the market research company. About two thirds of the companies surveyed expected UK sales and exports to increase next year, while about a quarter believed they would stay the same. Slightly more than a quarter planned to increase adver-tising spending, and about the same proportion expected their staff numbers in Britain to increase. However, 16 per cent expected their staff numbers to fall. Eighty-five per cent said recent currency fluctuations had affected their business, and just over a third said they had to rethink their production and distribution arrangements in Europe as a result.</p>

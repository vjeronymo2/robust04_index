			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FLURRY OF NUMBERS;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FACILITY READIES TO SORT, COUNT 16 MILLION CENSUS FORMS FROM 4 STATES  </P> <P> Perhaps it is inevitable that a man who is preparing for the arrival of 16  million census questionnaires at a Sorrento Valley warehouse would have numbers  on his mind.  </P> <P> So it was altogether fitting that Greg Nowakowski -- who in less than two  months will be surrounded by an avalanche of data on what people earn, spend on  housing, their number of children and myriad other details that chronicle life  in America -- heralded Wednesday's open house at the San Diego census  processing center by spewing out a torrent of statistics not unlike those that  will race through his high-speed computers this spring.  </P> <P> To succinctly -- if, perhaps, somewhat confusingly -- summarize what  Nowakowski, the center's manager, had to say: 16 million census forms from four  states will be counted by 1,200 San Diego workers who will use 300 computer  terminals, 11 high-speed cameras -- each capable of microfilming up to 2,400  questionnaires an hour -- and an estimated 4.6 million feet of film to prepare  the data for the FOSDIC (Film Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computer).  </P> <P> All of this will take place in a 128,500-square-foot building longer than two  football fields (or, to put it another way, more ground than the Chargers  typically cover in a game), after which the forms -- most Americans will  receive a 14-question short form, while one in six households will get the  59-question long version -- will be stored in a secure facility in Kansas for  72 years to protect confidentiality.  </P> <P> And that was only a small portion of the statistical flurry that Nowakowski --  a man of few words but of many numbers -- unleashed Wednesday to describe the  massive counting task that will begin in April.  </P> <P> One of only seven census processing offices in the country, the San Diego  facility will handle census questionnaires from residents of California,  Washington, Alaska and Hawaii.  </P> <P> Selected because of its availability of relatively inexpensive office space and  ready labor pool for the 1,200 temporary jobs needed for the decennial  population count, San Diego, like the other processing offices, will oversee  the five-step high-tech process -- human hands do little other than feed the  material into computers or other equipment -- in which the information on the  paper questionnaires is transferred onto microfilm and, later, computer tapes.  </P> <P> Due to security considerations, Wednesday's open house likely will be the only  time that either the public or the press will have access to the processing  center.  </P> <P> Marked by rah-rah enthusiasm with a patriotic twist -- red, white and blue  balloons were much in evidence, and a bureau handout noted that the census is  "a small patriotic duty to perform once every 10 years" -- the event also was  used by census officials both to allay apprehensions, particularly among  minorities, about the process and to try to attract applicants for the local  census jobs.  </P> <P> An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that about 1.4% of the American  population was not counted, with that so-called "undercount" distributed among  various minority groups, according to John Reeder Jr., the Census Bureau's  regional director. While 100% of the white population was counted, officials  estimate that 5.9% of both the black and Latino populations were missed in the  last census.  </P> <P> This year, officials hope to reduce that undercount through an aggressive  advertising campaign involving minority firms, combined with a persistent  emphasis on the confidentiality of the census information.  </P> <P> Recognizing that some people's reluctance to return census questionnaires stems  from skepticism over the government's need for such detailed information about  their personal lives, officials constantly stress that, as San Diego census  spokesman Dan Conway put it, the material is "not used for taxation, regulation  or investigation."  </P> <P> Although the statistical data is used to reapportion the U.S. House of  Representatives, to redraw state and local legislative districts and to  allocate more than $37 billion in federal funds annually, individuals' specific  questionnaires will be available only to their families until the year 2062.  </P> <P> "No one -- not the INS or the FBI or the IRS -- gets that information,"  Nowakowski said. "We take the confidentiality very, very seriously."  </P> <P> Of the 1,200 temporary census jobs available here, most are for clerical and  data entry positions that pay between $5.50 and $8.60 an hour. Most of the jobs  will last for about four months, though some will be filled for up to a year,  according to recruiting director John Ramirez Jr.  </P> <P> Estimating that nearly two-thirds of the 16 million questionnaires will be  returned within three weeks of being mailed out on March 23, census officials  believe that the San Diego office's peak period will be in late April and May.  If individuals do not return their census forms by May 1, their homes will be  visited by "street counters," whose job is to ensure that the final count comes  as close to measuring 100% of the population as possible.  </P> <P> "We'd like for them to have no work," Reeder said, only half-joking.  </P> <P> There will be plenty of work, however, for the employees inside the census  processing plant once the questionnaires begin arriving. Just how big is that  job? Let Nowakowski -- with yet another statistic -- answer that question.  </P> <P> If the 16 million paper questionnaires were laid end to end, Nowakowski  explained, they would stretch from San Diego to Washington, D.C., and back.  </P> <P> You can count on it.  </P></p>

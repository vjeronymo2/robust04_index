			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Technology: Screens have never looked so good - Worth Watching THE computer buff who is having problems with his or her bifocals may appreciate a pair of clip-on spectacles that convert fuzzy vision into clear vision. The designers, Direct Perception of London, say that by clipping Compu-vision over normal distance glasses, bifocals or varifocals, they can be brought to focus accurately at the special distance of computer screens - about 60 to 80cms. The lenses cover just the top half of the glasses and cost Pounds 8 a pair. Direct Perception: UK, 081 518 2685.</p>

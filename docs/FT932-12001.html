			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Suspicious Names detect errors admission on losses FOR THE third time in little over a year, hopes of an out-of-court settlement for loss-making Names have been disappointed, Richard Lapper writes. Yesterday's business plan offers Names the prospect of continued negotiations and the possibility of a 'modest' contribution from the central fund to any future settlement. Mr Robin Warrender, chairman of London Wall Holdings, which manages a number of syndicates, said: 'There are nothing but pious words.' Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which links groups of loss-making Names, criticised the failure to achieve a settlement but was encouraged by what he described as the plan's 'clear acceptance that litigation must be brought to an end'. He added: 'What we have to do now is negotiate the price.' Describing the plan as 'an incredible document', Mr Stockwell said: 'Lloyd's are admitting that many of the problems of the past are of their own making. They are saying that the spiral (the reinsurance of reinsurance) could have been prevented. They are admitting that they didn't have the management standards to regulate the market.' Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about 9,000 Names, is also concerned about the lack of a settlement, and concerned about worsened prospects for both the 1990 and 1991 underwriting years. He said: 'Further work on the litigation problem should be put in hand without delay.' His association also welcomed the plan's proposals to 'ring fence' past liabilities for old and open years. This would help 'the recruitment of new Names by insulating them from the liabilities of the past without selling-out the Names who underwrote the old years'. Mr Tom Benyon, founder of the Society of Names, which campaigns on behalf of loss-making Names, said the plan contained 'tea and sympathy' for loss-making Names 'but not much more'. He predicted that threats by Names to call an extraordinary general meeting, as a focus of opposition, would come to nothing. 'An EGM will be quelled in its tracks.' Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the biggest group of litigating Lloyd's Names, said he 'is deeply suspicious' of the plan. 'I suspect they are trying to manoeuvre a settlement on terms much less favourable than those we could obtain in litigation.' The plan's proposals to allow many badly-hit Names to continue trading were of little help to Gooda Names, many of whom have already resigned. Ms Marie-Louise Burrows, chairman of the Lime Street Action Group, which represents about 500 Names, facing average losses of more than Pounds 2m per head, is also critical. Ms Burrows said: 'There are wonderful words about the future but there is nothing in this plan which deals with Lloyd's. Nothing which deals with conflicts of interest.' Lime Street Names represent about 1.8 per cent of the total membership of Lloyd's between 1988 and 1991, but are faced with losses equal to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of those suffered by the market as a whole. Ms Burrows said: 'This tidal wave of losses will have to be paid by the rest of the membership. We can't pay them.'</p>

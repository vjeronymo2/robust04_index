According to Admiral Jan  Klenberg, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, such plans  were canceled when the Eduskunta appropriated another 207  million markkas for defense for the current year. The military  received funds as a result of the collective bargaining  agreement approved by the state.    "According to the collective bargaining agreement, the Armed  Forces will not be required to initiate new staff cutbacks or  mandatory furloughs during the 1994-95 period," noted Adm.  Klenberg in a speech during the opening ceremonies of the  National Defense Course last Monday [11 January] in Helsinki.    "By implementing the other significant savings measures that  we have planned, we should be able to get through this year in  some manner," opined Klenberg.    He emphasized that the military operating expenditures for  next year should, according to the Eduskunta, be brought to "a  level consistent with our defense readiness."    Last September, Klenberg presented the preliminary plans for  the closing of garrisons.    All garrisons were supposed to close for a month, and, at  the  same time, conscripts and permanent employees were to take  mandatory furloughs.    In his opening speech, Adm. Klenberg also talked about the  domestic defense industry. He expressed concern about its  continued viability.    In Klenberg's view, cuts in defense spending will lead,  during the next years, to the military being unable to order  munitions from the domestic defense industry.</p>

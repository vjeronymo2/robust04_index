			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / NZ jobless may fall to 6.4% Unemployment will fall to 6.4 per cent by the end of 1995 from the current rate of 8.4 per cent according to a New Zealand research group, AP-DJ reports from Wellington. The projection by Business &amp; Economic Research is more optimistic than the most recent economic forecasts issued by New Zealand's central bank in September. The Reserve Bank expects unemployment to decline to just 7.6 per cent by March 1996. The research group also expects gross domestic product to grow 3.6 per cent for the 12 months ending March 1996, greater than the 3.1 per cent predicted by the country's central bank.</p>

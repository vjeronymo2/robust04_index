			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Vauxhall strike threat recedes The threat of strike action at Vauxhall receded yesterday when members of the AEEU engineering union voted not to take action against the company's offer of an increase of 2.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent plus a lump sum of 1 per cent next year. AEEU members at Luton and Ellesmere Port voted by 2,318 to 374 against strike action and implicitly accepted the deal. TGWU members at Luton also rejected action. TGWU members at Ellesmere Port voted narrowly to reject the deal but will not take action on their own.</p>

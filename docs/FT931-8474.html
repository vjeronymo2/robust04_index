			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Department gets enhanced role and a bigger budget - Commerce MR Ron Brown, commerce secretary, yesterday set off to promote the president's plan in speeches in New York and Chicago with 'a big smile on my face'. The Commerce Department is a winner from the spending and cuts package proposed by President Bill Clinton to spur US technology and manufacturing competitiveness. Mr Brown told Chase Manhattan's technical centre in Brooklyn, New York, that the reaction to Mr Clinton's night speech unveiling the plan 'makes me know that we are on the right track'. He said creating more jobs was a primary goal of the Clinton administration. Tax benefits for corporations in high technology investment would help achieve that, especially among small businesses, he added. He noted that small businesses accounted for most American jobs, but did not say how the package would help big corporations, which have been cutting their payrolls. He described the speech as 'a call to arms. . . ,' saying it was 'a bold approach, an honest approach.' Mr Brown said that while there were some battles ahead, he thought the package would be enacted. In the short-term, his department will get Dollars 358m (Pounds 252m), including Dollars 117m for advanced technology and computer programmes, Dollars 81m for modernisation of the weather service, and Dollars 94m for economic development. Another Dollars 64m will go to the development of telecommunications 'superhighways' - a pet project of Vice-President Al Gore - which would establish computer networks between libraries, foundations, businesses and individuals. For the first time, the department will get sufficient funding to support the concept private-public sector partnerships. It will increase the number of 'manufacturing technology centres' from seven to more than 100. These will spread the benefits from the department's advanced technology programme, a scheme of matching grants to promote research and development. The department will get Dollars 80m for its role in defence conversion - in addition to Dollars 50m already planned - from the Pentagon. It will lose Dollars 6m from the export control programme which helps to curb nuclear and chemical weapon proliferation. Another Dollars 65m will be cut from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Disclosing who they are and what they earn (2) Sir, Your editorial, 'Directors' pay' (July 6), is right in seeking greater disclosure of board remuneration information, including share option benefits. I hope that the National Association of Pension Funds proposals for share option schemes ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans', July 6) support your recommendations for volunteering further details on share option schemes, but do not impose a view as to the 'correct' criteria. It should be for companies, and their remuneration committees, to decide the appropriate structure of the scheme, and to disclose it. It should be for the 'markets' to make their judgments on that structure, and to act accordingly. More disclosure - yes; more regulation - no.

The ship, Slobozia Mare, arrived at Mohacs on Monday [14  March] with Budapest as its destination. When checked  thoroughly for compliance of embargo regulations, it was found  to be carrying only 18 tonnes of oil instead of the 52 tonnes  indicated in its official documents, with water replacing the  missing quantity.    According to unconfirmed information, the Romanian captain  and the crew of two Serbs and six Ukrainians admitted to having  sold the missing oil, worth 2.7 million forints ($1 equals 103  forints), in Serbia. Customs investigations are continuing.</p>

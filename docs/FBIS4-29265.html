			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry will  make public parts of the Korean war (1950-1953) documents  received from Russia on June 25, officials said Saturday. The  documents are being translated into Korean by Foreign Ministry  officials and staff at the South Korean Embassy in Russia, they  said.    "The documents include telegraph messages between Kim  Il-song  and Joseph Stalin. They can substantially prove North Korea  made the first provocation against South Korea," said one  official, "Once the papers are translated, they will carry much,  much value." North Korean still insists that Seoul made the  first attack.    Russia gave South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the war  documents when the latter visited Moscow last week. The bundle  contains over 600 pages of over 200 items including  communication North Korea had with the former Soviet Union and  China from January 1949 to October 1950. For example, the  materials show Kim Il-song requested Moscow's support for the  war in January 1950 and Stalin agreed the following month. They  include an attack plan prepared by Russian military officials in  May 1950 and the kind of weapons Soviets supplied to North Korea  between September 1949 and April 1950.    Officials said the original papers will be kept by the  government and sensitive materials will be kept confidential.</p>

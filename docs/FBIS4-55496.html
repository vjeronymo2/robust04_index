			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic by </F> Amir Hodzic in Geneva; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Granic, how would you assess the  agreement between the Bosniak and the Croatian sides in Vienna?    [Granic] Very positively. I believe that this is a key step  in the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, it  is a key step [words indistinct] federation [word indistinct]  the Croats on (a fair basis), which will be [word indistinct],  and which will be to the mutual interest of both the Bosniaks  and the Croats, and the other citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Of course, we want this to be a firm federation that will be in  a confederal relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and  again to mutual benefit and interests. There can be no [words  indistinct] confederation, mutual interests. We talked about  this a lot, and [word indistinct] the talks with certain  agreements [word indistinct]. The primary problem is the  problem of the humanitarian convoys, the problem of energy  facilities, transportation, refugees, and so on. Of course,  this [words indistinct] through better cooperation.    [Hodzic] Do you believe that what has been agreed in Vienna  will be successfully implemented on the ground?    [Granic] Well, I am an optimist. Both sides have to make  maximum efforts. There will be individual resistance to the  agreement, and one has to expect that, but if [words indistinct]  then the agreement will be implemented.    [Hodzic] How much does the ministerial meeting in Geneva  respect the agreement from Vienna?    [Granic] Well, in any case it is not against the Vienna  agreement, and it is primarily directed at the third side, that  is, how to get the Serbs to the negotiating table, how to  achieve a cease-fire, and how to implement the agreement. As  for the main part of it, that is, the territories, [word  indistinct], and so on, [word indistinct] is the negotiating  position. I heard today that [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo]  Krajisnik has said that even 51 percent for the federation is  too much. That is their negotiating position. The  international community has presented its negotiating position.    [Hodzic] How would you comment on what the ministers here  agreed on as far as the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina  situation is concerned?    [Granic] I think it is all right in principle, which means  that a (contact) group has been formed to monitor the cease-fire  and the negotiations, and that is what Croatia supports.    [Hodzic] Mr. Granic, thank you.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bulmer up 19% in buoyant cider market - Growth attributed to concentration on mainstream brands HP BULMER Holdings yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in annual profits as cider continued to grow despite the decline in the UK drinks market as a whole. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to April 24 rose from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 17.1m on sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 221.9m. The results, coming on the day that the share offer for Taunton Cider closed, confirmed that the cider market is the one area of the UK drinks market that is still growing despite recession. Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said he welcomed the arrival of another quoted company and the amount that Taunton was contributing to the growth of the market. Bulmer's earnings per share expanded by 23 per cent to 19.96p and the final dividend is increased to 5.55p, giving a total of 9p, up 8 per cent. The record profits and earnings were, however, a reflection of its strategy of focusing on Strongbow and Woodpecker, its mainstream cider brands which compete mainly with Taunton's Blackthorn and Autumn Gold brands for more than 85 per cent of the market. 'Taunton's strategy is very much about new brands,' Mr Rudgard said. 'Ours is very much to do with existing brands and bringing in new brands.' During the year Bulmer spent Pounds 13m on capital expenditure, compared with a depreciation charge of Pounds 5m. The company has spent Pounds 49m capital on capital expenditure over the last four years. In particular, Mr Rudgard said, Bulmer had invested heavily in kegs and keg equipment to widen the availability of cider. Bulmer claims a 33 per cent market share for Strongbow, which it said had grown 13 per cent over the last two years, and a 23 per cent market share for Woodpecker which it said was growing at 16 per cent. By comparison, Bulmer said sales of Blackthorn and Autumn Gold were both falling. Mr Rudgard said that its premium Scrumpy Jack brand was also growing, albeit from a lower level than Diamond White, Taunton's mainstay. The contribution to sales from Pectin fell due to the worldwide recession with profits of Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.64m) on sales down 12 per cent at Pounds 14.5m. Profits in Australia rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.79m, enjoying the only significant part of that country's drinks market to show growth.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEIL DIAMOND GIVES A REASON TO BELIEVE  </P> <P> Neil Diamond really is a believer.  </P> <P> Not in anything thorny or controversial, mind you. But in an era when belief in  anything is hard to find, anyone who expounds ideals with heroic zeal and  wholehearted conviction is going to find a willing audience.  </P> <P> It's obvious that a lot of people find something believable in Diamond, and he  showed why on Monday at the San Diego Sports Arena, the closest to Los Angeles  he'll play before his record-breaking nine-night stand at the Forum in June.  </P> <P> On the surface, Diamond's two-hour concert was freighted with nearly every  phony, deadening device that big-time show biz has to offer: lasers,  unrelievedly sentimental songs, stentorian vocal stylings, bombastic patriotic  display.  </P> <P> But at the core was a singer who brought such unabashed, unflagging ardor and  energy to his music of high romance and optimistic zeal that it was all . . .  believable.  </P> <P> Somehow, Diamond made his big, leathery baritone sound convincingly heroic, but  not pompous. Don't ask for analysis: This feat was as mystifying as the Utah  fusion-in-a-bottle experiment. Somehow, the lasers and lavish showers of light  served as appropriate, skillfully applied backdrops for an already commanding  performer rather than as a cover for a lack of compelling human presence. And  these titanic trappings didn't prevent Diamond from showing an unassuming,  down-to-earth delight in being face to face with his fans.  </P> <P> When Diamond put his force behind middle-of-the-road schmaltz, he made it  bearable, even palatable. When he dug into his older backlog of catchy,  rock-oriented nuggets -- including a long hit-parade sequence that included  "I'm a Believer," "Red Red Wine" and "Sweet Caroline" -- the show became a pure  delight.  </P> <P> It almost didn't matter that there is a huge gulf between Diamond's  romanticized vision of things and the vexatious, doubt-filled, irony-laden  reality of things that the best pop songwriters often try to capture.  </P> <P> Over the course of a career, that's a serious flaw. But over the course of two  hours, Diamond made it a pleasure to suspend disbelief.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed that the requirement that for-profit institutions maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.25:1 was burdensome and exceeded the scope of the statute. One commenter supported the ratio requirement and suggested that a current ratio of 1.6:1 up to 2:1 might be a more appropriate standard of financial responsibility. The majority of commenters who expressed concern regarding the ratio requirement indicated that they believed the Secretary's justification for applying a higher standard to for-profit institutions was unsupported and discriminatory. Many commenters believed that the Secretary should not attempt to distinguish between for-profit and nonprofit institutions. Among the commenters who expressed a concern, most believed that the establishment of separate ratio tests for each type of institution was not required by the HEA. Some of the commenters believed that the exclusion of uncollateralized related party receivables from the calculation of current assets was inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles. A number of commenters suggested that a phase-in period ranging from twelve months to more than five years should be granted to allow institutions time to build up working capital reserves in order to comply with this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed that in applying this standard the Secretary was effectively mandating that for-profit institutions divert available funds away from capital assets such as facilities, supplies, and equipment and into lower yielding short term investments. While the Secretary recognizes the possibility that a higher current ratio requirement could theoretically lead to greater inefficiencies in the use of funds, the Secretary believes that higher levels of working capital afford greater financial flexibility to institutions and thus provide greater protection against the possibility of unexpected closure. The Secretary believes that Congress intended to ensure through regulation that students are afforded every reasonable protection with regard to their attendance at an institution through which they are receiving HEA funds. The Secretary also believes that the numerous fundamental differences in accounting and funding methods for nonprofit and for-profit institutions provide sufficient justification for the application of different standards to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Secretary believes that a change in the current ratio requirement is appropriate to take into consideration differing financial and operating structures while employing similar standards for both for-profit and nonprofit institutions. In order to implement a uniform standard that may be used for different types of institutions, the Secretary believes that it is appropriate to exclude certain assets and liabilities from the calculation of the analytical ratios. As discussed in more detail below, the Secretary believes institutions that are currently in compliance with the existing standards of financial responsibility will not require a grace period to meet the new standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;&sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B), the Secretary has replaced the current ratio requirement of 1.25:1 with an acid test ratio of 1:1, representing the ratio of the sum of cash and cash equivalents, and current accounts receivable divided by current liabilities. In applying this standard, the Secretary excludes from the ratio calculation all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables as well as all other assets not specifically identified in the above ratio calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the Secretary is involved in attempting to set accounting standards by requiring classified statements of financial position for nonprofit institutions reporting under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 117 (FASB 117), Financial Statements for Not-for-Profit Organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is aware that presenting the statement of financial position of a nonprofit institution as a classified statement of financial position is a matter of management decision. However, during the negotiated rule making process, the need for comparable financial responsibility and accounting standards became evident. This need must be reconciled in some manner, despite the varying accounting standards between for-profit and nonprofit entities. The Secretary does not permit this information to be presented in a supplementary schedule because supplementary schedules are not subject to audit tests, as are notes to the financial statements. The information concerning current assets and current liabilities does not have to be included as part of the audit but may be included in the notes to the financial statements. Preparation of a classified statement of financial position is included as an option under FASB 117. The Secretary is therefore not setting standards but merely requiring that presentation be made in accordance with one of those options in particular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed that implementation of the proposed regulations should be delayed for at least a year, with most commenters expressed stating that the increased current ratio requirement and cash reserve requirement would require institutions to accumulate additional cash or other liquid assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes institutions that are in compliance with the current standards for financial responsibility will not require a significant period of time to implement the proposed changes. For many institutions, the acid test ratio proposed by the Secretary will measure exactly the same elements as the former current ratio did. The establishment of a separate cash reserve should not impact the calculation to a great extent because the cash reserve balance will be included in the ratio calculation. Because the acid test ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity, the Secretary only requires that an institution demonstrate parity between its most liquid assets and its current obligations. The accumulation of significant liquid assets would generally not be required by an institution. The Secretary believes that it is reasonable to expect that an institution has at least as much cash on hand and current receivables as it does current obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family (Getting an income): How to make money when interest rates fall - John Authers, Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu examine options beyond the building society SAVERS ARE finding it harder and harder to find products that offer them a decent income. Too many have relied on the building society for too long. Many people are chasing from one building society to another in search of higher rates, but this game is frustrating. Rates which are ahead of the market one week are cut the next, and attractive accounts can quickly be closed to new business. Savers need to explore other options. Some of these can be complex, even bewildering; so, on this page and the next, we outline some of the main income-producing products and indicate their pros, their cons, and the rates available. Product providers are getting ever more ingenious in their efforts to attract investors. As in the US, money market funds are becoming more popular; these invest in short-term debt of banks and other companies, and offer returns which are close to the level of base rates. They are never the top payers in the market but they should always be competitive and may save the investor the bother of switching constantly between building societies. Fidelity and M &amp; G now offer money market funds which give cheque books to those who deposit more than Pounds 5,000. Another cash-based option is offshore accounts. These pay income gross, which is useful for non-taxpayers. However, quite often, they pay rates that are higher than those on domestic accounts, even after allowing for tax. Going offshore can prove risky, but there are some well-known names offering such accounts. With all these products, you need to remember that there is a relationship between risk and reward.  Normally, the higher the return, the higher the risk. Any exceptions to this common-sense maxim relate usually to charges on the fund. The lower these charges are, the more the manager can pass on (in the form of income) to the investor. Cazenove has a low-charging, high-yielding personal equity plan on offer this week (see Page II). The investor needs also to make a choice between flexibility and return. Some products offer higher rates by tying-up your money for a set period. But a few pounds of extra income may not be worth the loss of easy access. We can give only the outlines of these products on our pages; those who want more information should consult an independent financial adviser. ANNUITY ATTRACTIONS NO INVESTMENT will give you bigger 'income' pay-outs than an annuity. However, it does so by repaying all your initial capital at the same time, so annuities are inappropriate as the sole investment for anyone who needs to preserve their capital. When you buy an annuity, from a life office or friendly society, you pay a lump sum in return for a guaranteed income for the rest of your life (or for a fixed period in the case of a temporary annuity). The life office holds on to any remaining capital after your death, and invests in gilts to ensure that it can meet its guarantees. Payments are governed by two factors - your age (and hence your life expectancy), and the rates available on gilts. Pros. Annuities offer better value the older you are and the higher gilt yields are. For the elderly (as a rule, men over 70 and women over 75), this can make an annuity a powerful income-producing tool. Annuities bought with funds not derived from a pension scheme have relatively favourable tax treatment. Payments are divided for tax purposes into capital repayment and income; you are taxed only on the income element. Those who need to retain capital could combine a temporary annuity with a lump sum investment for growth, such as a Pep. If this goes well, you may be able to repay the capital by the time the annuity stops paying out. This lessens the risk to your capital, but it could still be eroded. Cons. If you die shortly after buying an annuity, your capital will be lost to your heirs, so this may not be a good investment for those in poor health. Returns may also be poor for those who buy when gilt yields are low. Rates. Temporary annuities can produce a high yield. A woman aged 70 paying Pounds 20,000 would receive a gross income of Pounds 4,931.16 (Pounds 4,736 net) for five years from Equitable Life, according to the Annuity Bureau. For a woman aged 80 the top rate is Pounds 5,365.20, from Standard Life. Men have a lower life expectancy, which is reflected in higher rates - a 70-year-old would receive Pounds 5,124.84 each year from Equitable Life (net Pounds 4,913.40), while the top rate for an 80-year-old is Pounds 5,758.80 (net Pounds 5,497.20), according to the Annuity Bureau. (See table on Page V for other rates). GUARANTEE OF GIBS GUARANTEED income bonds (Gibs) allow investors to lock into prevailing interest rates for up to five years. They are a variant of single-premium life assurance bonds, offered mainly by the smaller life assurance companies. Their income is fixed at the outset and cannot be revised. This rate is determined primarily by the yields on gilts. Basic-rate tax is paid within the fund. Top-rate taxpayers will be liable to pay the difference between basic and top rates on their income. Most companies offer the bonds over periods of one, two, three, four and five years. Interest rates will vary according to the time and the amount of money put in. Sums as low as Pounds 1,000 are not encouraged by many companies and most will offer a higher percentage income for a large lump sum. Income can be paid monthly or yearly. Pros. Because the rate is set at the start, it is guaranteed for the period of the bond. This gives the investor certainty and protection if interest rates fall. If the life company offering a Gib goes bust, the Policyholders Protection Act will pay out 90 per cent of the original amount invested, making the bonds more secure than many other options. Cons. If interest rates rise, investors may find themselves 'locked in' at uncompetitive returns. Since basic-rate tax is deducted and cannot be reclaimed, these products are unsuitable for non-taxpayers. Rates. Returns have fallen substantially in recent years. Over one year, the best rate on Pounds 5,000 at the moment is 4.75 per cent annually and 3.93 per cent monthly, according to Baronworth Investment Services. Over five years, the best rate on Pounds 5,000 is 6.74 per cent annually and 6 per cent monthly. FIXED-RATE BONDS BANK AND building society fixed-rate bonds are a way of fixing the return on a deposit over 12, 24 or 36 months. You pay a lump sum and interest is added annually, monthly or on maturity. The minimum balance is usually Pounds 5,000 but could be as low as Pounds 1,000 in some cases. Like any other fixed-rate product, you buy the bond to protect your income if you think that interest rates will fall further. Pros. By fixing the rate of interest, you know your total return in advance. The bonds are easy to acquire and are a secure investment so long as the bank or society is sound. Cons. Interest rates could rise, in which case you will have made a bad decision to fix when rates were lower. In most cases, you cannot redeem the bond earlier than the prescribed term. Rates. These depend on the amount paid and the term of the bond. Interest rates on monthly income bonds will usually be lower than those paying interest annually or on maturity. One-year bonds requiring a Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 2,000 minimum are paying about 5.75 per cent gross. Interest on larger amounts is in the 6 to 7 per cent range. Two- and three-year bonds are paying up to 7 per cent. Bristol &amp; West has just launched a five-year 'escalator bond.' The interest rate is fixed at 7 per cent gross in the first year (April 1993 to March 1994) and increases by a fixed 0.5 of a percentage point for each subsequent year. In the fifth year, therefore, it will pay a fixed rate of 9 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. INVESTMENT BONDS SINGLE-PREMIUM investment bonds are sold by insurance companies and come in several types - investing in equities, gilts, properties or a combination of the three. Investors can withdraw 5 per cent of the original value of their money each year without any basic-rate tax liability; higher-rate taxpayers can postpone their liability until the bond is cashed in. Bonds are either mainly 'unit-linked' - which allows investors the freedom to switch between funds without paying entry charges - or 'with-profits,' where non-reversible bonuses are added on each year. Pros. Being able to withdraw 5 per cent a year can be handy and competes with net rates from building societies. There is also the opportunity for capital growth. As the bonds are classified as insurance policies, some life assurance is included. Cons. Care must be taken over the timing of cashing them in since the gain could push a basic-rate taxpayer into the higher-rate band. Similarly, an investor's age allowance could be endangered. The bonds have charges which will eat into your investment. Levies are similar to unit trusts - 5 per cent initial with a 1 per cent annual management charge. If the capital fails to grow, you could be consuming your capital every time you take your 5 per cent income. The performance of managed insurance funds has not been as good as unit trusts over the long term. A BOND FUND PORTFOLIO BOND FUNDS - unit trusts which invest in gilts and other fixed-interest securities - have arrived in the past year. This could be an example of the investment community leaving yesterday's bright idea until today, following two years of strong performance by gilts. Prices are now higher; accordingly, yields have dropped. Income on these funds tend to be paid twice a year, so you will need to construct a portfolio of funds if you want a monthly income. Pros. Yields on gilts with medium- and long-term maturities are now above base rates, so investors can increase their income by buying the right fund. Doing this saves them the worry of choosing the right gilt for their needs (see Page IV item on gilts). The manager will try to use his skill to get income or capital growth (or a bit of both). Some funds have reduced their initial charges (the two Aberdeen gilt funds have no initial charge at all), while the risks facing private investors who play the gilts market on their own have grown. Cons. Charges on some funds can be high; this can take a dent out of the income return. Other funds have such high yields that they are eating up the capital, which could provide investors with a shock when they come to cash in their units. In any case, if interest rates rise, gilt prices could fall, leaving the investor with a loss. Any profits on a gilt unit trust are liable to capital gains tax, while gilts bought directly are not. If you buy a gilt directly, the yield is fixed till maturity; but yields on bond funds can fall. If bond funds invest in debt issued by companies, rather than the government, there is a credit risk if the company fails. Rates. The biggest yield at the end of January came from Abtrust Fixed Interest, with 9.23 per cent. Yields above 9 per cent also were available from Aberdeen Gilt Income, Aetna Preference, Guinness Flight Premium Fixed Interest, Henderson Preference &amp; Gilt, and M&amp;G Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest Income. But remember that the fund with the biggest yield is not necessarily the best; it might involve the risk of capital loss. International bond funds, which offer broader diversification, have generally lower yields of around 5 or 6 per cent. They involve a currency risk but the possibility of a currency gain if sterling declines.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Thai minister resigns over resort land scandal Mr Suthep Thuaksuban, Thailand's deputy agriculture minister, has resigned following claims that he had helped to assign land on the resort island Phuket to 10 rich families under a scheme designed to help landless farmers. The resignation should ease a political crisis that has threatened to stymie the chances of Mr Chuan Leekpai becoming the first Thai premier to lead a government to its full four-year term. The land scandal has been given blanket coverage in the Thai press, partly because Mr Suthep is seen to have perverted the government's much touted promise to boost incomes of the rural poor. Opposition parties - delighted to have some dirt to mar the Democrat party's squeaky clean reputation - have warned that a censure debate due on December 14 will go ahead as planned. With Mr Suthep gone the opposition will now try to bring down the Democrat party's agriculture minister, Mr Niphon Promphan. Mr Niphon was less directly implicated but the family of his political secretary, a Democrat MP, received one of the parcels of land. Until the land scandal broke 10 days ago the opposition parties had been unusually subdued this year, partly because of revelations that several opposition members of parliament are banned from the US because of suspected narcotics trafficking. Although some embittered members of the coalition's Buddhist Force party have threatened to vote with the opposition over the land scandal, most government critics appear satisfied with one or two resignations and the promise of a full inquiry. The more serious threat to the five-party coalition, overshadowed by the scandal, comes from within: General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the ambitious interior minister has threatened to pull his New Aspiration party out of the coalition if he is not permitted to vote against a key part of government policy - the democratisation of local government. Mr Chavalit thinks that if he campaigns against the proposal to have village leaders elected, grateful local chiefs will ensure their communities vote for his party at the next election. Yesterday, however, the Democrats and NAP appeared to be edging towards a compromise.</p>

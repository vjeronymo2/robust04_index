			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE BACKS PLAN TO CURB CIGARETTE MARKETING;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE BIGGER WARNING LABELS ON PACKAGES, ADS.  OPPONENTS SAY THE RESTRICTIONS VIOLATE FREE SPEECH GUARANTEES.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, while opposing some proposed new restrictions on  cigarette marketing, expressed support Thursday for larger and more prominent  warning labels on cigarette packages, billboards and print ads.  </P> <P> The bigger labels, including one that would read "Cigarettes Kill," were  endorsed by James O. Mason, assistant health and human services secretary,  during a packed congressional hearing on a sweeping initiative to restrict  cigarette advertising and promotion.  </P> <P> One provision of the bill calls for bluntly worded warnings emblazoned across  the top 20% of any cigarette ad. It would require similar warnings that fill  25% of the two most visible sides of a pack of cigarettes.  </P> <P> "Current labeling . . . is inadequate and warrants reform," Mason told the  House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment. He said  that existing warning labels are "too small."  </P> <P> The proposed new rotating labels would include warnings that "Tobacco Is An  Addicting Drug" and "Cigarette Smoke Harms Nonsmokers." Others would state  flatly that cigarettes cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and stroke  and may cause fetal injury.  </P> <P> The pending legislation, sponsored by subcommittee chairman Henry A. Waxman  (D-Los Angeles), represents the latest battleground between smoking foes and  the $40-billion-a-year tobacco industry and its congressional allies.  </P> <P> At Thursday's hearing, the initiative was alternately praised as "the most  important pro-health bill" in 52 years and denounced as "the most  unconstitutional advertising proposal ever considered by Congress."  </P> <P> At stake, proponents said, is whether to allow tobacco firms to continue to  lure 3,000 young people a day into an addictive habit that kills 390,000  Americans annually and costs billions of dollars in health care and lost  productivity.  </P> <P> Opponents, including advertising industry leaders and the American Civil  Liberties Union, countered that the issue is whether Congress should attempt to  restrict constitutionally protected free speech.  </P> <P> The measure, a compendium of anti-smoking initiatives, would bar the use of  human or cartoon figures in advertising by allowing only "tombstone" ads  containing written text but no illustration other than a picture of the  cigarette brand.  </P> <P> Proponents said that the restriction would prevent tobacco companies from  targeting young people, women and minorities with ads that associate smoking  with sex appeal, glamour and success.  </P> <P> The proposal would prohibit tobacco companies from sponsoring athletic, musical  and artistic events and distributing free samples. It would permit states to  ban cigarette advertising by rescinding a federal prohibition against state  regulation of such ads.  </P> <P> The measure also would withhold federal alcohol and drug-abuse funds from  states that fail to adopt laws setting and enforcing a minimum age of 19 for  cigarette purchases and prohibiting sales from vending machines accessible to  minors. Current state laws restricting sales to minors are generally not  enforced, according to a recent HHS study.  </P> <P> Waxman's proposal is modeled after similar controls adopted in Canada, France  and Australia. In Canada, such restrictions and other recent anti-tobacco  measures led to a 12% decline in smoking in the first five months of 1990, Ken  Kyle, public issues director for the Canadian Cancer Society, told the panel.  </P> <P> Representatives of the tobacco industry, which spends $3.3 billion annually on  advertising, expressed vehement opposition to each of the bill's provisions,  most of which they called misguided.  </P> <P> "There is no proof that anybody starts to smoke because of advertising," said  Charles O. Whitley, senior consultant to the Tobacco Institute, the industry  lobbying group. "Peers, siblings, parents and co-workers are the forces behind  smoking."  </P> <P> The industry spokesmen denied that cigarette advertising targets youth,  insisting that firms advertise to persuade smokers to switch brands or to stick  with brands.  </P> <P> Larger warnings are unnecessary because surveys show that more than 90% of  Americans already believe that smoking is dangerous, the spokesmen said.  </P> <P> The pending bill would amount "to total prohibition of advertising and  promotion of tobacco products (because) the only message that would be left  would be one that says, 'Don't buy this product,' " Whitley said.  </P> <P> Mason said that he and HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan oppose withholding  federal funds if states do not crack down on sales of cigarettes to minors.  </P></p>

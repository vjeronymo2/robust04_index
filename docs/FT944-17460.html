			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Surge in UK exports helps trim trade deficit The UK's trade position with the rest of the world is improving significantly as exports surge to meet strong world demand and imports of consumer goods fall, official figures showed yesterday. The trend suggests that the nature of the UK recovery is changing, as export-led growth begins to play a bigger role than consumer spending. Meanwhile, a continued fall in the trade deficit last month has damped fears that the upturn might trigger a new balance of payments crisis by sucking in imports to meet growing demand. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the UK trade deficit with the rest of the world fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 704m in July from Pounds 729m in June. Measured on a three-monthly basis, seen as a more accurate guide to the underlying trend, the deficit narrowed to Pounds 2.45bn in the three months to July. This is the smallest deficit since 1987, barring a temporary low point three years ago. It compares with a deficit of Pounds 3.48bn in the same period a year ago. The CSO said both exports and imports had risen to record levels in July, although the underlying trend indicated that exports had shown the fastest growth. On a three monthly basis, export volumes were 1.5 per cent higher in the three months to July compared with the previous three months, and 10 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Export values grew slightly more, indicating that exporters have slightly raised their prices. Import volumes, by contrast, fell 2 per cent. The fall surprised the City, in light of earlier fears that rising demand this year would suck in more imports. But the CSO said the key reason for the fall had been a 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop in the volume of imported consumer goods. This may reflect slower consumer spending as a result of recent tax rises. Imports of components grew by 4 per cent, reflecting the pick-up in UK manufacturing. The exports trend was flattered by the North Sea sector's performance. It recorded a Pounds 1.26bn surplus on oil trade. Exports also grew in most industrial sectors. Finished goods, which account for about half of UK exports, rose by nearly Pounds 0.5bn in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months.</p>

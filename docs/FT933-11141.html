			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors seek sterling safe haven from ERM storm STERLING-denominated new issues provided the main focus in the international bond market yesterday, with investors scrambling for sterling assets against a backdrop of continued turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank's decision to cut only its Lombard rate by half a point, while leaving the discount rate unchanged, sparked further turbulence in the foreign exchange markets. Sterling, which remains outside the ERM, attracted interest from investors because of its perceived 'safe haven' status at such times. SBG, or Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft (Deutschland), the wholly-owned German subsidiary of UBS, launched an unusual structured deal with a total price tag of Pounds 259.25m. SBG is issuing a series of 27 different zero coupon notes, with maturities staggered at six-monthly intervals from September 30 1993 to the final series (No 27) maturing on March 31 2006. The first 26 note issues are for Pounds 6.125m with a final, 27th, note of Pounds 100m. UBS, lead manager, said it chose this structure in response to strong investor demand for sterling-denominated zero coupon instruments. 'There's good demand for sterling assets from continental investors because of the currency play, and zero coupon bonds provide them with a leveraged play,' it said. The bonds also held tax advantages for certain investors. The zero coupon bonds are backed by semi-annual coupon payments from SBG's holding of a Pounds 100m issue of BT bonds, which have a 12.25 per cent coupon and mature in 2006. 'This is basically a way of creating zero coupon bonds off the back of a normal coupon bond as the cash-flow from the BT bond interest payments received by SBG will be used to pay off the zero coupon bond,' said a senior official at UBS. UBS originally bought Pounds 229m of BT debt, selling part and retaining Pounds 100m to do a structured transaction. The other sterling deal of the day was a Pounds 56.25m convertible issue by Witan, the largest investment trust managed by Henderson Touche Remnant. The bonds can be converted into a basket of shares in three separate investment trusts managed by Henderson, and in which Witan has shareholdings. Baring Brothers, book-runner for the deal, said the convertible bond route provided a tax-efficient way for Witan to sell its shares in the three investment trusts. The bonds were launched at par and were quoted at between 100 (bid) and 100.5 (offered) by late afternoon. Baring Brothers said the bonds were bought mainly by private client fund managers, as well as institutional fund managers in the UK and Europe. Meanwhile, Skopbank, the central bank for Finland's savings bank group, launched a Dollars 100m floating-rate note with the coupon set at six-month Libor plus 50 basis points, giving investors an overall yield of Libor plus 61 basis points.</p>

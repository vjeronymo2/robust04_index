			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / FT Guide To US Interest Rates Why is everyone so sure that US interest rates are going up tomorrow? The Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets interest rate policy for the US Federal Reserve, meets tomorrow in Washington for the first time in nearly two months. It has raised interest rates five times this year, most recently on August 16, in an effort to control an economy that grew at an annualised rate of 4.1 per cent in the second quarter and to head off inflationary pressures before they had a chance to show up as higher prices. Since then, it has become clear that the US economy is still growing much faster than the 2 1/2 per cent pace that most members of the FOMC would regard as sustainable - a 3.4 per cent rate in the third quarter. The unemployment rate is down to 5.8 per cent - at or below the level at which most FOMC members expect employers will start having difficulty finding workers and having to pay higher wages - and some commodity prices are rising fast. As a result, virtually everyone agrees that the Fed needs to pour another jug of cold water on the economy in the form of higher interest rates. Who makes the decision? The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the board of governors, who are appointed by the president for a 14-year term, and a rotating sample of five of the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. The committee is chaired by Alan Greenspan (below), and its vice chairman is the president of the New York Fed. Traditionally, the regional Fed presidents are viewed as more hawkish on inflation than the governors, but they are also in closer contact with the business community in their districts, from whom they are hearing plenty of reasons why not to raise interest rates. How do they decide? Like other central banks, the Fed once used the growth of the money supply as a target, but changes in the structure of the economy mean that monetary measures like M1 and M2 no longer have any demonstrable use as a predictor of inflation. Inflation measures, such as the consumer price index, tell you more about the past than the future, and also overstate the pace of inflation, many Fed economists argue. Now, the FOMC basically makes a forecast of where it thinks the economy is heading, using a wide and shifting range of indicators such as credit market developments, manufacturers' order books and lead times, and tightens or loosens its policy accordingly. One critical element is what Fed officials call the 'loss factor' - how easily can they undo the damage if their forecast turns out to be wrong? That argues for a series of smaller interest rate increases rather than one sharp yank on the monetary rope. How does the Fed move interest rates? To raise interest rates, the Fed operates in the credit market to take cash out of the system by selling government securities to the banks. It would undertake a reserve repurchase, selling government securities to the money market for a fixed period, usually one day, with an agreement to buy them back at a fixed interest rate. By reducing the amount of money available, this raises the interest rate banks can charge for the reserves they hold at the Federal Reserve and lend each other overnight - the federal funds rate, which currently stands at 4.75 per cent. The Fed can also raise the discount rate, currently 4 per cent, which it charges when banks borrow directly from its discount window - designed to operate mostly as a lender of last resort. So what exactly is going to happen tomorrow? Of the 39 banks which operate as primary dealers in the government securities market, 34 are predicting an increase of half a percentage point, or 50 basis points in the language used by bond traders, lifting the federal funds rate to 5.25 per cent. Only one dealer is predicting no change, according to a survey by Dow Jones Capital Markets, while four banks expect an increase of three quarters of a percentage point. Almost everyone in the financial markets would like a move of more than half a percentage point - a view not shared by business. Most dealers think the Fed has been 'behind the curve' in not acting sooner to cool the rapid growth of the third quarter. The markets could be placated if the Fed raises the discount rate by more than the federal funds rate, or issues a tough statement on its determination to keep inflation under control. When will we know? In the past, the FOMC has not made its actions known immediately. It gave the Fed chairman his orders, but left him to act in the open markets between FOMC meetings. This year, however, the FOMC has announced all its interest rate moves, and even given a brief explanation, usually around lunchtime, Washington time.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good start on cuts Sir, I have received two parliamentary answers, which might interest the taxpayer. The first is that Pounds 7m per annum is currently spent on sports facilities for civil servants, mostly in London. The second is that the special unit at Barlinnie Prison, which is intended to redeem recidivist criminal psychopaths was opened on February 5 1973. To date, 36 prisoners have been located there for varying periods of time. The staffing costs alone run at about Pounds 300,000 per annum, or Pounds 6m since its opening, which works out at Pounds 300,000 per prisoner - with almost nothing to show for it. Could they bring the costs of their little school a bit closer to the Pounds 5,000 a year at Eton, or half that for a state pupil. There, chancellor, is your chance to cut taxes and cut out waste.

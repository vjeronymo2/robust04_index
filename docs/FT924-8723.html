			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / SIB threat to small advisers THE Securities and Investments Board, the umbrella regulatory body for the financial services industry, is to consider whether the entire industry should continue to subsidise the contributions by independent financial advisers to the investors' compensation scheme, it said yesterday. A disproportionately large share of payouts under the scheme cover default by independents. The end of cross-subsidisation could raise their contributions significantly, driving many out of business. 'There must be a danger that the smaller members' existence would be threatened if cross-subsidisation ended,' said Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, in a departure from the stance of his predecessor, has said that if the independent sector cannot stand on its own, no special measures should be taken to maintain it. The brokerage community in particular has objected to cross-subsidisation, arguing that its members do not benefit from the services of the independents and should not be held responsible for their excesses. Mr Christopher Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for the brokerages and investment banks, said: 'The whole concept of cross-subsidisation is unacceptable to us.' Members of his organisation paid an additional Pounds 1m to the compensation scheme last year, and the cost could be significantly higher this year. 'I am told the claims are coming in thick and fast,' he said. The life insurance industry has been voluntarily subsidising contributions from independents to the scheme. Last year life insurers paid an additional Pounds 14m to cover levies on the independents. Meanwhile, SIB also endorsed plans for members of a new self-regulatory body for retail financial services to contribute up to Pounds 50m towards claims on the compensation scheme. The Personal Investment Authority is expected to include Fimbra members as well as the life insurers, some large independent advisers and the financial services arms of banks and building societies.</p>

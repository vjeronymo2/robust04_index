			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Slow pace of talks fuels Palestinians' frustration: One year on, the negotiations leave a West Bank camp disillusioned and angry IN DAHAISHE refugee camp, just south of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, there are strong feelings about the Middle East peace talks which last week entered their seventh session since opening in Madrid amid such fanfare one year ago. Almost without exception, Dahaishe's 8,200 residents are contemptuous of the slow-moving process. 'All of us in the camps - the poor people - are against the talks now,' says 17-year-old Iyad Odeh, whose father Ibrahim was killed in front of his seven children by a stray Israeli bullet in 1988. 'They will give us nothing.' A hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners which ended recently sparked a wave of violent unrest across the occupied territories of an intensity not seen since the early years of the five-year intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule. Karima Abeid, whose jailed husband Khalid was on the hunger strike, is another Dahaishe resident who has little time for the peace talks. 'I don't believe the Israelis will give us peace. I think they are fooling us. Here in every house we have people whose lives were destroyed by the Israelis, so what do you expect?' Opinions like these haunt members of the Palestinian delegation to the negotiations. A year after being feted in the streets after their return from Madrid, they are acutely aware that now there is widespread frustration in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because so little tangible progress has been made since. Opposition in the territories to the talks has been led by two main movements. The most radical is the Islamic fundamentalists, the leading organisation of which is Hamas, the main Palestinian power base outside the secular Palestine Liberation Organisation. The second chiefly comprises two radical, left-wing PLO factions, the PFLP and the DFLP. Although there are great ideological tensions between the two, they are united by their rejection of the terms of the peace talks, which envisage an interim stage of limited Palestinian self-rule, or autonomy, before further negotiations start on the final status of the territories. Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction led by Mr Yassir Arafat, has accepted the 'two stage solution,' believing it offers the only realistic, available prospect of an eventual independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr Riad Malki, a leading advocate of the leftist opposition, believes the failure so far to reach an initial 'autonomy' agreement, despite the advent earlier this year of a more dovish Israeli government, has enhanced the standing of the opposition camp. 'We are optimistic that we will represent the majority of the people and exert pressure to prevent the delegation from signing an autonomy agreement.' The thrust of the opposition is that the five-year interim self-government phase is an Israeli ruse which will become the permanent status quo, thwarting the Palestinian struggle for full independence. The weakness of this case lies in the absence of a coherent alternative. Even Mr Malki admits the Palestinians are in their 'lowest position ever' in terms of bargaining power to demand immediate transition to statehood. They have no realistic military option against Israel. All key Arab states, including previously hostile Syria, are involved in or support the talks. There is no longer a counterweight to the US, which brokered the process, to support a tougher Palestinian line. 'The patience of our people is decreasing, that is very clear,' says Mr Radwan Abu Ayyash, a prominent Fatah supporter. 'The (terms of the) peace talks are not our preferred choice. But we have no other way.' He believes Palestinians will accept an agreement based on an initial period of limited self-rule - if the PLO leadership endorses it clearly as a step in the direction of statehood and if it comes soon, before support is eroded any further. Even in Dahaishe camp, this is grudgingly acknowledged by some residents, including Karima Abeid. 'If it is going to be a period which leads to a Palestinian state, then I will support it. I'm with the PLO. But at the end we must have a state and a full Israeli withdrawal.'</p>

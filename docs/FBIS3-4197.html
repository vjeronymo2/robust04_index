			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday morning [12 March], State Council Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua attended a panel discussion held by the  Sichuan delegation to the current Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC].    During the panel session, Zou Jiahua joined the Sichuan NPC  deputies in discussing state affairs. He said: We should work  for common prosperity, attach great importance to the  development of western China, step up the development of  Sichuan's communications and telecommunications, and  successfully and rapidly develop the Sichuan economy.    The Sichuan NPC deputies spoke without inhibition, and  deliberated on Premier Li Peng's work report in a conscientious  manner. While Chen Guanjun, Wang Rongsheng, and other Sichuan  NPC deputies were speaking, Zou Jiahua conscientiously listened  to their views and jotted down some notes. Zou Jiahua also  exchanged views at the panel discussion with Xie Shijie  [secretary of the provincial party committee], Xiao Yang  [governor], and Yang Xizong [chairman of the provincial people's  congress standing committee].    Zou Jiahua noted at the panel discussion: We should pay  attention to protecting, guiding, and mobilizing the enthusiasm  of the masses, and should develop the economy in accordance with  the law of economic operation, as well as in light of the actual  local conditions. The construction of the Three Gorges Project  is of paramount importance. We should conscientiously study and  tackle problems relating to soil, sand, and silt in the project  area, as well as the water pollution problem, and strive to make  a success of water and soil conservation along the upper reaches  of the Changjiang so as to benefit future generations.    At the conclusion, Zou Jiahua stressed: In the course of  economic development, Sichuan should give top priority to the  development of communications and telecommunications, these  being key to Sichuan's overall economic growth. Moreover,  Sichuan should make full use of the "gold water course" of the  Changjiang. To this end, the provincial and central departments  concerned should work out overall arrangements for developing  Sichuan's communications and should build the relevant  facilities more rapidly.</p>
